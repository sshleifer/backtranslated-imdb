Samuel Fuller knows the war and is one of the few filmmakers in American film history who can accurately portray the horrific experiences in film-like form. His pessimism and idealism, if it seems a little strange to mix, work for him as a storyteller, and at the same time he is always in search of the truth, however brutal (or put in melodramatic constructions). Verboten, however, discusses the postwar experience, as we hear in the opening scenes only the big boom of WAR - bold for one point. The opening plan looks like a big exclamation point that seems to continue in the other scenes: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera is panning, we see another soldier shot on war-torn ground. Simple and direct language. Then, Fuller punctuates the intensity with something interesting: the title song is interpreted both by the credits as irony and sincerity, then by the music of Beethoven during a shooting between Americans and Nazis. Sgt David Brent (James Best) is shot to death, the battle continues, and is treated to treat his wounds. <br /> <br /> This may suggest that it will be a fairly conventional film about the Second World War. (a bit in what is not usually Beethoven and, later, Wagner put in these images), but this is not the case. Instead, Fuller makes this movie a "back home" genre, but not at all in the sense that "this soldier comes home hurt and so on". Instead of really going home, Brent stays in Germany, fallen head over heels for the Helga woman (Susan Cummings, very gifted for the German accent) and wants to work in a smaller capacity in the army. can marry him. What he does not realize is that a) she wants it more for food for herself and her brother, but it becomes emotionally complex at the time of the Brent revelation, slightly naive but sincere, and b) there is a basement. The Hitler Youth Sect called the "Werewolves" wants to bring back where Hitler ended early, despite intense discussions within the group, attacking the same government currently anchored in Germany to give them, as described by Brent , a "blood transfusion." With that, more images of the Nuremberg trials, and (as told, I think, of Fuller himself) a quick, punch-free story, pieces of Nazi war crimes, piece by piece, we have a multiple look at a society in desperation of an immediate post-war environment. While Rossellini has behaved in his own way with Germany Year Zero, Fuller does it on several levels: first there is the love story, or the tragic tragedy of a man who does not see beyond what, in his opinion, should be reasonable, his wife and a child on the way he can not leave, until the revelation that he was (partly) cheated. Baker and Cummings, as well as Harold Daye as Helga's confused younger brother, play with the greatest detail in emotions; these are not very easy parts of B-movie, although they could have been that. Another layer is the political one, the struggle of a society to attack the conquest and a sensationalized mentality, of course, by Fuller, who wants the Nazis to become a zone without a gray area. They are devilish, especially when they cancel the reasons for achieving their ends. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the style layer, which absorbs strangely. It's probably one of Fuller's most talkative movies, which is not a bad thing considering that it's one of his best scripts because the characters do not speak not just or in too many platitudes (with the exception of a small scene where two characters speak of Hitler's youth as juvenile delinquents, which, according to Fuller's autobiography, is probably another layer to take in count in the subtext and period of movies of the 50s). And Fuller draws almost that in a true European style, when he does not engage in combat scenes, because the editing is not always very fast and a break sometimes does not occur for a minute or more. This creates a strange tension, especially when a character says something that makes another person with crazy or suspicious eyes; Fuller could easily make a close-up, but it is more sinister and cold not to get away from two people in a conversation without going over the shoulder. But when it's necessary, like the big fight in front of the US military office or the images of Nuremberg purified in Franz's memories of Werewolves, Fuller can be as stylist as ever. (It's very difficult to find it) but it's really worth it if you're a fan of the director's or World War II films taking place in Germany, or even just a history buff, Verboten! is an intellectual experience and a strong emotion, with a better than expected cast of a B-movie, and an attitude towards the other as shocking as provoking.
