When I first played Soul Calibur on dreamcast, I thought it was great. When I played the second, I was hooked. And finally, when Soul Calibur III was released, I bought a Playstation 2 console and play. <br /> <br /> This can really keep you awake for hours, with a huge amount of characters, loads Unlockable content, and Mention an excellent combat system, this is really the biggest fighting game to date. <br /> <br /> The strengths of games are above all the game versus the game, when two human players compete, as a main character or character created and personalized. The Create Character option is vast and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character who uses the "Grieve Edge" fighting style (only kicks) must wear those ridiculous shoes. ^^ <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the greatest fighting game we can wish for. Now, I just hope that the planned film will not be bad.
