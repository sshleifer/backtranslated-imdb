This film is still alive today thanks to the presence of Alan Ladd. It's good in a way because the movie has some interesting things to say, but it's bad for another because everyone watching is expecting the hard-to-cook Ladd to bend at its usual pace. will be extremely disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, Ladd is suddenly introduced into the third roll. While his role is essential, he is small and may go astray. The ambivalent scenario of former journalist Martin Mooney has many key roles. He strikes all the political alliances and mercilessly denounces the reformist candidates. Joan Woodbury, charming and extremely talented, links the different aspects of this diverse story. Unlike the usual Hollywood production, the plot takes place in a series of jumps, much like the films of the French film "New Wave", although they are easier to follow here, especially if you know that the original title of the movie was Paper Bullets. Nevertheless, some of the narrative changes and characters in the film are a little disconcerting, especially in the role played by Jack LaRue who wisely chose to play the role in a strangely uninviting way. One of Jack's best acting roles, but no one will notice it, alas!
