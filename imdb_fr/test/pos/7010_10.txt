I watched this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and every time I watch it, I'm drawn into the movie and I go back to 1963! The film takes me nostalgic holidays every time I look at it. <br /> <br /> I think the important thing is to say that I was 15 years old in 1963 and that I remember well "before President Kennedy was shot and before the Beetles came." I can feel like saying something like, "I wore a watermelon." and realizing how stupid it was! Jennifer Gray plays Frances "Baby" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. Baby will start university in the fall. She goes to Kellerman for a vacation with her family (mom, dad and sister Lisa). <br /> <br /> One of the dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) gets pregnant by another staff member (one of the boys teachers played by Max Cantor) and has a chance to have an abortion but this is a night where she and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) have to dance in a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> Thus, the need for a substitute dancer for Penny. Johnny is persuaded by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) that he can teach Baby to dance in time for the show. Baby learns the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes! <br /> <br /> Baby's father (Dr. Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when the abortion is poorly done. Dirty Dancing reminded me of this time in history when girls got pregnant and had behind-the-scenes abortions by butchers. At that time (1963), many girls died of this type of abortion - but there was not much choice for a girl at that time. <br /> <br /> Lonnie Price plays a great grandson (Neil Kellerman) at Max Jack Weston Kellerman. Jane Brucker does a great job as the annoying sister of Baby Lisa Houseman. <br /> <br /> The music is great and the dance is wonderful! The "dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel the amazement of baby when she sees them for the first time dancing and tell them, "Where did they learn to do that?" <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray and Patrick Les Swayze are just perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song, "She's like the wind," gives me tears every time I hear / look in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends on a positive note, but lets you want to know what will happen next. in the lives of Baby and Johnny. Dirty Dancing gives something new every time. He hypnotizes the observer with nostalgia, the feeling of wanting to be again in 1963.
