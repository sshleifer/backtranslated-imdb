I was not surprised that it was a very depressing and exhausting film. After all, it's all about the impact of war on civilians AND it's about the "king of depression," Ingmar Bergman. In other words, many of Bergman's works plunge deep into human misery and anguish. This film does not seem extraordinary from this director. <br /> <br /> Even though it is harder to watch, the film may offer more insight into the depths of humanity. Indeed, initially, the main characters (Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow) try to overcome adversity and are basically decent people (although a bit stupid). However, as privations occur, they (especially Von Sydow) become less and less human and more animal-doing nothing to survive. <br /> <br /> Fun to watch, NO FREAKING WAY! But, an interesting insight into human nature. <br /> <br /> PS - One thing I liked about this movie is that it avoided a stupid movie chick. When the couple sat down with the shopkeeper for a drink or a wine, they finished the wine completely! In most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched. It drives me crazy, because I would NEVER leave a $ 4 alcoholic drink without drinking it, unless it tastes terrible or an insect floats on it! BRAVO!
