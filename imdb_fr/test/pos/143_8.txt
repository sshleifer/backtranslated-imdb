I am the first to admit that the thirst for Chan-wook Park is exceptionally well done, but spending more than two hours with Tae-joo (OK-vin Kim) is enough for anyone to tolerate such a long time. Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) is a priest willing to volunteer for experimental studies on people willing to undergo rigorous injections for a specific virus that kills by infectious means. Instead of dying legitimately, Hyeon becomes a vampire, still aspiring to the livelihood that the blood gives him to fight an infectious disease that reappears, causing the appearance of the symptoms that cover it (bumps, and the body vomits blood). ). Sunlight, as we know in the vampire genre, causes death by torture if it is exposed to Hyeon for a while. Hyeon falls in love with Tae-joo, the wife of sick childhood friend Kang-woo (Ha-Kyun Shin). Tae-joo was taken in charge by Mrs. Ra (Hae-sook Kim), considered a puppy and practically used as a pet to order. Ta-joo is miserable in this situation and starts a torrid affair with Hyeon, inciting him to kill Kang-woo by making him believe that she is being abused. Renouncing his priesthood, Hyeon plunges head-on into the relationship with Tae-joo, who will soon voluntarily participate in Kang-woo's death. This incident, to which Tae-woo contributed ((... using a boat, in the middle of a lake, was buried under water, Tae-woo prevented him from coming back to the surface while he was trying to return home) will haunt both when circumstances occur when Kang-woo "goes missing" (Hyeon gets rid of him, police can not find his body) Soon, Ms. Ra suffers from a stroke (However, a finger and the ability to blink contribute powerfully as the story progresses, showing that it is more aware than they are led to believe), and Hyeon offers at Tae-joo a special birthday gift ..vampirism By doing so, Hyeon created a monster, Tae-joo admits (although it's a slip of the tongue) that Kang-woo never hurts him, and like she is thirsty for blood, it is quickly realized that killing to eat does not embarrass her morally or psychologically Tae-j oo becomes such a hand, Hyeon must take desperate measures if he wants to put an end to such a threat to society, including himself. <br /> <br /> I'll say that Soif is one of the best horror movies I've seen in 2009. It's a methodical approach that Park adopts and we engage in a dark way with Hyeon and Tae-joo, while they commit terrible acts without anything positive coming from their unholy union. Innocent people die because of Hyeon's love (which was once lechery turns into an obsessive love at the end) for Tae-joo, and it will stop if he ends up not making a painful choice . We see in their heads, their souls, and it's not always pretty. Two hours with them can be quite exhausting ... but the credit goes to the director to leave nothing to chance with regard to sneaky behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people. Hyeon, perceived as a rather pleasant soul at the opening, accepts "hell" for Tae-joo, so that one can see Thirst as a unique but not wholesome love story. <br /> <br /> Regarding violence, although Park tends to move away from extremely graphic details, there is enough sadism to perhaps turn the stomach a little. At the very least, the way in which violence is perpetrated can have a lasting impact. The sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be very hot and erotic, while being sordid and morally reprehensible. I think the film is still a rather complex examination of the efforts we will make to stay attached to an object of affection (lust).
