Humor totally disgusting and cheap. I liked it!!! It's the most disgusting movie and the most horribly played except for Nicolas Read, who plays a Court Jester non-dead, with a brilliant comedy. But, anyway, I laughed so many times and I have to give it to the filmmakers, it was by no means pretentious or ordinary. Violant, fighter, zombies vomiting on their rape victims. What other movie has this? Not for the question, but with a pizza, a bang and six packs of beer, you have everything you need, if you have a cast iron belly and a juvenile sense of humor like me.
