Let's face it. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly clich√©, like the dramas and Korean romantic movies. First, there is a long-lost pair of siblings, one of whom falls in love with the other. Secondly, there is a not-so-popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys fighting for her. Third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic illness that ultimately ends up in life. <br /> <br /> Yet, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without the good actors, this film would probably have disappointed the fans of the novel. But as the actors fit the roles perfectly, the movie is captivating - honestly, I could not stop watching. Kang Dong Won, despite his pretty face, gives an impressive and heartbreaking performance, not forgetting Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun, as well as all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. .
