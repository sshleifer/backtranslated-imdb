The Beat was an exciting film about two young punks trying to survive in the 1980s in New York. This involves fighting with the other street gang with whom they share a high school class, trying to stay in school, as well as attending local shows involving groups resembling the Dead Kennedy's and carrying the Skulls name. Rex (played by David Jacobson) Play with an autistic child who begins to have a long life with all these genres and begins to show them that poetry is really beautiful and that applied to what these children do in life can really advance things for the best! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Kara Glover) are brother and sister. Although they ride with this crowd of thugs, these kids are not the same type of people as this group. They care about Rex and others, and really show an enlightened side of themselves. While her sister sleeps with the Gang's head, she also falls in love with Rex, trying to show her that she is not a slut. But in the end, the teachers of the school eventually join him and want to place him in a psychiatric institution. He finally feels convinced that it's time to end his days, while Animals of Sound was playing without him. But they like to think that he is not dead, he lives his life fully, riding sharks and happy to live in the ocean. This film was one of those films where I was happy to watch it. Although it was extremely entertaining, it also contained a great message. Something in the lines that these kids did not have direction, no future, no figure to look at, but because a troubled child happened, they all realized that there was a lot more going on in life than to fight local black children, or be destructive of everything. Rex showed them the beauty of angry music. Rex showed them the beauty of Rats, Disease and Murder. Rex showed them beauty in almost everything, while some of these things have no beauty, they were still able to see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people. Rex played an important role in this process as he turned everyone into depression to see that there was hope for them and that's why he started to show them. Rhythm.
