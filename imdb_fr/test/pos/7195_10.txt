This is the first time I remember where an adaptation looked exactly like the book ... In fact, only jokes were added to the story rather than mixed or deleted content! <br /> <br /> Such as the Egyptian slave Cellularis who had trouble transmitting, uh, to communicate, LOL! Or, when Tidivinnus was played as a quasi-Sith lord and was upset when the Roman Empire suffered a blow, the general ordered the empire of ...? Ah, look at moviegoers! <br /> <br /> I can easily believe that this image is one of the most expensive in the history of French cinema and that, for my part, it was worth it, Depardieux was excellent as the Roman denigration and the chirping boar Obelix. Keyboard playing of Little Indomitable Gaul was perfect and far from his time, the knight overthrown of Jean Reno in "Just Visiting". <br /> <br /> The fight scene between Artifis and Edifis was hilarious and enjoyable. See Matrix theme was not borrowed to defeat an otherwise perfect battle! <br /> <br /> Red beard, the pirate and his crew nearly stole the show, passing from their own boat to that of Otis (Edifis assistant) invention used at the very end. <br /> <br /> I understand that there is Asterix and the Olympic Games gathering several members of the same team, Toutatis, I intend to see that too!
