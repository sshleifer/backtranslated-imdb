It's a wonderful movie about people. Strange people. The characters in the film all have a very tragic past, so they have all their problems. Their problems evolve in such a way as to make the plot of the film very absurd; but that does not only aggravate the film, but better, because it is shot like a fantasy, so nothing is real. This review may seem a bit weird, but again, the movie is not quite normal ... It's also a hilarious movie on several occasions. If you have not seen it, see it. Enjoy!
