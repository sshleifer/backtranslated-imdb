Sharky's Machine is a crime drama set in the early 80s in Atlanta. He plays Burt Reynolds as a renegade policeman who is determined to stop crime and corruption in his city. The story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a criminal network that has put the city on his knees. Sharky's link to bring down this union is a very expensive whore for which he falls in love throughout the film. The action sequences are well done for the early 80's and the soundtrack / score are pretty good. The acting is level B, but it's a decent movie to have in your DVD collection. <br /> <br /> General 7/10 <br /> <br /> Peace <br /> <br /> Buggieblade
