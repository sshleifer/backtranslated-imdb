I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theater and I immediately went to see IMDb to consult it. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who thought it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10 and disappointing. I would feel morally carefree if I did not disagree. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a big fan of Masterpiece Theater, but often the stories can be a little silly on TV, for example, "He knew it was just" was absolutely horrible. "Carrie's War", however, is probably the best I've seen so far. The entire cast did a great job, and it caught my attention more than any other piece I've seen recently. Mr. Evans's character is of particular interest and, through subtle images, like an intact birthday cake or a garnet ring, my opinion of him has gone from bad to really good. Really. His ultimate disappearance, and the story of how everyone around him left him cold and hard, is what brought out that sweet-bitter sweetness for me. <br /> <br /> The end is rewarding in every sense of the word, except one; that everyone did not get what they deserved, but overall, things went well. I absolutely recommend it to everyone.
