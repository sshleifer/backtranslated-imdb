This short Oscar-winning short (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to the small town of Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 years old and the other about 8 years, look for huge collection item eggs for boys in the south at this time). Well, the Japanese Pearl Harbor bomb and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his egg to his little brother Willie and leaves in the hope of showing more emotion and tenderness to his little sidekick. Willie has none, if Pete can be a soldier, then he can. He travels to Memphis, showing his stubbornness and determination as he takes the best of several adults on the way. After finding the recruiting center in Memphis, he asks to see his brother, pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him at the same time. We are shown the devotion and love of a little brother (Jonathan Furr). He delivers an impeccable performance as a stubborn boy, with a strong will, in the sweetest times of yesteryear. The film tries and shows above all how the brothers can show their dedication and the importance of family ties in their youth. While the two brothers meet again soon, the film launches a cathartic cry while brotherly love envelops us all. <br /> <br /> This film is like a bottle of cold water. Perhaps Dasani or Aquafina, a good clear water with a tasty mineral package, but not a pure natural spring water like Evian. However, it quenches and you do not doubt its purity and its thirst-quenching effects. It is more common and less expensive than some, but the job is done, leaving a person refreshed and detoxified thereafter. 7/10
