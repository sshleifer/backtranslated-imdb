Michael Kehoe has achieved a feat, especially since this is only his second debut as a writer, producer AND director. Generally, beginners lack vision and direction as part of a major production, but "Dominion" proves that Mr. Kehoe is going to Hollywood! In a beautiful setting, Dominion relies on experienced players (particularly Thomerson and James) to communicate Kehoe's broad vision with exceptional clarity. Few movies can associate the slasher / horror genre with a true action / adventure feel, but Dominion has done it perfectly. This film is certainly one of the best movies in both categories. If you are looking for quick action with more than a minimum of suspense, look no further. I look forward to Kehoe's future projects with great enthusiasm. Good game!!!
