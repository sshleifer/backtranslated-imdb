Okay, I do not have any illusions that this is the typical gay love life, but since when are the heterosexual novels in real life as on screen? This film is well balanced with comedy and drama and I had a lot of fun. It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate seller who uses his clients' homes for his conversations with Flemish Darren (Tom Hollander). And having seen him in Priscilla, queen of the desert only the day before, he is probably one of the safest actors in their masculinity. :) Anyway, the plot went smoothly and the scenes of male relationships were fun. Thumbs up! 8/10
