I read a lot of reviews on SHOWTIME on IMDb and many seem to be missing out on the target. I noticed that many critics described this movie as a typical "boyfriend". De Niro is by no means Murphy's boyfriend during most of this film. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anyone. <br /> <br /> Murphy really shines in this one. He is back in what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He's a cop who wants to be an actor and likes to be in the reality show. De Niro is perfect as a straight person who thinks everything is stupid. I thought both had excellent chemistry and were a perfect casting choice. Ren√© Russo is also excellent as a television producer. Of course, she likes everything Murphy does and does everything in his power (with Murhpy) to make sure DeNiro also starts. <br /> <br /> Many critics have spoken of the hilarious scene of William Shatner, who takes over his role as TJ. Hooker teaches Murhpy and De Niro to "act" like cops. But my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confessional" in the hope of teaming up with a Wesley Snipes-type policeman instead of De Niro. Dude, it was hilarious! The comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Of course, you can make holes in the plot, most often with a comedy. I was excited to see the couple Murphy / De Niro ... I think it brought out the best of Murphy, which was good to see him at the peak of his form. I imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to join the great De Niro. Rating 8 out of 10 stars.
