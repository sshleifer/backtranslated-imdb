Under the sure guidance of F. Gary Gray, "Italian Job" never loses his grip on his cool and fun attitude. Although the material is revitalized and medium, the film itself is masterfully executed and is satisfying. The tone might have been a lot heavier, considering the murder-revenge plot, but F. Gary Gray keeps the tone light with his good mood, catchy dialogue and thrilling music. It is a pleasure to see that these so-called bad guys forge close bonds and stick to each other by deception and murder, never forgetting to have fun. This one is 7/10.
