This is one of the nine shorts on the anime disc, "The Animatrix". It is my favorite. The work is incredible. The slightly grainy black and white texture perfectly captures the mood that the segment is trying to describe. The story is tight and the end is faithful to the film noir. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave "Animatrix" a "7", but this segment in particular deserves a "10".
