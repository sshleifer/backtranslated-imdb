I would like director Barbet Schroeder to explain why he decided to shoot More, his first film, and more specifically his interest in hippies - or rather this Euro-hippie paradise - and their disappearance. The film is at least pretty true to interest someone, but in its kind of truth, it is strange, biased. This is a given heroine (aka "Horse") is a frightful, rotten thing, the conclusion for a lot of stupid drug users who see this as a panacea, because it's basically: after everything else s' stop, it becomes life, and it's either a continuous race for more of the same, or death. More begins as a love story between a girl from New York and a German, but it becomes something else, for better or for worse (sometimes both in the same scene). <br /> <br /> These are essentially two "young people", Estelle and Stefan, who meet in a town where Stefan came as a sort of wanderer from his home country. she is also walking around and maybe too friendly with a big pusher named Wolf, they find themselves on an isolated island somewhere nearby and, after a somewhat "daring" whim of Estelle, they also find a carpet in the form of a house apparently further away along the coastline Schroeder's commentary on youth and sex and drugs is not too simplistic, which makes the film truly lucid and intelligent several years later. It's both direct and subtle, more about the characters, and then the fact that what he's portrayed may well be a propagandist hippie exploitation picture, perhaps more agreeably, and it's just hypothesis, Schroeder draws inspiration from the kind of long sequence Bergman's Summer with Monika: two children inextricably linked, some good, some less good than all, against perfectly framed landscapes. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I must mention that there are problems, some big ones actually. The performances are not very convincing from the beginning to the end. some scenes have power or have the actors in good relationship with each other, but Klaus Grumberg is superimposed even if he is a fierce German by nature (in this case I would have preferred Klaus Kinski to make him more crazy, but deep enough for the subject), like Farmer to his degree. And there are lacks of naivety in the scenario that prevent him from being as deep as he really thinks. On the other hand, there are two main objectives: Nestor Almendros, the great director of photography (Days of Heaven), is DP and is a major asset for a new director like Schroeder. Almost every image is seen with a purpose or an impressive artistic talent, be it a view of cliffs at the edge of the sea or the sun or something as simple as the seemingly natural light of a room. <br /> <br /> The other thing is Pink Floyd, probably the main reason why me and many others have heard about the movie (years before I really knew who Schroeder was, I saw the band -Its "More" every time I search for Pink Floyd albums). It's very good music, sometimes a breathtaking variety that gives them the reputation they deserve. Some movies are also a little tedious, even if it's a movie about free love and lots of drugs and sometimes both. I would not rank it as high as Meddle or Animals, certainly not Dark Side, but it also helps raise the subject to another notch, especially when you least expect it or at low altitude or floating in and out of buildings like Stefan or other walks in the streets. It's almost a better atmosphere than the film itself deserves, but overall, More still deserves to be regarded as a dated but powerful period, like a less ambitious but more substantial Zabriskie Point.
