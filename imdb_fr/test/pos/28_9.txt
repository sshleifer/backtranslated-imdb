A fantastic cinema experience. I really liked seeing this really beautiful movie at the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, except that it is a terrible shame that Mr. Albert Finney is still not accepted by AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in such films as Tom Jones, The Murder of the Orient Express, Under the Volcano (to name a few, he was nominated for the Oscar), The Dresser is no doubt his point culminating, but ... <br /> <I know that the Oscars are only a popularity contest, but if Americans like British actors and actresses ("and the Oscar goes back to" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day- Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson, etc. - and all deserved the prize!), Why did they always leave Mr. Finney empty-handed? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, they handed it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (at Cousin Vinny). I do not know, should I laugh or cry. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the two main roles in The Dresser, you will not forget what the art of playing is. Watch this movie and enjoy! I recommend it to anyone who loves art. <br /> <br /> I give 9/10 for this excellent film (it misses 1 point for non-cinematographic material, it's still a theater ")" <br /> <br /> Note: My criterion is much stronger than on IMDb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should / could last indefinitely).
