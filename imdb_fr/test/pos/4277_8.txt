My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful ... For once, it was wrong to guess in advance the suspensive end. It was very fast and the acting was superb. I still love Tom Wilkinson. He never made a bad film about me. The above description of his acting plays hits the nail on the head ... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque landscape is awesome. We have just watched all the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have the means to capture their audience. There is no doubt that I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a few hours of in-depth entertainment.
