"Are you home alone?" belongs to the era of pre-cable broadcasting where networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular TV shows. It's a well done thriller with a talented cast and credible situations. Kathleen Beller plays a high school student who receives a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think it's nothing more than a joke, but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is a high school principal and Dennis Quaid plays one of his leading roles as an arrogant and wealthy kid. It is a competent cooler with a social message always relevant. Beller is charming - if you are 30 years old or older, you will remember that she was very popular among young people. Blythe Danner, whom I do not like very much, gives a really touching performance. Nice little movie.
