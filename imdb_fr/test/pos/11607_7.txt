Chokher Bali ?? A game of passion. <br /> <br /> According to Rabindranath Tagore's eponymous novel, this is a classic account of deception, adultery and relationship exploitation. Director Rituparno Ghosh, set in 1900 in Bengal, turns the acclaimed literature of the Nobel laureates into a visual delight. <br /> <br /> Tagore's story painstakingly treats Bengali society through its central character, the rebellious widow, who wants to live her own life. We are taken to the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet our heroine, the beautiful young widow Binodini (Aishwarya Rai). <br /> <br /> Despite his magnificent appearance, two handsome men, the rich Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterji) and his friend Behari (Toto Roychowdhury), denied having married her. <br /> <br /> Mahindra chose a naive Ashalata (Raima Sen) over Binodini and married her. Leaving behind life in the countryside, Binodini, a free spirit, accompanies Mahindra's mother to Calcutta as a guardian. Soon, his friendship with Ashalata flourished. It seems that the two men, speaking as "Chokher Bali" (sand in the eyes), share a lasting bond. The Anglophone Binodini occupies a special place in the house. But, soon, she unmasks her true face. By manipulating the nice Ashlata, Binodini gets closer to Mahindra and realizes his sexual desires. <br /> <br /> When she is rejected by Mahindra's enraged mother, Binodini seeks the comfort of a reluctant Behari. The remaining part of the story shows how the life of these four characters intersects and culminates in an unimaginable climax ?? Aishwarya passes through the role - a manipulative and rebellious lady, always gaining sympathy from the viewer - with the elegance of a dancer. The other main artists, Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhury, are also brilliant in staging their characters. <br /> <br /> While Tagore was writing this "revolutionary" story at the turn of the 20th century, the very idea of ​​widow marriage was taboo, even among the upper class! Relating the liberation movement of nations in parallel, the author affirms the importance of the individual freedom of life in a cage. Congratulations to the artistic director who gave life to Bengal in the early 20th century and to the applause of the filmmaker for capturing these sets with verve. <br /> <br /> Tagore's "passion piece" was fervently converted on the screen by the greatest director without losing its originality.
