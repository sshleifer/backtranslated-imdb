It's one of the most remarkable horror movies I've ever seen in my life. Forget the exorcist and all the other exhilarating horror movies. John Carpenter has made a tour de force horror epic with great special effects, excellent performances by Kurt Russell and others and a great soundtrack that will haunt you forever! The biggest asset of this movie after 17 years is that it has not been dated, it looks new and new and you do not get a lot of movies like this. was against ET and of course, he failed and was a box office bomb. Over the years, THE THING has become a cult for video and video sales and as many new fans. In the end, this film kicks me and for me, it never loses its advantage to scare you and me as a horror movie. Long live John Carpenter !!
