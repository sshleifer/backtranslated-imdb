From time to time, we encounter a film that forces us to rethink the reaction of society to people who differ from its definition of normal. <br /> <br /> Mitthi having suffered at the hands of insocial elements, finding herself alone in coping with the situation. with her tragedy, withdraws into her idyllic world ... which, according to her, is the real world ..... <br /> <br /> The surreal (the world of Mitthi) is superimposed on reality (her family ). <br /> <br /> Mitthi, suffering from schizophrenia, forces us to reconsider our priorities regarding the re-education of "patients" like them. Are we right in bringing them back to our reality when all we have to offer them in our society is pain and suffering? By what right do they deprive them of their source of happiness? By what right do we deprive them of their joy when we are unable to help them in their sorrows? 15 Park Avenue is one of the best movies on social issues ... showing us the need for any patient to need empathy and not just sympathy.
