The Duchess and her three kittens enjoy the busy life with their devoted human mistress until the mean butler Edgar, who has his eyes fixed on a great inheritance, decides to dope them and to remove them from the painting . How can these fragile creatures face the unknown countryside and the most sinuous streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with a romance in his heart. Once they have tasted the vast dangerous world, he guides them home and Edgar gets his right desserts from the wrong side of a horse. As always, it's really the voices rather than the animation that are at the heart of Disney's magic: Phil Harris is brilliant like O'Malley, Eva Gabor like Duchess is ... well ... Eva Gabor; but the most memorable passages are perhaps those of Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who turn the old hunting dogs Napoleon and Lafayette into a pair of wriggling rednecks fried in the south. Their scenes with Edgar and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his cool-guy are classic. The most striking thing about The Aristocats is how much Disney's animation style has changed since the 1970s. Maybe the nostalgic and dated atmosphere is just the result of its presence at the Belle Epoque Paris, but the illustrations are more work (damage) and animation and the general pace much less frenetic (sometimes a relief) than in more recent efforts such as Aladdin.
