A rather charming representation of the European Union that begins to operate among the younger generation while the representatives of this group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, ​​where they all study in international scholarships. Xavier (Romain Duris) is at the center of the story. He may have had a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but he quickly became a leader in the group, helping them cope with the problems of homeowners and others. He quickly learns life and love. Duris has a healthy appearance and gives a good performance. The rest of the cast is playing as well. Sometimes they all fall into English when they want to make sure they communicate, unsure of their roommates' ability to understand French or Danish or any language. A remarkable cinematography with beautiful views of Barcelona and its famous Gaudi towers.
