I am impressed that 'Hail the Woman' was created; Published just one year after the US women's vote, this turgid drama argues against the double sex standard that judges women's sexual behavior more severely than men's. <br /> <br /> LIGHT SPOILERS. A prologue, which takes place in the Plymouth colony in 1621, shows a pilgrim girl sentenced to a duck stool for flirting with a boy. the boy is not penalized. We now come to Flint Hill, New Hampshire, to the present (1921). Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a staggering bomber of bible: what we call in Britain and Australia "a God-in-law". Beresford is determined to have his son David (Lloyd Hughes) become a preacher, regardless of David's feelings about it. As for Beresford's daughter, Judith ... Beresford is convinced that women are not important enough to be more than just wives and mothers. Apparently, God told him that personally. <br /> <br /> David's evangelical career is compromised when he permeates Nan Higgins, the local man's daughter-in-law. (The character of Tully Marshall is identified in the credits only as "the man with odd jobs", but a close-up of a check reveals that his name is Jake Higgins.The prejudices of 1921 require that it be simply Nan's father-in-law, not his biological parent.) To save his son from the scandal, Beresford buys Nan's father-in-law with a check. Nan goes to the big city to be forgotten as one more single mother. <br /> <br /> Judith is naturally appalled by the limitations imposed on her by her sex. (Or rather, according to the perceptions of others.) She meets Wyndham Gray (excellent performance of Edward Martindel), an author who encourages him to transcend sexist stereotypes. But Judith is unofficially engaged to Joe Hurd, the neighborhood fool, who will not bear such nonsense. Hurd is starring Vernon Dent, a sturdy artist now remembered only for comedy roles (as Harry Langdon's second banana and as villain in Three Stooges movies). He gives here an excellent performance, outside his usual domain. Unfortunately, in real life, Dent spent his last years in poverty and total blindness because of diabetic retinopathy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Judith ends up working in an orphanage. In 1921, I was expecting the orphanage to be reserved for whites. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was a Chinese boy. (And uncomfortably surprised when used as the culmination of a racial joke.) The movie makes a strange mistake here. In a Christmas sequence, we see the mistress of the orphanage recite "A visit of St. Nicholas" ... but (in a dialogue title), she attributes to Santa Claus more than eight reindeer. Following is a brief animated sequence showing Santa Claus with six reindeers tied to his sleigh. I suppose that the animators (either by accident or to save money) omitted two reindeers and the title card modified the poem to fit the error. <br /> <br /> Lloyd Hughes was usually a bland and unimpressive actor. His most famous performance is his role in "The Lost World", where he is easily thwarted by a raging Brontosaurus. For his culminating scene in 'Hail the Woman', Hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father's tyranny. Theodore Roberts was accused of acting too much to make his role a caricature. Unfortunately, decades after the making of this film, I continue to meet "saints" imbeciles, similar to this man ... eager to destroy the lives of those around him and firmly believe that they have the authority to God to do it. <BR /> <br /> In the central role of Judith Beresford, Florence Vidor gives a sensible, realistic and intelligent performance. I do not normally like Vidor, who tended to play prestigious roles but was not pretty enough to justify them. Here, the physical appearance of his character is less relevant than usual. <br /> <br /> The entire film is impressively directed by John Griffith Wray, a director who deserves to be better known. Unfortunately, Wray died at the beginning of the talkie era, in his mid-thirties: if he had lived another ten years, he would probably have crossed several early sound classics. 'Hail the Woman' contains several extremely beautiful screen compositions: I was particularly impressed by a scene in the New England Forest, when Vidor and Dent quarreled in front of a huge uprooted tree. (I wonder where the film was shot.) 'Hail the Woman' deals with unpleasant subjects, but it deserves to be much better known, and I'll give a rating of 9 out of 10 to this ambitious drama.
