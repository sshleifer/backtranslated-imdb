I saw this movie in Santa Monica on August 23rd and stayed with me. I want to thank the filmmakers for deepening the details of Harry's enigmatic and eccentric life. And also for showing the flaws and weaknesses of Nilsson the man. Thanks for showing the good and the bad, the ups and downs, and for discovering this amazing BBC sequence. The film is also an excellent showcase for a large amount of music by Nilsson, very well placed throughout the film. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves good documentaries, especially if you're interested in Harry Nilsson or the early 70's music scene. Some commentators of the website, Not Not It Cool, wrote that it was of the best film they saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I think so. The film is informative, funny, sad, touching and full of great music. It succeeds at all levels. Really, really good.
