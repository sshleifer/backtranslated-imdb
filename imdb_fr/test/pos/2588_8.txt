We have just seen this film in preview before its release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two points: there was excellent performance in a first-rate drama, from the two main actors and others: and the film will bring only disaster. We saw a sullen poster with strings and suggestive comments implying a kind of wacko sex relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, while the film has real depth and thoughtful ideas. What is sad is that people looking for near-porn will be attracted by the film and will be disappointed, because this film will be too "heavy" for them, while the people who would really appreciate it would not be caught off guard. show it. Pity. A good film wasted.
