This Western was created in 1861 and is linked to the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines designed by Western Union. Although the nice Dean Jagger (carrying a lot of hair) does his best to get there, there was a villain who was only waiting to cancel it for his own reasons. It is therefore up to Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the situation. <br /> <br /> It's certainly one of the best 1940s westerns I've ever seen and it almost reaped an 8 - that was good too. However, for the life of me, I do not know why Fritz Lang was commissioned to direct this film - after all, he knew nothing about westerns. His strong point was the drama - and I suppose this film is a kind of drama - unfolding in the old west. Strange, yes, but it seemed to work well, but I wonder what this great German director thought of this post. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the film, it is exceptional - with bright colors. , excellent shooting location and very good acting. As usual, Randolph Scott presented another casual and realistic performance. I was surprised, however, that Robert Young was also chosen in the film, but it was a good casting decision - he was supposed to be an educated Orientalist at Harvard. When I saw Barton MacLane also in the movie, I was pretty much thinking that he would be the "bad guy" and my thoughts were well founded, since he had made a career playing fools! As for the screenplay, it seemed rather ordinary, but the final confrontation between Scott and Barton MacLane was much better than I had hoped - to make this film a very good one.
