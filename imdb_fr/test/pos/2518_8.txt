Drive was a nice episode with a dark end. Basically, a man and his wife are infected in the inner ear by an acute sound wave emitted by military equipment. Some of my favorite parts of this episode are Mulder's dialogue in the car and the scene where Scully joins the Hazmat team and finds the deaf little old lady completely insensitive to what they thought was a virus. The end is of course tragic in its realism because it suggests to the viewer that he will be able to realize this plan developed to save the victim, but when Mulder arrives, the man is already dead. 8/10
