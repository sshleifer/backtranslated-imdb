A surprisingly well-done and well-written film about a tough, but decent young man, getting that much-desired celebrity note: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace his lead singer. No exaggeration, the film tries to keep things in perspective and does not go too far; this makes you think twice about those persistent teen fantasies of being in the music industry. But the scenario, in spite of a solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-tested formula and is engulfed in its own clich√©s in the final act. I enjoyed it a lot more than the "Almost Famous" sweet fluffball. It has a nice bitter advantage to accompany its decadence of heavy metal, but a stronger finish could have made it more memorable. ** 1/2 of ****
