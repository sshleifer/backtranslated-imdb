This film must be one of the most beautiful morbid films I have ever seen. Merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with excruciating violence, sex and a minimalist narrative of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick layer of grain makes you wonder what you really see sometimes, but the use of texture, combined with extreme contrast, creates an amazing visual experience. This film is not for everyone. I think you have to keep an open mind and do not condemn this film so quickly for its extremely rough content but that makes a rather important statement about creation, God and humanity. Whether this film is a work of art or a waste of shocking value is open to discussion.
