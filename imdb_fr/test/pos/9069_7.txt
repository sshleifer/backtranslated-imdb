Peter Lorre gives one of his most devilish performances as the owner of the place named. The plot put a new government agent on the trail of Peter Lorre's character. When the G-man's contact is killed by one of Lorre's agents, the G-man is sent to prison for murder, although everyone knows that history matters more. Lorre released the man in his care and took him to his island where he extracted diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows, but he does not speak and a battle of wills is launched. <br /> <br /> It's a good little solid thriller that does not really make much sense of the wise plot, but even if the film holds your interest. I put the film last night to use it as a drift; instead, I found the story quite captivating; I still had 70 minutes left. Lorre is the reason we fall into this. His attitude rather disconcerting. He does very little, but it is clear from his orders and from the way everyone reacts (look at how they light his cigarettes) that he is a bad guy. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look if you have to find it.
