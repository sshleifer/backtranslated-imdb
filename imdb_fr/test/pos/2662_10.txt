This film is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It is a story told at a steady pace, told mainly not by words but by means of cinematic expression. A perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music brings life to the creations of the human imagination in a realistic and poetic way. The story itself is quite simple at first. As the title suggests, there is an archetypal journey, a pattern repeated for thousands of years. This motif has always been used not only to describe a journey in space and time, but also beyond, but also has a rich philosophical significance. The film is a poetic contemplation of the most exciting eternal questions. It's not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our kind. The film is excellent in itself, but in my case, the impression will always be mixed with that of the book. I read it at the age of 10, without really thinking about problems such as "what is the relationship between the evolution of humanity and the development of human morality". But the impression was big enough to make me crack for all kind of science fiction. <br /> <br /> The day I learned '2001' got only special effects, Oscar and was not even nominated for the best movie. "Academy Award" has become completely two words meaning nothing to me.
