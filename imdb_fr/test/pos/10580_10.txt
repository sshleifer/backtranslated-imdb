After reading all of Sarah Waters' books, I was excited to see Fingersmith, a BBC adaptation. Especially since Tipping the Velvet was so well done by the old Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the results, in fact I think it could be comparable to TTV; both romantic and entertaining. And not like so many ignorant people would have you believe, a useless lesbian boil. As a fan of Elaine Cassidy since she saw shamelessly unfold in Felicia's journey, I thought she embodied both a hard illusion and Maud's growing fragility. His transformation was credible and impressive to watch. I recognized Sally Hawkins as Zena Blake of Tipping the Velvet, a small role mainly, so I did not have as many expectations, but she was stunning in the role of Sue Trinder. His eyes were hypnotizing, carrying everything from anger to utter despair. Both, acting together, combining these talents, made this drama a must. Of course, Imelda Staunton was amazing as usual, she is indisputably a national treasure and support actors were all of a high standard. Even the direction of Aisling Walsh, which is almost unknown, used contrasting and beautiful blue shades for Briar and brown for London. <br /> <br /> However, we must congratulate the writer Ransley. Transforming a 600-page book where each line is of the highest quality into a three-hour extravaganza is a huge feat. He illuminated the main revelations at a steady pace while bringing us many stories in the background and development of the character. He has all my admiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a brilliant adaptation in which all participants give 100% and make it one of the best dramas of the BBC I've seen.
