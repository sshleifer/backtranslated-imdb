I like Ernest going to jail. This is one of my 3 favorite movies of Ernest. The others being Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest go to camp. In this movie, Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a janitor for a bank, but he wants to be a bank clerk. Soon, he will be assigned to a jury but will eventually get in trouble when the nasty assassin Felix Nash (Varney also) will knock him out and change places with him! Soon, Ernest is in prison and is forced to act like Nash, otherwise Nash will kill Charlotte Ernest's love interest. When they take Ernest on the electric chair thinking that he is Nash, he is so electrocuted that he finally burst and goes away to save Charlotte from Nash! Filled with hilarious scenes and comics, Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that will make you laugh so much! It always makes me! Jim Varney was a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both the good and the bad! Varney was like his star Tom Hanks of Toy Story. No matter what role they played, their roles were memories and that's one of the things we'll always remember about Varney! TEAR. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for giving life to Ernest and other fantastic characters! 10 of 10!
