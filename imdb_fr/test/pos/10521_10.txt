Another who slipped by the radar of most people. This little gem produced in B is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so absolutely refreshing and inventive that a frightful feeling about the lack of cojones in today's cinema is slowly moving past your body. The final composition is so innovative in its setting and style that it prefigures everyone, from Tarantino to John Woo. Oh, and if you think the "dying lines" are all clich√©s, wait for the line dying for FF. A piece of dialogue that could have torn you away with laughter will take away your heart. A real pleasure. Seek him and see him. You will not be sorry.
