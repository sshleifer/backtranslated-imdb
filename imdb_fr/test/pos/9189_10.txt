I was not sure I wanted to get this movie on DVD because I really have something against people who shoot black and white movies in the 21st century, but I ended up buying it anyway. I still do not understand why it had to be in black and white, but it's the only negativity I can see on the film, and it's a perfect example to witness the definitive rise of Brazilian cinema. Everyone does not understand such a film, but it is very rewarding for those who understand it. Unlike O Homem Que Copiava, surrealism corresponds quite well to this film and the acting is at least as good as this one, or other successful Brazilian films such as Bicho de sete cabe√ßas, Cidade De Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, etc. <br /> My only hope is that this jewel is not insulted and violated by a Hollywood remake. It's amazing how these guys spend zillions of dollars and still can not make a movie that's 1% as good as this low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to all the crew! 10/10
