An unknown and invisible jewel. Estevez does a remarkable job of depicting in a poignant and heartbreaking way the tension that is created between a son who has been in hell and back and his parents, who can not begin to understand the emotional healing left behind. This is not unlike Born July 4, in that it deals with the emotional and mental collapse of a soldier after serving in Vietnam, but although it focuses more on the politics of post-Vietnam (anti-war speech, etc.), this one deals with a much more personal subject: the family. A man's struggle to return to normal after a life-changing experience, and the fact that his parents do not see the change. <br /> <br /> Estevez performs a show that smiles under the name of Jeremy Collier. You can feel the pain and frustration bubbling beneath the surface. It's his father, Martin Sheen, who fits him like a glove. It's a journey in observing that these two act on each other, because one has the impression that they are constantly trying to fight each other. It's as if the presence of each other has inspired the duo to do their best and their performances have triumphed. <br /> <br /> Recommended to all those who like to play, to go and to write in a solid way. And to any Vietnam war lover. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
