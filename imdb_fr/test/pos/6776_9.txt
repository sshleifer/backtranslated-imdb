This is by far the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is an entirely original and beautiful land. It's not boring, nor too dramatic. The characters are tangible and realistic, but that does not detract from the story. The fact that it is not in English is probably the finishing touch. The end leaves you flourished like never before. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to find this movie earlier. <br /> <br /> More lines. <br /> <br /> more lines. <br /> <br /> more lines have a lot more lines go, i'm done
