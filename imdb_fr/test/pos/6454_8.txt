I saw this film last night at a "pre-code" film festival, and I must tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head for his basic introduction, the entire audience was gasped. He was so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Cooper is set apart, this film perfectly shows the artistic talent of Rouben Mamoulian. Scenes of fantastic fades, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions - Mamoulian continues to explore the medium of direction and propose innovations. <br /> <br /> It was the first role of Sylvia Sidney in Hollywood, after her success in New York. scene, and she's just as beautiful as a leader Gary Cooper should be. It's nice to see her play a role with a tougher aspect than she has received many times - she often seems to fear being hit by someone. <br /> <br /> There are many familiar faces in this film. movie, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson. The most striking is Guy Kibbee, known for playing rich and moronic men, as a smashing and brilliant hit-hit. <br /> <br /> There are not enough of these pre-code movies available in VHS or DVD so if you can not find a pre-code festival near you, try campaigning with Turner Classic Movies for a broadcast! As for the critic who believes that Gary Cooper was too stupid to have a more complex dialogue than "Yep" or "Nope", he should perhaps consider Coop's performance in such films as "Mr Deeds Goes to Town" or " Meet John Doe ". Although God knows that someone who looks so good should not be so smart.
