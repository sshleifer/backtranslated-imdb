North and South is a miniseries of the "golden age" of the 1980s television miniseries, which was a period of breathtaking epics with high production values ​​and many star cameos. This is generally excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less narrative elements of soap opera history and the general meaning of the story. <br /> <br /> James Read and Patrick Swayze give excellent performances - particularly Read, of which George Hazard serves as an emotional anchor in the heart of an often melodramatic story. The series also contains leading works by Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilbourne, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Genie Francis, Georg Stanford Brown and others. Costumes, filming, sets and music are also top notch. <br /> <br /> Do not take it as a lesson in history, but as such: a complete epic well done. from a bygone era. Book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but I would advise viewers to skip book 3, which came out 8 years after book 2 and was not as good as the first two parts. Books 1 and 2 are classics, even with their tastier elements, and deserve to be viewed.
