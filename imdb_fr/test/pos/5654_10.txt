A heart-rending masterpiece of the madness and despair of war, Fires on the Plain (Nobi) will not please everyone: it is a war movie in the most real sense of the word, which does not use to the banner. patriotism or saccharine sentimentality. Nobi cuts deep, it's ugly, dark and dark like little things ever made on celluloid ever will. It is the war behind the guns, without triumphs or heroes, without moral victories or defeats to be made, just a handful of lean and terrible men sown in a land ravaged by war, like penitents fleeing a great disaster. The characters defy the moral judgment because they are creatures darkened by a great misfortune, a misfortune that does not allow questions of a moral nature. War and survival. Make the difference between your will and that of others in a battlefield. The loser is simply removed from existence. <br /> <br /> Tamura, a soldier of the Japanese Imperial Army, is demobilized from his platoon and ordered to go to a nearby hospital for coughing up blood and being hated by others in the squad . He is told never to return and commit suicide with a grenade in case the hospital rejects him. What he does. The hospital is nothing more than a wooden hut and the surgeon at the hospital simply tells him that if he can walk, he is fine. It is in this shabby excuse of a hospital that one of the most heartbreaking scenes of the film unfolds. While the area is bombed by American planes, doctors and those who can move away from the hospital and take refuge in the woods. A few moments before the hospital was torn to pieces, the thin, crippled figures of the sick and the wounded slipped into all the postures, clad in their disgusting white robes, as if the building were a sort of beast spewing viscera and dirt. on the ground. <br /> <br /> This is the biggest success of Nobi; the atrocious and heartbreaking representation of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images, without melodrama or pseudo-heroism. The soldiers cross a swamp, wading knee-deep in the mud, crossing the opposite bank and entering a field to discover the enemy tanks hidden in the woods, their lights shining like evil eyes as they scrutinize the darkness. A procession of wounded, dirty and half-insane soldiers crossing a road and falling to the ground at the sound of enemy planes. Busettes feasting on a pile of corpses. An abandoned village. A mad soldier who thinks himself Buddha sitting under a tree, covered with flies and his own excrement, offering his arm to Tamura when he is dead. These are the images Kon Ichikawa evokes for our eyes, ruthless and unwavering, but honest and brutal. <br /> <br /> Nobi does not rush to go somewhere. Tamura is content to follow the war-torn journey as he tries to reach Palompa's regroupment center and observes the madness and obscenities of the war. The film goes through the horrors of war, slow and dark, like the characters it follows. The last thirty minutes during which Tamura took refuge with two deserters who feed on "monkey meat" are the closest to what Nobi wanted to adhere to the conventional stories and which are no less powerful in this respect. Remarkably photographed in black and white, with superb performance of the cast and direction provided by Ichikawa, Nobi is not only among the best war films to be made, but also among the best of Japanese cinema.
