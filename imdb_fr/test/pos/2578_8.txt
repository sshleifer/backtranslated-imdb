In Mississippi, former Lazarus blues man (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife who has just left him. He finds the slut and the nymphomaniac of the city, Rae (Chritina Ricci), thrown on the road near his small farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus takes her home, gives her medicine, breastfeeds and feeds her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When his boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is fired from the army because of his anguish, he misunderstands the relationship between Lazare and Rae and tries to kill him. <br /> "The Black Moan Snake" is a strange tale of faith, hope, love and blues. The talented Christina Ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since childhood by her father and having sex with the entire city where she lives. It's amazing the versatility of this actress, and it's probably the most mature work I've seen Christina Ricci play. Samuel L. Jackson also has a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard in a movie, with a beautiful blues. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Between the world and hell" ("Between heaven and hell")
