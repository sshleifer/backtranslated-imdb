It's one of Marion Davies' best walkie-talkies - and one of the few that allows him to showcase his talent as a physical comedian, so engaging in his silent films. OK, so she makes a clunky clun number, but even the dance of that time of Ruby Keeler does not hold for the younger generations. The problem here is the script. The story falls into an incredible melodrama in the last reel. It's quite scenic, and is obviously adapted from a play ... but not good enough. There are still some catchy dialogues and slapstick everywhere. Well worth a look.
