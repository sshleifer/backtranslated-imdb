Jack Webb's representation of the marine training instructor training new recruits in basic training requires no interpretation. Straight ahead, direct, forward, are all applicable to this classic. At a time when analyzing the statements of our leaders is a necessity to understand what they say, this film plays no game with our language or our moral fiber. True and false are clear and easy to define. If you like a clear and well-understood dialogue in a disciplined military setting, this film should suit you.
