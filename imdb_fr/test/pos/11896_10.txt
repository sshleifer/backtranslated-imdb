I love movies that train you. A movie that leaves you really weak when you're done and that kind of movie is rare. <br /> <br /> Damian is so talented and versatile in many ways to write and represent different characters on the screen. This film has a sharp edge. A main cast for such a small budget. Why a man with so much talent and charisma (not to mention sex appeal in a way that exceeds most other actors) can do it with so little money to work with ????? These actors really believe in his scenario and his raw talent as director, screenwriter and actor. I am so happy to know that a genius of our time is here, letting his passion for art lead him and taking us for an audience. Damian I have heard of you in so many different circles and do not let the jealous of this world reach you. Martin understands this, Fellini understands it and you will always get it. The fire and passion in you is what we like to watch on the screen. Thank you for being different and having the courage to write like you. You are a unique director, do not listen to empty ships.
