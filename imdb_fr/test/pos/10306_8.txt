I agree with Andy, it's a good movie. The character of Kevin McKidd is credible throughout the film. We have to hate him and sympathize with him. Paula Sage who plays Roberta also performs well. It's moving and emotional, without any overproduction of slush. We thank the director Alison Peebles and the writer Andrea Gibb for this. A very interesting viewing. The rhythm of the film is right, it arouses just enough interest for the subject, instead of bombarding you with documentary facts. Nice little soundtrack to accompany the film too, again used sparingly, not to distract you from the screenplay. Recommended.
