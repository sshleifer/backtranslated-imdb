I went to see this because I have friends in Ukraine. but the film touched me beyond what I expected by revealing itself to be a perfect mix of belly laughter (strange use of English in alex) of situational comedy and heaviness that graze depression. I loved the range. it made me want to jump into an old car and take the road to Ukraine. alex (hutz) plays his guiding role perfectly and is an excellent counterpoint to the seriousness with which Elijah Woods faces poker. the film shows the positive side of humanity when people from different cultures can make connections and do what is right when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when they have entered with preconceptions and prejudices , and how that can open doors deep buried memories. there is a lot in this movie.
