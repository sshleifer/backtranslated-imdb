Although made by HBO for cable, it's a nice film and a fascinating look at the world of television, which dulls the wrist. Allow the viewer to take a behind-the-scenes look at the so-called late-night talk show war of the early '90s, as Jay Leno and David Letterman compete for the coveted position as facilitator Tonight Show. Kathy Bates gives a brave performance as Helen Kushnick, Leno's Commercial Director, and one can feel empathy for what Leno / Letterman has endured at the hands of TV executives. This is equally timely now, given recent events related to ABC's unsuccessful attempt to replace Nightline with Letterman. No matter how many times I have seen this film, I still find it as much fun to watch it as the first broadcast. If it were ever to be released on DVD, I would definitely add it to my collection.
