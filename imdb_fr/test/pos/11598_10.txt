When I watch this movie, I get excited too when I see scenes of miss world. She has a beautiful and charming body. When a cute lady does bed scenes and shows her body completely naked ... I think men are struggling to resist ... I think the time has come for cute girls like hrishita bhatt to also do scenes of nudity. At least no one wants the naked body of ugly women like Seema biswas to c in bandit queen. I agree with what mallicka.b said. The film is described in a way that seems to be a kind of defamation of the original content. Emotions are not correctly transmitted. I suppose that some not very good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a little sturdy, which is not what the film should have been. I also noticed a bit of over-action in some of his scenes. I am a sharp critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can not help it; Sorry. "Raincoat" was a good film by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not impressed at all
