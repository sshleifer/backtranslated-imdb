I want to start this review by saying that I do not know at all what "begotten" is. All I really know is that at the beginning, God kills himself, giving birth to the Mother Earth, rooted in the sperm of God. She then gives birth to a son. The rest is quite subjective and you have to interpret it in your own way. <br /> <br /> This is how I chose to interpret the film; The fact that God committed suicide marked the beginning of the scientific revolution, when people began to question the doctrines imposed by the church, such as the geocentric vision of the universe, and so on. because God says it's "points of view." The tribal people were the church that was attacking them, trying to impose Christianity on them, and I do not know exactly how Son Of Earth fits into that. and the tribes seemed to be fighting for him, so maybe he represents people's freedom or something like that. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the final parts of this movie are supposed to mean Blanner, raping, then dismembering the Mother Earth and the Son of the Earth and grinding them in the ground like a mortar and a pestle might have some meaning, but that's where the pleasure of this You can interpret it as you like, it does not have to be definitive, you can let your mind wander, sometimes you do not even know what you're supposed to look at, because it's shot in an angle strange or too blurry. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me is that I was expecting a real terrifying movie. I went there thinking that I was going to receive a phone call immediately afterwards with a warning "seven days" presentiment. What I got was pleasantly different. It was not scary at all, but it aroused my imagination. Trying to decipher the encrypted message of the movie was a creative challenge. There were a lot of scenes that were actually beautiful. Mother Earth just after her birth and the last plan of the forest trail come to my mind. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. It's certainly the most abstract movie I've ever seen, but it's not a bad thing.
