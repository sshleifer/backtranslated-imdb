I hope Robert Redford will continue to make more movies like this one. Hillerman's books are wonderful, and when a young child grew up in the southwest, his stories hit the house! Adam Beach is a highly underrated and underutilized player. Wake up Hollywood, not everyone thinks your Mel Gibson is cool! Today, many moviegoers want to see films that make you think. I saw the whole series Redford / Hillerman. They are thoughtful, picturesque and have large parcels. I hope that if enough people write to Robert Redford, he can decide to make some more! Thank you Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for their great entertainment! If anyone has the chance to read Tony Hillerman's latest book, do it! It's good. I also recommend traveling to Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop by every point of view and feel the scenery of Hillerman's books. Incredible experience
