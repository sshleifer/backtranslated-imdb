I wish it to be published, because I would like to see the finished product! We saw the unfinished version before it was released. I loved all the characters and actors. Anyone know if he's already on video? I would love to see you again. It is really worth to be rented if it is not shown in the theater. I had a hard time finding it because they renamed it.
