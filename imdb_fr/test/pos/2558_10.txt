my girlfriend, as we walk in the cold London night in Leicester Square, after the movie, said: if they did not speak English and did not show the stadium, you would have thought it was the slum of a city from South America. or in another slum of the world, not in Queens in New York. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani is, at present, my official hero, because he seems to have devoted his work not to show the OTHER American face, but the REAL face of America. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bahrani's films look like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta 'aperta. Chop Shop is the reality turned into a movie, is more realistic than a documentary, in fact I think Ramin Bahrani's films are more realistic than documentaries. It's a good movie, but do not expect a car chase or a shoot. This film is about tragic lives on the edge of the richest and richest country in the world.
