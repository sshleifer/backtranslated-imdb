I can not get rid of this gesture. It's totally different from everything that exists. I saw a ton of movies during the holidays and even if some are fine, nothing upsets my world like BlindSpot. There is just something really cool about the actors and the way they put the film together. It's as if there were really scary things mixed with some hilarious black humor. Franco is great, but the more agitated guy steals the show in a few scenes, like when he hits the kid in the grave. I imagine that some good politicians will not appreciate the atmosphere (do not bring your grandmother) but it's totally awesome. The best thing is the kaliedescope style. There are really serious things mixed with some really interesting images of the road. The film makes you really sad and scared but it also makes you turn your head with what is happening and the way it is filmed. WTF is with the world? Too many critics praise all these so-called revolutionary and revolutionary films. When you watch them, they are boring and predictable. I do not understand because there are many other better choices. Blind Spot is really great, because it gives you thrills, thrills and a major power for future stars, but it is totally fresh and radiantly radiant.
