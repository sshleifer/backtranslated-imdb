Watching these two movies simultaneously is not a bad idea to get an idea of ​​early movie production and act for camera styles. I greet Garbo (but not much) regarding his naturalness. Robeson is majestic. But his performance is destined for a large proscenium theater. Another thing that struck me was the cinema's themes of empowering women and minorities. There were still no movies out of Hollywood allowing the voices of marginal characters like Anna and Brutus to come to the fore. They were very progressive films for their time. It is likely that O'Neill saw the writing on the wall well before everyone else about the future of America.
