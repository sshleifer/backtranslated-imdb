Several books have cited this film as the first gay cinema. I do not really see this as gay in the homosexual sense, but to see two men dancing in what must be the world's first musical has its appeal. <br /> <br /> There have been several previous comments about this film that rejected any homosexual connotation. As for those who are quick to dismiss this film as just idiot and a late-night experience after drinking too much ... Well, I've heard that story before. <br /> <br /> This film is interesting as curiosity and if people want to consider it as the first gay movie, so be it. This is better than the depressing 1919 Anders als die Andern.
