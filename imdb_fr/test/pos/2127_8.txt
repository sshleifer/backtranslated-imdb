I thought this movie was perfect for little girls. It was a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do at any time. Most girls would like this story, even if there is the thought of death. Although no one dies, the king almost succeeds, but the little girls would not understand it. All events add up, creating a big storyline that can have meaning if you dig deep enough. This story is perfect for little girls, and as it is a Barbie movie, kids can have more fun with it, especially if they have Barbies on their side. Anyone can have fun with, though, because it's so cute and understandable. Overall, I think this movie is a good movie for everyone, especially little girls, and will make everyone smile at least once.
