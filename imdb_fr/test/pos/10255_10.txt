Cooley High is considered one of my best movies of all time. It certainly reminds me of days when I grew up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago in the early, middle and late 1960s. What happened to Brenda and Pooter? Someone needs to track down these two. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for her innocent spirit. They both deserve to be recognized, even 31 years after the launch of this film. I think a lot of fans of this film would like to know what happened to them, as well as those who played in this funny movie. I certainly think that this film should be written in a kind of MOVIE HALL OF FAME. All the actors in this movie were great. My opinion is "Cooley High" is to go back, those who have been years of pleasure.
