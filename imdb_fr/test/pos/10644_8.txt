It's been a while since I want to see this: I never thought I would look at it in a wet Trafalgar Square in London with 15,000 other people and a new Pet Shop Boys score. <br /> <br /> Quickly, this experience in particular. A new departure for the PSB, he seemed to suffer from the same problem as that of the miniaturist Hugo Wolf when he wrote his opera Der Corregidor: the long structure was a chain of short pieces, that is to say songs. PSB produced a more fluid and integrated score, even if it was quite static on its own terms. They could not resist the song either: a subtitled text setting worked in that direction; an autonomous meditation on the action of the massacre committed in Odessa during the action of this sequence itself was, I would go so far as to say, counterproductive. Overall, it was very exciting, and that's certainly what Eisenstein was trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> This is a very exciting movie whose editing is accelerated and replaces the acceleration of tension or action. In fact, the film, although beautifully shot and acted passionately (it has a silent movie melodrama, but not in Hollywood comic style) breathes through its neat editing, framing specific shots with an idea of ​​how fast the film audience them in. And there is also a wide variety of perspectives; or he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the port and the steps took a lot of time. <br /> <br /> A super movie, which can be evaluated independently of the sound, because the final product would have been so. conceived. 8/10
