I thought it was brilliant! It was great to see the presenter find each one of them. Dwight Schultz always had the same look, he had almost no change of look, any more than Dirk Benedict, he always looked so withering! I thought Mr. T looked slimmer, but it was nice to see how he'd behaved all this time. I thought it needed some work to find other cast members, such as the one playing Decker and the woman playing Amy. It was just too bad that Mr. T could not attend the meeting. In addition, it was very unfortunate that George Peppard died, leaving a void so to speak. I only wish now that I have saved it to keep it. Hope they repeat it again.
