Some martial arts purists believe that comedy is the worst thing that can happen to the old school kung fu movie; and it is true that the introduction of comedy in the genre marked the end of the "chop-socky" period of the Hong Kong film. But the fact is that one can only continue an essentially physical show of prowess for a very long time, then everyone gets bored with it. And that's really the reason for the disappearance of Chop-Socky and the birth of Hong Kong's "New Wave" action movie: producers, actors, directors were all bored to hit people for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Given this and considering that Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a considerable list of films in his CV, this film must be considered as something other than a simple comedy of kung- fu. It is rather a comic film in the martial arts genre, and in fact one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> What Liu did with this movie is really a pleasant surprise: he took a martial-art plot and reconstructed it in the lines of a Hollywood-style musical! Complete with singing and dancing episodes! It was around the time of this film that some filmmakers and moviegoers began to recognize that the martial arts cinematographic performance (actually drawn from the acrobatics of Chinese opera) had more in common with dance that fighting. . (I will continue to emphasize this link until most Americans realize what they are supposed to look for when they watch a martial arts movie - well choreographed body movements, using the intrigue of an action movie as an excuse for their performance.) Anyway, Liu Chia Liang clearly established this link and decided to explore it closely. The result is incredibly charming entertainment, filled with wonderfully human characters who attempt a miraculous kung fu (and stumble on their own laces as often as they do not). and the film taking place in the 19th and 20th centuries, gives Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of Westernization and modernization of China that have greatly contributed to the construction of China as we know it today. The film therefore also has considerable historical importance. <br /> <br /> In addition, fans of Stephen Chow's recent Kung Fu Hustle should really watch this film carefully, as Chow clearly learned before making his own film. <fr /> <br /> A very funny and well done movie. Oh, yes, and the kung fu there is really good. <br /> <br /> Purists will not admit it, but it's probably director Liu's best film.
