This assemblage of THE SEARCHERS is one of the strangest films I have ever seen, filmed by a Brit in a strange and unknown Mexico. It is often said that the best movies about America are made by strangers, who can approach the regular with a foreign eye. But this crackpot movie is something else. Although apparently taking place in post-civil war America, it is not a recognizable America of myth, cinema, television, etc. The film has an air of timeless fable about it, while dealing specifically with Western mythology. <br /> <br /> Director Harvey uses the title horse as a center of interconnected stories, all of which deal with the traditional Western conflict between primitive opponent and civilization. The first seems to have the upper hand. The vast desert and scrub of the film landscape are uninterrupted, conducive to the allegories of the spirit. The only brief sites of civilization are the diligence of missionaries and landowners, as well as their hacienda, from which all but civilized behavior results. <br /> <br /> The fundamental story separates three stories. In one of them, a desperate deserter, Pike, after losing his trading partner, steals a miraculous horse, Eagle's Wing, so named for his grace and speed. In the second, an Indian, White Bull, owner of this horse, drags a stagecoach and kidnaps one of its occupants. In the third, the Spanish men sent in search of him ignore this quest for murderous and lustful madness. <br /> <br /> Although a Western revisionist, the treatment of the Indian is problematic. Unlike Pike, his character is never explained, forever impenetrable, voiceless, with the exception of an atrocious excerpt. When he is not a strange Other, he is a symbol whose role is not entirely defined - at one time, a savage brute, at another he embodies nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But Pike notes at the beginning that the film will follow the period of primitivism before civilization. In many ways, the film resembles 2001 - AN ODYSSEY OF SPACE, especially its opening sequence. Part of the power of the film lies in the links established between the three disparate characters, forcing us to look at the quests and the mythical struggles in a different light. Indian culture and Catholicism are linked by superstition, rituals, greed and murder. Pike and White Bull are both musical and alcoholic. Pike and the abductee demonize White Bull as a "bastard", unknowingly revealing the tactics of illegitimacy used by the white colonizers who infantilized the natives, thus becoming "necessary" fathers. <br /> <br /> Unlike a traditional West Anxious to make history, civilization and progress, this film is a double detective novel, questioning the past, the traces, the remains. <br /> <br /> What gives this film its remarkable singularity, I feel, despite Maltin racism, his british. The decisive stalemate is more like an Arthurian game. The film itself courageously avoids dialogue for the most part, creating the kind of visual and sound tapestry Malick missed in THE THIN RED LINE, and few Hollywood directors would have dared. The existential splitting and quest motives are more of a European than American myth (resembling another British film by Harvey Keitel, THE DUELLISTS). <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is the use of nature. Most Westerners use the landscape as a breathtaking backdrop: there is little sense of real life in the West. In many ways, EAGLE'S WING resembles a film by Powell and Pressberger, nature being a powerful and pantheistic character - living, dangerous, hostile, beautiful. There is a sublime scene reminiscent of AA CANTERBURY TALE, when the jewels left as a trap by White Bull in the trees are suddenly blown into the wind: there is a haunting, piquant, magical and moving effect that is more reminiscent of Nights. Arabian than a horse opera. Cardiac arrest.
