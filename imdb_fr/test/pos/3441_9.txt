I just finished seeing the movie for the first time in its entirety (although I watched a few passages during its first appearance in Britain in the mid-90s), I really believe it's is a masterpiece of cinema of the late twentieth century. Without a doubt, a film of this magnitude raises many questions, like this: why are there narrative differences between Hermann in Heimat, in the 60s, and Hermann in this film? For example, in the first film, Hermann has a rather significant relationship with his father-in-law (he finances the electronic music of Hermann), whereas in "Die Zweite ...", there is little question of his father before the final episode. <br /> Another point interests me; Reading Edgar Reitz, I am struck by the historical similarities between him and Stefan's character. (The next episode will be revealed), it is revealed that Stefan won an award at the Venice Film Festival (Reitz won the prize for the best start working for his film "Mahlzeiten"); Reitz's film company is called 'Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion' and Stefan's is also called the same name. I'm interested in Stefan being an autobiographical character, because apart from Helga, he's probably the least friendly of friends. <br /> <br /> Maybe Stefan is a fool, I do not know. What I know is that I liked this movie and that I would have liked to do more, except for "Cache" by Michael Haneke and Werner "Grizzly Man" of Herzog, there There is not enough ambition, daring and passion of this kind in modern cinema. I can not wait to see number 3 now.
