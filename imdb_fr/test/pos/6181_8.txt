It's about getting what you want when you want it. And the message of the eighth woman of Bluebeard is to pay attention to what you want, until you wish for yourself. <br /> <br /> Most men have heard of what happens when your sexual frustration is not relieved. and some of your anatomy turning blue. Beside misogynist pirates, Cooper plays a very rich man who is very used to getting what he wants when he wants, learning too late that it was not what he expected and will never learn his lesson until he meets the brave Claudette Colbert. Thanks to a twisted commercial agreement (in the soul and in practice), he ends up buying / buying it with the intention of sleeping, but it will have nothing (literally) and will frustrate it at every turn, corner and room, and tourist attraction. <br /> <br /> The film has definite French sensibilities, which means that it has a strong double meaning and a boudoir humor for the day and that it has a cutting edge to which you are not used ( and may not be pleased to see) either Cooper or Colbert. The reason I watched the movie is that they are "friendly" actors, and the purpose of this film is that they are inimitable people, or at least friendly people who have developed unimaginable traits protect the world. <br /> <br /> If you can accept it in its own terms, you will find satisfaction in this spiritual and sophisticated film ... and satisfaction, as we said, is what matters. Such a film with such a distribution comes only after all, once in a ... uh ... blue moon.
