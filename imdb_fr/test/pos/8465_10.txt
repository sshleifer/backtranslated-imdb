The fact that this film was shown at the Barbican in London tells me that the print must have been sufficiently acceptable for such a projection. Now the question is: Why is this important and long-lost movie not available on DVD (or even VHS)? Many people in Europe and the United States have been hoping to see this film for many years, if only for the wonderful music written by Sergei Prokofiev. What needs to be done to make such a wonderful production accessible to a wider audience, not just the Barbican customers in London? As a devoted listener of Prokofiev's music for many years and aware of this film, PLEASE, do it right, do it on DVD.
