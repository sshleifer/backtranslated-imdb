Age can not tarnish the beauty of this East-West love story for me. Ignoring the famous and beautiful title song and his lyrics, we have here a theatrical biography of two remarkable characters trapped in a counter-current moment involving social conformity, bigotry, war, doubt and the need for immense courage. This Hong Kong-themed film tells the story of a Eurasian doctor and an American journalist who met and fell in love with the Korean War. As Mark Elliott, William Holden is intelligent, light and a little weak; Jennifer Jones is perhaps almost perfect, like Dr. Han Suyin, who in turn is torn by doubt and ecstatic, enthusiastic and hesitant. Torin Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Matheson, Virginia Gregg, Richard Loo, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell are also part of the cast. Many of the best Eastern Hollywood actors also played small uncredited roles. John Patrick's screenplay closely follows Han's exquisite novel; the direction given by Henry King was solid, as always. The plot tells how reluctant Han was to fall in love with Elliott, his busy and demanding schedule as a doctor, and his doubts about their future; and how much he was afraid, despite the intolerance and interference they faced when their case was known. The film is undeniably physically busy, interesting and often so beautiful. The hill on which the lovers are going to separate, the beautiful bay in which they swim stand against an already busy business city, large social events, teeming streets, hospital corridors and busy arteries. With Leon Shamroy's cinematography, Ben Nye's makeup and Helen Turpin's hairstyles, the excellent work of set decorators, sound and light, the arts department and all the players involved, this must be one of the most most memorable productions in a major non-American city of all time, and one of the most difficult to capture on film. Yet, what is most remembered here are the lovers, fortunately not extremely young, who face obstacles and evaluate what they are exactly - then move forward as if love mattered and that the conditions that constitute barriers to love do not have it. The culmination of the affair is Mark's return to war; subsequently, Han receives her letters, even after she realizes that he has been killed; they seem messages from a better world. A world where everything is about hope, courage is the price to pay for access, and it's always summer on a high and windy hill, above an area where beauty and individual desires may be victims, subjected to ill-treatment. fortune or swept away by militant forces of evil. Really, love is a very splendid thing, says Dr. Han; and this film is one of the most striking proofs of this doctrine, lucid as a pearl, timeless as a Chinese proverb and beautiful as polished jade unfolding against a rough background.
