I recently had the movie and all I can say is a good movie. There are many monuments and famous historical places of Rome. He is the same author and director of The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks plays alongside Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film begins with the Swedish space experience until one of the cans is stolen by the most hated enemy of the church, the Illuminati. It's hard to discuss the plot without spoiling anything. It's a race across the city of Rome, following the Illuminati Trail to the secret Illuminati meeting place. By racing against the clock to find the path of the Illuminati. Overall, it's a movie worthy of hell, I've watched it 3 times and I still love it, so in the end, buy it. It's a lot better than the 2010 movie. And the end has an awesome twist of the plot.
