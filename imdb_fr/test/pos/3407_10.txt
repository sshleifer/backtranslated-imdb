A story about love and hate, tragedy and happiness and, above all, about friendship in the very interesting time of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> interest you in the story, engage you emotionally and incite you feverishly anticipates the next episode. <br /> <br /> In addition, the cast was beautiful. Many superstars appear in short cameos, the main roles being provided by a large number of talented mimes - Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber should be mentioned here - this is simply a superb example of a television production such as she should be. <br /> Do not forget the beauty of Wendy Kilbourne who represents Constance :-)
