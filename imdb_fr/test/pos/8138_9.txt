This short film aims to focus on a problem known as cultural shock. the film presents the Romanian average condition in democratic Romania who discovers that life and problems are no different from the communist period, and if you want something, you have to bribe to get it. , our main character is fired after a long time, he is about 50 years old and must get a similar job, but the only work available is less. He has to take it because of lack of money. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that you have to live in Romania so that this film can be as real and tragic as it seems.
