It's certainly one of the best documentaries I've seen on family relationships and marriage. I saw "capture the friedmans" not long ago and I must admit that I thought it was better. <br /> <br /> The story is not incredibly shocking, but it's a great review of trapped personalities and the cold relational war. Block cleverly guides the viewer through diaries, family sequences and interviews after the fact; his interview style is sensitive and deep, and his ideas are clear and measured. <br /> <br /> 51 Birch Street is a great review of personalities and relationships over 40 to 50 years of social change, social impact and potential. for redemption.
