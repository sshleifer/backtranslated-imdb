Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg and John-Luc Goddard - were you expecting a fun movie that will please the whole family? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they did not follow the general public, but created it. For those who complain of not having adhered to the original story of the opera - How often is the music of a movie directly related to what happens in the movie? It's the atmosphere that counts. That's what I think the directors of these films were doing: creating a contemporary atmosphere for old operas. For the most part, they succeed wonderfully. With all these operas, who will love them all. We could have used more Beverly whistles. <br /> <br /> Finally, what is art (even opera) without some naked women?
