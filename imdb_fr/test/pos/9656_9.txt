It is a charming and charming epic fantasy with a lot of heart. I lost myself in this sweet film by watching him at the Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It's really romantic with a touching message. The work and effects are striking and the fact that the director is an extraordinary artist is so obvious. Frames are like watching moving works. He also has a cast of strong and talented actors. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland, he is just a perfect fairy tale king. Sarah Douglas is great because the wicked and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz are a romantic and charming couple. The fact that the film was made with a ridiculously tiny budget for an independent film sweeps me away. It may not be the kind of Hollywood movie we're flooded with, but it's a really cool movie to rent and enjoy by snuggling on a sofa on a rainy Saturday. Do not forget the popcorn in the microwave. This is my advice. Have fun.
