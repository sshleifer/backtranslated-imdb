Although I can understand some of the remarks made about cinematography (I thought that a more targeted approach would have better supported the low-fi and home movie style), but I must say that I found the scenario and the game of WHAT ALICE FOUND excellent! Dean Bell has created a real jewel that Judith Ivey charms with a character-driven delight. Her Sandra performance is a pleasure - taking turns both diabolical and romantic. We are both intrigued and repelled by his actions ... and we never receive more information than necessary. Her efforts and those of the secondary distribution join Bell's post-modern fairy tale with arms wide open. Emily Grace's Alice Grace is imbued with evil magic. She seems to be modeling herself like clay in front of us, turning into a sort of beautiful beast lost. In the end, we disagree with the words, like her, saying goodbye to her mother. Congratulations also to Jane Lincoln Taylor - whose mother provides the fair and tragic weight - and to Justin Parkinson - whose timid shy John, Sam, provides one of the sweetest, even the most clumsy intercourse. scenes in the film. Bell has created a first-rate story and brought together a plethora of talents to make it happen.
