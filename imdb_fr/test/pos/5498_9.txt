Simply a film well done, well written and beautifully played. Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo <br /> stand out from Eastwood as Secret Service Agent Lilly Raines. <br /> <br /> The greatness of the film rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". He captures <br /> <br /> the rage and hatred of this character, as well as his humanity rather oddly enough. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it was his best performance and should have received an <br /> <br /> Oscar for that (but I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive also this year -the). Overall, a good movie will allow you to take a look in the mind of an assassin and be <br /> on the edge of your seat throughout your journey. Enjoy!!
