I am a big fan of the legendary director Elia Kazan. His films often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses. Whether it's an obsessive love in Splendor In the Grass, poverty in "A tree grows in Brooklyn" or racism in "Gentlemen's Agreement". While looking for other films made by Kazan, I came across a film based on a novel by Arthur Miller. The movie "Focus" features William H.Macy (one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern. He approaches antisemitism in a very realistic way. <br /> <br /> Macy's character seems to be going hand in hand with the bigots of her neighborhood and her work, until it concerns her personally. That's the key here ... the reason he acted was not because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand, he acted because he was now considered a outsider and that he began to feel the same glances, the same remarks and the same brutally that Mr. Finklestein (David Pamyers) experienced. <br /> <br /> The film is very well written and well played. Meat Loaf does an amazing job playing in an earth bag! The performances of Macy and Dern are remarkable! It is easier to live in life, instead of opposing it. Sometimes, for people to take a stand, things must have an impact on their lives or on those of their loved ones ... Only then will some people find their moral compass.
