I love to love this show. It's a refreshing version of some science fiction styles and sensations. they are not afraid to shoot and when they do, people tend to die. Far too many series are afraid of this and just end up pointing the guns and then making a stalemate. Farscape also comes with a large amount of comforting characters. They all grow on you until you find it difficult to hear them discuss removing some of the animatronic images from their box to make the mini-series. From start to finish, Farscape leaves you with a sense of hope and despair, as new and unexpected things happen, as people live and die, surprising you every time. Worth the detour even if you do not have the time.
