I do not usually comment on movies since I'm in the distribution business, but I have to say it's one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is fantastic and the scenario is even better. There has been no cheesy talk or exploitation of people with disabilities in an attempt to make this film more "Hollywood". James McAvoy is such a remarkable actor that I could not look away from him if I tried. Steven Robertson also impressed me. I can not believe it's his first real movie. Brenda Fricker plays a small role but, as usual, she is remarkable. It's a movie for everyone to see how lucky we all are. If you like Awakenings and Mask, you'll enjoy this story. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie.
