-Facts (I): "Mar Adentro" tells the well-known story (at least in Spain) of Ramón Sampedro, a Galician quadriplegic who killed himself (helped by friends) after 28 years of abandonment. The judges repeatedly denied her requests for active euthanasia. <br /> <br /> -Facts (II): "Mar adentro" becomes THE FILM OF THE YEAR in Spain. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... Everyone loves, even the opinions of the critics are unanimous. The film wins many awards (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya ...) and annoys the Catholic community and quadriplegic lovers of life. A star is born. <br /> <br /> -Facts (III): The intensity and quality of the actors of "Mar Adentro" are simply incredible. That's why I wonder why we have to watch the same bad movie. young actors in most of the latest Spanish films. I do not know if Javier Bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (there is a big difference between the two things); in any case, his work is simply impressive, as is that of Lola Dueñas, Belén Rueda, or that of all the guests. It is (the selection of the actors) the strong point of the film of Amenábar. <br /> <br /> -Facts (IV): Alejandro Amenábar learned his lesson at film school without a doubt: he has a privileged brain. . He takes control of every technical aspect, he knows what the public wants, he knows how to touch the right deal, even if it turns him into such a demagogue (just like Spielberg is one of Amenábar's idols). <br /> <br /> -Facts (and V): If you criticize a film such as "Mar Adentro", you will have the impression that you have a problem with the moral problem that tells the story. There is a trap in this kind of images: you have to make the difference between the film itself and the moral concepts. If you do not like "Schindler's List", that does not mean that you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or yourself?). So for me it's a good movie and an amazing story (since it's a real story that makes it a lot more amazing). Grandiloquent, generous and anything but neutral (no matter what Amenábar or Bardem said about it: these characters who are not in favor of euthanasia are useless!). 50% Hard / 50% much too sentimental. <br /> <br /> -Epilogue: "Mar Adentro" would not be in my ranking of the best Spanish films of the 50s of all time. Nobody has merit in history, if not Ramon Sampedro himself. He is the movie. Alejandro Amenábar will become the most international Spanish director of all time, perhaps he will live in Hollywood; but some of us would like to see him film a simple story, without twists, without undead or undead ... "The Others" is still his best film. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
