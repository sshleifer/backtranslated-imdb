A wonderful little production. <br /> <br /> The filming technique is very sober, very old, BBC fashion and gives the whole piece a comforting realism, sometimes embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The actors are extremely well chosen - Michael Sheen not only "has all polari" but he also has all the voices! You can really see the editing seamlessly guided by references to Williams' journal entries. Not only is it worth watching, but it is a terribly written and interpreted piece. A masterful production on one of the greatest masters of comedy and his life. <br /> <br /> Realism really comes to the house with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than using the traditional techniques of "dream", remains solid and then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, especially with the scenes about Orton and Halliwell and the sets (especially their apartment with the Halliwell murals decorating each surface) are terribly well done.
