Inlow <br /> <br /> My Architect: The Journey of a Son 2003 - Nathaniel Kahn Not rated: 116minutes Vault Rating: 7 <br /> <br /> What a thing to be father without a father. "My Architect: The Path of a Son" follows Philadelphia filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn, who is desperately searching for answers from his father, the famous architect Louis I. Kahn, who has been dead for the last 30 years. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn died a train station in 1974 and left more than one family. Funerals, when the filmmaker was just a boy, were, let's say, an unpleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> We find that Nathaniel only knew his father by passing, his sporadic visits with his mother, he tells us, he loved deeply. This film is about a boy looking for his father and maybe himself by visiting his work, as if these magnificent structures had a secret. <br /> <br /> Of course, Louis Kahn was a talented architect, but "architect" is a cold word. The man was a large-scale sculptor who spoke of his art in terms of silence and art. <br /> <br /> Among his remarkable works, explored with love in the film, include the Salk Institute (1965), The Kimball Art Museum (1972) and the monumental complex of the capital in Bangladesh (1983). The part of the film where Nathaniel first traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh, discovers the work but not the man. <br /> <br /> The film takes great advantage of the presence of many images of the public when he worked in New York and as a professor at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. Many of Khan's contemporaries and collaborators also help to give life to the filmmaker's ghost. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the viewer does not seem to come to a particularly satisfying place. The answers that Nathaniel Khan looks for seem empty. Not good enough. <br /> <br /> In scenes where the director meets his half-sisters, both of different mothers, one can feel the tensions of the years, the affronts and the wounds. One would expect them to burst into anger, but only the camera saves them from hostilities. Each of these children has visibly lost something. <br /> <br /> It can be said that Khan, who seemed to be a motivated perfectionist, never got rich. Instead, he became remarkable. It was as if he sacrificed his family for his art. It is an extremely sad and tragic thing. <br /> <br /> April 28, 2005
