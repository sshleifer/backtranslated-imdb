Eric Bogosian gives a performance as exceptional as you will see in an Oliver Stone movie. His character Barry is an assault rifle disguised as a man and he sweeps anyone, whether he comes or not, who offends him. Adapted from Bogosian's play, "Talk Radio" is a vicious and scary adventure that will not let you down until it's too late. At that time, you became familiar with the fringe of racists, rapists, paranoid, murderers and simple murderers who listen, talk and hide in the darkness of the Dallas nights. <br /> <br /> Stone behaves himself, if it is still possible, leaving Bogosian to dominate every scene, from Barry's modest beginnings to the decisive point where his radio show can reach national syndication. The rest of the cast is consistently excellent as a lover and / or coworker who has all been used and set aside by Barry in common. <br /> <br /> The only thing I would change would be the recurring theme of the music, "Bad To The Bone". I would have used "Not Fragile" by Bachman-Turner Overdrive. A better song, a song I've never heard in a movie so far, and a catchy and unrelenting song whose sinister riff is the real soundtrack of Barry's life. <br /> <br /> Listen to me if you dare!
