I have never really been sure to like this documentary or not. It was broadcast on Channel 4 before a reduced version of Revelations and appears on the video tape of Revelations before the uninterrupted broadcast. The documentary is basically a friend of Bill who says how awesome he was for an hour with video clips from the show, much like a trailer of the movie you're about to watch. It also stars David Letterman crawling like a worm to throw Bill on his show before his death, the reason? Bill made a joke about how Pro-Life should organize funerals, and Letterman advertised for Pro-life. Anyway, watch the video because Revelations is a bill at its height :)
