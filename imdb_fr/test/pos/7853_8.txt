I thought Eastwood's most unusual role was The Bridges of Madison County, but it was until I saw The Beguiled. He managed to shoot, giving a very good performance, as well as the rest of the cast. The direction is imaginative since the film was shot in 1971 and there were no intrigues - which the director seems to have trouble hiding from time to time - we would talk about an excellent film. He remains powerful nevertheless. <br /> <br /> 8
