For those who are like me and who are used to watching and watching big-budget Hollywood movies, on huge screens with surround sound, this movie seems to be so distant. However, it surprised me to see how close he can be to any human while I look at him. It is so natural that you have the impression that no one has written a script or that no one has directed it. You are the director and you write the script while you watch it. For me, the time I spend watching a movie is the only time I go to another world. This film is the first sample for me that shows that it is not always essential to watch millions of dollars of budgeted films, but also surround sound capabilities to go to another world. This film sends you to another world (or perhaps brings you back to yourself) without millions of dollars in budget or technical capacity. I had the impression that I was reading L'Ã©tranger de Camus.
