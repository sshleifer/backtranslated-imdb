Movies are something you see on Saturday nights and you forget Sunday morning. Moving pictures are works of art that stick to you forever. Mishima belongs to this last category. This is the kind of thing that should win the Academy Awards, a brilliant visual film both depressing and uplifting. Rather than taking a direct look at Yukio Mishima's life, director Paul Schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories to give a glimpse of his last and last day on Earth, the day he tried to lead the way. Japanese army in the rebellion the emperor. Failing to do so, he commits a ritual suicide in an end that strikes you like a ton of bricks. The three adaptations of the new story allow us to take a look at what led to it and are presented in an experimental way, which makes them appear as filmed plays. Ken Ogata is beautiful like Mishima. Despite his eccentricities, he is very friendly, a man quite willing to die for his convictions and dies. This makes the ending much more devastating and the sense of loss more significant. Of the three adaptations, Golden Pavilion Temple, Kyoko House and Runaway Horses, this is the last one that is the strongest and the most moving. It is also the story that best fits Mishima's mood in his later years and illustrates what really led to the events of November 1970. This review can not be complete without a mention of the remarkable musical score of Philip Glass. Since 2001, no movie score has been a perfect complement to its visuals. Paul Schrader directed one of the finest films of the 1980s or any other decade. Have the handkerchiefs handy because the end will leave you in tears. Mishima: A life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes the film can still be a form of art and, as an art, it is brilliant.
