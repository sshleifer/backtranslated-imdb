The Man with the Golden Arm is one of the first films to focus on the tragedy of heroin addiction (and, in some ways, his message). It's far from a good film, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's dedication to making it real and at the limit of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked was that it's not really a junkie show (if you want the best presentation of this Naked Lunch reading, if you can get through anyway, other than the goal) but the nature of the urban environment that Frankie Machine lives. After leaving prison, he hopes to become a drummer in a band and legitimize him as a musician. But he has his wife "crippled", Zosch, who can not work and needs money and often complains. Then there is the old neighborhood. He can not escape the visit of Louie (Darren McGavin), who still plays card games in the back room. and, yes, push dope. Like Mean Streets, it's hard to escape minutiae unless you leave. <br /> <br /> But again, it's hard for Frankie Machine not to try to work naturally in this urban neighborhood. It's just that he can not escape the temptation of junk food (when he is indicted for theft with his friend, he sees a junkie panicking and he fears the fear of finding his own identity). And personifying Frankie is Sinatra, and I do not see anyone who could have played it, even the original Brando pick. He fits into the neighborhood and seems to be the kind of guy who should be one step ahead. But there is also a vulnerability to Sinatra: he's doing just fine, and by the time we see him becoming a "cold turkey" in Molly's apartment, it's credible even if it's not the kind of thing that "my" generation would think of heroin (ie Trainspotting and certainly Requiem for a Dream). If for nothing else, you want to watch the movie to see what happens to Sinatra as a character. <br /> <br /> The flaws, however, are found in some of the other performances, although it's a little tricky. Eleanor Parker seems to have been restless for a good part of the movie, deceiving Frankie that she is really paralyzed when in reality she can walk and cheat on him for one reason or another. But then, it becomes more and more clear: she is supposed to be crazy with jealousy and at this level, she begins to improve. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is good, even if she is not worthy of vertigo, as a possible girl in the side but rather as the voice of reason in the story. Then there is a detective Bendar, who could be one of the most remarkable characters / performances to date. And also Sparrow, Frankie's friend, and Louie and Schiefka's characters, and they're all played as one would expect (in fact, McGavin is better than OK). Preminger did not do a lot of things regarding Sinatra. And, frankly, some scenes fall flat. <br /> <br /> But the man with the golden arm fascinates a lot, and not only as a piece of outdated sociological interest. It works like a compelling drama and as a message conveyed without being a preacher or camper. It is an authentic article, but not exceptional.
