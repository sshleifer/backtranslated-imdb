I did not see this movie before it was broadcast on television because I doubted comic books. Since the series "Batman", "Spawn", "Judge Dredd" and many other pitiful bombs of 13 years, I dodged everything at all costs. I wondered in my mind, "Why can not someone make a movie rated R that stays true to the story, is it difficult?" And finally, my prayers were answered with Blade. This film comes out of the pages on the screen with pure violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, good against evil, etc. Yeah, many action movies contain all these candies, and most have been bombed. But not Blade, the film was shot just right, without going too far, offering a good length and never a boring moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real movies I've seen in a long time.
