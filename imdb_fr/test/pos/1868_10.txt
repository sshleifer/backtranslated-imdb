This sitcom attracted a lot of people from 1984 to 1985. It was a time when people could see deserted streets in most overcrowded Indian cities as soon as there were sitcoms on Indian television screens. All of this is the result of the creation of television relay stations throughout the Indian nation. This was one of the essential elements of the strategy of modernization of the Indian television network adopted by the late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. She was also sued by her son Rajiv Gandhi. This series offered captivating entertainment that a large majority of Indian viewers were watching on their black and white TVs. What is curious about this series is that it was sponsored by an Aboriginal company specializing in Ayurvedic products. A few days ago, I saw some episodes of this series, but the global equation of laughter was missing. This may prove that the time spent with the entertainment equipment loses its charm and sticks to people's minds.
