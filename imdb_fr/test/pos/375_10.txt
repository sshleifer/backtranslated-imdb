When Alfred Hitchcock made FOREIGNERS ON A TRAIN, the fact that the bulk of the film was made public announced that he was back at the peak of his form. From 1946 to 1950, his films were not a box office success, and his contract with David O. Selznick ended for this reason. In fact, he made very good films at the time, such as NOTORIOUS, SPELLBOUND, UNDER CAPRICORN, ROPE and (in my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. Although NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND are appreciated, Hitch's attempts at experimentation have diverted the audience: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable, as was the context for psychiatrists. But the experience with long ROPE shots baffled the audience (ignoring the merits of this film), and Hitch's willingness to let the public cheated on a lie told by a main character in a flashback was hated - well more hated than she deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. UNDER CAPRICORN was badly chosen (it was published when the scandal of his star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) suggested that it was a failure (which was not the case). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that has really little success. <br /> <br /> With Strangers on a train, Hitchcock fled maneuvers that interested him in recent movies. Instead, he focused on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story told how professional tennis player Guy Haines met one of his fans, Bruno Anthony, a playboy, who was traveling in a cross train at the same time as the athlete . Bruno is chatty and talkative, and Guy sees him as one of the fans he's met ... even though he's a little eccentric, he's talking about wanting to be the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows everything about Guy's personal problems. He is married to Miriam, a mischievous young woman, and is in love with Anne Morton, daughter of a senator. Bruno knows that Miriam will not divorce with her famous husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather, who constantly criticizes him. Then Bruno mentions (in an informal way) an idea he has about two men - technically foreign - who exchange murders and then commit two perfect and insoluble crimes instead of fiddling with them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees that it's an interesting idea. The train arrives to Guy and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the eccentric Bruno is a sociopath and thinks that Guy has just accepted that the two men are killing each other! <br /> <br /> It's actually a wonderfully simple plot. Bruno, of course, kills Miriam, but he really expects Guy to respect the murder agreement and kill his father-in-law. Guy is horrified - and even worse, he discovers he is the main suspect in the police department. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, mentions that he has the lighter of the latter (he pocketed him on the train) and that he can plant him on the scene of the murder, Guy is facing deeper problems: how to avoid the police and control (if possible) the crazy Bruno? <br /> <br /> Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully, so that from the beginning, we saw our two "heroes" on the same footing towards their fateful meeting on the train. There are constant cross-contacts in the film to show how the two men are drawn into their orbits. It's as if destiny brought them together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch, with a typical twist, makes Bruno's crazy character more attractive. His stratagem can be vicious (he will kill two people if he succeeds and he will enforce the agreement at any cost), but he has a taste for life. It's been suspected that Guy had one, but the failure of his marriage, coupled with the fact that he now went to a socially-known woman, made him more cautious and duller than he was. <br /> <br /> The casting is good too. Robert Walker probably had his best role in this film (only a year before his death). It was very far from the SIDCE YOU home boy went (e) or the clock. Her supple figure also seemed quite elegant in tales in several scenes. Guy Farley Granger behaves like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE, especially since circumstances make him increasingly suspicious of the authorities (while his former role made his nervous behavior more and more more suspicious of Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies, Kasie Rogers is just sluttish like Miriam - which allows the audience to be prepared for her disappearance (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her glasses) in order to really encourage Bruno in his diabolical act . Patricia Hitchcock appears as Anne's younger sister (Ruth Roman), who looks a lot like Miriam and accidentally triggers Bruno at a social event. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman supports Granger, but her role is limited because she is established in her community and quite discreet. The other supportive interpreters, Leo G. Caroll as Senator, Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's chick mother, and Norma Varden as the unplanned recipient of Walker's violence are all highlighted, the all in the hand of a master.
