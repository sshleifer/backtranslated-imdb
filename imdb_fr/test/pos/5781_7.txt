I was very lucky this year to have seen several films at the art museum of my university. On occasion, well, more often than half the time, I'm unable to watch the movies there. I always tried to watch each of the movies I missed. So far the plagues and pleasures on the sea of ​​Salton and who killed the electric car? are the other movies I had to watch this way. The film tackles an intriguing subject and is well theorized (emphasis on this point later) but it is not as successful as Plagues and Pleasures, but far superior to the electric car. <br /> <br /> The film's thesis concerns the future of the American concept of life in the suburbs. He questions the feasibility of such a practice when oil prices rise. The film deals with the origin of the suburbs and its evolution until the early 2000s. One of the themes in the film is the alienation created by the suburbs among its inhabitants. Many people can live together, but they do not know each other when we define the word. For me, this represents the strength of the film: its attraction to real human emotion. We are able to understand the argument of filmmakers so much more easily because they do not have to convince us of the legitimacy of their argument. It's also one of the reasons why Salton Sea is such a wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Suburbia loses her firebrand explanation message in support of her central argument. As the interviewees speak, their arguments are more and more similar to those of environmental activists. We are told that oil production will reach its peak during this decade, but no scientific proof (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc.) will be provided to support this assertion. We are given little information on how this date was calculated. Fortunately, this is the only major flaw I was able to detect in the film's argumentation, but it is nevertheless blatant. Another less important difference that I noticed is the liberal (political) bias that could polarize some viewers. However, this bias is revealed by detailed clips of various events and not by the filmmakers themselves. The clips, especially those of the 50s, seemed a little useless. The film was not better with their presence and would have been more concise in their absence. <br /> <br /> While I was thinking more about this film before composing this review, I wondered why I found his argument more convincing than other documentaries I had recently watched. Finally, I realized that the filmmakers offered an analysis of the problem of the suburbs. They propose a decentralized village system where groups of people would live together. They argue that this practice would reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce waste of space. They define wasted space as long distances between shopping areas, for example. What is incredible in this hypothesis is that it is really conceivable. Most documentaries vaguely say that some problems need to be solved, but there is no way to do it. Thinking more about the film, I decided that this analysis is what saved me the film and why I gave it a favorable review. <br /> <br /> Although its presentation is neither perfectly convincing nor fluid, The End of Suburbia is a profitable investment of its time. It not only addresses the current problem of urban sprawl, but also gives a realistic view of how to change it. The public can also benefit from high production value through various clips from the 1950s associated with modern arguments. People living in Atlanta, Georgia or the Triad region of North Carolina will particularly appreciate this documentary, as urban sprawl is the most established in the region.
