I have the impression that Lisa Krueger is easy to forget. I personally found that his first film, Manny and Lo (1996), was a wonderfully detailed character study and the performances were consistently marvelous (with a special credit for Mary Kay Place). The film was played for a week or two in major urban centers and disappeared. One or two critics really liked it, but many thought it was light. Krueger's second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (almost two years late) and has also disappeared. Once again, critics described the film as lightweight and dismissed it, praising Heather Graham's screen presence, but rarely her acting ability. And again, for me, Committed is a solid success. I feel that Krueger has an authentic voice and a personal visual style. These are traits that should not be ignored so easily, simply because she works on a very limited canvas. <br /> <br /> The title has several meanings. , but it's mostly Joline's (Graham) refusal to let her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) crash and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most attractive stalkers in recent film history. Her respect for her marriage vows leads her to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And yes, the plot is as simple and easy to ignore. <br /> <br /> Joline, of course, is the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate close to 50%. And for me, his personal revolution against unfulfilled promises and a legacy of deceit is quite intelligent and powerful. Confident in the belief that people simply do not believe enough in themselves, Joline must inevitably discover that her beliefs are not in tune with those of society in general. Several comments about her have spoken of her character as one-dimensional and I fear that it is a simplistic reading of the film. Or maybe even a bad reading. If Joline was just an innocent, she would not be interesting at all. It is the fact that she understands the world and refuses to respect the rules of "normal" that makes it so interesting. Sociologically, she is completely deviant. <br /> <br /> Krueger sometimes falls into moments of piquant dialogue and the orientation of this film is rather strange, she relies too much on the images of clouds moving across the El skyline Paso. However, his mistakes are quite rare and in this film, as in Manny and Lo, it is the performances that carry the day. Graham has never been so good because she has never had a character as well suited to her as Joline. For the first time in his career, Graham seems to be comfortable in the role of an adult, even in a slightly arrested development. She is wearing the film perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother) both have good times, as do Alfonso Arau as Mexican Mystic and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, the slightly psychotic truck driver. As in Manny and Lo, the characters are part of their environment, with very detailed and totally organic creations. These characters can sometimes seem unnecessarily bizarre, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist stoked by Joline's devotion, fits in a strange way, even if one never discusses his character. <br /> <br /> For me, it's a film that takes depth. Another speaker spoke of stereotypical representations of Mexico. And again, I'm tempted to call it a misreading. Joline seeks self-justification. She knows that her commitment is out of control, but she looks for any spiritual avenue that can help her understand herself. The character of Arau understands that most people do not believe in him and he plays his own faith when he sees a woman who respects him. <br /> <br /> I guess I can understand how this film could be considered disappointing. I just do not agree. It's always funny, often hilarious, and all the characters radiate a heat that is quite wonderful. <br /> <br /> I give this one a 7.5 / 10 and when I connect to the vote here, it'll go up to an 8.
