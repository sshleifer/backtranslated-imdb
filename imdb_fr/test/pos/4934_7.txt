It's a great movie! It's funny for everyone, even adults. We have Jason Voorhees / Leatherface as a killer in this movie, along with other wacky characters. Very funny movie, for children of all ages. Must be rented every time we went to the video store! Buster and Babs make a good pair and must love the duck. He is probably my favorite character! I have never been great on TV, but this movie reminds me so many good memories. To see for families, fans of the show or anyone! Nice, no matter how big or how old you are! RENT IT NOW IN YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE! <br /> <br /> P.S. NEED A DVD PUBLICATION!
