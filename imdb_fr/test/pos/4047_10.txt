It may be one of my favorite movies. It tells the story of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother very young, so she was bought by her father. She falls in love with the groom named Kai. However, on her birthday, the Snow Queen (Bridget Fonda) comes to the hotel owned by her father and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then pursues Kai and follows him in all four seasons in hopes of saving him. <br /> <br /> I thought it was an excellent adaptation of the story with excellent performances from all the actors. It has wonderful special effects and the story blends very well and is easy to follow. I think it's a great movie for the whole family. I watched it every time since its release and I never got tired of it, which is why I gave it a 10!
