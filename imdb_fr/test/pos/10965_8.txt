1st seen 26/08/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-John Cassavetes): Cassavetes' first well-made independent films have presented a style very different from what Hollywood shows to its audience. This film also featured some very taboo topics, especially the racism that probably prevailed throughout the country but was not shown by the mostly white filmmakers of the time. Of the only black actors who had a lot of respect at the time, there were those who acted and displayed a personality similar to that of whites (aka Sidney Poitier). In addition, the idea of ​​ending a film without really concluding the relationship that has begun leaves many moviegoers stunned but actually allows viewers to realize that life is like that (it continues ...). I prefer this kind of ending, because it makes you think more about the characters and what might happen later and the conclusions are not just presented to you. The film follows the lives of people (especially two people who have a brief relationship and who have opposite skin colors). We then look at what happens when the White realizes what he did. This is very well done and makes the film very special. The acting is supposed to be improvised, which makes the movie even more amazing. I guess you can say that I liked this movie, if you can not say it. If you can find it, take a look at this classic classic of the first independent films.
