You wear only the best Italian Armani costumes, sewn by hand and adjusted to your measurements. Your car is the best that German engineering can offer. It is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood. You are a member of the best polo clubs, dine often in restaurants such as Spago and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch also serves as a nuclear explosive, while your trusty pen can also be used as a .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol. You ski in the Alps, dive into the Caribbean, into the Andes, and your hair is never out of place. You are Bond, James Bond, the most famous spy in the world, the favorite son of the good queen, the bad boy of the British SS and perhaps the most desired man in the world. The character of James Bond was created by Ian Fleming. It is the most sustainable icon in the film industry, with more than fifteen films covering more than forty years. Pierce Brosnan was the last to play this role. In 1996, he succeeded Timothy Dalton for James Bond and debuted at Goldeneye. developed by a third party on the Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. Its dominant position in the sales charts is testament to the quality of this game. No library of reviews would be complete without that. <br /> <br /> Let's face it: most licensed movie games are flopped. Although both appear to be a good mix, the results have been mostly horrendous. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, not to mention all Star Trek flops, are ample against this mix. And for the record, I'm not a fan of licensed movies, especially if I've seen the movie before. At least that's what I used to think. In the case of Goldeneye, I had more reserves than usual. Although it was not a bad film, Goldeneye did not interest him, and I do not rank him in Bond's top 10 films. However, as a game, let's say it's a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is a first-person shooter, and to be successful, you will need at least as much brains as muscles. . For those who have seen the film, which I suppose to be most of you, read this story, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the film with little variation. Goldeneye, a plot to control the most dangerous satellite in the world, began in the USSR. A beautiful woman was captured. Your missions will be numerous, the extreme danger. You will have to rely on your intelligence and experience to carry out the most challenging missions the world has ever known. M will inform you as soon as you are ready. Have a good day, James.
