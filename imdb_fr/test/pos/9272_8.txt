Do you remember Greg the rabbit? It's this show that started on the independent film channel, but has turned into a full-fledged sitcom on Fox. My cousin and I found it very funny, beyond the early idea that puppets use TV-PG material. Puppets that kill occur in a similar universe, where puppets live in the same world as people and, like us, hold a job and lead their own lives. Let's just say that if you can not handle that, then do not worry about watching PWK, because this show is a portrait of 4 puppets that have become obsolete by drug addiction, hedonism and violent crime to end up in half. final. house of passage. There is a lot of violence, sex and bad language (so that it is never broadcast on American television). As if the sociopathic puppetry was not enough, the fact that it happens in Canada makes the situation even more disturbing (in fact, the government pays for it), and I think any American viewer would require more of that type of feed. I do not know where you can get it in the United States, beyond the extra satellite TV, but I would advise you to try it. Really funny things. (It is broadcast on the Comedy Network in Canada)
