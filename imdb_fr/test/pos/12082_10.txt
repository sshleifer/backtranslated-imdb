Who will love my children changed my heart, it made me cry all the way, the more I cried with was when the family had to say goodbye to the baby, I cried the most with that, and every Once a child was adopted, I cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother, it was sad for them to lose their mother, I had pity on the child with epilepsy, He was happy that he had been adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. For me, this boy I thought was special because he was going to a house. I feel that I am special because I am in a world with Asperger's syndrome and sometimes when I feel downcast, I sometimes cry. I really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. A true story, very good. I think another movie that would make you cry would be Tuesday with With Morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
