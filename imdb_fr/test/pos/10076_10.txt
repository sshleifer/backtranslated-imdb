I loved this film. You can not buy it, rent it or find it ... but it's a guardian. <br /> <br /> A wonderful chemistry between Braccho and Walken ... and Ferrar .... <br /> <br /> Terrific action and non-stop reactions .... I loved it. <br /> <br /> I've watched my pirated copy maybe 6 times over the last decade ... every time showing it to someone who has never heard of it. <br /> <br /> Find this film and watch it. <br /> <br /> So many movies are on TV again and again - without the spirit or style of this little movie. <br /> <br /> I did not know it was made for television. .. my copy is an 8 titles that I hacked years ago ... I hope it will last.
