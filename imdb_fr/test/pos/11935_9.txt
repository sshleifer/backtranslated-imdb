It's one of the best "Bloke" movies of the early '90s and, even if it's slightly dated, it's one of those movies that would never be shot today, which makes it very special! In fact, a very similar movie called "Masterminds" was shot in the 90s. It was a PG variant on the same theme, but it was not nearly as fun and realistic about it. <br /> <br /> so special about this film? It's the comrade between the main characters and the theme of the film against all odds. Sean Astin is very friendly and has played in some of the most memorable films of the 80s / 90s, including "The Goonies". He also tackled bigger things with "Rudy" and "The Lord of the Rings", but "Encino Man" is a good trip in the past. Will Wheaton of "Stand by Me" supports the film and Andrew Divoff is a villain. Louis Gossett Jr sleepwalks in his role, but he adds a conciseness to the film, especially his relationship with the rebellious nature of Astin. <br /> <br /> So, how is the action? According to current standards, it's rather tedious and cheap, almost like a TV movie, but the production values ​​are good and the violence is actually quite unpleasant for a film involving school children. However, the director compensates the limited budget with a few moments of suspense and a well-placed humor. <br /> <br /> So park your brain at the door and enjoy this action movie, but do not expect gear for Oscar!
