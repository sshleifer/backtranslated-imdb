I caught this movie after a tape that I used to capture a movie that I really wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually a little entertaining and it brought me back into the "machine of the way" to the wacky movies that Hollywood shot in the sixties, a bit like the current Austin Powers. Oh, the acting was not great, nor the plot, but it was worth the look. There were delightful landscapes, although Mrs. Welch provided the most pleasant of such. Tap it if you have the opportunity and look at it when you have absolutely nothing else to do. It's not a snoozer, but it will not make you roll in the aisles too.
