At first I found it really shocking to see William Shakespeare's masterpiece of love being reworked into a gore, violent and perverted film adaptation. But after watching it once, you feel a second and a third time, when you learn the shock and start enjoying the film on its own merit: solid acting, good dialogue, beautiful sequence and choreography. soundtrack not too bad and some of the (special) effects that continue. Oh, and also the end. What a riot!
