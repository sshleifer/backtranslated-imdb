Following an assault at Grand Central Station in New York, an innocent witness (Kevin Spacey, "The Usual Suspects") is arrested by police who believe he is under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We can understand why they think this, given the way the man politely informed them that he was wearing his dark glasses because "the light on your planet is really bright". And so Prot (as he identifies himself, pronounced as rhyme with "goat") is sent to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, where a doctor stuffed with workaholic, Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, "The Big Lebowski "), Tries to understand the so-called illusion of this man. <br /> <br /> Prot's manners are courteous and cooperative. When asked why he thinks he has been institutionalized, he says it's because "you think I'm crazy". Within minutes, after satisfying his insatiable thirst for Earth-fruit, the fully transparent Prot revealed that he was an alien of the planet K-PAX, located 1000 light-years away, surrounding the Agape binary star system and Satori located at the Lyra constellation. He also explains how his infinitely more advanced species has already mastered faster displacements than light, thanks to the control of the energy of light, an accomplishment that would have been much worse for the human race. <br /> <br /> Powell is understandable. He is very skeptical about these outrageous claims, though he is fascinated and committed to understanding how Prot came to believe them. Meanwhile, Prot uses his time to observe his colleagues in the psychiatric ward, finally offering everyone around him something to live and hope for treatment. On July 27, Prot later said he would leave for K-PAX and he could only take one human with him. Nobody knows exactly what will happen on that date. <br /> <br /> Initially scheduled to play Dr. Powell ?? with Will Smith as Prot ?? Kevin Spacey entered the lead role when Smith had to withdraw from the film. You can say that he had a lot of fun with his character and that his sometimes ridiculous dialogue ("Your product alone was worth the detour") was delivered with a lot of realism, which often provoked a sincere laugh. There is an undeniable intelligence behind a lot of Prot's words, but logic maintains that it must be delusional ... right? <br /> <br /> The public is trained between the possibilities ?? for the first segment of the film, we almost accept the possibility that Prot is an extraterrestrial (it's a sci-fi movie, is not it ?!), before being totally convinced when Prot displays an inexplicable knowledge of the astronomy of a newly discovered planet system. Dr. Powell's latest investigation provides us with an earthly explanation that is perfectly packed for Prot's delusions, but it's just as quickly blown away and we let ourselves be scratched again. The film, rightly, keeps its end open, letting the audience contemplate what he has just watched and discuss it with his entourage. Nevertheless, whether you believe that Prot is a stranger or not, two irresistible certainties remain in your mind: the Universe is indeed a fascinating place and there may be higher forces that we humans have not yet discoveries.
