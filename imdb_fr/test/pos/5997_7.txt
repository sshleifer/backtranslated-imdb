This version of Gulliver's stories is really weird. The production adds a story of setting (that's what makes it famous) Gulliver's return to his wife and son. In a view, it is incredibly long and sometimes lacks attention, but the strange images and diversified distribution will keep you looking for. Mary Steenburgen does the best job of distribution. Danson seems a little out of place with his American accent. The asylum as a whole is extremely disturbing, but it is nevertheless interesting and holds well for Gulliver's travels. The character of Danson seems really crazy, however ... he should have worked to be a little more believable for everyone, in my opinion. Also confusing goes from the present to the past. Does anyone else think that Yahoos are the ugliest things that have ever existed on a television screen? Confusing, sometimes boring, but still highlighted by some good actors, great visual effects and some nice parts. NBC's first film among many event films by Robert Halmi, Sr. See for yourself how you will play, but I give it * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
