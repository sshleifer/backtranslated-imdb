This is by far one of the best biographies of recent times. I'm going to put it there with Ray and The Aviator. This is the story of a young bi-racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the incredible Miss Rachael, aka "Nanny". You will fall in love with Nanny, a woman who gives herself to everyone around her. S. Epatha Merkerson gives the character a magnificent life and the other members of the cast do the same. If I had to congratulate each actor for the way they played their roles, I should mention everyone in the cast. <br /> <br /> The music of this film integrates perfectly with the story, dictates almost its course. And besides, this film is really entertaining. It will not bother you at all, not even a minute! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone wishing to spend an evening at home watching a quality movie, very intelligent and entertaining.
