This comment was written by someone who read it (many times) and who knows what it is about! First, I read other reviews and found that some of the objections were really stupid. The people who read the book and the other Jane Austens or, in this case, any good book, will know that it is vital to stick to the book, it is essential to trust an author for what he does. If the viewer does not like this because he sticks to the book, it shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and are obviously not a real fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, if the viewer really liked the book or Jane Austen in general, watching it for four hours should not be difficult. Secondly, their society was very interested in appearance, and such voluminous and elegant hairstyles showed how rich you were, which in their day was a determining factor in the quality of life in society. I must admit that the women's costumes were not brilliant, but there were only a few bad and men compensated, this prejudice for the navy not wearing their uniform is ridiculous! They wore their uniforms away from school or work because they wore casual clothes and it was the same in the 19th century. Also, when it happens, the acting is very good, it's subtle because that's how Jayne Austen writes! and the scene at the end is beautiful. You can not compare the filming to that of the 1995 version, because the technology has improved so much since it is ridiculous to compare them. The actress who plays Ann is too old but her acting act and how she makes up for it. <br /> <br /> People seem to prefer the 1995 version for a reason that I can not understand! It does not stick to the book at all, so it's flat, the end is sentimental, they change major scenes, the only good actors are the main actors and I did them well, what they did. Obviously, people who really like, are (I'm sorry) stupid because they do not understand persuasion and so need it to be exaggerated. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, was written by an excellent screenwriter (the same as Inspector Morse), had very good actors and it's really a film that you can watch several times and during which you can be delighted.
