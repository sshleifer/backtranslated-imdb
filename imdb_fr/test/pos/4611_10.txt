This is a great example of making unhindered movies at its best. Richard Greene (who is doing well in the role) in search of his two missing friends, takes him to the Black Forest estate and to the castle of the one-eyed Count Bruno (Stephen McNally), one of his past enemies that he has never seen face to face. The incredible movie has so many awesome elements combined (for once) in one movie - a crocodile pit; a heavy mute (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.); a cunning doctor (played by Boris Karloff); a leopard hunt (VERY well done and VERY atmospheric); a love story; a castle; a fight with the sword; a sadistic count with one eye and his two diabolical accomplices (interpreted by John Hoyt and Michael Pate !!!); an intriguing story that makes the movie even more interesting; and more!. Jerry Sackheim's script does not let up - make a hugely commendable movie for all unlimited moviegoers with a twist of horror and a special atmosphere.
