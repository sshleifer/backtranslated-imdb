The Universal Studios version of "Flipper" (1996) is a great film comforting for the whole family with good values ​​and sentimentality. This is the story of Sandy Ricks, a Chicago teenager reluctantly spending her holidays with her uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas. This ultimately changes the lives of teenagers and he grows up in the process. He learns to appreciate nature and respect the environment. I grew up in the 1960s and NBC's "Flipper" TV show was my favorite childhood show. Elijah Wood is perfectly interpreted as a Sandy Ricks of the 1990s and gives an excellent performance. As much as I loved the NBC television show and MGM feature films with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I loved this feature, the best! I think Elie Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. As far as Luke Halpin is concerned, I think Elijah Wood has more than a range of acting skills and is more of an actor, which makes her performance excellent and more credible. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor who works in movies today. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the screenplay and did a great job as a writer and director of this film. Paul Hogan gives a comical and friendly performance as Sandy's Uncle Porter Ricks. Mr. Hogan's performance perfectly offsets Elijah's role as Sandy. I am a big fan of underwater movies. This film was beautifully shot in the Bahamas as "Thunderball" (1965 UA). The director of photography was Bill Butler A.S.C. who focused the movie "Jaws" in 1975. Mr. Butler is a very talented filmmaker. The director of underwater photography was Pete Romano. He did a superb job with underwater cinematography. I enjoyed the movie music of Joel McNeely. This good score featured Crosby, Stills and Nash among other talented artists. This movie was shot in Panavision as "Thunderball" with a 2.35: 1 aspect ratio. If possible, try to see this movie in a scopes-like version originally made by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. Another very interesting thing is that Mr. Shapiro entrusted to the original "Sandy Ricks" (Luke Halpin) a small role in this remake. He portrayed Bounty Fisherman # 3 in this film. It was a very kind gesture from Mr. Shapiro! As you can see, I'm a real fan of this movie. Unfortunately, the majority of film critics have encountered hard words in this beautiful movie. Originally, I had seen this film on May 31, 1996 at my birthday in a movie theater. It meant a lot to me. I have it on many video versions. The VHS versions are in "pan and scan". The laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have a 2.35: 1 VCD from Hong Kong that is "letterboxed". But my most precious possession is a 16mm "original" film copy that I will cherish all my life! Thank you Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan and everyone involved for making a memorable film for me! <br /> <br /> P.S. I must add that the quality of the universal DVD is superb! It's the best DVD in terms of quality I've ever seen. The color and resolution are spectacular. The soundtrack is great. I think Universal must have used the same transfer for the DVD as for the laserdisc version. The 35mm format is "mint" and Alan's film really looks great. A beautiful tribute to a magnificent movie! The resolution of the DVD is even higher than the quality of the laserdisc! It's just spectacular! Thank you Universal Home Video for its excellent quality control and transfer. Thank you very much for doing a superb job on this family film. Thanks also to Alan for all your extreme kindness to me !!! It's a real honor to know you !!!
