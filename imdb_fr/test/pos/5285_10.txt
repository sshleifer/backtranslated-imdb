Even since the beginning of the title of this film, I really like the works of art and the canvas of one of the national islands of Japan. We see large green hills and eastern houses of a coastal town. Instantly, we watch the beauty of the Pacific on the big screen of the theater. And to prove how awesome this movie is, I have to say that Charles Darwin would be proud. Teachers of evolution classes and school science such as biology would prefer fantastic Hayao Miyazaki's new film "Ponyo". As you will see, the main character is perhaps the icon par excellence of media animation, whether in classrooms or auditoriums. <br /> <br /> In addition to the scientific aspect, dive into the blue waters of this exciting story. We have a lean, old and powerful wizard named Fujimoto, who lives in a submarine and is cynical about the urban expansion of humanity and the pollution of their industrial waste. He wants to have complete control of the seas and the pretty, peaceful aquatic life, including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood is half human and half amphibious, is both an anti-hero and an ocean-loving antagonist; similar to the nasty James Bond Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved which operates an underwater city called Atlantis. <br /> <br /> His daughter, whom he treats like a pet, is called Ponyo. It's a big goldfish that already looks like a pretty red-haired girl. The father banishes her from the real human world, the dangerous pretender, and too difficult to manage. But frankly, Ponyo's exploratory curiosity is as strong as his love nature. Finally, fortified, similar to the wonderful scenes of Nick Park's "Chicken Run", she frees herself from the rocky and fossilized aquatic city of her father and swims to the surface of the water of Japan. She falls into the attentive hands of a young oil tanker captain named Sosuke. <br /> <br /> Sosuke lives in an oceanfront home on a beautiful beach (or a rocky beach), has two overworked parents, an elderly housewife, Lisa, and the first mate of a Koichi tanker barge. Lisa seems to be angry at his wife for being out aboard a ship and giving him all the housework. Even more, Ponyo's black magic provokes a chain of apocalyptic events: the Moon approaches the Earth too close to the Earth and waves emerge from the imbalance of tidal interaction forces, and huge waves of tsunami devastate. the peaceful city but evacuated. . However, what seems to underestimate this curse and seem literally more powerful than the supernatural power, is the love and friendship tightly knotted between the child captain Sosuke and the adorable red-headed Ponyo, who wants to be a sensitive man, not just a preserved fish. Like the hobbits with curly hair and free spirit in The Lord of the Rings, Ponyo reminds me of a light reminder. <br /> <br /> I could write again and again on this amazing animated film, the best since "Coraline" which was in theaters in February. And now, Hayao Miyazaki, feast your eyes on another 10-star rank from your animation fan, Graham Abraham. The year 2009 could be filled with dozens of animated films; However, Ponyo is the most imposing film of many environmental beauties and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world.
