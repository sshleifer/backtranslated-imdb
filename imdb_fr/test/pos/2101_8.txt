For those of you who have wondered what a movie of art and test monsters might look like, do not worry anymore. The DAIMAJIN trilogy, circa 1966, is one of them. More epics of the samurai era than anything else, these three films also present one of the most monstrous (and literally) two and machines of all time. There is not a single facet of these jewels that is unpolished, from the screenplay to performances and the filmmaker's know-how. Even special effects are handled with a skill well above average and are integrated (in most cases) almost seamlessly into the movie (s). If you are a fan of GOJIRA or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just loves a good movie, whatever its genre, I highly recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
