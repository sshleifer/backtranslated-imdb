I'm writing this after just seeing the last episode aired in the UK, and for me, maintaining the standard must be hard work. The latest episode, entitled "Blink", contains elements of Gothic horror, all related to statues that are not quite what they seem. The Doctor and Martha do not seem much, but it does not detract from a well-designed episode. The general standard has reached a high standard and the last three episodes, both parter with "The Family" and the latest have been the best that the current team has ever made. <br /> <br /> This is not David Tennant just keeps on, all the secondary distribution week after week also helps. For those who are waiting for series 3 abroad, the wait is worth it.
