This film reminds me a lot of the latest Rock Hudson movie, MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT, which tells the story of a fishing writer who has NEVER fished and is forced to participate in a fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart writer who does not know how to cook and who does not really have the perfect family that she describes in her articles - in fact, she does not have a family at all. Like Rock, she is maneuvered to play - in this case, create a huge holiday dinner during her country holidays. Since there is no family, she takes a veteran and some friends home and tries desperately not to "let the cat get out of the bag" so that she can not do any of the things for which she is known. A cute little comedy and a welcome movie for the annual holiday movie programming.
