Watching "The Bed of Death: The Bed Eating" is like waking up in the hospital, after two days of suicide, disorienting, but strangely stimulating. Few cinematographic equivalent to this disturbing but often humorous lesson of mythology, morality and surrealist ideology. <br /> <br /> "The Blood of a Poet" by Cocteau and the experimental works of Maya Deren evoke a taste for the strange atmosphere found in DEATH BED. Angela Carter's adult fairy tales, a genius of literature, and the troubling stories of Unica <br /> Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED has many recognizable elements of the past <br /> but displays a unique and original story. <br /> <br /> As a story, DEATH BED is a surprisingly simple and original vision <br /> <br /> that only one release out of a thousand will succeed. This unpretentious film has its technical flaws but overcomes them all with a cast of beautiful non-actors and <br /> <br /> and scary places lost - a true independent classic from the 1970s. <br /> <br /> > DEATH BED also displays a unique and subversive three-dimensional personality - a deep and continuous superimposition of dream images and ideas that gives it a "fun-house" style of construction. The passage of time told in the stories of return and historical travel stories, the bed to his sinister dark humor, the symbolism both rich and sober used in his images. The most satisfying is the image of Aubrey Beardsly, the suffering artist, imprisoned forever in his own painting while commenting and caressing with the murdered "victim" "offerings" offered to him as offerings of love by the madman's spirit. - A sick chorus and a wonderful element / metaphor for "trapped artist" - Nothing but the weirdest POE or MALLARME can match that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who values ​​the spirit of independent cinema and aspires to a multi-level symbolist experience, or to the surrealist concept of "convulsive beauty" and Gothic inclinations Low-budget films to dig this very unique vision. A simple and funny film with deliciously deep psychic currents. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. *****
