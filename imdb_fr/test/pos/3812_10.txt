Let's start with this point: it's not a movie for the general public. Quite bizarre, somehow incomprehensible, totally unpredictable, it prevents you from looking at the screen to try to understand what will happen next. If that does not make you think it's a great movie, come back to your "family" movies and forget about MOTORAMA. It has material to be considered a cult film, it can be classified in the same category as the award-winning films in Cannes or other film festivals, but, unfortunately, Hollywood has already dropped, simply because it is not commercial. The performance of the young Jordan Christopher Michael is perhaps not an Oscar film, but it gives the good touch to the story. Even the genre is difficult to describe; it's not a comedy strictly speaking, you do not know if you're supposed to laugh at the strange situations in which Gus is involved. It's more like an impossible adventure that some kids might want to have, but do not let them watch it either ... it's not a children's movie. So, if you like Disney movies or are looking for a "Home Alone" style, this one is definitely not for you. But if you like to read Edgar Alan Poe or the works of Tim Burton, then you will love Motorama. So, jump into your red Mustang, get a tattoo spelling "Tora" and cross Strangeland with Gus. I would like that...
