I absolutely, positively liked the movie. I just saw it and I can not wait to see it on DVD. It is a beautifully designed masterpiece. I am always amazed by the complex work of Ghibli Studios. <br /> <br /> Other people commented that Sosuke called Risa by his first name. He never calls his father by his first name unless he tells someone else. I did not get the impression that Risa was his mother. This has never even been mentioned or implied by anyone. It is obvious that she is his mother-in-law. That's why he makes her promise to go home and why he's so upset when he finds his car empty. His mother must have died when he was very small because he mentions being cared for by Risa. This is in addition to the fact that his father is often at sea, which explains his problems of abandonment. Everyone is also talking about its maturity. This usually happens when a child loses a parent.
