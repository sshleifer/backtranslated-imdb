How to make this film not more widely considered, it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> I picked it up for Â£ 1, and I do not exaggerate saying it's the best book I've ever spent. a movie. <br /> <br /> What usually leaves movies on the club stage is the actual music or scenes shot in clubland. <br /> <br /> Here, music and club scenes are completely believable, using some great tunes of the time, and filmed in real clubs, with people who seem to want to be there. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are of a high level, although Jason Donovan in particular for me stands out (he played Frank N Furter in the Rocky Horror Show of London around the time when shooting had to take place, so his drag phase was at full throttle!), and of course Tim Curry, who is eloquent Drug Land Boss is convincing. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are a fan of British film, you have to see it, it does not matter if you like the club, because the movie is strong eno ugh like a story when even. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
