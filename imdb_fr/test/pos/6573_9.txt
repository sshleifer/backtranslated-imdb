When I first saw this movie's poster, I cast it as another low-budget film for young people. A few days later, when the film finally arrived in the theaters, a friend of mine told me it was a good one. <br /> <br /> A year later, the first time I saw the ad that Anand was going to be shown on television and the moment finally came, as I changed channels, I stopped watching a movie and lo and behold, I watched the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And right now, 3 years later, I watched the movie at least 7 to 8 times and I do not really watch movies again and again! <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it tries to be different, while all Telugu movies were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights. <br /> <br /> It's a simple film, a little slow but a very captivating scenario, the film has no end, dialogues very well paid, which is really very difficult to <br /> <br /> The music is both classic and soothing, great performances of Radha Krishnan, some great kirtanas are also part of the film, throughout the film. <br /> Cinematography deserves mention. The montage is not smooth, but suits a romantic film like this one. <br /> <br /> But what really strikes you in this film is two things: 1. The way each scene was treated with the greatest respect, the now famous Shekar Kammula. <br /> <br /> 2. The beautiful words of Veturi. <br /> <br /> And one last thing deserves a special mention, Kamalini, part of his success attributed to Sunitha, for having lent him such a beautiful voice, really, the voice does wonders me. <br /> <br /> The other actors are also good, Raja in the main character and the little girl, and the way she screams when she has a new dog. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can tell you that this film is about to become another classic with these old romantic classics, as well as Godavari, another classic-romantic Kammula.
