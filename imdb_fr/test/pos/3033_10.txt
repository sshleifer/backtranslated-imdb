Great story of a dedicated young teacher teaching minority children in a region off South Carolina. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight is just amazing as a stubborn, dedicated and idealistic teacher who takes on this challenge despite a director who believes in harsh discipline and has little consideration for modern pedagogical techniques, as well as a crusty superintendent of the old school, played with passion by the late Hume Cronyn. Madge Sinclair is the main one who loves her babies. <br /> <br /> As a retired teacher, I was able, in a way, to understand this excellent film. The ignorance shown here as well as the lack of cooperation with officials are also quite evident in urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voight realizes that these children need much more than the traditional teachings of a classroom. He brings them out and experiences life on their own by learning outside. <br /> <br /> The end is hopeless, but so true to life. <br /> <br /> Amazing that such backward students have a zest to learn and were well disciplined. I guess that answers my question. The behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment. <br /> <br /> The end is going to hit you on the heart. It was memorable and so poignant.
