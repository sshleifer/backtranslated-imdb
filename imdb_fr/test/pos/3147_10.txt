I watched The Reader at Sugar, which is not the perfect place to watch anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well integrated and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and his team. But it's the story and its delivery that really made the difference. Duncan Rogers' tight screenplay was exactly what this "shorts" night needed. He neither despised, like many offerings, nor preached. The reader was a simple story in its best form, well performed by Rogers and beautifully played. Duncan Rogers is obviously a director capable of bringing together all the pieces, I'm looking forward to seeing his next project finished. K.
