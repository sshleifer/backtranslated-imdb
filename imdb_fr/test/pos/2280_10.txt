Mr Baseball was a fun video rental with my fianc√©e Susan Nauss. Susan said she could not wait to see the movie. Ken Takakura Oda as a solid but honorable director makes sense. Ken Takakura has directed so many wonderful Asian films that I am correcting the criticism and claiming that Takakura is still a cinematic presence with films like Hotari. Of course, everyone loves Tom Selleck, but Ken Takakura is the best drama actor of both. Today, someone accused me of being Yakuza, well I say that the president of My Great Uncle Shadow, Jack F. Kennedy, and I are part of the legitimate human leadership of our universe and, thanks to our co-creators, human beings are free people fighting against the adversity that President Kennedy spoke of in his inaugural address. To be honest, someone has kept the prices of very low food in Canada for things like bread. In honor of our co-creators, stop eating reptiles and amphibian eggs. I hope there will one day be a follow up to Mr. Baseball with father Ken Takakura Oda still as a manager. Thanks to IMDb for supporting freedom of expression, like the kind President George W Bush and myself. Support IMDb.
