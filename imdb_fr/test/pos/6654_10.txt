"How can a name, not even a real name, break your heart?" Here's how. Few film versions of a famous novel have done justice to their sources better than Anthony Minghella's film on Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain. If you have read the book, you will be able to feel most of the major scenes relentlessly restored. I personally cried many times while reading the novel and spent a good part of the evening watching the movie through tears. <br /> <br /> A staggering scope, beautiful lyrics, excellent acting and excellent music. In the DVD interview accompanying the film, Minghella talks about the multiple layers of the story. All work. One of the best films I've seen and an invitation to one of the greatest novels of the last ten years.
