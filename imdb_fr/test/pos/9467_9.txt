This film is however an excellent film, as it is predictable in most cases. The highlight of the film is of course the star Amanda Bynes, absolutely beautiful and hilarious. She is one of the few people in the world who uses the 53 muscles of her face to create the strangest and heart-wrenching faces ever created. It's good for kids and contains superior male nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end. All in all, they have updated an old classic and deserve to sit on the set with O and 10 things that I hate. Other actors also do important work, often when they first start.
