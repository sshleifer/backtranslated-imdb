This is the first short film Three Stooges with Shemp that I saw and it's one of my favorites! <br /> <br /> That's what I really liked about Shemp when he came back after the Curly shot, he did not try to look like Curly, he was his own character and he I admire! Shemp is my favorite third stooge, I love him more than Curly, but I love Curly as much as Shemp. Shemp is awesome, he's funny, he's silly, he's SHEMP! <br /> <br /> I really loved the scene in which he dropped the money and where Moe came into the booth with him to find him. They ended up getting lost in the wires and were badly injured! <br /> <br /> But what I thought was really scary was when Shemp rubbed his face against the window of the phone booth, he looked like a malformed teacher, Snape! <br /> <br /> Poor Shemp, he had a lot of bad things happening to him in this short film, but it's just typical of the Three Stooges, they always have a lot of bad things happening to them! <br /> <br /> This short film is another must for the fans of Three Stooges! <br /> <br /> 10/10
