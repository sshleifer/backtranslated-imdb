The Squire of Gothos is one of the most ridiculous episodes of Star Trek, and therefore one of the most entertaining. The entertainment factor is usually fueled by the clash between William Shatner and William Campbell, the hilarious guest of this episode. <br /> <br /> During an unspecified routine mission, Sulu suddenly disappears into the air, and Kirk follows shortly thereafter. Spock immediately starts looking for his missing colleagues (and, although he hates to admit it, his friends), while the two stranded crewmembers have to face Trelane (Campbell), the powerful and flamboyantly flamboyantly proclaimed Gothos, a being able to create or destroy everything he wants by the power of his mind. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the plot may seem to have been recycled by previous episodes (honestly, are there any science-fiction shows that did not involve at least one God-like character), but this feeling disappears quite quickly thanks to the script's use of exaggerated humor, all conveyed by Campbell's deliberately camped performance: his Trelane is essentially the Trek version of a child spoiling the body of an adult, so that his curiosity for mankind fed by his ignorance (his knowledge is quite limited) probably inspired Gene Roddenberry when he proposed the Q character for the next-generation pilot about two decades later. this episode was broadcast. <br /> <br /> In short, the key to appreciating The Squire of Gothos is: "idiot" does not necessarily mean "bad".
