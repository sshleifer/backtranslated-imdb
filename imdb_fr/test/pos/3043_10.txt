I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I have seen it 4 times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself well aware of classical cinema. A real polished diamond, in its raw state. <br /> <br /> This film gem revolves around Jon Voight (lead character "Conrack") as a young teacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach Island children at a school. At first, students reveal that they know very little about the world outside their home island. The heart of the film is that Conrack finds inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them. Students quickly reward their teacher with eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that were foreign to them not long ago. Conrack uses unconventional and intelligent teaching techniques that are, oh, a little fun! God forgive. Learn and have fun? Together? It can not be, says the officials. To avoid a spoiler, I'll just say that Conrack finds resistance from the boss man ... and that the end is really bitter-sweet. <br /> <br /> I am a 35 year old Caucasian man with some experience of I should identify with the main character, Pat Conroy (aka Conrack, Mr. Petroy). But I do not identify with black children. As a child, I was transported to a school at the other end of the city from the 4th to the 6th degree, around 1979. These children of the film remind me of my classmates. Fortunately, in Grade 4, at age 8 or 9, we do not understand racism. I just remember that we were all children and we played 4-box relays, kickball, hide and seek and running. <br /> <br /> This film is very moving. There are delicious and poignant moments from beginning to end, non-stop. I found myself several times with tears in my eyes, then suddenly burst out laughing. It's a funny movie. <br /> <br /> "Get away from this winda !!" "Sir, if you are ready to accept shit, I should tell you that this rabbit has just done it on your lap." ..... "So, you, white teacher, Mr. Conrack. MY GREAT LOVES Mr. Conrack You are a handsome teacher, you are a handsome white man. "....." wind 15 mph from the east. "Warning: small boats, small boats, beware, big boats OK , do not worry about anything. "...." Not a cook of fries, but Eleanor Roosevelt, not a sharecropper, but ... it's latin..they are waiting! "...." Conrack sings like a frog .... I sing well, what are you talking about ?! " <br /> <br /> It still mystifies me that I still do not hear anything about this movie or that it has very little reputation or continuation. I intend to seek more reviews, comments, background and "making of" if they are there. What surprises me is the acting given by untrained children. I understand that one of the children, Mary, was an actress, and you can tell. However, other children have many lines and authentic reactions. I wonder how they did it! I guess Conrack and Mary had a specific dialogue with which to work while some scenes unfold naturally or ad-libbed. <br /> <br /> Conrack is a special film. In my opinion, this is one of the few films as good and unknown. King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods Must Be Crazy ('80) and Bad Day at Black Rock ('55) are also in this category. I recommend them all. But first, take a seat in Mr. Conrack's class.
