Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (The Isola degli Uomini Pesce) bought by Roger Corman and released through his film New World Pictures. Of course, Corman must write his initials by asking one of his lackeys (Dan T. Miller) to film gore images before distributing them in the United States. <br /> <br /> Isola degli Uomini Pesce is a very entertaining story from Dr. Moreau Island. We are in 1891 and Claudio Cassinelli is wrecked on a mysterious island with some recently escaped convicts. Claudio falls on the amazing Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays villain Edmund Rackham: a man who can manipulate scientist Joseph Cotton by turning the local indigenous population into amphibious creatures plunging into the deep sea (they look like a cross between the Black Lagoon creature and one of the Humanoids deep in the depths) , convincing Cotton that the mutations were created for the highest scientific and humanitarian motivations. <br /> <br /> After discovering the lost city of Atlantis, Rackham uses amphibious creatures to loot his treasures. The sexy Barbara Bach plays the girl of Cotton who has a psychic link with these mutations. In a memorable scene, Bach takes a midnight bath with these mutants dressed only in a thin white cotton dress that leaves little imagination. Claudio discovers that one of the condemned with whom he befriended has been turned into a branchial creature, then hell is unleashed. <br /> <br /> Filmed at the same time and in the same place as Zombie 2, Richard Johnson did not even have to change his costume between the movies. The house where the experiments take place is the same one used by Johnson to conduct experiments at Zombi 2. Talk about making economic movies! <br /> <br /> The additional sequence features some bloody decapitations, (how to go Roger!), and a ridiculously bad Cameron Mitchell doing his best pirate imitation. All that's missing is the parrot. <br /> <br /> Spanish Title: The Continent Of Fish Men
