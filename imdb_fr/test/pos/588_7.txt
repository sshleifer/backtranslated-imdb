The first adventure of a feature film by Jim Henson's beloved characters is a very competent musical, as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree and swampy environment in the spotlight (powered by the failed Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who heard to sing); on the way, he gets to know Fozzie Bear (a humble comedian at James Coburn's El Sleazo Caf√©, who has Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn a protector!), the dog at the piano Rowlf, the bestial beater Animal and his return , awesome band, Miss Piggy (egocentric beauty queen) (at a ceremony chaired by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc. Milton Berle, Bob Hope and Richard Pryor, respectively served by the insolent waiter Steve Martin, almost served ice creams and balloons. They almost got brainwashed by German mad scientist Mel Brooks. who has Cloris Leachman as secretary)! The pleasant score is courtesy of Paul Williams, who also plays the role of resident pianist at El Sleazo. For the record, I recently bought four of the following Muppet movies and I should watch them in the coming weeks, when their turn comes.
