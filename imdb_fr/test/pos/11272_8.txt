Begotten is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. For me, it's more of a study of sound, light and darkness and movement than a real story. The type of thing you see as a video instillation at the Museum of Modern Art is a popular film at the local theater. I will not try to interpret the images of mother nature, the beasts in coats, the twisted and tortured body of her "child". Some things simply defy the interpretation.
