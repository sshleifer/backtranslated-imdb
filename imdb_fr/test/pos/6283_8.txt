I was chosen as a surfer in the beach scenes. We almost had the role of muscle dude, since the real muscle guy was really late that day. Pauly asked my brother and me (the skater in front of the tattoo) to do some stuff between two scenes live from Venice because he was still doing his MTV thing. This film is really good too. Would he have made my top 100 if I was not there ........?
