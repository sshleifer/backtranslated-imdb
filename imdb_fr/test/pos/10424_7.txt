It was a very beautiful soft-core film for men and women. A lot of nudity / sex, but without the general panoply that you usually find. They could not have done a better job of casting because the whole thing was amazing. Believe me, if you want to put your wife in the mood, grab something with Bobby Johnston! And I'm sure the beautiful Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies would do it for any heterosexual man. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene together and if you know of a movie where they do, please send me a message! I would like to know. The photography was much better than usual. So was the story. Predictable, but pleasant, sweet and romantic. At the very least, it was not one of those annoying predictable murder mysteries, full of blond women with huge breasted baby bottles. I give that 7/10!
