Very nice love story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very weird and funny. A funeral director (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B.Blethyn). They try to simulate her death to escape her husband and the village. A scenario of strange situations begins. As well as GAVING GRACE and LONG LIVE NED DEVINE.
