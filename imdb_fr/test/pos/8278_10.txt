If you are a child of the 80s and you have not seen this film, you have not managed to be a real child of the 80s. How not to love these super chipmunks (do not forget the chipsets) , lines and songs. Years later, I can still sing every word for every song. The scenario is excellent and much better than today's children's movies. It's just pure pleasure and it's worth the money, even if you're all grown up.
