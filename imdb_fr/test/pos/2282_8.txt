A major league baseball player is forced to continue his career in Japan. He faces a foreign culture, a seemingly humorless manager, an attractive Japanese woman and his own professional and social insecurities. A certain subtle charm derives from the performances of Tom Selleck. There is humor, sometimes discreetly, as in this film, sometimes chuckling as in "Folks!", But there always seems to be a higher goal. Add to that a self-doubting individual who struggles to solve his personal difficulties while standing firm on "doing the right thing", and you end up with a film that is both funny and stimulating. The actors are like a championship team, and even if neither the actors nor the film wins prizes, they will let the viewers feel good (and maybe that's the best result after all). You'll want to watch this movie more than once, and each time, Mr. Baseball hits a home run.
