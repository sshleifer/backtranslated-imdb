I feel that Rupert Grint has a lot of potential for this role that everyone knows about. So, even though I had never heard of this movie before, when it appeared in my cable TV programs, I immediately switched to this channel. I am so happy that I did it! <br /> <br /> I have read, among other commentators, that they generally do not like new stories; I do pretty much enough. I am one of those who reach their majority. I have been since I was 12, I am 52 years old now and I will probably continue until I am 92 years old. Becoming an adult is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day offers. The suddenness of the realization, its magnitude, sometimes throw us into disarray. If we try to protect our delicate beings from this, then yes, I can see how maturity can end. But if we simply dust ourselves off and set ourselves in the new direction we discovered, we suddenly find ourselves on a new path and we are just as alive as we were yesterday, but only stronger, brighter and more living. I can say, more interesting. <br /> <br /> This is the purpose of this film. It was a story of arrival in age; Young Ben, his father, Father Robert and certainly Dame Evie ... have all had a wonderful transformation. In fact, Mr. Fincham did the same, did not he ?! I guess everything was done, except for the mother, despite the enormous opportunity that was given to her, provided by the events at the end of the film. One has the feeling that she will continue on the same path as she, but perhaps with a different distribution. <br /> <br /> An excellent film, which could not have been shot in America, which is quite depressing to think about, but thank God we have a constant stock of films shot elsewhere that we sometimes have the opportunity to see. I highly recommend this film, as long as you are not disturbed by the passages we are all too familiar with and by the fact that you are smiling.
