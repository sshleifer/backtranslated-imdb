I mean, let's face it, all you have to do in modeling is to pose for photos. The judgment is so exaggerated with his critics. The show is however entertaining, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J Alexander and the model Twiggy. I watched seasons 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of season 8. Looks like American Idol has become sexy, but I'm a guy and I only watch it because of the hot girls posing in bikinis! The show can be quite boring, when it comes to judging, Tyra tends to go again and again and it's really off putting. Anyway I would recommend it? Yes, would I recommend it to women who want to go into modeling? No.
