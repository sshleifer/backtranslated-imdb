I'm new to this field, so please support me. I am a big fan of Surface. I thought the screenplay and the graphics were exceptional, as good as any Sci Fi movies I've seen in the theater. In February, the TV guide told Season Finale, the show's announcer said that "... and now for the final of the Surface season." Final season, not final of the series! I could not wait for autumn to come here, to see that it would happen next. So, autumn is coming here and it is nowhere to be found! If NBC is not going to get it, what about Sci Fi or the United States? It seems to me that Bay Watch did not last long on ABC and that the United States took it back, and that it provoked gangsters! (I bet ABC shocked) Ha! If it's not a series, then at least a mini-series, to give closure to all our loyal fans. What happened to our guy stuck in the church steeple? Was the creature in the Nim chase? Did he have a big spert? Does the cloned guy come from our side? There are so many unanswered questions. Thank you for listening to me babble!
