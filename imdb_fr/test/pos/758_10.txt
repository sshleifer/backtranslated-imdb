I did not know what to expect from "driving lessons" - I did not know if Rupert Grint could play such a role, but in the first few minutes I was completely hooked. All along, the music, the acting and the sets were absolutely breathtaking. Julie Walters has, as always, presented a great performance like the old eccentric actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, just as good, also offered a fantastic performance like the romantic Ben. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was forced into ants, laughing and swelling with joy as Ben freed himself from his dominant mother and fought for friendship with his only friend, Evie. A very controversial story, probably probably exaggerated but still one of the best films I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good British movie and an evening to enjoy just have fun.
