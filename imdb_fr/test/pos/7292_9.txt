I do not understand why the critics would criticize this film. It's a teen movie that's really serious, which is rare. I admit there are extremely sappy moments, but go about young love, it must be sappy to be valid. My biggest complaint is Chris Klein. While he was funny in American Pie, he is apparently not ready to switch to an even more spectacular rate, but he is very uncomfortable to look into some of his "mom's stories". Hartnett and Sobieski, on the other hand, demonstrate remarkable depth and credibility, just as parents do. Although the scenario is strongly clich√© and the lovers spring from the poetry, the actor makes it work. The direction displays powerful images on the screen. Beautiful cinematography, good music, excellent young actors, I was impressed and I am a jaded critic when it comes to teen movies.
