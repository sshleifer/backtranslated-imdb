It's actually a brilliant film. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially the performance of Mads Mikkelsen as Svend is magnificent. It's a simple story about two guys who want to do it themselves, but it's a strange and absurd story, with a lot of people getting killed and being served chicken steaks. If only more people understood Danish ... This could be a great candidate for an English version. Also worthy of mention is Ole Thestrup, who always brings an extra touch to the plot, with her slightly crazy character, Holger. I can only recommend this film to the Danish public. Also take a look at Adams Ã†bler (2005), a film by Anders Thomas Jensen, also with Mads Mikkelsen, accompanied by the very successful Ulrich Thomsen.
