A young Frenchman uproots himself as he becomes an Erasmus student in Barcelona and returns better. Sounds boring? No way! The film is filled with colorful characters, all stereotyped (the British twat and his racist brother, the sexually liberated Dane, the ultra-organized German, ...). In this case, however, the stereotypes are brilliantly realized. You feel like you know people like that (I know an arrogant doctor and his wife trophy, and these are the characters in the movie!), They feel like real people! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie and enjoy the subtitles!
