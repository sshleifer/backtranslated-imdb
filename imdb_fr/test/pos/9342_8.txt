Thriller (1983) by Michael Jackson must be the biggest video ever made. Dude you have Zombies, Gore and a catchy melody, what more? John Landis mixed elements of Night of the Living Dead and American Werewolf in London. This video is out. What begins with a beautiful evening for a young couple turns into a hellish date, literally. You have dancing zombies, a werewolf wearing a great jacket and Vincent Price "striking". A nice video for a song that everyone in the neighborhood has marked. <br /> <br /> I must strongly recommend this song because it must be the best music video ever made. He did not have another like this. <br /> <br /> Discover the "Making of Thriller". The documentary contains "interesting" things.
