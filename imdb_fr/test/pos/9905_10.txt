It was a rare treat to see "Checking Out". I was touched by the characters, I laughed a lot of the wonderful script and deeply moved by the authentic emotions beautifully portrayed by this set and in particular by Peter Falk. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he recounts his experience of his life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions for the future, is so real that it is at the highest point . level of the best performances awarded at the Oscars. He is an accomplished actor who has outdone himself in this film. The screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge, timing, gift of dialogue and hilarious situations that made me laugh out loud. I highly recommend "Checking Out" to all those who wish to enjoy a quality narration played superbly.
