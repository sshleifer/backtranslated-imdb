Fat Man And Little Boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs dropped in reverse order on Nagasaki and Hiroshina. This is the story of this film. <br /> <br /> The terms used are the code names for two plutonium and uranium bombs. Fat Man was the plutonium bomb and it was dropped on Nagasaki and that of Little Boy on Hiroshima. <br /> <br /> The film is primarily a conflict between US Army General Leslie R. Groves and physicist J Robert Oppenheimer who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under Groves's leadership . With two men from equally divergent backgrounds, the conflict was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who has been a disarmament activist all his life, plays the role of General Groves. To his credit, Newman does not play a man whose opinion he shares very little with any caricature. Groves is primarily a soldier with an engineering background. He wanted a combat command, as would be expected by trained army professionals in the greatest of wars. But because of his engineering background, Groves took over the Manhattan project, which was codenamed. Newman is determined to do his part for the war effort. <br /> <br /> Most of us first met Dwight Schultz of the A-Team under the name of H.M. Murdoch the pilot whose reality is at best tenuous. If we only knew A-Team, we could think that Schultz had a great future in comic roles. <br /> <br /> Instead, Dwight Schultz is one of the best actors in the English-speaking world with an astonishing range. Dramatic plays since the release of this television series. J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. The challenge of the problem is also intriguing. Later, Oppenheimer entered a dead end because of his political views and his left-wing partners, known to all, in the Manhattan project. Bonnie Bedelia as Mrs. Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson as Oppenheimer's Communist mistress whose affair with Oppenheimer later won her such a jackpot, and Laura Dern as a nurse at the Los Alamos site. <br /> <br /> But the best is John Cusack who, as Michael Merriman, is a composite of some real-life scientists who could rightly be labeled as the first victims of the atomic era. Her scenes with Laura Dern, especially with what happens to her, are really poignant. <br /> <br /> The debate on bombs and the use made of them is still the subject of heated debate. Fat Man And Little Boy presents the facts and lets you decide what might have happened if another use had been made.
