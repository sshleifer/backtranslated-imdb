The Golden Door tells the story of a Sicilian family from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes to have a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave his homeland in Sicily, embarks on the difficult journey through raging seas and lives in a land where rivers are supposed to flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World, their dreams of prosperity will come true. The images of the New World are optimistic, intelligent and very imaginative. The silver coins are raining down on Salvatore as he plans how prosperous he will be in the New World; Carrots and onions are shown to be twice as large as human beings harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will produce. All these images are intertwined with the characters and pleasantly complement the realistic realism that the story reveals to the public. The contrast between this image and the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps to restore hope for its passage aboard the ship to the New World. <br /> <br /> The journey into the New World takes place almost in the dark, especially when stormy seas roar and almost kill people inside. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is portrayed as a little helpless and primitive. This is what Salvatore shows as he rushes to sell his remaining possessions (donkeys, goats and rabbits) to get the proper clothing he needs to enter the New World. I found it rather interesting that these people believe that they must adhere to a certain dress code to be accepted in the New World; it almost suggested that people had to adapt to a particular stereotype or mold to be recognized as morally fit. The most powerful image of the film was when the ship left her home country and departed for the New World. This picture shows a top view of a crowd of people who seem to slowly separate from each other, illustrating the separation between the old and the new world. This clich√© also suggested that people were separated from all that was familiar to them, wanted to divorce their dark living conditions and wanted to enter a more promising world. <br /> <br /> As we will see later visually, the Old World seems dark and dark compared to the New World bright but hazy. I found it particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty was never exposed through the fog of Ellis Island, but remained hidden. I think it was a deliberate choice of direction that seemed to defeat the purpose of the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry" seemed to be a joke about this that these people had to live when to arrive at the New World. Once on the American continent, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (delousing, mathematics, riddles, etc.) to prove that they were fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the outlook of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the most difficulty in submitting to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would bring, the reality of what the New World required was derogatory and rude. Salvatore does not change much more than his attitude to what he thought was the New World in relation to what he really seemed to be disappointing. This attitude was shared by most people who traveled with him. Their arcs of characters are more about a darling dream and a dark reality to accept. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be the subject of a strong commentary on preparation for entry into a civilized and heavenly society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and the stupidity of dominating. This may be a commentary on how the United States learned from the failures of other nations and was deliberately established to ensure that these scourges did not infest or destroy. Although the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help people to flourish.
