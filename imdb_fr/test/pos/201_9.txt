A true masterpiece of Soviet cinematography. It is a shame for the Soviet Union that Samojlova never had the opportunity to play in Western films - but again, she would probably never end up there. In "Letyat Zhuravli" she is unforgettable. It was one of the few films where I cried ... <br /> <br /> Besides Samojlova, Batalov and Merkurjev, who are at its best, it was a brilliant work of the director and the operator who has allowed movie a classic of all time around the world. Just remember the piano music scenes and proposals under the violent German bombardment, or the death of Boris with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies. The very simple way - but the advanced technique adds to the emotional weight ... Notice, 20 years before "The Star Wars", 41 years before "Titanic" and with a Soviet budget.
