spoiler-- <br /> <br /> In 1993, African-American director / actor Mario Van Peebles followed the hugely popular New Jack City urban action movie with "Posse". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also plays the main character, Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: The film begins at the turn of the twentieth century, when the United States was mingled. in the Spanish-American War. Apparently at a time when the American judicial system could send convicts to military service, Jessie Lee is a man enlisted against his will, serving in a troop of black cavalry in Cuba. Among his compatriots are Little J (Stephen Baldwin), Weezie (Charles Lane), who speaks loudly, and the imposing but simple Obobo (Tiny Lister). They find a hidden gold treasure during a reconnaissance race and decide to keep it. However, Colonel Graham (Zane), ambitious and sectarian, discovers gold and seems to want to kill Jessie Lee and company for it. A shootout between Graham's forces and Jessie Lee's forces leaves the Colonel blind with one eye and his forces withdraw. Jessie Lee's ragtag crew manages to get smuggled (and gold) to New Orleans, but it turns out Graham is not far behind. Jessie Lee and her allies are forced to run west to a town called Freemanville. Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the American Civil War. Jessie Lee's father, "King David", was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the city. However, as intermittent flashbacks reveal, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white crowd, in parallel with the Ku Klux Klan's terrorist campaigns that had begun at about the same time. Jessie Lee and her company end up traveling to Freemanville, only to find that locals are not quite happy to see him, especially when sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) of a nearby white borough makes it clear that he wants Jessie Lee and her friends. partners? dead or alive. Carver (Blair Underwood) is the de facto sheriff and mayor of Freemanville and his agenda may not match Jessie Lee's presence. <br /> <br /> Analysis The action sequences are all very credible, and Mario Van Peebles. turns into a good performance as a smoldering hero. Following the success of New Jack City, Van Peebles was almost expected to lead a sequel, or at least a similar follow-up in urban areas. Instead, Van Peebles looked back at the past, creating an essentially black western ("updating" the 1970s black-themed westerns) and pursuing the cowboy-themed film legacy. black largely forgotten at the beginning of the twentieth century. . Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently funded and was originally published by Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. The leaders of the big studios apparently hesitated when Van Peebles introduced them to "Posse". The rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc, of Father Time and Angel, are among the most "curious" actors of the time. In some interviews, Mario Van Peebles said he often likes to play against typography. in the years that followed, the tendency to use rap singers in non-musical films would become almost commonplace. Enthusiastic viewers will notice several cameos of entertainment personalities: veterans of the black action movie like Isaac Hayes ("Truck Turner"), Pam Grier ("Foxy Brown") and Larry Cook ("The scarecrow seated by the door "), as well as stand-up legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention TV producer Stephen J. Cannell (who hired junior Van Peebles to play in" Sonny Spoon "years earlier). Woody Strode ("Spartacus") plays a key role in the film.
