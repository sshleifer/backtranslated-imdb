Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic by Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method (sketching poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and his fantastic beauty) and his struggle to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealistic imagination. <br /> <br /> The film beautifully incorporates extracts from poems by Miyazawa. His relationships with his students were powerful, especially in a scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom. Miyazawa's selfless compassion for the farmers in his village, his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson. In addition, Miyazawa's attachment to science was well described. At a time when Western ideas still aroused skepticism, especially in provincial towns like Miyazawa's, he understands how useful it is to help his fellow citizens and draw inspiration from his elegance. The way in which the film presented the moments of artistic passion and disappointment of the writer was really intense and well interpreted. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that the CGI integrated into the film, while innovating, in confrontation with a more organic animation. . One could argue that it was intentional to represent a conflict within the main character, but I found it rather unattractive. I would also like the film to talk about Miyazawa's Buddhist influence, but it worked well without that. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very well done. I give him a 9/10, with one less point for the CGI. Otherwise, the animation, the plot and the dialogue were all wonderful and sincere. I have not seen any Kawamori Shoji movies yet, but I will not fail to give them a chance to see him.
