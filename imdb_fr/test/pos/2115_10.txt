This is the kind of movie I grew up on. It's a family fun, that kids love and that parents like too. I wish more movies like this one were made. It's a beautiful story about a little boy who raises a bull with his mother and his sister and shows it until the Grand National Championship where he wins! Then he's afraid someone wants to grill his bull, so he takes it off and goes home with it. I was really excited when I saw this film for the first time at the theater and was surprised to see George Strait, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little film. The music was great with all sorts of big names from countries like Willie Nelson and the Dixie Chicks. Anyone who does not like this film, have no children or have never been children themselves.
