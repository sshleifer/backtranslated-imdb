Without a doubt, the best movie of Burt Reynolds! Even better than Smokey and the bandit. It was probably the first real bloody crime thriller of the 1980s and offered the perfect mix of humor, action, mystery and style that is lacking in today's movies. <br /> <br /> This one has it all: Henry Silva, psychotic I earned $ 1,000 a night in PCP, ninja assassins and Burt Reynolds who get their fingers cut, one by one, with a butterfly knife. The film is based on the novel by William Diehl who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, another of my favorites of all time. This film is worth watching just to see Henry Silva being shot six times, crashing through a window and falling thirty floors up from an Atlanta tower. It's probably the coolest waterfall in Hollywood history, made by the legendary stuntman Dar Robinson. <br /> <br /> Robinson also played "Moke" in Elmore Leonard's STICK film, also starring Burt Reynolds. The stick features another great Dar Robinson waterfall. Robinson falls from an apartment building in Miami and unloads the six shots of a 0.44 magnum as he comes down. Very cool stuff. <br /> <br /> SHARKY'S MACHINE is my favorite crime drama. I never understood why this movie failed. If Burt had made more movies like this, he would have built a better reputation. He turns out to be a talented director with Sharky, as well as a talented actor. Burt is supported by Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward and the favorite villain of all, Henry Silva. Please repeat this classic movie! Get yourself Affleck and Samuel L., as well as other passionate actors, and you'll have a good movie just waiting to be filmed. <br /> <br /> I give it a rating of 9 out of 10
