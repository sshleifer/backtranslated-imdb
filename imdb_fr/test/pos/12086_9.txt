Forget all those romantic and naughty movies involving notebooks and closed-lipped couples who still manage to get past after a life on the unrealistic romance screen too simplistic. Forget all those unscrupulous movies "the dog gives his life to save his family movies" (though I must admit I have a weakness for them myself). Forget about Ricky Schroeder who already showed his propensity to outbid at a tender age (now that she was shameless!). <br /> <br /> This TV movie, which seems unfortunately never to be broadcast, is the champion of all times watery, hands down. And a story well written and well played to start. Ann-Margret took a great chance assuming this role. Nothing flamboyant or sexy at home here, and it's a monumental feat in itself. Based on a true story, she embodies Lucile Fray, a terminally ill mother who chooses to fight to the death to find good homes for her ten children, instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government agencies. Frederic Forrest does a great job as a husband, a good-hearted but unreliable family supporter whose disabling arthritis and personal demons make him unable to care for children. <br /> <br /> The film guides us through Lucile's heartbreaking process of interviewing future parents and watching her children leave home. It also gives us the perspective of the children themselves and the father - we are saddened by the tragedy that is unfolding now and we will not fail to follow, and frustrated by his inability to do more. The scene in which the youngest child (Steven) is taken to his new home is the most heartbreaking I have ever seen. Now, I grew up as a "hopeless romantic," and have spent the next many years since becoming a harder and more cynical shell. I usually find more mockery than empathy in the cinematic sentimental guts imposed on us these days. But this jewel of the early 80s still kills me. <br /> <br /> I really want someone with a marketing boost to release a DVD version of this drama. Among the special features include the Emmy Awards broadcast the following year. A-M was nominated for this role, but the award for Best Dramatic Actress was awarded to Barbara Stanwyck for "Thorn Birds". In what must be one of the greatest moments of what is now a real record, Stanwyck burst into tears during his thank-you speech and launched "Ann-Margret, I love you! . <br /> <br /> One last note. The IMDb rating for "Who will love my children" is 6.4 at the moment. However, more than 75% of the scores are in the 8-10 range (most of the time 10). Regardless of the type of handicap system used by this site to change the overall rating of movies listed by IMDb, it completely misses the benchmark. This one is the "weeper" of all time and a hell of a good TV movie to start.
