Thursday is clearly a derivative of the "new wave" of detective films released since Quentin Tarantino took the assault with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early 90s, but he has enough ideas in his own right to do so. an interesting little movie. . Thursday uses a few characters mainly in one place. It works because each character is quite eccentric to be memorable, and once assembled, what you have is a very entertaining little thriller. There is little substance in the plot, but it does not matter, because no one embarks on this kind of film while waiting for a rewarding experience. The plot follows Casey; a former drug dealer who went straight and now lives with his wife a talented architect in the suburbs. The couple wants to adopt a child, but things go wrong when Casey receives a visit from his former criminal partner, Nick, who brought with him a heroin case and a stolen money from the cops. Thursday will be a very interesting day for our former criminal ... <br /> <br /> The first scene prepares the film quite well and allows us to know what to expect. We see a coffee order go bad, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits quickly cover when a cop comes for a refresh. The scene is imbued with dark humor and spiritual dialogues, and this continues throughout the film. Thursday is a very entertaining film, and scenes such as those who see the adoption visitor at an uncomfortable time make it hard not to like the movie. It is true that the film brings nothing new to the table, either on the cinematographic level or on that of the plot, but the fact that it is happy to sink in its derision guarantees that it remains more of time for the absurd situation around the main characters. The acting is pretty decent, with all the casting fun clearly with this plot. Thomas Jane holds the film in the main role, while the amusing performances of James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke support him pleasantly. It is unlikely that this film will impress seasoned film buffs, but if you just want a fun little movie with some nice twists and performances; Thursday is likely to suffice.
