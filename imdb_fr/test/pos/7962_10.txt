This is without a doubt one of the first most accomplished films for a director. The film lasts only 90 minutes, but manages to say just about everything about life and death. Not a lot of action, and the dialogue is minimal, but the film flows to perfection and demands your attention because of the wonderfully natural feeling of everything that's going on. The performances of the main actors are perfect, and even some secondary characters get strong emotional scenes. The film will be somewhat lost for today's modern audience, but it is a film that everyone should see. Frankly without humor and honest, it is on par with the works of Ozu. <br /> <br /> Scratch my title, this one is perfect!
