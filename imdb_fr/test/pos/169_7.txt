This movie is great. A 1980s slasher film about three children born during an eclipse, they kill everyone. The reason they kill makes almost no sense, but it only reinforces the charm of this movie. And dang, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I'm talking to. This kid is vicous! Although the movie does not have a lot of gore, it is entertaining and, for some reason, you care about the characters. He also has a beautiful nudity. A little decent actor too, really a decent 1980s slasher movie, worth a look if you have the chance to see it. You will have nightmares on these children damn well, I guarantee you!
