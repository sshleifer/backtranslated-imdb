The first critic is right: in this film, we see ourselves, snuggling around the majority, pleasant, trying to avoid trouble, just trying to live our lives, and we see how easy these human traits are, if fundamental to the functioning of society can lead us to become accomplices of a great evil. <br /> <br /> The story takes place during the Second World War. Radio, newspapers and movies remind us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to emphasize the irony. the same kind of violent antisemitism that occurs in America. Sometimes it seemed a bit heavy. <br /> <br /> It's more like a play than a movie, but it's so exciting that such jokes do not mean much. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the whole plot is based on a fact that seemed rather implausible. Larry lived a life without incident until his middle age. however, he just needs to start wearing a pair of glasses for everyone - EVERYONE - to take him at first sight like a Jew. I deliberately suspended my disbelief because the plot allowed me to move on, but the improbability bothered me throughout the film. (And, frankly, I did not understand why his wife was also taken for a Jew.) Larry seemed to think so because his name was "Hart." And later, when he married her, I do not know. why her neighbors supposed she was Jewish.) During the first part of the film, I wondered if there were any fancy elements. Larry's lack of pretension seemed exaggerated, almost borderline with the grotesque. Why not call the police at the sight of the rape, even if the attacker was a neighbor? And I thought the lighting seemed to suggest something slightly unreal: the red of the houses seemed too red, Gertrude's entry seemed intentionally superimposed, the colors were usually almost pencils in their intensity. <br /> <br /> In the credits I see that the film was filmed on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto. So I plan to drive there (near Bloor & Dufferin) today to check the colors. Really :) It was good to remember that the clergy at that time was often at the head of the evil of racism. (Remember how the Pope refused to denounce Hitler, seeking only protection for the Church, and this same pope, at the moment when Rome was to be liberated by American troops, asked First soldiers Enter the city, do not be black, check your story.) I do not remember ever having heard of this movie before. It's a shame. This certainly interests all thinkers, all those who are interested in American history or racism; This is one of the clearest illustrations I've ever seen of Bertrand Russell's saying: "Do not go out with a crowd to do the wrong thing."
