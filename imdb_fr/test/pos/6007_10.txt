Excellent storytelling and cinematography. Poignant and biting social commentary. <br /> <br /> Great effects. Well filmed and acted. <br /> <br /> However, the parallel action between the present and the adventures of travel (although very well done) sometimes hangs a little too much (about 3 hours) and causes excessive interruptions. the flow of history. <br /> <br /> I first read the book as a child and I enjoyed the passages about giants and the common people - but the book lost me when it came to the floating island and land of "yahoos"! Although the adventure plot may look like a children's story, it is actually a very adult story, full of symbolism about moral degradation in England at the time of Jonathan Swift, the author of novel on which the film is based.
