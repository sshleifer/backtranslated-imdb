This film was beautiful and touching. It touched a place deep inside me and I do not know why. I am a happily married woman and I have never had lesbian tendencies, but this film has almost made something that I want. The choreography, the script, the dialogue ... the film was a work of art. <br /> <br /> mess without synopsis is that a gymnast woman dissatisfied with her life and looking for ... something, anything. She is with a man who does not want a baby, but she wants it. It is not mean to her, but not treated as a woman should be either ... I guess it does not really appreciate. All these years, she stayed in shape and decided to go back to the gym. She meets another woman during her acrobatic training and an intimate and beautiful relationship develops. Throughout the film, she trained another friend with whom she was trained and who remained close friends. <br /> <br /> The relationship that takes place is .. I do not know the word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate, sexy ... but something that can only exist between two women. The kind of relationship that could really make sense of your life. Someone who makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, even confused. <br /> <br /> The relationship with her close friend is beautiful in a different way too. They have a close and intimate relationship. Her friend showed me what a real friend is. Someone who is understanding, easy-going, real, fun to be with, someone who is there for you no matter what. Someone who is supportive, and you can snuggle up and tell your deepest secrets. Someone who shares your past but does not share your secrets. <br /> <br /> The story is simple because it has not been exaggerated, but not underused. He leaves a lot of sensual images to capture his moments. The dance and the choreography were breathtaking. I could watch it again and again. The way the artist captured the feelings and emotions of the main character was. The dance and the images were very dazzling and hypnotizing to watch. What a wonderful story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, rent it and watch it !!
