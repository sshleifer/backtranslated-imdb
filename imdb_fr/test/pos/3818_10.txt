There is no point in comparing this to the original series. Although different in appearance and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, a series of anthologies SF / horror. In Australia, because of indifferent programming, I only managed to capture a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really gave me goosebumps (the nightmares of my age ...!), But many others fell flat; usually when stories have entered horror realms and away from SF. I only hope that the DVDs will eventually reach us.
