It's absolutely the best cartoon of the 80s, perhaps the best cartoon of all time. There was all about action, adventure, thrills, and so much more ... <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how difficult it was for Ruby-Spears to make this beautiful cartoon. money for this masterpiece and it was worth it, for example, teleportation scenes were difficult because I would not call the 1980s for a great technological year with computers like in the world where we live. excellent! <br /> <br /> The cartoons will never be like before, so I hope they'll all be released on DVD, especially The Centurions, because that's my favorite. I have the full 65-episode DVD-r series, but it's not the same, because if they were published on DVD, people around the world could buy it and see the DVDs in almost every stores, which means a lot for the Fans. My good friend Ted launched this petition for the show to be broadcast on television or better on DVD, if many requests asked us to retrieve them on DVD. <br /> <br /> Help us by signing the petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html
