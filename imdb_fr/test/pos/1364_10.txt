Believe me when I say that this show is just hilarious. The basic story is that of Kintaro Oe who travels from town to town and works part-time. He pursues women and learns everything he can about life. Kintaro must be one of the easiest to relate to the characters ever created. It takes everything to the extreme, and it's just laughing to laugh funny every time. From his incessant quest to study life to the very small things he does, he instantly becomes immersed in a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's style that is constantly being exaggerated. . He spends a lot of time in various super deformed modes like Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times, in less than 0.1 seconds, her face will not only become serious, but will be life-like or death-like expressions of a manga, like a dumbbell trying to calibrate a new record. It's hilarious. <br /> <br /> If that were not enough, the writing is superb and the game of English voices could not be better. The English VA Kintaro is perfect and you will roll even if he says nothing. The only thing to mention is that it is definitely an Ecchi series. He virtually defines the word. If you're an adult cartoon fan and you can laugh at movies like American Pie, you'll love it. <br /> <br /> - Rirath_com
