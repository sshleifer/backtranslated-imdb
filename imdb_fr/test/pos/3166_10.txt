Almost four years after the start of the war in Iraq, we are in a bigger hole than ever before. That's right, so all those hesitant flags that were so sure of the right and the power of the American way are now running, are not they? You bet that it is. This film says it from the beginning. It's a bit odd how much the film, or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was going to happen. It's almost like going to a fortuneteller and hearing what's going to happen in the future. There was a moment when I felt the hairs stand on my neck when GW announced that "the major combat operations were over" above the visual of a failed RV towed with the American flag waving to the back You have to see it to understand what I mean. But even if you are apolitical or even if you are pro-war, this film will have an impact on you because it is so rooted in history.
