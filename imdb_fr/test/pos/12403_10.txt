This film is like "The Breakfast Club" meets "Mad City". Justin Walker, Corey Feldman and James Remar offer excellent performances. However, this film is not for everyone. If you do not like movies that "go to the end" in terms of violence, then do not look at the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course, I could not leave the screen of the eyes. It's a really realistic drama for teenagers. I can not believe it comes from Roger Corman, the king of B-Movie. This film is a must for those who are not weak of soul. Highly recommended.
