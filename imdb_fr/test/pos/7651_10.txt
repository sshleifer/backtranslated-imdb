We stumbled on this show on a Sunday morning at 6:30 am by flipping through all the cable channels, which turned out to be the best show! It is absolutely adorable. We need programs like this for kids (and adults, because I'm well beyond my childhood). As pointed out by one of the other comments, this show takes advantage of the simplicity of the characters and the scenario. The puppets are incredibly cute, the backgrounds are colorful and, even if they are made of cardboard, moss, paint and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhood, when we could spend the day at a world where surround us. For those who have never had the chance to have a grandmother as nice as Nana, this show is for you, you will make up for lost time! This show is a true source of inspiration, imbued with ingenuity and humor, to the delight of young and old. In other words, do not neglect this show just because you are over three years old! Spend half an hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka and Russell, they will be friends you can not wait to see!
