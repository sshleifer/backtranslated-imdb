I loved this movie and I watch it every day. I think that although the acting is not so great, it's really just a group of guys having fun with a screenplay. I was looking for this movie for almost a year and when I found it for thirty dollars, I had to get it back. It's now, by far, my favorite movie of all time. It deals with the failure of the relationship and at the same time makes it a joke. I loved all the parties with Don Vito, especially one where Valo asks him for a grape when they are sitting on the porch, and he tells him to eat the one that falls under the porch. He really represents him as he is. The "Making Of" part really touched me when they talked about Brandon Novak's heroin addiction and the extent to which his friends and family were trying to help him. "Dreamseller", a new film in preparation, tells the story of Novak's dreams, broken by his addiction.
