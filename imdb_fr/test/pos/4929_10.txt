It was one of my favorite movies since my childhood. I watched it so many times that my tape finally wears out. I was a big fan of this series and I still am. What I like most about this film is that it appeals to so many people, young and old. I watch this movie now and I laugh as hard as the first time I saw it. I am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes I have never had in my childhood. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my father (also a big fan of the movie) and I still quote lines from this movie. I like the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movies. "You keep the places, Shirl and I'm going to grab Dad's snacks." I also liked the story of Plucky and Hampton and his family traveling to Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me a lot of my father. I love the moment they arrive at Happy World Land and just climb the monorail. This film is hilarious and attracts children and children. The animation, the jokes and all that relates to it are of superior quality. If you have not seen it, rent it. You will not be sorry.
