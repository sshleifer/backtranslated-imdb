I'm new to the game, but I would have started MUCH earlier if this movie had existed! I caught him at Gen Con last year (a trip made only as a favor to my husband) and I loved it! Even for a non-player as I was at the time, it's funny and accessible - so much so that I finally gave in and started to be part of my husband's gaming group. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give all the details of the plot, but if you're a player, you NEED to see this movie - and if you're not, you'll have a good time despite yourself. There are certainly jokes "in", but the vast majority of the film is accessible to all. <br /> <br /> My only complaints: wish it is longer and that it is available on DVD. Soon maybe? ...
