Peter Strauss, by nature, appearing in miniseries and movies designed for television, often receives an unjustly high proportion of bad reviews - usually from casual observers who watched the movie for ten minutes, after jumping it in a chain halfway through. Well, I just read the other 20 reviews of this movie and I'm glad I did not hear a rude word about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough for you to be ready to buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and even watching it once will show you why he deserved it so well .... <br /> <br /> Worried to be objective, I tried to criticize this film. Instead, I found myself arguing with each of my possible choices. That's what realistic and realistic movies are. It's not your typical Hollywood sensationalism, where everything is overexploited - it's so realistic and realistic that people thought it was based on a real event !!
