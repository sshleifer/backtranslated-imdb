What movie! I have always loved the Asian filming style and this film does not disappoint at all! The photography is breathtaking, ranging from incredible landscapes to swirls of color. The main actor is really realistic in the representation of the painter (whose paintings are amazing). The end is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only comment is that they may have had to show a little deeper the connection between her inspiration and her alcohol abuse and the women. But overall, it's a great movie!
