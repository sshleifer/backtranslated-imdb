I saw this film so long ago, but it remains in my memory the saddest film of all time. I cried all the time. My mother will never watch this movie again because it's almost painful to watch. Anyway, besides that, the story is not really complicated ... Ann Margaret is dying and has to give her 10 (?) Children. As if that were not enough, it is during the depression and she has to separate the close brothers and sisters, one by one. I imagine that it was very sad for me because I too belong to a very big united family and I could identify with the pain of each child to leave his mother and his brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm a masochist but I'd like to see this movie again because it was well done and the end, surprisingly, is a little happy (at least we could smile and sob) at the same time). He should arrive on television from time to time so that I can see him again.
