Love Jones is one of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The main thing that attracts me is the fact that it is very well directed. I've studied this film in its entirety - watching movies more than once, some things come to mind unconsciously - the direction of this film, as well as its writing, is chic, trendy and clever! I am in love with management. The scene where Larenz Tate and Nia Long drive the bike at night in the north of Chicago is amazing. The director of this film has won awards for his excellent work. <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a classy and sexy movie. This highlights the fact that we can be people who love, who have flaws, who like to live, learn and just be us without the hype. To be our natural being <br /> <br /> The poetry is wonderful, but the plot, the dialogues and the scenes really make this film. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen. It's a great movie for lovers and friends, where to watch, or the hopeless romantic (like me), to sit down and savor alone on a Friday or Saturday night. Every day of the week when peace, loneliness and a little bit of entertainment are needed, Love Jones is what I recommend.
