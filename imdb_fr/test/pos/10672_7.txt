I saw it for the first time in the 1970s on syndicated television and I admired its production values, which were at the forefront of technology. The remastered video is rich and colorful, much more intense than the pale 35mm TV copies. This film deserves more attention: it opened the way to UFO, Space: 1999 and even Star Wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly designed gadgets. While the story of an alternative anti-matter planet, Earth, has been recycled a hundred times since Star Trek, the beauty of this film lies in its European flair for design: from space engines Rolls Royce to "Euro Sec ". Business letterhead, JFSS or Dopplegangers as it was called in Europe is nice for the imaginary vision of Europe in space under the shadow of the superpowers. The ambitious epic of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson becomes a little tedious when the American astronaut finally realizes that he is on the unknown land and that everything is literally downhill after the poetic and graceful boarding of the shuttle. A mediocre story is helped by a grandiose and lyrical score of the late great Barry Gray, the British John Williams.
