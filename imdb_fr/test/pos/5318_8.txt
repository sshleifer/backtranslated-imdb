This film must be one of the most powerful films I've seen posting, it was absolutely flawless, incredibly original and provocative. The story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very powerful. This is a guy who kills the delayed brother of his ex-girlfriend and, when sent to juvenile prison, through many flashbacks, you enter a story and you do not let it disappear until 'at the end. The murder he commits changes the course of life of each member of his family and the family of the deceased, and when you watch and realize that everyone has their own story and their own dark side, you enjoy this movie even more, it is a complete turn of power, because these actions can not be described by mere words. His motive to commit murder is explained in an incomplete way and makes viewers think. Playing was pretty flawless, and the cast was very good, it contains a lot of familiar faces. If you like movies that cause thought and make you think (for example, "Donnie Darko", "Mulholland Dr."), then "The United States of Leland" is a great movie choice for you, otherwise you You should skip this movie and watch it when you are in a serious mood to provoke thought. <br /> <br /> 10/10
