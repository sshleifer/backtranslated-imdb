Dude, I had my doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought maybe it was good. I had never heard of that ...! You know, it was one of those things, we gave it "20 minutes and we'll turn it off if it sucks" and we were stuck right off the bat. It's a very seductive and funny movie. It's weird, you know? I mean, you have a singer, a murderer (and a credible), you have the prank, then Kathy Bates in all her actor splendor, Rupert Everett finally acting to her real potential, Dan Ackroyd, and a dwarf to make you laugh loudly I tell you that you will laugh / you will cry. <br /> <br /> Maybe I had a strange week, but I think this movie is about fried green tomatoes. If you do not like this movie, maybe you will not like it, but I think it was a great movie. I went out and bought the DVD.
