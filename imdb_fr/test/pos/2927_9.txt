I tell you, although it's funny to see how many of these swear words are in this one, I'm sure the number of blasphemies and swear words in it would probably be as high as 200, because I heard the greatest number of swearwords an episode of South Park equals 165 points of the word s ** t but apart from that, it's so funny because it contains swearwords and pedophiles who shoot themselves in the head. Look at this for your own survival, also look for a mention of cartmans. the father and the annoying voice of Chris Hanssee, as well as kyle have to save Cartman pedophiles (the predator show is also on the timeline) and they hunt down a peado and when they got there, the peado "shot himself "
