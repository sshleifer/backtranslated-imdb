Selected in the Directors' Fortnight, this year 2002, Catherine Breillat masterfully divides her autobiographical film, where her main actress, Anne Parillaud (The NIKITA Woman, Luc Besson) perfectly embodies the director of "Intimate Scenes". . <br /> <br /> It's a comedy of the manners of the actors. Making-of? Film genre? Pornography or exhibitionism? Sex Is Comedy is a post-modern film whose scenario is based on a film contained in the film. As an implosive history of a minimalist love scene, the film is built with a constant solidarity of forms and spirit in which Breillat continues to break down and analyze taboos. Using visual codes and a certain sense of the formula, Catherine Breillat implements her clinical analysis of sexuality as an isolated problem outside of society to be able to communicate through the door of the heart. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Gregory Colin (Bon Work, NÃ©nette and Boni, Claire Denis, The dreamed life of angels, Eric Zonca) in the role of the actor and Roxanne Mesquida (Fat girl, Catherine Breillat, Marie of the Bay of Angels, Manuel Prada), the actress, are actors she invents, she clarifies in an interview. Breillat even observes the man before him, a chaste man. Then, Breillat films shame and sexual mutilation, but also a great hope, a troubling dimension of ecstasy, a nudity of feelings, the halving of exhibitionism, playing to become one. The director should finally bring the actors to give their feelings, their body and their soul. Thus arranged, faced with the problem of the order of "who I am", the actors of Breillat put an inorganic vitality to merge in his work in progress. But, in terms of an incredible form of exorcism, for an actor, Breillat raises many questions. The actors, who are at the same time suffering a great deal, seem to be the ones who are looking for this loving transport to be part of the eternity of their work. <br /> <br /> The Art of Breillat is a researcher, to know how to engage in a dialogue aimed at pushing the limits of intimate scenes. Join the makeup, erect prosthetics and unions are reminiscent of what images and scenes of Jan Steen and Rembrandt could be in the anecdote and the daily life of characters on a set. While the moral categories disappear from the background of Sex Is Comedy, Breillat succeeds in revealing the power of loving imitation of the actors in a landscape of a tremendous and dramatic humanity.
