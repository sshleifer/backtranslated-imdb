I felt cheated to know the whole story. Although there may be a twist, this twist was so important that I felt betrayed. I think he could have called on a better writer who could better put together all the elements of the story. The writer could have revealed more "twists" throughout the film, rather than all at the same time in the end. That said, I think the actors did very well what they did, especially Matt Damon, who actually had a small character, small quirks that were not selfish or that looked like a flawless criminal who always know what he's doing. The other main characters were their own separate entities who had just talked to each other. The group's cohesion in Ocean's Eleven was gone.
