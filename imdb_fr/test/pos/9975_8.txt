this film has a decent story in my opinion, very good fight scenes but I was a little disappointed by the end of the film.I think it was better if lydie denier also knew karate or if she knew how to use weapons , her character became more interesting too and she was a decent opponent of Cynthia. All in all, I think fans of Cynthia Rothfield will be very happy watching this movie. This is not the type "yes, ma'am"! or sworn to justice, but it was pretty much fun and cynthia looks awesome in this movie, so my rate for this movie is a solid 8/10
