People at Aardman made a cool, cute and wild adaptation of their short films by Wallace and Gromit in the role of the man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more intelligence (or practicality) for the latter . In this case, they invented a machine capable of capturing all the rabbits who eat the crops in a quiet English village. Especially for Mrs. Tottington (or "Totty" for those who are "intimate"), to the chagrin of Victor Quartermaine, who only wants to kill all the rabbits with his trusty rifle. Wallace and Gromit seem to be successful with their machine, but Wallace is confused: a machine he made to make more food suddenly cuts himself off with a rabbit - the spell is cast! <br /> <br /> That's at least as much fun as a children's movie, but it's also a tribute to the oldest tradition of the classic cartoon slapstick: Looney Tunes, which is in turn owes a lot to silent comedy and vaudeville. Certainly, the guys at Aardman (Nick Park and Steve Box) have a lot more gadgets and tricks and ingenuity with their gear. It's never less surprising to see how they use stop motion, even when a joke or a gag can be a little funny on the side "ho-ho" not funny "ha-ha" (a tired critic but I ' I will say it). Curse of the Were-Rabbit works so well on all fronts, with its distorted narrative and sudden immersion in the exhibition (the scenario of the Golden Bullet is a doozy), Park and Box and his company never lose sight of the pleasure in the material. It's unclear and warm and completely offbeat for kids (even the youngest ones will love adventures and strange gadgets, such as the Wallace and Gromit truck circulate in), and for adults, there are small beards of funky and absurd tones. in the middle of a classic English farce. Only (and I'm probably a minority opinion here) compared to Chicken Run, it's almost a light job. There is less plot than series of gags, and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their rifles like Quartermaine expressed by Fiennes ). But when it hits the best, it's one of the most entertaining movies of 2005. That gives me a big, goofy smile every time you watch on TV.
