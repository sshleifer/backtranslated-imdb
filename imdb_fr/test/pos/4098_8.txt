I saw this movie when it came out in 1973 and I liked it. Since then, I've been looking for a video but I've never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it does not fit. This glamorous version just can not reach the production level of 1937. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, to listen alone, and I even bought a CD, but to my taste, it does not lend itself not good at this mysterious and fascinating story. All is not suitable. Michael York is lost here. Sally Kellerman throws a good performance but Olivia Hussy is just ridiculous and not worth dragging across the Himalayas. The best performance is Charles Boyer at the head of the Lama.
