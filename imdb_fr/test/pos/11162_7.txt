Hey, this Ralf Westhoff seems to know a lot about people! Nine women and nine men participate in a speed dating event. Each person has five minutes to talk to each of his interlocutors. A good idea to make a movie of these conversations. And even better: it works very, very well! The dialogue is spiritual, original and authentic, each person is subtly characterized, without falling into the trap of clichés, something unusual in German films, remember: all these years, we Germans, were tormented zeitgeistic idiotic comedies such as "Workaholic" or "Stadtgespräch". <br /> <br /> But now is the time for young German filmmakers to do what they want and take the risk of making films that are both entertaining and fun, intelligent and intelligent. The timing of "Shoppen" is good too: although it mainly presents the dialogue, it keeps the tension and the interest. After a while, you're really curious to see how this man and woman would do the trick. Some participants meet later for two people, it's fun to see them interact together in the "real life". Of course, the film has some disadvantages: it is not very cinematic (but such a movie can it be?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but all this is only marginal. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: We have very good actors here. Imagine this: all are still very unknown, even here in Germany (most are from the theater of Munich or Bavaria). But I predict that of the 18 main actors, at least 11 will soon become very well known in local films and television. It's great to see so many new faces at once talented. Well done! <br /> <br /> For those who want to read more, here is a summary of the 18 actors: (spoilers!) <br /> <br /> Sebastian Weber: The silent waters are deep! Memorize his monologue "Garden of flowers", you can win the heart of any woman with this one. <br /> <br /> Anna Böger: A woman's hell! Every time she opens her mouth, you can not help but laugh and feel good. Listen to her saying "asshole" and call the pink shirt guy a "Bürscherl"! <br /> <br /> Felix Hellmann: The "Bürscherl" from above is fun to watch. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many. His appearance reminded me somewhat of Flo Weber of "Sportfreunde Stiller". <br /> <br /> Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. His scene "you want children" is a classic. A great actress whom we will certainly hear again. <br /> <br /> David Baalcke: Is this guy a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in "Sideways". I hope this is not an interim method. <br /> <br /> Julia Koschitz: The "beautiful woman" in the circle. Julia was playing theater in my hometown, bravo! I think it will appear in many upcoming television series. <br /> <br /> Martin Butzke: The revolutionary guy finally surprises the cutest and most conventional woman. Would you like to share a taxi with this guy? <br /> <br /> Kathrin von Steinburg: She gave a great performance to "Tatort" last year. His trance performance in this film is not less. SEE her beautiful face and hear her dirty laugh. The best scene of the movie belongs to him. <br /> <br /> Matthias Bundschuh: I know these guys are "writing everything" back from school. I do not know if the hot blonde had her allergic reaction because of him or her cat. Matthias's portrait of such a chicken is remarkable. <br /> <br /> Mediha Cetin: The sister-in-law of my ex-girlfriend was the same person as her. The day I met her was the only day of my life when I needed tranquilizers, such bad memories here. <br /> <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: The "nice and desperate" circle. Limpinsel has a comic talent that is far better than most so-called "comics" on television. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wagner: The victim of the metaphor of Sebastian's "flower garden". Lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad at the same time, wow! <br /> <br /> Oliver Bürgin: The "handsome man" of the circle. No wonder he catches Julia in the end. These two are really together. I think he will appear in many upcoming television series. <br /> <br /> Julia Heinze: The "cute and conventional" woman. I hope it will not be underestimated: Julia's face goes from naive to hurting furious, it's great! <br /> <br /> Stephan Zinner: The "nature boy" from Partenkirchen likes to cook, eat ?? and good sex. Watch the body language between him and the hot blonde! Zinner usually plays the politician of the CSU Söder on stage! <br /> <br /> Anja Klawun: The "Merchant's Daughter" has good times, but I apologize, she fails (like most actors) to play drunk on an adventure screen. Christian Pfeil: plays the arrogant and narcissistic type. I could not believe that this very actor owns two art-house cinemas in Munich. <br /> <br /> Tanja Schleiff: Play the sleeping girl with every man around. I'm sure many male visitors will pick her up. I heard she could also play dramatic roles, so I'm curious.
