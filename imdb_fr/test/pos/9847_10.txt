It's the best movie on the stage I've ever seen. All the artists are former Turkish theater actors, they are beautiful in this film. It is sometimes said that "they do not play, they live it", you can really see it in this film. The director is also competent, you can not see a lot of cameras in motion, but the position of the cameras is also good. But after the actors play, the most remarkable part is the content of the film. This gives happiness, enthusiasm, the desire to live, the importance of true friends for people. We all started to live individually nowadays, in this film you see that there is someone other than us. And above all, you see that the most honorable thing in the world is to love, to love your friends, to love your darling. Everyone should see this movie ...
