I saw the film for the first time a few years ago and I was totally impressed, but its sensuality. It's one of the most touching films I've ever seen, although it may sound a bit pretentious and artificial - too good, if you will. Anyway, one thing is certain - the cameraman did a good job - each picture deserves to be cut and shown as a separate art peace, comparable to the paintings of Chirico or Bernard Buffet. <br /> <br /> The music forms a perfect background for the story, especially that of U2 played between the first and second novel on the beach. As for the cast, I can not be objective because I really like Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue and I can not add more to the praise of others. <br /> <br /> However, the very fact that many people (critical and sophisticated at the movies) criticized the film made me look with a more critical eye for the second time. No doubt, the setting is beautiful and the cast is beautiful. But it's not enough to make a complete and coherent film. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malcovic is somewhat superficial and does not say much about the motivations of the people involved - was it only to shoot a beautiful and sensual love scene with Marceau naked or what?). Apparently, this adds nothing to the idea of ​​the film and even the hoarse voice of Malcovic is not able to make the connection with the main plot. <br /> <br /> Other stories are more justified and are really beautifully shot, which indulges in many logical sophisms within them. The scene when Jean Reneau dominates the city through the large window of his apartment at the top of the tall building is absolutely incredible. The sensation of moist air and fine haze, which spreads from the first scene of "Ferrera", can literally be felt across the screen. Antonioni is undoubtedly a great master of nuances and half-nuances. My favorite novel is the last - the most romantic, the most profound and the most meaningful - I guess it's the one that most resembles Antonioni in the whole movie - almost a parable. Probably, the positive impression of the film is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small Italian town of Ghotic, with its narrow, winding streets and twisted sidewalks, its fountains with monumental drinking water cathedrals .. It was laconic but really touching. <br /> <br /> I hope my impressions and comments on the film, as chaotic as they are, would make someone spend an evening watching it (it works better with home theater, with someone caring on your side only in the movie theater). Enjoy. <br /> <br /> I beg your pardon for imperfect English and possible spelling mistakes.
