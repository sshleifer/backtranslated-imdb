Sensational. When I went to see this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, I did not know what I was living at all. This film takes you on an emotional roller coaster in the best sense of the word. Sigourney Weaver was better than I have seen in years; Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see that it will not be everyone's cup of tea, because sometimes it deals with hard things that can happen to a family. Do not get me wrong - it's really funny too - during my screening, the audience was bursting with applause after laughing a few times. I just think that if you are open to examining your own life, Imaginary Heroes will touch you sincerely. I can not wait until it comes out in theaters.
