I love horror movies, but I think they work much better when they hide a dramatic impact behind (The Devil's Backbone, The Exorcist, for example). It's that kind of movie, and it's not only weird and terrifying when it's necessary, it's also very beautiful. A tale of two sisters starts very slowly, so if you are in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes, you will be disappointed. In reality, it's not a ghost story, although there are some. It's something more complex, and it's done in a way that Ringu and The Grudge are not sweaty. A tale?? is a much smarter movie than these huge cultural hits because it really is about his characters and the direction is flawless. Every detail of this film will leave you breathless if you are the kind of person who likes to pay attention to detail while watching a movie. The acting is superb, especially from the mother-in-law and the main girl. These two are worth the ticket price alone. Do yourself a favor and watch this awesome movie.
