Ah the outer limits. I love this show. It was incredibly scary or mysterious. I liked every genre of the series, from horror to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started looking good after it was canceled, when science fiction showed it was like a replay, or played marathons. It was really a good show, I do not know everything about the seasons and everything, but I remember that every time I saw the screen panic and the voice on television said, "There is nothing wrong With your television, do not try to adjust the image "I would cry with joy. It was a good show and I like to watch if it is. I give him a healthy 8 out of 10.
