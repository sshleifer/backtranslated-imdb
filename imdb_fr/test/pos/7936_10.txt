I liked this movie since the first time I saw it so many years ago. I do not know how many times I saw him, maybe 10 or maybe 20. This last time, I was struck by a detail that I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> Towards the end At the end of the photo, the murdered heroes are brought back to town by sledge. There are two close-ups of the dead men. The one who struck me the most was a shot of the blonde youth. All you see on the screen is his profile, from head to toe. His hands hold a flickering candle. The wind blows and its thick blond hair dances in the wind, in tune with the flame of the candle. The contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful. The moving hair and the candle flame remind us of the life force that once inhabited his body. <br /> <br /> Every time I revisit this film, I see something new.
