This film is a great example of the great entertainment of the 80s. Oh, make no mistake, most of the music at the time was nil. I've never liked anything but 80s metal bands. Groups that had bullets. Forget that wheezy keyboard shit and all that "life is horrible and I want to die" garbage. But the films of the 80s are the best. They were all absurd and had a good time. This film illustrates that! Party! Get naked! To get laid! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!
