People who do not like this film seem to have an academic vendetta against it - those of us who do not own the original can take full advantage of it. <br /> <br /> My husband who never saw the original said "I do not want to see a movie girly." I assured him that "women" is just a fantastic film, not a female film. He had a good time. He was very happy to have enjoyed the movie "boy" that we saw the day before, "burn after reading". <br /> <br /> SPOILER: I even think the new ending is better. Maybe not so much fun, but it was beautiful. At first, I did not understand why they had made some changes to the plot, but when I was finished and Debra Messing gave birth and brought the first man in the movie, I cried. It's a thing to love in men ?? they are our sons.
