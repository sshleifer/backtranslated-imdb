It's a beautiful movie. Gross and sublimely moving. It sounded like a very captivating and intelligent theatrical piece (but without the overly theatrical feeling that you actually feel while watching people on a stage) playing on the terror of a white lie that degenerates into monstrous consequences. All the main actors are fascinating. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart in the end ... and everyone else judged by the amount of trial and error for the tissues and hands that go up in men's and women's faces. Julian Fellowes still triumphed. It's a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now. Can he not be wrong ?! GO AND SEE This is a movie for real adults.
