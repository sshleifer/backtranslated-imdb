The four-season merchant is a film about a lack of love. The film begins with the main character; Hans Epp, returning from a spell in the foreign legion. He goes back to his mother's house without being told how much she loves him or how much he misses her. but to be told that it is worthless and, worse still, that she would have preferred the man with whom he had gone back to the place. It's the character's relationship with women that makes this movie so obnoxious. the fact that his wife is taller than him symbolizes his relationship with the other sex; he is constantly humiliated by them, and it is by his relations with him that his life is not as beautiful as it could have been. This is also evident in the way he treats his wife after a drink. He lost his job as a policeman due to the lust of a woman and even his wife; a woman who is supposed to love her never really shows her affection. Even in the end, his wife is more concerned about what her daughter and daughter will do than her husband's condition. <br /> <br /> The Four Seasons Dealer is a very uncomfortable film. There is not a scene in the movie where someone is happy, not just that; but the film seems deliriously happy to sink into the misery of its central characters. The film is certainly not recommended for anyone going through a difficult time, that's for sure. Despite all the misery, the film never goes beyond the limits of reality. every event in this film can - and most likely happened - and this only serves to make the film more shocking. The film is, of course, directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; the cult German director who committed suicide in 1982. This is only my second taste of the work of man, but thanks to two films, it is easy to get an idea of ​​the type of art he creates . Both films are oppressed and realistic, but realistic works of art. His characterization in this film is subtle; we never discover the characters except by their difficult situation and not by their character. It's a very clever way to show the audience that it's their environment that defines the characters in the movie, not the characters themselves - and almost everyone who sees the movie knows what life is like in a society urban, it will be difficult for most people to report. <br /> <br /> The four-season merchant is not a film that is easily forgotten; the film is rich in substance and not very stylish, which makes it an unforgettable image, that all those who consider themselves fans of cinema should experiment. It is in this spirit that I recommend this film at the highest level. it's not sweet and it's not nice, but you will not see a more realistic depiction of depression, and it's definitely a movie that will stay with you.
