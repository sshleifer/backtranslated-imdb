I have lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie, but I love it and find it very funny every time I see it. The facial expressions, burlesque humor and joke timing make it great. The characters, including "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik" are hilarious. I think Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern have done a great job. In fact, I think this film was perfectly shot. I think it has to be published on DVD before I wear my VHS version.
