A beautiful movie. One that made me think of God but do not feel guilty or outdated. Makes me think of death but do not fear it, think about life but do not hide it. A film that has given both love for everything I defend and condemns it at the same time to the depths of hell. A film that made me think of love and all that I lost, but no sadness has honored my eyes, for some strange reason, a relief. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a good shot of wine and irony! I highly recommend ***** <br /> <br /> "When the S *** hits the fan, take a tent" Oh, we should all go camping. Everyday.
