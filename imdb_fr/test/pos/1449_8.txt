I have never been so surprised by such an old movie. Only "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" resists this performance. As a person who saw heroin addiction first-hand, I was shocked by the realism of this film. Frank Sinatra's performance is totally uncompromising, realistic and heartbreaking. The staging of Otto Preminger is perfect for the film, with long shots and a very mobile camera. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's performances are good, as are Eleanor Parker's performances. In fact, the whole basic cast works very well, with discrete performances, as it suits the style of this movie. The documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date. Strongly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8.0 out of 10
