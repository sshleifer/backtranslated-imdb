This film has improved over time. I can not believe it's been 40 years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, it's true. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could get into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a child of my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King have been killed, but the following summer, a man was walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was an opportunity for the Woodstock nation to stick to the man. You will see where Robert Downey, Jr. got his sardonic brilliance. His old man was an instant hero for kids like me. This classic is not unanimous and aging hippies will rejoice when they relive this time. Let us hope that new children of flowers will be emboldened and that this era of fascism will be subject to the same scrutiny that my era has been subjected to.
