Big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. But looking at that, I thought of something. Some of the events that occur in this movie are incredible. So, really, the movie is a kind of big lie. There was no way he could get away with it all. Here are all the incredible things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he pretends, his father chokes on a meatball and acts as if he is the father. Jason (Frankie Munez) could not have gotten away with this. Fortunately for us, he did not do it. So, that did not fit with that, the scandalous. <br /> <br /> 2. Even if the grandmother was blind, she could have understood that it was not her granddaughter. <br /> <br /> 3.They could not get on the plane, fly to Los Angeles, act as if they were coats sellers, sneak into the studio, then, and then ... Part of the movie is a bit incredible. But it does not hurt to say a little white lie. Trust me, I do it all the time. <br /> <br /> A big fat liar, though incredibly incredible, is fun. It's also very fun. But let me just say one thing before continuing this review. If Paul Giamatti was not in this film, it would be really bad. It would be horrible. Big fat liar is also quite funny, although cheesy sometimes. I lift my thumbs. <br /> <br /> Fat liar: *** / ****
