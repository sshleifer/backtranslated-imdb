I watch the show every day and it's a lot of fun. It provides updates of new techniques, video games just about any geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, players or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely improved their game since the comment of the guy below me (2006). This is the only place where I receive my technical information. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work wonderfully and the show always includes segments referring to elements of the game, film, comics ... Universe. If you know these worlds, you will understand the jokes. In short, Aots is a hilarious show that gives me, to everyone, all the news of everything that matters to you. I'm watching her as I tap this, they're 'in' San Diego and cover the Red Bull air races. Sugar.
