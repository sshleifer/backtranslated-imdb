This show is my absolute favorite. This show is smart, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mom who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines in the skin of the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind in Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I like the spiritual dialogue, that's what makes it unique in the show. Kelly Bishop is mean like Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is great like Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy because Luke Danes and the band members are unique. The community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and the others are always laughing, funny, funny and interesting, which always makes it possible to distinguish the players with a keen one. This show has changed so much over the years that it will never age. Gilmore Girls is an original and intelligent show that allows you to watch. That's how good it is. I give this show a rating of 10/10.
