I saw this one for the first time when it was shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really scared me, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of all the feeling of a suspense story recorded on video (the same thing that helped Dark Shadows) . And the casting was so fair. I know very little about Shane Briant, so maybe it's not fair to call him a beaver, but for me he's Dorian Gray. And as for other male actors, Nigel Davenport (who is so good at "larger-than-life" characters) is the one who has done so well as Sir Henry. And John Karlen, a kind of "repertoire player" of Dan Curtis at the time, because of Dark Shadows. As a poster emphasizes, this version manages to include relationships with men in a rather subtle way. The scene where Dorian recites a list of men's names from John Karlen's character, as a means of making him sing, and the look on Karlen's face were very well done. (If this scene were done now, it would probably be VERY EVOLVING, and would be bad in comparison.) Famous version of 1945 (which is deservedly famous) is the version for me.
