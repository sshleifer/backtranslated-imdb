Shame is a highlight in a master's career. Ingmar Bergman, a penetrating existential study of a couple from Gotland Island that is set to survive a long war. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give painfully detailed performances in this dreadful drama. The intensity of the film lies in the fact that Bergman remains focused on the intimate and meticulous relationships of his two characters - accomplished musicians - trapped in a landscape they have ceased to understand. We see how the external pressures of war complicate and corrode their relations. The material circumstances of the war force the two characters to betray their own sense of ethics. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of cinematic support by showing a filmed interview of Ullman's character that has been re-edited and distorted to have a political effect by one side of the conflict. and used by the other party as evidence of war crimes during a brutal interrogation. <br /> <br />
