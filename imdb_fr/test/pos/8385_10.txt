... "Inglorious" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It's a great cinema. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to recommend this film to everyone except the most disgusting. Never let them know what they are missing. <br /> <br /> I hesitated to give ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In any case, save "Reservoir Dogs", they have improved thanks to additional monitoring. <br /> <br /> So even though I gave him ten stars, I did it reluctantly. It does not leave me alone. <br /> <br /> Yes, Christoph Waltz is the Nazi that we all imagined to be the worst. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and very sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who extinguishes his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it in the whipped cream as if he scratched himself the heel. victim. <br /> <br /> To understand Tarantino's films, all you need is a sense of dialogue, color and rhythm. The colors are as bright as necessary and, if necessary, more vivid. In the French farm house of the opening scene, they are muffled and dark, but excessively. Outside, a bright sun shines, but in one of the rooms of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black. <br /> <br /> It is a brilliant framework for an interrogation by Waltz, as a "Jewish hunter" of the SS, who swings his French host peasant on the edge of the precipice by revealing what he can not to reveal repeatedly, then withdraws him with obsequious bonds of friendship and understanding. <br /> <br /> A second sadistic German, well played by August Diehl, later plays the role of major player in the final plot. The Nazi Major of Diehl, who has a keen ear to German accents, is almost as good as Waltz ... almost. <br /> <br /> Film classes will study this film a lot. They should look with love at the superb stimulation. Tarantino knows how long it takes to draw a scene, creating a suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then, just at the moment of the break, taking a sudden resolution. <br /> <br /> For the color, look for the latest shot at The French Theater, where its secretly Jewish owner is organizing a surprise for the upper echelons of the Nazi leadership. <br /> <br /> We see it, played by Melanie Laurent, waiting for the hated German dignitaries who will arrive for a glimpse of the film of the latest German film masterpiece, a propaganda article about a German hero and its dubious achievements. <br /> <br /> Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the magnificent theater, his red lips and low dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of his creations on his guests. It's a single plan that deserves an entire movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there are many more such images, many more scenes of exquisite dialogue and suspense. <br /> <br /> In short, see it I'm sure you'll see it again and again.
