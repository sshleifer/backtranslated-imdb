This musical has a deep meaning that is appreciated only by a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most people call madness. <br /> <br /> This music could regain its popularity as the consciousness of the world grows. It is a country "far from everything" where "living beings have room to grow". Its inhabitants "live and grow together" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age. <br /> <br /> The words help us to recognize the relativity of this "turning world" and to "look within yourself, what is where the truth is always." The absolute level of consciousness is more real as the world of the senses constantly evolving. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for video for years. When I find it or it comes out on DVD, it will help me to "share the joy" of being in "Shangri-la" again. The music of Burt Bacharach and the words of Hal David were a masterpiece in these turbulent times, ready to be fully appreciated. <br /> <br /> May this CD inspire you to find your own "Lost Horizon" or recognize it when "peace of mind" has found you. - LostHorizon.org
