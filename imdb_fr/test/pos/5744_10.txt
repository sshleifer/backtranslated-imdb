Well, here we go, you've probably read in previous reviews of this movie that it's horrible, badly done, avoid at all costs. Well, I guess in some ways it's true, it's fair to say that you can not write spoiler in this comment because there is no plot to spoil. However, there is a fine line between terrible plain and absolutely hilarious and believe me, this film is the latter. The acting is so bad, the plot so non-existent and the end so completely disconcerting that it will make you laugh all the time. There are scenes in this film that push comedy to another level. Do not expect an Oscar, but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster, it is worth it.
