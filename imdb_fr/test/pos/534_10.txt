Having myself 15, I enjoyed this movie! I was talking more with the character Ann August than most of them. My mother is not as eccentric as Ad√®le, but the feeling of loneliness is the same. This movie is perfect for both Natalie and the visual aspect, and Susan's performances are so intertwined that it's the best dual-screen I've seen in years. Their chemistry gives life to the characters, they become real people! I would recommend this film to anyone hoping to escape. Because there are really a lot of people who would like to be "Everywhere but here", including me! and if you can, watch this movie with your best friend or mother. These are the tears that mix everyone around you more !!
