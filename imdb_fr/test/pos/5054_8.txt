I was delighted when I saw that my husband had rented "Labyrinth of Passion". I love Almodovar's films. We both loved the movie. We could not both stop laughing. We particularly enjoyed the scene in which the transvestite is shooting a photo novel, and while he was supposed to be threatened by a murderer with an electric drill, he was told to answer the phone and say, " I can not talk to you now, I 'am attacked by a sadistic serial killer. If I survived, I'll call you back. "(That would make a great answering machine message to think about it.) We also loved the lady saying," I went to an orgy after the concert but I could not do it. " to stop thinking about you. "(I'm waiting to use this line on Twitter)" Labyrinth of Passion "is a delirious farce with many high jinks, a hilarious dialogue and a feast for the eyes. : The costumes and hairstyles of the 1980s add to the wacky I would give it a score of 10 out of 10, but I would give it an 8 for two reasons.The first is the scene that includes laxatives and that includes the plan of a lady getting dirty: it's totally useless, and it reduces the tone of the movie to the crude comedy of Hollywood for a moment, the second is the suggestion that Queti sleeps with his father: shocking, yes, but still a time, it spoils the tone of the film, but I will recommend It's the movie to anyone who wants a sophisticated, spicy and fun moment.
