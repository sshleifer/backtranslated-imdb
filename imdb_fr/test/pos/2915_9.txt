This is not what we could call a happy tale. The main character entitled (Edmund Purdom as THE Egyptian) does not get the love - although he gets (?) Obviously the last word, the otherwise tragic main figure (Michael Wilding as a politically shortsighted pharaoh) ends tragically, and the wrong guy ?? even if it's Victor Mature, wins all the balls. Peter Ustinov may have had the best role (Kafka) and may have stolen part of the film, if not most of the content of the film, with the exception of Jean Simmons, a barmaid a little more brilliant than the average (Merit) that may have more to offer. balloon ?? intellectually and spiritually, than all the others gathered together. <br /> <br /> Sinuhe the sinuante and pessimist doctor (it's Purdom) is described as a dark, cynical and tortured soul, who spends all the intrigue ?? his life, seeking the meaning of "life". (By the way, and to paraphrase John Lennon, "life" is what happens when you make other plans.) Forgive the lack of philosophical depth in the previous parenthetical commentary, but the plot eventually unveils itself to reveal it ! <br /> <br /> And speaking philosophically, as if things were not so gloomy and negative, John Carradine (the role of the nameless burglar) appears in a cameo role in the middle of the film marrying this "life" is fundamentally meaningless and worth living only as a mediocre alternative to ultimate disappointment. <br /> <br /> So we have over 200 words and I did not really have a kind word, so why on earth did I rate it so high? Well, there are many Shakespherian tragedies and moral values. There are ethical contrasts, true friendships, a true love and not shared (almost) and, despite the limitations of production capacity of the 50s, the scene is very well staged, pleasing to the eye and the eye. ear and rhythmically balanced. The acting game is, for the most part, consistently very good ?? Given that it is a costumed drama of the 50s, and that the interactions are credible to the fatal flaws of the characters - which abound and do justice to the best of the Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> There is some redemption, Sinuhe discovers and kisses his son ?? Tommy Retigg who, despite all the efforts of Ustinov, really needed Lassie to succeed. Two other souls "lost" have their just dessert - ?? the 'foreign' pot of meat Nefer (Bella Darvi) ?? apparently in Egypt with a carnal exploitation study visa, which before had cruelly even despised Sinuhe - and Princess Baketamon (the awesome dykeish) (who knew a very dark secret about Sinuhe's ancestry), and then tried to use it to put it against his friend, his brother the pharaoh ?? Nice people, huh. <br /> <br /> The performances of Purdom are really to be seen. He removes the motion pretty well so that somewhere before the end of the shoot, you want to hit him hard on the pus, grab him by the backhand and say: "Look at you, model, get closer, the glass is not is not half empty, it is half full! " and then find that you are personally disappointed with Horemheb - truly Sinuhe's best friend, (Victor Mature as Pharoah's best soldier) for himself, having this defect in his character that prevents him from achieving anything positive . <br /> <br /> I wonder if the secret of all the film is that it succeeds very quickly, then supports the "suspension of the disbelief" necessary and brings you early to understand and to worry for the characters to the point that you feel really sorry for it. and their missed chances of happiness; a happiness that otherwise was not so far from their reach. <br /> <br /> ?? I do not understand why this one is not already released on DVD and I hope that it will be corrected quickly.
