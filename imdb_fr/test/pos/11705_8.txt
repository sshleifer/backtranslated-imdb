This is the first feature film by Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote the film with his brother Richard with the help of John Clarke, another comedian and actor. Mick and John also have lead roles with several other iconic Australian actors - Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson et al. The basic premise of the film is that the slimy Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) became a member of a Lawn Bowls club for the sole purpose of getting free parking close to his job. The club is in a difficult financial situation and asks Jack to help him. John Clarke plays the scam of the club - he tries to take it and turn it into Jack "Poker Machine Slum" and the other members of the group unite to try to save the club with many fun twists and a possible redemption of Jacks. . It's a pretty smart little movie. He is well above the usual humor of Mick Molloy's gutters. It's pretty well written and well done. The older Australian actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter, Monica Maughan and Frank Wilson and Gold). The film winds rather than going at the speed of the neck, but it adds to the charm of the film. There is a bad language of low level.
