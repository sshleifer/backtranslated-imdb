I guess it's called Southern Gothic. <br /> <br /> It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci and also Justin Timberlake is featured in a role. Timberlake did a good job, to my surprise, I did not expect it. <br /> <br /> When you are lost and you can not find a way back home, it's the groan of the black snake. <The people in this film are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those whom they trusted and loved and filled with pain. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson plays a singer / blues musician - whose wife has disheveled with his brother and has now left him for his brother, with the abortion of a child he hoped to have with her. <br /> <br /> The character of Christina Ricci is a woman who was sexually abused in her youth - it turned her into a self-destructive nymphomaniac; allowing men to mistreat her. <br /> <br /> The story is at the crossroads of the life of these two characters. It's a love story, but not a story of sexual love between them - the old black man and the young white woman. <br /> <br /> It's different from most movies that Hollywood crushes. <br /> <I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
