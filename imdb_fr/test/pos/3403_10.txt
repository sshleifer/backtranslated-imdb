I absolutely loved this film as a child and still do it as an adult. To say that is even a euphemism. My sister, my brother and I watched it for a year at our grandparents' house during the Christmas holidays. They had recorded it from the television. Our parents were happy that it kept us busy for one night, but they thought we would get bored and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became fascinated. They could not have taken off if they tried. It has become a cherished annual tradition. We loved everything: time, romance, battle scenes, bad guys, and so on. <br /> <br /> Come on, who can resist the hate of this Bent psychopath with his constant SIR? Classic! Plus, who can resist cheering when Justin falls off the balcony ?! What a triumphant moment! I have always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme song alone can make me tear up a bit. This film is incredibly moving and I challenge anyone to stick to the end. It's worth it!!
