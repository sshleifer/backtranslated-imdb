This film is about Carlos "The Jackal" (Quinn), an international terrorist who, according to the description of CIA agent Henry Fields (Sutherland), seems to maim women and children for the devil. At least, that's what he says to force US Navy officer Annibal Ramirez (again Quinn) to assume the role of Carlos and place him as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB. Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos but mentally, he is his antithesis. He was born of order and Carlos of chaos. <br /> <br /> The film is not just a bloody action, and it's a good thing. During his first half, Ramirez follows a drive to act and think like Carlos. This is where the film differs from other ordinary action movies. Israeli agent (Kingsley) joins Fields as part of Ramirez training. Together, they seem to assume the role of parents at the birth of the new character Ramirez. We learn to Ramirez not to like the things that Carlos does not like, to act at the split second as Carlos would, and even to make love like Carlos (courtesy of an ex-girlfriend of Carlos). Naturally, everything that one teaches him would be put to profit in the second half of the film. It's a little artificial, but Quinn gives a captivating performance as Carlos-wannabe. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I liked in this movie was that he did not use the much used plot in the evil movies of twins - you know, the one in which the evil twin is inflamed in the family of the good twin. Ramirez's family comes on the scene, but they emphasize on the contrary how his new character is wreaking havoc in his family life. <br /> <br /> A good joke humor is injected into this film, often coming from the sore duo of Sutherland and Kingsley. An exception is the overused and apparently gratuitous joke about Ramirez's first name (Annibal, Annabelle, included?). In addition, the duo constantly emphasized the power, intelligence and intelligence of Carlos. In my opinion, during the final showdown, the fallout was not up to par. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big fan of action movies, but this movie was smarter and more captivating than the average action movie and caught my attention throughout its life. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
