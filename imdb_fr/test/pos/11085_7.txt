My dad already worked with some very secret information in the DIA and he told me about this film. When I was a child, I always asked him what would happen if he gave secrets and he recommended this film. <br /> <br /> In the movie, he really puts 2, almost completely different friends! in an entanglement, they never really knew what the result would be. The snowman, Daulton, really made me crack because the movie portrayed him as a simple drug dealer who did not know what he was arguing about, and in the movie it seemed like he had the worst. The hawk, Chris is just a guy who wanted to express his feelings about the US government in a very radical vision. <br /> <br /> For movie buffs, it's a must!
