I just watched the 08th MS Gundam again for the second time. It's so much better than Gundam Wing. I can not wait to get the DVD and see what was published in the series. It's great to see the Gundams move clumsily around the country. Someone really thought about writing this move script. <br /> <br /> See this today,.
