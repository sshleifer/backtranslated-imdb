It was a really epic production that had all the elements you would want in a fantastic movie. The costumes, the music, the cinematography - all the artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and offered a rich experience. <br /> <br /> Ted Danson, best known for his televised roles in "Cheers" and "Becker", was excellent in the role of Gulliver. Mary Steenburgen (Time After Time, Cross Creek) played just as well in her limited role as wife. <br /> <br /> The other performances I really enjoyed were James Fox, Dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard and Queen Brobdingnag, and Peter O'Toole as Emperor of Lilliput. <br /> <br /> This would make a nice children's movie, but would also appeal to adults for its in-depth social commentary.
