This film has one of the best club scenes, very good soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music) <br /> <br /> certain situations (as the main character Carl starts to use drugs for example) are a bit out of reality, but the plot is entertaining, but the characters are all a little superficial ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend you to watch this movie if you do not like it techno music <br /> <br /> For the plot / play alone, this movie is a 4/10, with the really cool special effects and the club scenes and the soundtrack, this is a 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies, listen to beautiful titles and grab a little club, it's a 10/10. <br /> <br /> the special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (that is to say fast moving clouds / sun / moon, changing background, cuts that change) <br /> <br /> For my part, I loved that, too bad there is no dance floor at the cinema;)
