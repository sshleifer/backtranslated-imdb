This is one of my favorite movies of all time, cheap, nerdy and vampire B. <br /> <br /> The model of Calvin Klein underwear ... oh, I mean, Stefan the Good vampire, returns to Transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty, but his half-brother Radu, manicurist and eternally slobbery, has other plans. After killing their father, the vampire king, Radu now turns to Stefan, his deadly new girlfriend, Michelle, and his two lovely friends, and the all-powerful Bloodstone. <br /> <br /> Okay, the scenery is beautiful and it should be like it was shot on site in Transyl-fricken-vania for the gods. The actresses are not great and Stefan the Heroic Vampire is as charming as chilled fireplace poker, but we do not care! There is only one reason to watch this movie, and its name is RADU! It is a physical tribute to Nosferatu and he has the best replicas of the film, all spoken in the hoarse voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. The cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as Radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his smiling, bleating face to the world. I found myself encouraging him as he gathered victims and mocked his perfect brother. But maybe I'm just a sick person. Aside from the dubious taste in men, I highly recommend this movie to vampire lovers. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen in a long time ... much more fun than the crying, crying Undead kids who endlessly adorn the horror screens of our days. Radu loves his sadism and never apologizes. He is what a vampire should be.
