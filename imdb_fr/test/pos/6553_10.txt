Uzumaki has a very unique story and I will never look at the spirals again in the same way. This film does not really have the horror of tingling in the backbone, it has the atmosphere of a dark acidic journey. Was it just me or did you see vortex visuals? The shots are interesting and the film gives free rein to your imagination. The weird supernatural sensation of this film attracts you as the title suggests. Playing is well done and the decor of the city itself seems to start badly. <br /> <br /> It may take some viewing to sink. A fantastic movie.
