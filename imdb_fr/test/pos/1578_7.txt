Kazuo Komizu strikes again with "Entrails of a Beautiful Woman", the sequel to "Entrails of a Virgin". This time, the story is based on a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to take the Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a doped and raped patient who finally gets to her door. When she gets above her head and the Yakuza capture her, she learns how their girls are insidious and drug themselves to sell them into slavery. This apparently ends badly when she has taken an overdose of cocaine. But it soon merges with another body to be eliminated to become "dum, dum, dum". "Super Slime Hermaphrodite Zord"! That is she who makes minced meat from yakuza and saves the day, not really. <br /> <br /> Well, it's better than "Madmen of the Virgin", but not much. Most of the film (67 minutes) consists of rape and sex with mist and the usual material. Almost towards the end, we finally have our dance rhythm with some cool sequences (like a monster-inspired monster penis through the stomach scene and sticky asphyxiation), but it still suffers from a very low budget feel which makes it fun but can elevate it from the base rate of horror.
