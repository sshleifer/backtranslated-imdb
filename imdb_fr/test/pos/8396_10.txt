My mother is as carried away by the wind as possible. She has collectible plates, Rhett and Scarlett Madame Alexander dolls, GWTW Christmas decorations, and even a GWTW recipe book! My sister and I had only seen fragments of GWTW but we knew the plot by heart. On a whim, my sister bought this miniseries thinking that my mother would like it and we were interested after having flipped through the novel. <br /> <br /> Yesterday we decided to watch Gone With The Wind and Scarlett. We started GWTW around 2.30am and finished it at 6.30am. We started Scarlett right after. My mother usually goes to bed around 10 am, she ended up staying up to an hour and a half with us to finish it! We were riveted! I love the film's debut at Melanie's funeral, where Scarlett stopped by saying, "I'll think about it tomorrow." Scarlett does not stay long in Georgia, she runs to Charleston on her quest to win him back. Rhett is not happy when he finds Scarlett at home, so he goes off to plant the family. Scarlett, who is Scarlett, follows him and they finally agree to put aside their quarrels for a moment to contain the gossip. Rhett begins to enjoy his company and takes him on his boat. A storm rises and they sink. He helps her to swim to the shore of an island. Terrified of having died, Rhett is worried until she wakes up. When she does, they are both trained in the moment and make love. Scarlett wakes up the next day in Charleston but Rhett is gone and writes that he thinks it would be better if they never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Scarlett is heartbroken and when she does, she does something wrong, In this case, Anne Hampton sees her alone in a hotel room with Ashley. Nothing happens, but her reputation is stained so Scarlett goes to Savannah with her two aunts unmarried. She soon discovers she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right moment to tell Rhett. In Savannah, she meets many members of her O'Hara family and grows up as a cousin, especially a Colum father. She will soon get her divorce notice from Rhett and then decide to never tell her about her baby just to upset him. Typical scarlett. <br /> <br /> She decides to go to Ireland to make sure that Rhett will never be able to discover her condition. She meets many more parents and buys a beautiful ancestral home, Ballyhara. All the while, Rhett is courting Anne. It's on Halloween that Scarlett receives notice that Rhett has remarried. She starts doing her job that night. <br /> <br /> The film passes a year later and Scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. Lord Richard Fenton pursues her, who is really an evil man, forcing a girl named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Scarlett meets Rhett and Anne again at a horse fair. After an accident on horseback, Scarlett has a conversation with Anne and learns that she and Rhett are going to have a baby. With a broken heart, Scarlett leaves and goes to Dublin with Fenton. As I said, she cultivates a relationship with him. She does silly things when she is heartbroken. <br /> <br /> Mary Boyle discovered that she was pregnant and asked Colum for help. The priest exhorts Fenton to help the girl and the girl kills him after Colum warns him. Fenton convinces Scarlett to go to London with him to escape his grief after Colum's death. Mary asks to accompany him. Back in Charleston, Anne died of yellow fever. It is clearly stated that she never took the child to Rhett. <br /> <br /> In London, Scarlett sees Fenton's true colors after he has hurt her when she is not in the mood to sleep with him. Fenton rapes her after she tells him that she would never want to see him again. She falls unconscious after and when she wakes up, Fenton was stabbed to death. Scarlett is accused of his murder. <br /> <br /> Rhett hears about it and flees to England with Sally. Fearing the gallows, Scarlett has no choice but to talk to Rhett about their daughter. Rhett is furious with her for keeping such a secret but stays to help him. Mary Boyle, the real murderer, can not be found. Scarlett is found guilty but Mary finally arrives to declare her innocence. After promising to help Mary, Scarlett leaves with Rhett for Ireland because, as he says, "it's time for me to meet my daughter." The scene where he sees Kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed and the two are finally reconciled completely and admit that they still love each other deeply. <br /> <br /> After seeing GWTW, I'll say yes, Vivian Leigh was a better Scarlett, but I liked the character of Scarlett in this movie than in the first. The reason being that in GWTW, you do not know why you like Scarlett. She is so cruel to Rhett and haughty and spoiled, but you love her quick wit. In Scarlett, you see how much she has changed. Oh, she is still in luxury, but she is no longer haughty. You see how she becomes a true mother to Kat and a generous person to the poor of Ireland. Joanne Whalley does a great job playing this new aspect of Scarlett. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but you sometimes swear that you can see the original Rhett in him. <br /> <br /> If you just sit and not compare Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable will definitely enjoy this movie. It's a chance to compare yesterday's Scarlett, the one it becomes after "tomorrow".
