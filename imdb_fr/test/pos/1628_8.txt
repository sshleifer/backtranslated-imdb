This is a fitting adaptation of Dan Brown's breathtaking book. I can not say it's novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better. The film is quite long but in the end I felt like I was missing something. The sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Playing was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who have not read the book, things may seem to go too fast. From my point of view, instead of trying to put so many items in the book, they could have tried to make the important scenes more properly. What makes the book very good is the whole puzzle, associated with the excellent portrait of the Vatican. You do not see anything in the movie. Too much haste and time use not in a good way, these are the main problems of the film. So, it is worth looking at but could have been better done.
