Television produces dozens of real crime movies every year. You can watch 3 or 4 every Saturday on the Lifetime website and use Court TV a few times per weekend. So I started to watch The Morrison Murders thinking that I knew what to expect: a more or less competent account of a real family murder. What I got was a subtle and beautifully played drama that captivated me end to end. <br /> <br /> The two brothers were totally convincing and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in Luke's difficult role. Georgia's appearance was in almost every frame. If I had a complaint, it was Gordon Clapp as sheriff. He does not look like Byron Calhoun, a lawyer from the south of a small southern town. It looks and sounds like Medavoy, and Medavoy is not good for this part. <br /> <br /> But that's a small note: Morrison's murder is worth watching, not just a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you go out, stick it. You will not regret it.
