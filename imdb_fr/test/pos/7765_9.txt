This is my favorite movie that portrays African Americans in a totally different light. because it shows a different side of African Americans that it is not shown in the movies. it's not the gang bang, the urban ghetto or having to deal with deep racial problems, it captivates the very essence of being young and trying to succeed and having a hard time lowering guard and let someone in your life, and the whole bohemian The atmosphere gives this great contact that makes it all awesome, it's a great script that captivates you and you simply get involved in the character. perfect casting with a lot of chemistry and very good acting and I have not always seen any movie with black characters that are represented in this format, the only one that gets closer is "Sprung" but since it's a comedy, he loses it very quickly I give this film 9 out of 10 and I would like them to continue making movies with this kind of attitude towards African Americans.
