Many BDIM users seem to have stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the Canadian "Showcase Network". Like many of you, I also sucked in and watched the whole movie. At first, I was fascinated by the alphabetical dialogue and twisted sense of humor that the film is rich in. I rode comfortably on a sort of wave "Kevin Smith meets Killer Films" until halfway through the film when the movie really folded in on itself and explored its themes in more detail ... in a resolute tone darker and more poignant. Far from being removed from the experience, I was taken further. This film is not the best of its kind and will certainly not be universally appealing ... so I understand some of the most negative reactions. But I bought ... and I really enjoyed it. The "backtracking" movement in the timeline was effective, the characters were well understood and the issues raised were human, accessible (in my experience anyway) and interesting. I was quite impressed by the film's ability to stay soft, funny and entertaining without running away from controversial topics or language, dynamics and rough emotional situations. This film is an excellent antidote to much of the schlock that has permeated the romantic / spiritual romantic genre. A kind of Brigitte Jones man for the literate sect. Take 2 hours off of your busy schedule and enter the world of Wirey ... or you could rent "You've Got Mail", because if you feel like it, you will not like it anyway! Those of us who liked it will be fine without you on our side ...
