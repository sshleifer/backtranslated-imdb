After seeing Kieslowski's feature film from this episode of "The Decalogue" a few years ago, we came back to the viewer when we looked at the ten complete vignettes. As in other films, this one is loosely based on the fifth commandment, or "You will not kill". <br /> <br /> Kryzsztof Kieslowski, writing with Kryzsztof Piesewicz, took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a heinous crime by murdering an innocent person to express his own frustrations. This opus has a Dostoevskian character that constantly reminds us of "Crime and Punishment", or at least some of the qualities of the novel are transmitted to the aimless youth who, apparently, has no redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The story shows the young man as he walks the streets of the city without a clear idea of ​​what to do or where to go. The only tender moment he displays is when he goes to the photographer to ask him to restore an old photo of his sister. Kieslowski drops the fate of getting the murderer into a taxi with the intention of stealing the driver, but it is his anger and frustration that drives the best of this youth to kill a man who does not deserve to die. The last moments of this criminal are one of the most captivating sequences of all the movies, past or present. <br /> <br /> The other element of the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal. Nothing can prevent the court from condemning the young man to death. The lawyer feels at the end of the failure of his client and speaks to the judge to determine where he was wrong. The young man only asks him to retrieve the picture and send it to his mother. <br /> <br /> Kieslowski's account of how he interprets the Fifth Commandment is a surprising film that will remain in the viewer's mind for a long time. after this episode is forgotten.
