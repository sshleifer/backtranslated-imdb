I knew the premise of this movie and I obviously can not miss a good movie, especially the director of "Master of Suspense", Sir Alfred Hitchcock. By and large, tennis champion Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets an eccentric stranger, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), on a train traveling from Washington to New York. Bruno speaks of a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno "suggests" to exchange murders. Obviously, Guy did not take him seriously until his wife, Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) was found murdered in an amusement park. Of course, Guy is the main suspect, and Bruno continues to "bump" him by reminding him of their "plan" and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants to kill. This investigation into Bruno's murder and criminal harassment threatens his tennis career and his relationship with the daughter of Senator Morton (north of Leo G. Carroll of Northwest), Anne (Ruth Roman). Bruno realizes that Guy will not commit his murder. He decides to file evidence at the scene of the crime to make him guilty, from Guy's monogram cigarette lighter to the amusement park. After his tennis match, Guy and Anne (who have obviously discovered the "plan" of the assassination) go to the amusement park to stop Bruno, and argue about the carousel fast and uncontrollable. It also stars Patricia Hitchcock (director's daughter) as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Anthony, Howard St. John as police captain Turley and John Brown in the role of Professor Collins and the Hitchcock cameo boarding a train carrying a double bass. Some interesting dialogues and interactions of character, some good moments of suspense and, of course, the unforgettable finale of the carousel, a good classic film. He was named the Oscar for Best Photography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on 100 icons of pop culture, the film was number 32 on 100 years, 100 shivers. Very well!
