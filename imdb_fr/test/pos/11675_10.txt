<br /> <br /> First, I reviewed this documentary because I was interested in the subject he was describing, the Los Angeles punks. <br /> <br /> I listened to this music and I loved this music and I loved reading many small magazines published in the early 80's that were not as easy to do in Finland. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this kind of music, why do you write here? I like this kind of music, it speaks my soul, so I know punks from all over Europe and the Americas, so why do you find this music "disgusting" that makes sense to comment? <br /> <br />
