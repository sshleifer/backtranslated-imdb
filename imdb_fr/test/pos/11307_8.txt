After all these years, I wonder why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a famous name or a star of the famous comedy. She is one of the funniest women on the planet. In this parody, she confronts Madonna who is one of her favorite targets. She is Medusa, a singer with huge success, like Madonna, who also shot the documentary "Truth or Dare". Julie Brown poses as Madonna by Medusa, from Wisconsin, a dairy and beer country. I remember the segment where she went to Wisconsin to visit her family and a grave. I do not remember if it was a parent or his pet. I remember someone who said that Medusa was not original. She just copied the others. I must say that I hope this parodic documentary will be available somewhere on DVD. Julie Brown was at her best mocking and spoofing others.
