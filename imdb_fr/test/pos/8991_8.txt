The eternally strong film will never be nominated for an Oscar, it will never be named best actor, best film. But this movie has things that other movies do not do. In a nation with so much scandal, so many problems, films launched without paying too much attention to the morality of society, at least this film promotes good. What is the problem with standing behind something that promotes happiness? We should be supporting films that tell our American teenagers that there is not only drugs and alcohol in life. With regard to this Haka debate, as noted above, the Hakka is not exclusive to New Zealand All Blacks, and various high school football teams and colleges in Utah perform this ritual before matches. Including Hawaii, BYU, etc.
