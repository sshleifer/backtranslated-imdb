After cleaning Dodge City (with a little help from Wyatt Earp), Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where a nice little shooting war is taking place. More a sharecropping scheme interesting enough. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and he's after the bad guys Billy House and Steve Brodie who drive homesteaders off their farms. The homesteaders they drive are in a sharecropping system funded by Robert Ryan. It looks like he's picking different farmers on a piece of land to get to their farm, which gives them a percentage of the profits from their harvest. Ryan is about to lose his t-shirt because of all the shenanigans. <br /> <br /> As described by Scott, Bat Masterson is a Western hero who is passionate about the East and becomes a journalist. know he did it later in life. <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic subplot involving Brodie and Ryan, who is a bit silly and harms action. Anne Jeffreys still sings well. <br /> <br /> Of course, Gabby Hayes provides as always the great comic relief. <br /> <br /> A good addition to the Randolph Scott western collection. Also interesting because his latest Western movies did not have him wearing a hat as white as this one. <br /> <br /> This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes of the Professional Bull Riders, a proud resident of Liberal. , Kansas, a city with a great tradition, whether Bat Masterson or not.
