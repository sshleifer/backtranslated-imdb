Barry Champlain is a talk show host on Dallas radio. His flawless ideas on a multitude of social problems disturb and shock many of his callers and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah in search of the truth, or an unsuited person to attack his audience? <br /> <br /> This is an intense and provocative piece about a man with redemptive traits who seems at the same time to be on a really deep philosophy. Although co-written and directed by Stone, it's really Bogosian's piece and it gives a surprisingly hard and penetrating performance that no one can escape. Barry is sometimes one of the most disgusting characters imaginable, spewing a bilious misanthropy to everyone around him, especially those who care about him. But at the same time he is also strangely empathic, hypnotic, wise and even lovable. Bogosian hawks' features burn in the frame, with her green eyes constantly flying as if she were constantly searching for an answer to an enigma. The film is essentially a furious speech against bigotry, injustice and the banality of the world, culminating in Barry's unique three-and-a-half-minute spin-off, uttering the ultimate speech "I hate everything". but the boy is he packing a punch. The support is excellent, especially Greene as a former wife and Baldwin as boss. The fiery photography of Robert Richardson manages to keep the unique radio studio set looking interesting and there is a tense Stewart Copeland score, with a touching coda featuring this endearing musical piece on the phone, Telephone And Rubber Band from the Penguin Cafe Orchestra. If you are not familiar with Bogosian, discover his astonishing talent in this film - like his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, he rarely appears in the mainstream media just because his writings are so well known. I find Stone's movies variable; I do not care much about his great successes, but when he is more orderly and objective, as with that (or Salvador and Nixon), he is much more incisive and striking. A great primal image scream, based on a Bogosian play, inspired by the true story of Alan Berg, a talk show host on Denver radio murdered by the neo-Nazis in 1984.
