This is the second movie on 1985, the other was "The Wedding Singer". While "Wedding Singer" represented the pop side of the 80s, "Rock Star" speaks of metal. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a band paying tribute to one of the most famous rock bands of the moment. and Jennifer Aniston plays her girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day. <br /> <br /> The story is not too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of a rock star's life. Sex and drugs are very limited in this film, but it is filled with Rock'n Roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are brilliantly directed! The entire concert is very well captured because they used a real audience (no CGI here). <br /> <br /> Good direction and a brilliant performance from Marky Mark, who acts like a real kind of metal! <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" is synonymous with fun and if you have something to do with the old metal scene, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
