His music, especially what we hear here, is very slow. About the time of Bach's death, composers were looking for ways to move music forward more slowly: more than a century later, Wagner and Mahler wrote pieces as slow as possible. -Of course, we can cheat by writing a march of 4/4 and then specifying a tempo of, say, semiquaver = 1, but this tempo would not be the correct tempo. Wagner and Mahler have written music that is PROPERLY played at the speed of a snail. Since slowness does not seem too slow, "the snail's pace" is the wrong expression. A critic wrote about a famous Wagner conductor: "He does not beat time, he beats eternity." As far as I know, it was a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that at the beginning of the 70's, the directors worked on making the slowest possible films: there is "Death in Venice", and "Solyaris". I much prefer the old one. On the other hand, "Solyaris" crosses the line or line and becomes soporific; "Death in Venice" is thrilling from start to finish. Few things happen, but everything happens in the right order, at the right pace, with a photograph where you can get lost. <br /> <br /> Another way to cheat with music is to write something that does not really tempo at all. Such music sounds slow, but is not really musical, just as many movies feel slow because they lack rhythm and form. "Death in Venice" is not part of it. Beautiful in all respects, it will remind you of the timelessness and lack of context of quality. You do not need any theoretical knowledge to answer Visconti's mastery, as to answer the incompetence of a lower director. It's a great job.
