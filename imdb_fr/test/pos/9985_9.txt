It's first of all a good, exciting story, with well-developed characters. But all the other details are well designed, leading to a beautiful movie. Do not let the Disney label make you think it's a game for kids - it has a lot to offer for all ages, whether you like golf or not. One of the most impressive things is that the film manages to give a game of golf a really exciting aspect. And as one of the many players who do not support golf on television, this is no small feat. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film describes well the basic characters with their motivations and their antecedents. , enough for you to end up loving all the important competitors once the decisive match begins at the halfway mark. Of course, you are still attached to the character of Ouimet, but his main opponents are nice and interesting. The background layer is important once the golf match becomes a match that uses both minds and golf clubs, because you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each person throughout the game. <br /> <br /> Computer effects are flashy, but they help the story more often. The staging has all kinds of smart golf shots, and the costumes and period decorations are really top notch. <br /> <br /> There are some small nonsense - many minor characters seem a bit too stereotyped from the class war mold, but this is forgivable with the main characters so well drawn. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBoeuf playing Francis Ouimet is, as usual, insensitive and friendly. But the real star player is Steven Dillane, who plays Harry Vardon. He rarely moves his face, but his intense eyes, often sad, and his minor changes of expression speak volumes. <br /> <br /> Ouimet's younger brother, Eddie Lowery, played by Josh Flitter, steals the scene in which he finds himself. After you see the movie, Google to find the real photo of Ouimet and Lowery during the tournament, to have a better idea of ​​the incredible quality of this game.
