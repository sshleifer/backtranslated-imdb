During the civil war, an injured union soldier hides in an isolated Confederate women's school. where the principal and the teacher of the school decide to take care of him, until problems arise between women and girls alone and sexually frustrated. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but all of this finally comes at a price. <br /> <br /> "Dirty Harry (1971)" (which was made about the same time as "The Beguiled") could be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after seeing this, I I tend to think this to be the best job of the pairs together. A very unusual, clever and elegant vehicle for Eastwood is always waiting for you with a direction controlled by Don Siegel and a haunting and catchy score by Lalo Schifrin. The dark and gloomy nature of this film, which is an integral part of the film's psychological make-up and its manipulative strangulation in sexual depravity, stands out clearly. It is assiduously played and makes it even darker and bloodier when these random shocks and delicate intentions come under tremendous tension. Siegel's portrayal of John B Sherry and Grimes is inspired by the seductive, daring, and slow script (from Thomas Cullinan's novel), made through vivid emotions and the tightly lyrical context of the screenplay. Siegel's powerful leadership captures the idyllic setting of South Victoria with such a highly ornate photograph and installs strangely piercing images with remarkable clarity and restraint. <br /> <br /> While the performances, are really commendable and of high quality. Clint Eastwood as a chameleon union soldier who speaks softly, suave and suave, is very impressionable and deliciously assured. A deeply eminent Geraldine Page steals the painting as the hardened director and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman add a delicate sincerity to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is a dark room maid and Jo Ann Harris is the choice of young students with her seductive and devious character. <br /> <br /> Honestly, while Eastwood's charismatic character plays the game for his own selfish needs, there are still mixed intentions out there. at the end. Throughout the film, a very dark sense of humor and an ironic touch settle in the material. What is demonstrated here is simply more than just your basic shock, but it is full of intrigue and realism hard to avoid. This is also true for his extremely strange title and his closing song. <br /> <br /> It's hard not to be tempted by his hospitality.
