Swift's writing really has more in common with Kafka and Orwell than with fantasy writers. It is curious that Gulliver's Travels was considered a children's novel. Lucky, children! <br /> <br /> The same goes for this film. There have been some really horrible versions of this story, which probably explains why people are reluctant to watch this version. I mean, it's a TV movie from Jim Henson, so how should we expect anything other than kindness? <br /> <br /> Look again - beauty appears in the strangest places. Children love this film enough to spend the three hours of the evening, but it also takes time for the dark vision of Swift to be correct. I hate special effects, but here they are used to advance the story instead of dazzling us. Please note that producers have taken the trouble to recruit such classic actors as John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole, who perform their quirky roles with perfection. <br /> <br /> Dramatic, the romance between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch is touching and poignant, as well as funny (she's a little girl, but twenty times her size). The story-frame has a theme about missing fathers that many children will tell. And the party on Gulliver in the asylum introduces an element of horror dealing with the abuse of authority (apparently deriving from Val Lewton's "Bedlam" [1946], another forgotten masterpiece). <br /> <br /> VHS always turns in the trash for pennies, which is an insult to the many great artists who put this thing in place. I encourage the public to recognize a good thing by getting this film and inspiring others to watch it. Although it has a lot to offer children, adults will discover that it resists classics like Aguirre, Brazil, 1984 and other fantastic and serious works.
