A wounded Tonto standing alone to protect three innocent lives. A sneaky woman at the head of a deadly plot. Racial tension. Intelligent Indians. <br /> <br /> These are things that we rarely or almost never seen in the TV series, but this film adds them all to the mix. Although it's most likely a Lone Ranger movie, it mixes the formula just enough so that those who were tired of the show could still enjoy it. Highly recommended for any fan.
