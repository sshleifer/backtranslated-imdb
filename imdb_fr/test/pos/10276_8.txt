I loved this. It begins as a fairly normal French art film, a little heavy, then suddenly, halfway through, he went crazy. This part is brilliant because you realize that you have looked at two parcels, not one. Unfortunately, the end does not make much sense, which is a shame. Oh yes, and it's brilliantly filmed.
