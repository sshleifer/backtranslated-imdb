This is the essence of the early eighties! Shopping malls, credit card machines, food, punk hair color, soundtrack ... I'm in love with this movie. This adorable and intelligent teenage film from Romeo & Juliet creates an immediate addiction. <br /> <br /> Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She really uses her actors, like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so take a look at -Joy of Sex- and Real Real. The soundtracks of Valley Girl are excellent. If you can find a copy of the movie, buy it! It's exhausted and very difficult to find.
