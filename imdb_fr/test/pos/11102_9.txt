This film does a great job dragging us all the way through the dark tunnel of espionage, from start to finish. The impact of the film is even deeper when one realizes that it is based on a true story. Timothy Hutton offers us a sober and quality performance and Sean Penn shows why he is one of the best live actors in America. As in "Midnight Express", this film should make us think twice before doing something we should not do in a foreign country.
