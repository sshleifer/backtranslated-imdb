Ok, I grew up with Who, but I did not like a doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I will be furious against him forever. <br /> <br /> The writing is great, the acting great, the staging (which was horrible in the good old days) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this program and was just looking at it to be forced into it, but I am now a big fan and I love it (I then have the ring of a Dalek screaming "Exterminate"). <br /> <br /> Some of the things I love about this new program - 1) People notice that Rose (Billie Piper) has disappeared from the planet. Some of the old shows show that an assistant would drop for a while, then come home as if nothing had happened, nobody noticed. 2) Chris Eccleston's doctor loves Rose - romantic or not will be debated, but there is no doubt that 9 love and care about his mate. He would destroy the world if he were to save it, which was lacking in the old series. A doctor often did not care if he never saw his assistants again. 3) They talk and think like real people - when you show Rose something extraordinary or new (like aliens), she behaves like a real person who would be - sorry. I never liked an assistant of the old series, who never saw anything foreign, integrates perfectly and adapts instantly. I want to see the surprise on Rose's face when she sees a plastic mannequin come to life. She gives it to me. <br /> <br /> The few things I do not like in this series: 1) almost everything happens on Earth (London or Cardiff) and I was hoping to have some kind of more offbeat show. 2) Eccleston left so fast that he made the series brilliant. <br /> <br /> But I can let these things go - I appreciate the show a lot more than I ever imagined, so I do not mind if they have works on earth. <br /> <br /> Do not take this show seriously, it's fun, smart, entertaining, but it's not a very serious show. It's purely fun and purely British and I can not get enough of it. Look at him with an open mind, and put your brain in neutral and enjoy! <br /> <br /> ps - do not look at series 2 or later. The series 1 was brilliant, the first episodes of the series 2 were good, but do not look at them once that will happen in Love and Monsters. Ultimate waste, completely destroys the show.
