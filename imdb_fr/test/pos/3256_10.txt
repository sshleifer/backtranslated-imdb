So I turned on the television today at 1 pm on a Sunday, expecting to see shit and informative ads. This fantastic movie was just starting, I did not know what it was, but it almost immediately attracted me. The movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> There were a number of things that made no sense to one that I do not understand why the dead was talking about doing things to get you out of your bad situation, but then Jimmy does really nothing but the basic things to survive that anyone would do in his situation, ie it was not his initiative that took him out of his bad situation, it was just luck, secondly, I do not do it . understand that the girl killed the gangsters in the end, because all this was partly blamed on the thieves who steal money from Panda, then the other thief kills Panda in the end, so they steal his money twice and kill him how is it good?
