Return to Me is a charming movie gem. With an absolutely starry cast, who can go wrong with this modern fairy tale? It also includes many jokes written by the funny girl Bonnie Hunt, who wrote and directed this film. David Duchovny is also very good, showing a different approach than his daily alter ego mulder on my favorite show, the x-files. a good date movie!
