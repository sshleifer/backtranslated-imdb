Dr. Sayer (Philippe Leroy), a wealthy doctor with psychological problems concerning the opposite sex, kidnaps an employee, Maria (Dagmar Lassander), a free-spirited liberal woman who believes that it is men who must be " set "instead of women. Sayer retreats to his palace, making Maria run a series of humiliating thoughts, threatening to attack and kill her. Sayer's desire, it seems, is to dominate his body, his mind and his soul, by making him his sex slave, by obeying his orders, by adhering to his slightest desires and caprices. After having resisted, Maria slowly begins to achieve her goal, but has her own plans. She says she wants to help Sayer renounce his sadistic behavior towards women so that he can love and not feel such a burning desire. It seems that Sayer seizes her, accepting some rather embarrassing scenarios (such as getting her toes lotion, "making love" with an inflatable doll that is a recreation of herself, often spending time without breasts and watered when she slaps her violently on the face, bringing her blood from her nose) which almost breaks her, but something happens while the doctor in difficulty slowly falls in love with Maria ... and by what seems to be a desperate attempt to to end the madness, Maria takes over, playing with the thirst of Sayer for his body. <br /> <br /> It's more like a battle of wills, a kind of sexual war where one seems to be in charge while the other is really in control. Sayer mistreats Maria through much of the film, forcing her (it seems) to submit to her series of psychological games of a sexual nature. His attempts to escape fail because his home is a well-designed fortress. This is a typical European Art Deco palace, fashioned and orchestrated by a man who kept this weekend retreat for some time (.. walls and doors opening to his command, with a set area in quarantine for his "victims"). But, once Maria seems to have taken a bottle of pills because of her anguish in her hands, the tables are returned and she has it where she wants it. He discovers that he really wants her and Maria uses this to her advantage, playing hard when Sayer wants to take her in his arms and ravage her (and I could understand her frustration because she has this attraction that can make a man mad). <I felt that the film ultimately worked as a war cry for women, their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control, sexually and mentally. The "twist" completes this ideal. I could not swallow Sayer's fate because of his cardiovascular activity and his rigorous exercise regime. We see how he develops his athletic figure and how this diet is part of the normal routine every weekend before the real games of the mind begin with his victim. If he is so fit and spends so much time developing for extracurricular activities that follow his diet, how could he suffer the fate that follows his conclusion of the contract with Maria in the end when she stops resisting her advances ? <br /> <br /> Maria, he admits later, is the first kid he really kidnapped; others of the past, call girls, were paid for their services so that Sayer could feel the power to dominate a woman, even if it was a fictional charade caused by a deeply troubled person, unable to connect to the opposite sex. The spontaneous decision to do it, to get out of the norm, costs him more than anything he could ever know. <br /> <br /> All this psycho-sexual subtext is rather fascinating to see get rid, but Dagmar Lassander, such a delicious sex kitten, was my reason to enjoy it then ... without it, I could not love him so much, because she is a vital victim worthy of fighting to obtain it. Maybe the highlight of the film, the delicious Lassander dance dressed in gauze (!), Defeat the wardrobe, exposing her breasts to a jazzy score ... this is the kind of sexually seductive moment that puts you in the mood mouth watering and sweaty forehead. Dagmar Lassander must have been a joy for fashion designers because she wears these clothes so well .. She has that kind of cool, sophistication and on-screen presence with her beauty and alluring powers, Dagmar transcends the party for create an iconic character that would define his career ... even if the film is not known (... I discovered by word of mouth). The provocative nature of the script and the risky subject might not please some crowds, as it deals with sex (and pain) in many different forms, the dialogue being quite illustrative and elaborate. Sometimes I could not help but laugh at Sayer about a jailed Maria, explaining how he likes to make women suffer and the thrill he feels to force them to become a sort of slavery. in order to make poetic words, everything feels rather hokey). But Dagmar is the real reason to see it, and the film, to me, works best as a fetish movie, a possible male fantasy with this seemingly primitive and clean idealist, captured and held against his will, forced to stay in a precarious situation. situation, his fate may be at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. Her submission and the way she reacts to her aggressive behavior with her (there are times when she discovers herself with a reluctant desire to kiss her, revealing a possible attraction for him that, in itself, might frighten some who look at it) are some of the most fascinating points of this operating feature. My other favorite scene, besides dancing, is the piano concerto with Sayer caressing Maria as she plays a soothing melody.
