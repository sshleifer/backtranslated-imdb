This film was so rhythmic that I do not think I actually blinked while watching. One intense situation after another kept me stuck to the decor. However, I would have liked to see Corey Feldman a lot more on this picture. He just steals all the scenes in which he is. This could be my favorite performance of Corey. The end was smart and unlike other movies that move away from the separation of body parts from friendly characters, this movie goes for the better! I liked the fact that it was not graphic blood or blood but rather left to the viewer's imagination. Bravo. I had to literally wipe the sweat off my forehead during this torture scene with a paper cutter. In the end, the film works because of its sympathetic main character and the awesome presence of my favorite favorite villain, James Remar (48 hours, remember?). I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to sweat. <br />
