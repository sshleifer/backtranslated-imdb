Fans of apocalyptic films will love this well-made budget thriller that is essentially a remake of George Pal's 1951 classic, "When Worlds Collide". A comet is about to make a near-collision with Earth. When his fellow scientists ignore his warnings, eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) brings together a group of private investors to secretly build an underground sanctuary. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds through the eyes of Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati), a Gulf War veteran who inadvertently discovers Crawford's hidden shrine and then decides that Crawford is wrong to hide his project from the rest of humanity. Coming near the comet, the subject of who should live and who should die makes an interesting drama. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are not in the same league, I enjoyed the story more than I did with The Spielberg War the worlds, because I think this scenario is better. Some suspension of the scientific reality is necessary, but it is worth it for the development of a good history. I highly recommend this film to fans of the genre.
