This little-known comedy from Ruth Gordon's hit play is a delight. The script, based on the game, is spicy, rich and completely undated. Ditto for the casting but I must emphasize the work of the main woman, Irene Dunne. Irene is simply gorgeous - as usual - and illuminates the screen with every frame she is in (and she is often there, thank you heaven). In addition, director Vidor presented him unusual and fascinating close-ups. What girl! I do not know any other Hollywood actress of all times who is versatile and convincing in all the films. Why it remains so little known is a mystery. I saw most of his films and this one was a surprise, even for a fan of ID cards like me. See, everyone!
