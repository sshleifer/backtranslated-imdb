Francis Ford Coppola's first "personal" film, completed and released in 1969, is his last film before his appearance as an almost unknown director before becoming his godfather. It contrasts sharply with this film and the rest of its inequalities. career. It is apparently a road movie featuring a disconnected young woman, bored by domestic life and pregnant with a child she is not sure she wants, fleeing the traps of her monotonous marriage and jumping on the road in search of freedom. On the way, she befriended a friendly man, a former footballer who suffered brain damage as a result of a head injury, was subtly subtle by the young James Caan and decided to "the help, "even if he was frustrated by the simplicity of his means. . His efforts to get rid of him still fail, whether by guilt or chance, and end up putting it directly in the hands of an emotionally wounded policeman (Robert Duvall), who has his own ideas. The plot is worn out, but Coppola does a great job detailing the emotional life of these characters, and uses editing techniques to tell a story that was not at all common in American movies of the time. The plans are simple but extraordinarily efficient, reflecting both the desolation of the freeway and the emptiness of suburban American life, imbued with a sweet melancholy provided by the score of the film. Coppola also deserves credit for addressing the issue of domestic discontent from the perspective of a woman in the 1960s who was culturally agitated. On the whole, a rather discreet film is not what the public expects from Coppola, but a minor triumph in its own way, discreet and unadorned. 7.5 / 10.
