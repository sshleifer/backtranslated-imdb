I love this show. It's smart and very well played. David Morse and Andr√© Braugher have excellent chemistry. The writing is intelligent and the secondary intrigues generally give a great comic relief. After each new episode, I'm always amazed at how much the show provokes reflection and entertains it. My only complaint would be the absence of Donna Murphy at this point in the second season. As David Morse's ex-wife, Heather, she added such character to the series. <br /> <br /> I think this series honors the police / drama genre. That said, I can not understand why this show has such a low rating. Has anyone given this show a note please 1 could it be corrected by a critic?
