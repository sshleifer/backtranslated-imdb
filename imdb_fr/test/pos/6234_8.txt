The slasher movies started maybe 30 to 35 years before this movie, but believe me, this is a pearl that will stay longer after turning off the TV. Especially if you are an easily frightened person, this is the movie for which you would not have the stomach to take it to heart. Even after so many years, the film has not lost its charm and its lively emotions. <br /> <br /> No blood, no gore, but the chills will certainly cool your spine. the movie starts with the bang and stays at the same pace until the end. BGM is cracking nerves and I remember it was the one that had been copied in many Indian movies these days. Kings favorite? No wonder ... that's the only reason I wanted to see this and it did not let me down. "Do not turn off the lights" ... because you will not find Enrique, but maybe a smiling doll sitting right behind you! You must beware. not for the light heart ... <br /> <br /> Two jostling and I'm going with 8 out of 10 which is pretty weak but I still keep my ratings for the drama ...
