After a slow start, I thought the film about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during the Second World War had been resumed and had become a rather pleasant watch for a few hours, mainly from two points of view. <br /> <br /> The love triangle is interesting and seems credible to me, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz plays Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the beginning, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece and Mandras went to fight. After the German intervention, Greece is conquered and Pelagia Island still lives under the Italian occupation. Meanwhile, Pelagia met and began to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage.) This was, of course, a dilemma for many young women in the occupied lands. Knowing their occupants, they began to consider them not as enemies, but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbors. I have just finished reading an interesting book on the British occupation of the Channel Islands by Great Britain, in which it was a major problem. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br /> <br /> The second substantive issue concerns the Italian occupation itself, which in my opinion has been described very realistically. The first was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupants. Greece defeated Italy (which is quite true from a historical point of view) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the city to go to the Italians and instead of insisting on going to a German officer seemed to me something that could have happened (and which was quite funny actually. line, "we would rather go to this German dog than for you Italians.") The representation of the Italian troops also seemed credible to me. The Italian army has never been in love with its German ally and has never been enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here, Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which German troops on the island simply can not understand), and are delighted when Italy restores peace and withdraws from the war - until that they discover that it might well turn them into prisoners of war. the Germans. It was pretty well done, I thought. <br /> <br /> It ends up flickering a bit with a too predictable finish, but still deserves praise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
