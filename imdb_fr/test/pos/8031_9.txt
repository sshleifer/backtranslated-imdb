Worldwide, the undeniable imprint of the American brand C.I.A. can be found in a lot of confused mess they have left behind. At first, their objectives were simple: to spy on, eliminate enemy agents, steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. Years have passed and, while their mission remains similar, their clandestine operations with blacks now include domestic espionage, the discrediting of US citizens and the infiltration of US organizations critical of the US government. However, this film is centered on the famous man's "Carlos, the Jackel" manhunt in the world of C.I.A. The film is called "The Assignment" and tells the story of Lieutenant Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn) is a US Navy officer who strangely resembles the brains of so many terrorist attacks. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of the CIA and Amos (Ben Kingsley), special agent of the Israeli Mosad, Ramirez is secretly trained to watch, to pose, to infiltrate this elusive organization and to discredit then the real Jackel working for the Russians . This film is extremely exciting and is full of fierce prosecutions, murders and chaos between countries. Quinn is beautiful and surprisingly artistic, playing on both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. ****
