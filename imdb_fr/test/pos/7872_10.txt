I saw that at Sundance, one of the first years of my stay at the festival - it blew me away ... <br /> <br /> It happened way too fast, and I did not never could find him. I thought it would end up on a compilation somewhere, but still no joy. My memory is blurry about the details - I just remember being surprised again and again, and on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Someone reading this has tracks? Online, DVD, breathtaking VHS copy - I would try to put it to the value of your time ... <br /> <br /> Over the years, I've probably seen over 200 shorts (who lived near Aspen) where they have an amazing Shorts Fest in April). This is certainly part of my favorites and I hope to see you again! <br /> <br /> A big thank you to everyone who knows how to see it :)
