I've been a fan of Mario for as long as I can remember, I have great memories of playing Super Mario World as a child. This game has brought back a lot of these memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment of the incredible Mario franchise. This game is very different from all the other previous Mario, while still keeping the most important elements of Mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space. <br /> <br /> The story begins a lot Like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration in his castle of the mushroom kingdom. On arriving at Peach Castle, Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then raises her castle in space. In the middle of the castle raised in space, Mario falls and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is brought back to the home of Luma, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser took the Power Stars out of the space station and scattered them into the universe. It's up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach. The adventure begins. <br /> <br /> The way you play the game by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy being composed of several planets that Mario travels in levels via these shooting stars to recover the Power Stars. Mario can often walk around planets without losing their gravity, some planets are small and others large, many planets are similar to Mario's classic environments. The best thing about the game is the controls, everything is like jumping, etc., remains the same, but the Wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. If you shake the remote, Mario will perform a rotation that will serve of main attack in the game and will also activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote control at the screen and use the pointer to shoot stars at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there are the graphics, these are by far the best graphics of the Wii, it is so difficult to describe how great this game is, you could almost say that it looks as good as some games to 360 Â°. <br /> <br /> My only minor complaint is that the upside-down effect takes a while to get used to, and the story is rather weak. The worst thing is that you lose all your lives when you disable the game, no matter how many people you had at the last cessation, you raise to 4 lives. Despite these minor problems, it's a great game, very entertaining and very stimulating. This is the type of game we expected on the Wii. <br /> <br /> A perfect 10 out of 10!
