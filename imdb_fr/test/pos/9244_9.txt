I found it to be an entertaining story about the challenges that an independent filmmaker could face (something I never even thought about). The film managed to keep my interest all the time and I even laughed loudly more than once! I'm not a filmmaker, so I do not know anything about technology, but I thought it was well set up and the writing went smoothly. As a non-liability, I contributed to this effort afterwards, by providing music for the soundtrack, but I was not involved in the creation of this film and I could not tell you anything about from Repo Man, except that I remember seeing him coming back, I'm not really a science fiction fan). I enjoyed the comparisons between the movie made of punk rock and punk rock music. My wife went with me to see the movie and she did not know anything about it before. We had a great time.
