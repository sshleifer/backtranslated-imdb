This is a video version of a scenic production, with additional shooting for video editing. The result wins both the drama of the scene with the impact of a well produced film. The decor of George Tsypin, with his sculptures and masks by Julie Taymor, is superb. <br /> <br /> Jessye Norman is great, and we hear young Bryn Terfel. This production is beautiful, emotional and majestic. If you do not see this, you missed your chance.
