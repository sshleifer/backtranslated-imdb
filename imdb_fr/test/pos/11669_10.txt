I am surprised that a director known for his leftist political fervor can create an image as subtle as it is non-sanctimonious. If you are for capital punishment, you will always be after seeing this. If you are against the death penalty, you will always be against it. But no matter what your position, this movie will at least give you some idea of ​​why you feel what you're feeling. There is not a wrong note in the film.
