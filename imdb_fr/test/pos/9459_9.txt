Shes the man is great. it's funny, original and made me laugh so much that I nearly wet my seat. The day I went to see the movies, I was not in the best mood, but when I left the movie, my face was covered with a smile. The story is a little behind, no one notices that it looks much too much like a girl, but who to say what is credible, the jokes are great and some of the characters of this hit of 2006 may well fall into the 'history. Amanda B. did a great job as the lead role and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true as her opposite as a gorgeous Duke. So the girls will see that because it's a big laugh and there's a hot guy in it and the boys are going to see it because you may be learning something about girls! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a brilliant, fantastic and fun film that I'll buy on DVD when it comes out.
