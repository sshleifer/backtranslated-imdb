It was just starting on television when I opened it, and since I felt too lazy to switch channels, I ended up watching her. The man was so lucky. <br /> <br /> This film is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama, sometimes openly sentimental. This is certainly what one could call a wellness film, and I usually find it boring or irritating. Yet, this film is so well done that I could not help but love it. The script will not twist your brain; it's conventional, but flawless. The actors are brilliant, everyone is perfectly suited to the role. There are not many scores, but the music beautifully enriches the film. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate anything other than expensive pyrotechnics, vicious murders or saving the world in a movie, look at it if you already have the chance. 5/5
