I thought the movie started a little slow and disjointed during the first hour. However, it has become more absorbing, fascinating and surprising in the last two hours. So, even if it starts as a cheap horror movie, it turns into a fantastic fantasy movie. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda stands out as a Snow Queen. It was her best performance and it is unfortunate that this is apparently her last performance, as she has not played in the last 7 years. She embodies both the beauty and the coldness of winter. <br /> <br /> My 14 year old daughter found the movie a little scary. If you're presenting it as family entertainment, stay with your child and reassure them. or him that it's just a fantasy fairy tale and do not take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> This is really one of the best fantasy movies I've seen in a long time, slightly better than "Eragon" or one of the "Lord of the Rings". It's about as good as "The Golden Compass".
