I am impressed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her superb talent as a star of the action! This film is propelled by his wonderful acting performance and his formidable action prowess. I'm a fan of science fiction, but I have to say that this film goes beyond most sci-fi movies in its cinematography and mostly uses an actress whose presence replaces the plot, which is fine but it's not new. Although it seems that this film was designed for television, it is in my opinion better than most of the movies released in cinemas.
