(The description of the film's mood can be considered a spoiler - because there is not much action in fact) <br /> <br /> An excellent ... <br /> </ p> > Is it for me? special interest for dystopias and utopias? Is for the atmosphere of the film. Or is there more magic? If so, it is certainly the most human possible ... <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly extremely artistic / artificial (it depends on taste). I can imagine that most people who hate watching slow movies (and those of Tsai Ming Liang (who I did not like other times) are among the slowest I know), who suffer during the movie. Yes, people are unable to slow down and let time pass - and look at it without the impression of losing it. Can we take this piece as torture or therapy ... <br /> <br /> The subject on the surface? Lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - next to each other - but not really together? People are tired, sick of something and unable to describe it - they just do not want to meet, touch, talk, confront each other ... as if they have disappeared. The large block of apartments looks empty and the falling rain constantly evokes the strange melancholy inside. And sometimes it has to be something abnormal, unexpected, undesirable decomposition, such as a hole in the concrete floor - that allows us to reach us. <br /> <br /> One of the possible ways to see it is: Do not examine the inner world of the characters. Consider all the space of the film as being inside you. And ask - why is this? Where do these depressive states and moods come from? Is there a place for them, they have no right to be here? And look for the answers (if you need them) among the walls and corridors of the block - instead of staying in the barely transparent mind of a man. <br /> <br /> The key to understanding is not to understand - let a movie borrow us - as a subject of study - inside of itself - and in the end bring us back in all security to our reality more colorful and more "normal". <br /> <br /> Then you may reach - like me - the sense of real hope, possible, not pathetic, that we are still human beings ... and that this state of mind can we help a lot to live in this world.
