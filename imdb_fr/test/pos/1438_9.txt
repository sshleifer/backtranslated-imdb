Excellent book, excellent movie, excellent soundtrack. Frank Sinatra shows in this film that when he wanted to make an effort, he could play. The end is a bit schmaltzy, but for the moment it's understandable, the studio wanted a happy ending. The graphic nature of heroin addiction (revolutionary for the period) is an asset. Add the fantastic soundtrack and you get one of the great American movies.
