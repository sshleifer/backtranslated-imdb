The plot of the plot is an expose of the underbelly of American politics. Although the theme seems common, what "makes" the film is the unconventional way in which the story is told. <br /> <br /> The characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of lead and his lost innocence. The politician is the prince of double language, a real snake. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is impressive. He affirms the nuances of play and dialogue. Ditto for music. <br /> <br /> The story uses a parable with vintettes where the message is full of double meaning. A very wise strategy of the screenwriter / director. The tension in the scenario continues until the last scenes. <br /> <br /> The film looked like a good book of mystery. Something was "on foot"; you knew it was bad; you did not know exactly what it could be - you had your suspicions; and when the evil was revealed, you let your breath out, you did not notice that you were holding on. Sadie, shaking her head. <br /> <br /> A story well written and well told. 3 cheers to a young writer / director.
