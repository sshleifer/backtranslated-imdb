[Minor detractors follow] <br /> <br /> Steve Allen was of the opinion that many could find acceptable humor about serious events, based on the formula: Tragedy + Time = Comedy. Before 1939, the German assault on Poland was hardly a time of entertainment and subsequent events, including the Blitzkrieg (following the Sitzkrieg) that led Germany into the English Channel, led to the heroic evacuation of Dunkirk. and gave the world the disgusting spectacle of a prostrating France lying supine. his honor in front of the Nazi conqueror. <br /> <br /> Romance, comedy and a host of serious dramas? Yes. The director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, with remarkable and remarkable actors, creates in "Bon voyage" a pastiche of events and scenes of history and imagination extremely entertaining. <br /> <br /> Viviane Denvers (the sloe) Isabelle Adjani) is the best actress in France while the clouds of war are gathering in Europe (what a clich√© overused, sorry). A veteran and venerable chevreuse with many business under her belt, her inner motivation seems to be "Everything that is good for Viviane is good for ... Viviane.) After the premiere of his latest film after which a minister of administration incompetent Reynaud Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu in an unusual role for him) signals his interest for her, she only returns home to meet wearily an old lover who does not understand the word "no". but then frantically and histrionically, another former son, Frederic (Gregory Derangere), always at bay, to help him cope with the mess of his apartment Frederic is a novelist waiting. <br /> <br /> A comic accident that took place It emphasizes once again, almost like a public service message, the importance of wipers in good working order, which puts Frederic in jail for the charges Fortunately, the dismantling of the Germans from their static positions imposes a mass transfer of prisoners in the south of France. our boy escapes, going there privately rather than as ward of the state. <br /> <br /> The panic and fear in France as the Germans headed for victory are well portrayed and a new turning point in history. Who should meet Frederic if it is the young and wonderful research assistant, Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), who accompanies the scientist specialist in Jewish refugees, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehle). Kopolski has some "heavy" water bottles he needs to go to England. Of course, the Germans must not cling to this essential ingredient to know what (this part is pure fiction - there was never heavy water in France in 1940 - just Perrier). And Camille is both seductive and devoted. <br /> <br /> And after? Peter Coyote as a supposed French journalist, Alex Winckler. Be informed about his name. He really is an Abwehr officer (German military intelligence: a spy). And he also slept Viviane (and wants a resumption of their relationship). Apparently, the Kopolski genre is the only major male character who does not want to do it with the actress. <br /> <br /> What follows is a series of adventures and mishaps that fit perfectly to produce a very fast film. rhythmic and pleasant film. It is partly a homage and a parody on "Casablanca", it is a remarkably amusing film (with the exception of the Nazi elements). <br /> <br /> Isabelle Adjani deserves congratulations for the best performance she has seen in the years of an adorably cute total narcissist with few features, if none redeeming. And Depardieu, disloyal to Reynauld and ready to leave the ship to join the traitor Petain, is convincing as a man whose ardor for Viviane exceeds his diluted sense of duty to the Republic. As a human being in power at a critical moment in French history, Beaufort is ugly shabby. <br /> <br /> Not presented in too many theaters, "Bon voyage" should soon be bought or rented. See! <br /> <br /> 9/10
