The story line of this game is very jerky. It seems that the authors of the game have been trying to find ways to justify the appearance of a character in certain areas of the world map in Tales of the Soul. That being said, this is the only complaint I have about this game. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the GMF is spectacular with breathtaking landscapes and interesting new features, such as the ability to create and design your own character and their martial arts discipline. There is even a second story mode that offsets the clumsy design of the Tale of the Souls story. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the Tale of the Souls FMV are also interactive and allow you to decide the fate of your character. a certain degree which is an interesting feature. <br /> <br /> With the many character combinations you can create, the varied paths you can explore in the story mode of Tales of the Souls and Chronicle of Swords, this game will keep all fans of Beatem up / RPG entertained for a moment!
