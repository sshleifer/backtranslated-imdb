I saw it at the 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival. There are wonderful descriptions of this film from other commentators here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it. So I will not give you a summary of the film, but you could see a bit Woody Allen and maybe a little Federico Fellini in this film. The collection of the film contains about fifty skits or short vignettes, without any real intrigue. Some of the thumbnails are linked to each other in their character and line of lines, but a corner bar is frequently used as a central scene where they always give the last call. The beginning and ending scenes also have a common theme: the movie. It took three years to film this and a lot of the time had to be spent looking for the simplest and most homogeneous people in all of Sweden to do the distribution. This is Sweden's official candidacy for best foreign language film for the 2007 Oscars. It's a good film but hardly worthy of an official nomination for the best foreign film. Farväl Falkenberg had been very weak last year. The year before, she was expensive, but dull like a ZoZo. Once again, Sweden will have no chance of winning the Oscar. This film has its moments and would have made a good short film of 20-25 minutes but it becomes a bit old and cold for a feature film. Roy Andersson directs. Gustav Danielsson is the director of photography. Editor-in-chief Anna Märta Waern deserves a lot of credit for the work she has had to do. Benny Andersson of ABBA fame provides an entertaining musical score. It's an interesting movie with a lot of dry humor and I liked it but it's nothing really special and I can only give it a 7.0 out of 10.
