Despite all the chaos surrounding the episode THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES, THE BALANCE OF TERROR could be the best episode of the show. And, even though I always liked A PIECE OF ACTION because it's so much fun, I really have to vote because this episode of Romulan is the best. <br /> <br /> The film, quite interesting, really looks like an underwater film of the Second World War as it oscillates between the hidden Romulan ship and Enterprise while it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak into the Neutral Zone after a raid on the outposts of the Federation. In many ways, the series is very much like the movie THE ENEMY BELOW - where the American captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German captain (Curt Jurgens) are shown in a cons-point as they both try to outsmart the others - and in the process, develop a reluctant respect for their enemy. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, only the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet - and this is amazing, since an episode on board the ship could have easily been static and dull. But, because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters wrote and acted so well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as a Romulan leader). Oddly enough, for the thirsty Trekkers, they will recognize Leonard as the same actor who later interpreted Spock's father. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is a great and extremely engaging episode that will stay on the edge of your seat.
