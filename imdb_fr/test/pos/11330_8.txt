Two hours ago, I was watching this brilliant film that flooded me with imprisoned photographs. We understand very well how he won the prize for the best camera at Cannes 2000. The close-ups prevailed. Close-ups of walls, humans and many other things. The warm and colorful light (usually that of the director) gives the film a warm atmosphere. We mainly only see two people in most cases. Interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the film almost all the time. Each of these themes represented a certain atmosphere throughout the film. Silence and slow movements characterize the film. Some scenes were prolonged moments or serious close-ups. Tony Leung not only deserves an award for his excellent role as Maggie Cheung was also brilliant. I wonder how many dresses she wore in different scenes. The story was also linked in some way to the history of Hong Kong and the 1960s region. This prevented me from understanding some of the details, especially at the end. In short, I would recommend to fans of artistic films to watch it in the cinema.
