Growing up in New Jersey and spending a lot of time day and night on the cobbled streets of New York in the 1970s, I watch a movie like "The Seven-Ups" or his closest spirit, "The French Connection," always reminiscing Memories of an era and a place that, for some, may have been the darkest time in New York, but for me, in their early twenties, have always been a fun adventure after the other. I really miss those moments. As one commentator commented, "This film is a great example of the cold, winter-like atmosphere of the New York winter season, while unmistakably exposing the infamous sub-world of crime and the maintenance of order in the region, an era and a culture ". A precise characterization of the film and the city. The stellar attributes of this film - the plot, the cast, the characters and, of course, the car chase - are amply described in many critics, so I will not go into detail except to say that the One of My favorite moments occur during the car chase, when the camera focuses on Richard Lynch on the shotgun at Bill Hickman's maniac. The look of horror on Richard Lynch's face, as well as the defensive gestures, are so foolish for an actor much more known to be a source of terror rather than an object, that it is actually comical to look at him. I laugh every time.
