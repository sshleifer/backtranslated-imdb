As far as I know, this was my first experience with Icelandic cinema. It's such a relief to see something other than your usual Hollywood movie. Too bad that movies like this one have a small chance to succeed in the big world. I can only hope that people look at it by accident, by recommendation or by another ... <br /> <br /> Because it is really worth it. I left the cinema very sad. I could not get rid of the tragic fate of the characters. And it impressed me even more when I thought about the complexity of the film. It was not only a tragic story, but also excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, look at it! It really provoked reflection and made me think a lot. <br /> <br />
