This is probably my favorite TV show ever. I like all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! It always makes me laugh and I feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe. <br /> <br /> It seems that some or all episodes sync with music albums as well. Here are some examples. (The episodes start over at the end, but do NOT read the credits until the end, but always read the opening credits.Most episodes of the album are played once and the episodes are played twice, but some go further.) RADIOHEAD, PINK FLOYD, BOB Dylan. <br /> <br /> 2.02 "Double bogey" Computer Kid A / OK (episode is played at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> 2.14 'Saturn' Kid A / Meddle / Coup d'amour # 2.19 'The world without Alex' Kid A / I wish you were here / Pablo Honey (the episode is played at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> There are clues in the episodes that tell you which albums are synchronized. Kid A can synchronize with EVERY episode!
