This film, also known as "Do not Look in the Basement", is not bad. It's a little-known film, even for the biggest horror fans, but I found this film quite entertaining. Do not get me wrong, it's certainly not without its problems, but think more people should take a look. The story of a hip nurse who goes to work in a sanatorium certainly attracts me. I thought the acting game, which seemed forced at first, had improved over the course of the film. It seems that the actors have really taken on their roles. There are good colored characters, including a guy who thinks he's still a soldier, one who thinks he's a judge, an adult with a child's brain, and an alluring girl who's so in need of be careful that she drops her clothes when a man approaches her. The title "do not look in the basement" has about as much relevance to the story as "the last house left" on this film. If you like movies with terrifying characters in a psychiatric neighborhood like me, go see that.
