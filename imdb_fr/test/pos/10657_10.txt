Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest film I've seen and it's also the first silent movie I've seen. I heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I took the tape home and watched it. When that was over, I just thought it was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the real Russian battleship Potemkin. You would not think so, but some were sad and disgusting. It's sad to be the mother who dies and the pram rolls down the stairs and to be disgusting, they have to eat spoiled meat with worms. It is still considered today as one of the best silent and Russian movies ever made. I think everyone should see it (if they can find it). You will be immediately surprised by the quality of his work. It's a classic to see absolutely. 5/5.
