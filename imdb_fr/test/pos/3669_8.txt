Ignore the comments of everyone else for this movie and watch it on a pay-as-you-go cable or rent it. You owe it to yourself. This film is what the movies are supposed to be. Difficult to classify (and God knows how it was presented as a "high concept"!), But this is one for the angels. Check it out. What do you have to lose?
