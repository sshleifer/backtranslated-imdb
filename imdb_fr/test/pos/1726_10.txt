Unlike most people who commented, I was born after the last episode of Sylvester Mccoy and so I could not compare the two centuries of doctor who at first. I really enjoyed the moment Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the rest of the series. Since then, I have seen old episodes of Doctor Who and other very successful ones, but, like the doctor, the series had to regenerate to continue. The 21st century doctor who's great, I thought Martha was great, almost a match for the doctor and if Jack's appearance is amazing, she'll be brilliant when she's came in the 4 or 5 series. > <br /> Speaking of Jack, Torchwood is also brilliant and you should look at both of these programs (although definitely more child-friendly). However, if you insist that it's not the same as Doctor Who, stay in your basement. <br /> <br /> 10/10
