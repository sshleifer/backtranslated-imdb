An essential viewing for anyone watching news on television, as it can help to become a little more skeptical or even cynical. On a personal note, I remember taking a course a few years ago about being interviewed on television: what to do, what not to do. The instructors made us understand that TV news was a "branch of show biz". This depressing vision, which is probably even more valid today than when it was made, is reinforced by this film. Regardless of journalistic integrity, what matters is the ability to look good and smile well. And make sure you do not sweat in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The interactions between the three main characters form the centerpiece, each with its own ambitions, abilities and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and installs them in the unstable scenery of a TV news studio, and adds more than a pinch of love interest to the mix. The result is a complex portrait, though sometimes a bit long, of our daily compromises to meet our ambitions and take others with us. It's always fun, even though the final scene may have been useless given everything that had happened before.
