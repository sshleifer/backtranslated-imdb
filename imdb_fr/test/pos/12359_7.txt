Once upon a time, in Sweden, there was a poor sister of the Salvation Army. At the door of death, she asks, "Let David Holm come!" But Victor Sjöström (like David Holm) can not be found because he spends New Year's Eve in a cemetery with his drinking buddies. The dying sister Astrid Holm (editor) wants to see if the prayer for the soul of Mr Sjöström has produced results in the past year; no doubt, this is not the case. In the cemetery, Sjöström tells the story of "The Phantom Carriage", about which he heard about his deceased friend, Tore Svennberg (as Georges). According to legend, the last person to die each year must recover the soul of all the dead, until it is relieved the New Year ... <br /> <br /> The director Sjöström, whose main performance is very strong, partners with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create an attractive film. The great effect of "double exposure" is used frequently, but never seems exaggerated; and, this does not make the other dramatic moments of the movie less memorable (eg, Sjöström tore his sewn coat and cut the door). A story by Selma Lagerlöf was probably not a story you could or would alter in the 1920s - which explains why the end of the film is a disappointment. And, unlike similar spiritual stories, it's hard to break your disbelief if you think too much about what's really happening at "Körkarlen". <br /> <br /> ******* Körkarlen (1/1 / 21) Victor Sjöström Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg
