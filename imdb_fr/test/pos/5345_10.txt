Who can ask for more? Taking my 2 and 4 year olds was a risk, I admit. But it's really worth it. They were fascinated, credit after credit, with their parents at their side. <br /> <br /> I already took the children to the movies with mixed results: too scary, too boring, too sophisticated, it does not matter. With this film, however, I was happy to see a clever film with spirit, style and a sense of passion emanating from the screen. Any movie that requires 5 (!) Years of production, good or bad, deserves a little respect for the bravery and patience needed to shoot a movie like this. <br /> <br /> O.K. I throw a little. Again, why should not I get upset? Browsing through the list of films, it only reminds me of the poor quality of the films distributed. At least for the moment Anyway, W & G is a movie well done. Perhaps the originality was not the most inspired, nevertheless, well told and rhythmic. <br /> <br /> Too much humor for adults? Too many sex references? May be. Although my children did not quite catch them. Too young. So, in my case, I did not really notice. <br /> <br /> Well, needless to say, I liked it.
