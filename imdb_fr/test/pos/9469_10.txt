I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. I already knew the movie was going to be funny, but it was funnier than I expected. Of course, there were some lame jokes, but they made me crack. I thought the actors would get pretty bad, but the actors were good at playing this comedy. I have to congratulate Amanda Bynes, she looked amazingly like her brother and achieved an amazing performance as a boy. As for the other actors, they were also funny. Of course, there were times when you shouted on the screen "How not to know?", But it's all part of the fun. In the end, the plot went well. There is a happy ending, but what did you expect? <br /> <br /> All in all, just hilarious.
