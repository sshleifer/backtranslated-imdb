I will say it as clearly as possible for those of you who are not aware of Bill Hicks' legacy. He was simply the greatest humorist in the world, probably, in my opinion, the greatest ever to exist (his idol as such is the great Richard Pryor, whose fight against addiction he led in parallel) . His death in 1994 was barely noticed by the popular media, just weeks after Kurt Cobain's suicide. His tragic death at such a young age eclipses any sense of injustice that was ignored by crime during his life, of course. But the harsh truth is clear as the day: no one has defended his place. There is no standing comedian with nearly as much expertise and invention. <br /> <br /> The observation is made in the loving tribute `It's just a ride 'that stand-up comedians often see in their stone work at richer activities - lame movies and movies. morally motivated sitcoms designed to occupy - but never enrich - the life of an unimaginative audience. That's all Bill Hicks has talked about. His sermon has always been a rallying cry for people to think for themselves, control authority, form a single race. <br /> <br /> His call continues to grow every year since his death. His star will continue to shine long after so many small lights have gone out. Once you have been exposed to his brilliant, intelligent, but ultimately compassionate production, you will be enriched and rewarded. <br /> <br /> The man himself liked to quote Dylan: "To live out of the law, you have to be honest," he said, Bill Hicks was honest, beyond that. he was the funniest of them all.
