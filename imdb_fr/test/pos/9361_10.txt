*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There must have been something in the air right after the war that made night towns an attractive setting for movies. A multitude of urban nocturnal films were shot at this time, not just in America. One of the most remarkable is Carol Reed's Odd Man Out, an English image of a wounded gunman staggering through the streets of Belfast. In America, it was black midnight, or exactly midnight, film noir. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not really a film noir, but has the characteristics of black, although it uses them for its own purposes, which have to do with bigotry. Directed by Edward Dmytryk, written by John Paxton, it has been adapted from a novel by Richard Brooks. The book concerned the murder of a homosexual; in the film, the victim is changed to Jew. Although filmed as a mystery, there is little suspense in the film because it is pretty obvious who is the killer at first. What makes the film so appealing and so beautiful is its evocation of a city, Washington, DC, just after the Second World War, by some of the most talented craftsmen working in film at that time. Unlike many night movies, Crossfire takes place mainly indoors: in police stations, rooming houses and cinemas all night long. The soldiers are ubiquitous in the film and most are eager to return to civilian life. Yet most of the men we meet feel that their personalities have been so shaped by their military experience that it will be difficult for them to return to their old neighborhoods; for some maybe even impossible. They seem more connected to each other than anything or anyone else. <br /> <br /> However, some men have never really bonded with anyone in the military. The murderer, Monty, is one of those individuals. We feel that he has never been connected in his civil life. He is a lone wolf who also needs people. Desperately alone, he has a sadistic tendency over a mile wide and always needs someone nearby to be the target of his jokes. The man he killed did not hurt him and was actually a stranger to him. But once Monty discovered the religion of man, that was enough. He did not really want to kill the guy because his intention was to "just" humiliate him and hit him. But since he was drunk at that moment, Monty's fists got the better of him. It is this act that sets the story in motion. <br /> <br /> Once the film starts moving, the other characters quickly become attentive. The opposite phone number of Monty is Keely, another soldier who, although introspective as Monty and somewhat detached, does not harbor any resentment towards anyone and seems to be a reasonable type, even kind. Finley, the homicide detective by pipe, is dandyish and a little oblivious to men in uniform, but he is more than a match for the various and mostly recalcitrant soldiers with whom he deals. The actors playing these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, give excellent performances, each in a different tone. Ryan, as Monty, is tense and paranoid and is always looking for someone around him. and one can feel his anguish to become a victim himself. As a Keely, Mitchum is discreet, almost nonchalant; he never raises his voice; and he seems to have more to say, more to offer, than the script allows. Young's performance has often been criticized as being too soft, but I find it falsely strong and offbeat. He cuts the policeman's stereotype hard, and makes Finley's character a prince of crime detection. <br /> <br /> There are few surprises in Crossfire, although the script is sometimes surprisingly well written. , even brilliant. Actor Paul Kelly plays one of the best short films in cinema as a "boyfriend" of a woman that a soldier takes in a bar. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and he may or may not live with her, although he seems quite relaxed in his apartment. The beauty of these scenes lies in the fact that nothing is specified, and that this man himself seems more than confused as to his role, his nature or his existence. These few scenes are somehow the thematic core of the film, the anomie. With the exception of the detective, all the men in the film are adrift, aimless and fundamentally lost, some more seriously than others. In this respect, Crossfire is, despite all the sermons of the end, a film about the vagueness of identity and the ease with which it can be lost or distorted. The men move from one bar to another in this movie as they embark on a sort of sly fellowship, their personalities blending into a kind of American male model. Then something happens, something is nailed. One word is mentioned, whether it is "Jew" or "hill", and things suddenly become tense, and the very notion of individuality, of identity outside the group, of anyone who does not resemble them becomes deeply offensive, even disgusting. Then, once the spirits have come to an end and everything that has provoked them has been solved or forgotten, the men find their normality as a cowardly and not a personal group, and the order is reestablished.
