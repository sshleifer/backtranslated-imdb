Chris Noth is a maniac who wrote a children's book as a young boy posing as a doctor threatening a community to push his sister's son to be the genius of his school. The only man who can arrest him is a policeman who respects his own rules and who is obliged to go undercover with the help of his mute father who communicates via the oujii board. Will Rick Springfield know what's going on? Or will someone sabotage his recording studio! Does the mentally handicapped boy who exploits the mobile book have clues? Look to find out! I do not invent anything!
