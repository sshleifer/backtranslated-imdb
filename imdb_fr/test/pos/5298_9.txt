I feel that what you think of this movie will depend heavily on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki movie before, you may get lost. If you have ever seen a Miyazaki movie, it will probably leave you totally confused, but you will not care! It's because I discovered that the first time I saw one of his animated films, I tried too hard to understand what was happening and why - and it affected my enjoyment of watch the movie. Now that I've seen just about every Miyazaki film, I see the quirk and I'm clearing it - taking advantage of the beauty of it all. In many ways, these films (at least for the Western audience) are like drugs: many strange and beautiful images that initially do not always make sense, but are really enjoyable to see! Of all the Miyazaki films, this one could have the most unusual and incomprehensible plot - even more than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. But, like these and many other Studio Gibli movies, if you just watch, you're rewarded with a fabulous tale. But as it is so difficult to describe (and others have already done), I will not even go there. <br /> <br /> As for the works, it's very typical of one of these Japanese films. there was a noticeable change. There was a very wide use of what looked like colored pencils for the backgrounds. It was NOT a bad thing at all - the pretty pastel look was very nice and unique. In some ways, it looked like a tiny part of Bill Plympton's artistic style that was infused into a typical Miyazaki film. With a high frame rate, an exceptional character animation (which imbues them with a lot of personality) and an excellent "wonder factor", this is an exceptional film for all ages. Although clearly designed for a younger audience (especially TOTORO fans), it's a bit scary here and there (during the storm segments), but there are a lot of great things for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically, so), I loved cute stuff and applauded the film from another world. <br /> <br /> A great movie - among the best of Miyazaki. I do not give him a 10 because I hesitate to do it - besides, I liked a few more films from the studio (especially TOTORO). But that does not mean you should not rush out and see it - do it and do yourself a favor.
