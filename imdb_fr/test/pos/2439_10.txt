it's one of my favorite movies ever! with casablanca and the cannibal holocaust, it's an almost perfect cinema. Rex Allen tells this wonderful story about a cougar that just needs a little love. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy and chaos on a riverbed! SEE THIS FILM IF YOU MUST KILL TO DO IT !!! you will not find a better cat image anywhere, with "outer space cat" coming in second. Charlie's performance is magnificent. even include cruelty to animals and intense logging! must love Disney, for all moral failures!
