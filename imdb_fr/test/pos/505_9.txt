In the ever-changing cinematographic genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the best made, and the most faithful to the content of the source .... Figuring in its debut in Dracula's Tomb of Marvel, writer has taken almost ALL the characters and elements of the comic story. Although changes have inevitably been made, the subtleties of the film come before all critics. Do not let any of your friends tell you differently: Blade is a good movie. If it sounds too comical for you, Stanley Kubrick snobs out there, it's because he's supposed to do it. Treat it, but do not lose it.
