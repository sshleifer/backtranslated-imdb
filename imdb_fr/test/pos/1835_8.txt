This movie is so cool. He told me to take full advantage of every moment of life. I think Bonnie Hunt (Jerry Maguire) writes well and I'm so happy that she gave aging actors the opportunity to have such important roles in the film. It's really good, in a society that worships wealth, health and youth, it was good to see a movie about normal people. The movie reminded me a lot of "While you slept" that I really like. If you do not like this film, work on your sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quotes: Megan Dayton: "I'm just saying, for your safety, do not shave your legs, because we will not let it go too far." Grace Briggs: "Megan is a first date. " Megan Dayton: "I got married on a first date, I'm sure you intend to keep your mind clear, but once you're in the moment, the male brain seems, I do not know not, everything they say is suddenly bright, legs are your only connection to reality. "Favorite scenes: Megan (Happy Hunting) rides a bike. All the scenes in the garden. The conversation and fellowship between grandfather and friends of the restaurant. Please do not miss this movie, it will warm your heart!
