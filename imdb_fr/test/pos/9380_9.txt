Never have the words "hidden gem" been so precise. Bad moviegoers could look everywhere for the next hidden darkness, sometimes with things like weasels tearing my flesh, but other times, luck will prevail and you could end up with something like the death bed, realizing with hope that it's not bad at all, it just has a bad title, and not even a bad title, but a humorous title that might discourage you, but Somehow Death Bed always enters the "bad" category. With a dark and empty atmosphere, Death Bed is a true masterpiece of low-budget horror, reserved for those lucky enough to enjoy a shadow as dark as a vision. <br /> <br /> Death Bed involves an incoherent behavior, And yet, the intriguing relationship between a demon in bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait, who only wishes to be able to spare someone the terrible destiny to be devoured by the yellow moss. Although it's not that scary, because it's a killer bed, Death Bed has all the qualities that make horror so successful. A dark and desolate atmosphere, confusion, a strange and subtle score and that quality of dream that this masterpiece displays almost. Such a quality or mood usually seems unintentional. Not only is it intentional, but from what I've read, Death Bed is based on a real dream. George Barry, the director, has transferred the dream to film successfully, only a genius could accomplish such a task. <br /> <br /> The old mansions are a horror of good quality, just like the portraits, not knowing what to do with the bed killer with its yellow liquid killer, a rather strange dream, indeed. In addition, this is not quite the mark of B-horror that I expected, given the title and all. Before viewing this gothic gem, I was expecting something more similar to Class Reunion Massacre, it's now a bad movie. If you've seen it before, you know what I'm saying. After reviewing all of the above, I feel as if Death Bed deserves only eight stars, but since it has remained so dark for so long, we will say that the bed that eats deserves nine.
