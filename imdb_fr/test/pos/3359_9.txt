Twenty-five sitcoms had big-screen effects. Most of them came in the 1970s. Here is a list: Are you in service, Blackadder, bless this house, Down, Father's Army, Father, dear father, for Ada's sake, George and Mildred, Gentlemen's League, love your neighbor, Lovers, Man About home, Nearest and dearest, Never pay attention to quality Feel breadth, In buses (3), S please Sir, Boiled, Rising Damp, Steptoe and Sons (2), It's your funeral, until our death, Up Pomeii (3), Whack-o, No matter what happened to the Apocalypse and the Probable guys. <br /> <br /> So there was a big screen version of my favorite sitcom, Dads Army. The film focused on the men's inscription. This showed the difficulty of getting a uniform and getting weapons. It was a big summary of the first series of Dads Army. At the end of the film, they catch German spies in the church. The Home Guard is dressed as an altar and carries a bayonet to defeat the Germans. The best part of the film was when they were simultaneously presenting a conference on HG and a German conference: German: head office on the phone, will you get 10,000 bombs, (CUT TO HOME GUARD) GODFREY: Mrs. Mainwaring on the phone, would you have 1 / 2lb of Brussels sprouts. <br /> <br /> It was probably the second best sitcom movie, beaten only by Till Death us do Part (1969). It would have been better if at the beginning of the film, it was already formed, it was in the middle of the war. Although it is still an excellent movie, a good movie for the family.
