Pink Flamingos: A representation of the company's past <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos, a film directed by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing portrait of the negative impact of a traumatized childhood on future life. Babs Johnson grew up in a very atypical house. Blatantly, you can see the impact it has had on society through its actions until the end when it engulfs dog feces. Was this film simply a sick and twisted perversion of heartbreaking episodes without end, or was it symbolic of something much deeper? To associate with the first would be the easy way out, and the second might seem crazy, but perhaps true. The film has a credible resemblance to the events of our societal past. All the leaders we consider "horrible" have characteristics similar to those of Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler and Joseph Staling all had a "troubling" childhood. Babs Johnson has had a troubling childhood and is therefore associated with the same class as all the leaders mentioned above. This is why many of his actions throughout the film can be considered disturbing. However, were her actions her fault or society's for allowing her to grow as she did. In addition, each character in this film represents a former leader or event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind, it can be linked to the genocide and Hitler's attempt to annihilate the Jews. Some consider Hitler a genius, others a madman. John Waters must have considered him a madman because his performance, Edith, was indeed suffering from mental illness. Edith's son, The Cookies and the traveling companion Cotton, symbolize what was wrong with our own backyard, slavery. Both names are slang terms that represent a period that most of us would rather forget. These characters are critically important insofar as they point out that our American society was sometimes no better than what we often consider to be horrific social assaults in other cultures. The chicken chicken scene is the embodiment of what was wrong with our society at that time, and it is always wrong. Chicken, is a slang term from the 1970s for woman. As a result, it is possible that John Waters attempted to bring the subject of rape to light through the actions of Cotton and Crackers. The family of antagonists, if only one antagonist can be determined in this film, was that of the Marbles. Marble is often mentioned in association with wealth. As a result, this may symbolize the struggle between the poor and the rich, a struggle that continues today and is likely to continue forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for her disturbing scenes, but it's also worthy of mentioning her camouflaged political agenda that Waters has displayed so influential throughout her journey.
