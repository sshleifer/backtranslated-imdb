These are just stories, some that we want to happen to us, others that we want to never happen to us, everything about unfulfilled desire. The places and the naked bodies are beautiful, but after the second story, I could not think that "it takes more than beauty to create a real movie". Then, of course, the film unfolds. The stories move except that Sophie Marceau can not communicate her story in this film. Malkovich plays the story for both of them. The voiceover does not connect the stories but helps Malkovich to provoke a reflection. <br /> <br /> I would say that it's worth seeing and that the best Antonioni I've seen. Given his age - remarkable!
