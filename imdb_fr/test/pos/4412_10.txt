A pile of human flesh is asleep on a red pillow. This is the piece of naked meat that is "Little Joe", a New York scammer who lives with his bisexual wife and small child. The film follows a day in his life, after his wife woke him up by asking him to go out and do the traditional male thing - to be a breadwinner. But she wants to use the bread to pay for the abortion of her new girlfriend. We are certainly not in the traditional family unit here ... <br /> <br /> After playing with his child, Joe goes out on the street looking for clients. Customers arrive quickly and well: the ordinary homosexual man who wants to see him again because they "work well together", the old English classicist scholar who pays $ 100 to see Joe pose as a former Greek athlete; the topless dancer who blows Joe then boasts of having been raped; the aging gym rabbit who does not think that what Joe and he do together is strange. After a hard day's work, Joe goes home exhausted, only to be shot by his wife and his girlfriend. He goes asleep as they harpoon and undermine him. <br /> <br /> The flesh is fascinating because it takes what is a traditional traditional structure - it has an incentive incident (money for abortion) and setting up, a confrontation and a resolution (even very discouraging), even a very motivated protagonist with purpose, before focusing on the details of the daily routine of those people who are perfectly ordinary but extraordinary for most "mainstream" people. All this seems very authentic and natural - it's hard to see the acting, the actors are so fully their roles - but all this is a sneaky artifice - a beautifully drawn portrait or a finely carved statue. Director Morrissey carefully paints every incident, every encounter around his theme of human flesh becomes a packed commodity, but with such a cunning hand that you hardly notice it. The woman "packages" Joe's sexual organ, the old Englishman deplores a vanished order of classical beauty that has created art and poetry from human carnal beauty, the strays of the stripper's friends pretend to be women while reading a Hollywood magazine in which women are packaged as products; the gym bunny buys Joe's friendship and affection, thinks that artificial porn is real and can not say, as we can not, that Joe is exploiting his friendship and intimacy to gain 'money. The film itself presents itself as the ultimate cinematographic realism, but we might as well take care here of works of art or a first example of conceptual art. <br /> <br /> Genius - a little used word - Morrissey had to find a way to get Warhol's artistic pretensions to make films, interesting but boring, and turn them into marketable products that remain among the most intriguing works of cinema ever made - commercial boxes labeled "Flesh" and "Trash" and "Heat" with a product label - "Andy Warhol" - selling an idea of ​​the product as much as the product itself -even. However, just as you come out of Morrissey's cynicism, you are fascinated by his ability to maintain the highest level of quality and depth. The constant appearances of camera flashes constantly draw attention to the filmic nature of what we see, and yet, we remain drawn into the illusion: Flesh is certainly one of the pieces of cinematic magic the most extraordinary that has ever fascinated an audience.
