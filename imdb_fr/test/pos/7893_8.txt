If Archie Bunker was armed, he could have been "Joe". However, "All in the family" would have had a fairly short term because the censors would never have allowed him to follow the movie of THIS film. Joe is a racist and swagger working class guy, who has a big mouth, especially when he's drunk. One night, he meets a man in a bar, Bill, who drinks a glass to soothe his tired nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's boyfriend, and passes it on to Joe. What happens is that Bill's daughter was living with the drug addict, and that she is taken to the hospital after an overdose, he passes near the apartment to pick her up, but does not expect to meet the boyfriend, who has just come out of a big drug business. In the ensuing fight, the boyfriend is accidentally killed and Bill does not want anyone to really know, of course. But he lets Joe escape, then when the newspapers and television reports come out, Joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes. He will join him later and Bill is of course concerned that Joe is going to blackmail him, but not for money, he wants to spend time with him. Which is, in a sense, almost worse. Now, Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic where she is and returns home and accidentally hears what happened. She is then on the run. her. This leads to a pretty shocking end, which for me was totally unexpected and ends on the right note, or the wrong note, depending on your point of view. A kind of decent but dark vision of life in the early 70's, mainly from the point of view of a bigot of the working class, which does not make it for everyone, but it's not a bad movie at all and it's a decent watch. 8 out of 10
