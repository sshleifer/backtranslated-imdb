I tend to like and love anime, because the more you watch, the more you notice that many shows are only poor copies of rare gems or questioning old formulas. But from time to time, one of the real jewels presents itself and its originality amazes you. Haruhi is really one of those shows. Many animated series are at the origin of the mangas and sometimes the translation into an animation is rather poorly made and does not use the advantages of the animation compared to the static drawings. Haruhi is actually based on a series of bright novels and unexpected fires, a beautiful animation, an excellent voice, excellent music and a full and well-paced story. Look at that, you will not be disappointed, and I would suggest looking at it in order of broadcast, it works so much better as well.
