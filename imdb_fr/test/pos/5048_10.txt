It's a fantastic movie. Hána is a very old man with a very young heart. He knows how to live his daily life to the full by teaming up with his friend who is doing pranks on just about everything, even his own death. Although his wife can not handle her "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows that this is exactly why she has loved her husband for almost half a century. I would love to spend time with this old man because he knows how to live and is not afraid of death. He is happy, witty, playful and never boring. Vlastimil Brodský brilliantly played Hána at the age of 79. Every look in his eyes and every movement of his aging muscles delivers so much about the character to the public. It's a film that leaves a big smile on my face and makes me look at my life a little closer. Tomorrow, I'm going to buy a mansion and have a little fun. If Hána can, I can too. But I think I'm going to skip the smoking part.
