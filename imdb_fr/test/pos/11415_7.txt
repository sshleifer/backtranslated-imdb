Although I read all the complaints about this movie before I saw it, I still had an interest since the preview. I do not know if it was because I was expecting a bomb or what, but I really enjoyed the movie. I was not very scared at all until the second half of the movie, but even then it was not very bad at all. I think most scenes and false alarms were realistic, even if they were a little too casual, but it was necessary to advance the story. I think that the house and its surroundings are the ideal setting for this type of film. It's beautiful and huge, but the same qualities that attract are scary. I also think that the arrangement of the lights worked very well, because not only did they light at the entrance, but there was no way to keep them, so that the house remained dark outside the small section in which Jill was. Speaking of Jill, I thought her role was pretty well played. At first, it was not so credible, but after a few calls, it was good. In fact, the scenes where she is afraid are perfectly played. And, finally, someone has understood poker well. I can not tell you how many times when I hear a noise at home, I catch the poker in the fire, and it was a nice touch for her to do the same thing, even if she foolishly forgets it when she needs it most. /> <br /> Regarding the holes in the plot, the movie is not perfect, but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the mystery is how it came in..exactly, how long did he watch? how did he go out to kill his friend? and when exactly is the gardener dead? Overall, I appreciated and was surprised at how quickly it happened. This caught my attention and I wanted to see how it ended, although the end was very short and leaves a bad taste in the mouth. My only complaint, other than the end, was the lack of character development. They could have added ten minutes with her and her friends or something to make us feel worse for her situation, to give us a taste of her personality and to let us guess how she will handle the situation (for example, the scene where she wonders if it is necessary to go back for the children, it seems that it is missing at the beginning a scene which spoke about her caring only for herself or something else).
