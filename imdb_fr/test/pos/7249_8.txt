So, that might not be completely accurate historically. And there is little or no real development of the character. But for the first attempt of Jake (son of Ridley) Scott, the price of the ticket is well worth it. <br /> <br /> Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller is still good) can be a gentleman, but he has not yet got the money or the clothes to prove it. Plunkett (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes) is an apothecary outlaw. The circumstances of their strange meeting involve a corpse, a ruby ​​and finally a partnership as Gentlemen Highwaymen. As the slogan says, "they rob the rich ... and that's all". There is not really much substance, or even deep development, but the objective seems to be to relieve the aristocracy of enough money and jewels to pay for the passage of the two men of the road in America. A small problem: MaCleane falls in love. With Rebecca (Liv Tyler), the ward of the Chief Justice. Who happens to have also attracted the attention of the general thieves. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite original, the cast is excellent (especially Alan Cumming in the role of Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller, the drag-queen, - also together in "Trainspotting", their dynamic is Fantastic, the makeup is outrageous, and the music is a harsh techno with a strangely classic nuance.Jake Scott has an eye for light and shadows, a good sense of balance between show and plot, and he has nothing wrong with showing the more unpleasant side of London in the seventeenth century, and fortunately for us, he likes the close-ups of faces, especially the eyes, the eyes of Jonny Lee Miller, and Liv Tyler too, but hey. Who does this movie sound about? Rebecca? No. Plunkett and MaCleane, but this film is not just about pretty faces, but at the risk of looking like a cliché it's a fast, furious and sometimes frustrating ride with the noblest band robbers since Robin Hood.Cadadent, sordid and violen t, Scott's first film is an entertaining evening at the cinema. <br /> <br /> As MaCleane said, "I was great, and it was a good laugh!"
