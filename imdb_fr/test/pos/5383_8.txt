Bravestarr was published in 1987 by the now-defunct American animation company, Filmation on the Back of He-Man: Masters of the Universe and She-Ra: Princess of Power, respectively in 1983 and 87 '. The plot of the caricature was about a Native American cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr, with the strength of the bear, the wolf's ears, the speed of the puma and the eyes of a hawk, and his faithful sidekick, a horse named Thirty-Thirty, who carried with him a firearm called "Sarah Jane" and, with the help of Deputy Fuzz and Judge JB, protected New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his band of -law. <br /> <br /> Futuristic Texas was and still is, to this day, one of the rare caricatures to take place in a particular city, in the United States, so in the south of the country, with thousands of light years into the future. Considering this was done in the 80s, the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the Far West look, but from a science fiction perspective. Bravestarr not only talked about morals and good verses, but also taught life lessons to children, but also brought to light issues of culture and community, and that we should not take things and life for granted. And while this is an adventure cartoon, there are many topics, stories and themes that resonate with children and adults in a way that suits them. In addition, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the very first (ethnic) minority cartoon characters to have an impact on television. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were incredible, the music was excellent, the song theme just as memorable and the animation was wonderful. The characters were well-designed and the stories were varied and taught the children the moral and importance of what is right and what is wrong. Unfortunately, the same can not be said of today's caricatures. <br /> <br /> If Bravestarr has been overshadowed by the success of He-man, he remains the personal favorite of many cartoon fanatics of the 80's. Suffice to say that I preferred Bravestarr to He-man because the diversity of stories, characters, and depth of the situations and issues that the characters were facing, were rather what I would say realistic and contrasting. For some reason, they have more resonance with people because, for example, in "The Pledge", where a child dies of an overdose, the fact that there was no happy ending was important - in the sense that when children watch this episode In fact, anyone watching this episode will realize by itself the devastating consequences of drug use and that no one should underestimate the dangers of the drug. <br /> <br /> Bold, brave and sometimes disconcerting, Bravestarr is definitely bold, brave and provocative. A classic cartoon cult for many years to come, he dared to take risks, but it has indeed paid off in the end. Many cartoon fans will remember him as one of the most interesting and best cartoons of the 1980s, and rightly so. <br /> <br /> 8 and a half in ten
