A girl begins to notice that the inhabitants of her small town are fascinated by everything in the shape of a spiral. Soon, fascination turns to obsession and things become deadly. Although I will not say that "Uzumaki" was an excellent film, I would say it was different from anything I've seen before. Throughout my viewing, I felt like I was watching a cartoon. There are fun passages between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes. Later, I discovered that the movie was an adaptation of a comic manga, so it makes sense. However, just when you think of watching a movie that could be a children's movie, you're bombarded with nasty and bloody visuals! The story is often late and the end is somewhat abrupt and seemed anti-climactic at the time, but in retrospect, I appreciate it more for its originality. My rating: 7/10.
