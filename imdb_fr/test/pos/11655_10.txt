Susan Sarandon is, for want of a better word, incredible. In my opinion (and yes I understand that not everyone will agree with me here), she is one of the greatest actresses of all time and should have at least 2 Oscars to her credit. I mean, it was an amazing performance in Lorenzo's Oil (but then I think every performance of hers is amazing) and they gave it to Emma Thompson ... what was it like ??? And by the time she had this Oscar, she was in the industry for about 25 years. I could not think of anyone who deserved it more, especially for a performance as brilliant as his portrayal of Sister Helen Prejean. But again, it's all about the artificiality of Hollywood and it does not need to be Oscar - people know it's good, anyway. <br /> <br /> This film contains very deep and provocative messages, so useless. to say that this should not be taken lightly. Tim Robbins, of course, can not escape the credit here. One would think that because of the feelings of his person against the death penalty, the representations made in this film would not be accurate. However, both sides of the debate on the death penalty have equal weight. On the one hand, you see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side, which makes the testimony of his death rather heartbreaking. At the same time, you see how he saved his victims and the constant torment of his parents, deeply bewildered. A word for Tim - BRAVO. <br /> <br /> A brilliant film and, as I said, a well-deserved and long-awaited Oscar.
