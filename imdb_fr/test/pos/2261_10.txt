If you have ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. Teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip-hop and break-dance aside from jokes on airbags in cars and waitresses completely shocked to meet a vegetarian, this movie really captures fragments of Ukraine that you will never know if you go there. I spent most of the movie shaking my head thinking, "Yes, that's absolutely true." It's very funny if you understand Russian too, because subtitles do not always do it justice. The actors are so credible and Elijah Wood does a great job playing with a socially incompetent Jewish child. My favorite character is without a doubt Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., the "guide dog" of the grandfather, who is really a psychopathic border collie. The characters are so eclectic and so likeable that you believe they are real people.
