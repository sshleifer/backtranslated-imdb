"I'm ... proud of 'Head'," said Mike Nesmith. It should be, because this film, which has been either derided by many of us, or studied and scrutinized by film teachers, works on many levels. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's unconventional. For many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers handed you the film and tried: "You understand it." You probably already know that the Monkees TV show has been a dazzling marketing success that depends on the business acumen public deception service. Television shows are about selling soap and toothpaste before entertaining. The fact that The Monkees escaped from the box for a short time to do "Head" is a testament to the popularity and importance of the band in pop culture, despite your head. Let's be clear: "Head" is not the show The Monkees TV. <br /> <br /> So here we have a "psychedelic documentary" about Western pop culture, which comes from a source that has authority on the subject. "Head" is a film that can only come from those "inside the box". In 1968, the actors and the team at The Monkees were seasoned and tired professionals who had seen their share of promises and disappointments. The film was a deliberate attempt to reposition the market. Three things have been done: Make a film in the manner envisaged by The Monkees. More importantly, reinvent the group into a group that is not subject to its old bosses - and your youth. Make a film that has revealed American attitudes to information dissemination. <br /> <br /> "Head" really concerns the handling of the media and its net result: disappointment. The media are supposed to inform us, inform us about world events around the world and finally ask us to formulate opinions about these events that can turn thought into positive action. Thus, we assume that the information we absorb is complete and unbiased - if not, how to make a valid conclusion about an idea presented by a book, a newspaper or a television show? In one of the street interviews in "Head", a man confessed: "I have not watched a newspaper or television for years". Is he inferior or better man? Even the parallels of drugs are a soft veil of "Things are not as they seem." Remember the old joke, "All you know is wrong"? The scenario begins with The Monkees' public admission of his own "fabricated image" and literally works with the football. Is the football scene in the film a visual manifestation of the very idea of ​​"Head"? Is the film an exercise in the flow of consciousness? Is the film the culmination of smoking marathons? There are too many coincidences in the film that suggest the opposite. I guess "Head" is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intentional and unintentional. <br /> <br /> Basically, the initiates responsible for "Head" seem to have fun during the festivities that take place in the film, but there is anger - anger at the chaos that characterized the end of the 1960s and how the media, especially television, has changed the culture in a negative way. Drugs and violence were powerful negative forces in the late 1960s and still are, but the Head producers want you to know that bad news is a much bigger danger. <br /> <br /> Wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies. What ideal way to spread misinformation only through television? On several occasions, the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle for The Monkees and, apparently, for all of us as well. In one scene, Peter sits gloomily in a living room holding a melting ice cream cone. Another monkey asks him, "What's wrong?" "I bought this ice cream cone and I do not want it." The film suggests that the primary purpose of the media is NOT to inform, but to mass sell blindly. "Head" goes a step further: place any idea in someone's head and go with joy. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers know it well and the danger is real. "Head" is either a film that is created "as and when", or a deliberate statement. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it's just "advertising," as critics pointed out in 1968. The jokes are about The Monkees and about us. Pay attention to what you ask for, you can get it. <br /> <br /> To yours: A real guilty pleasure. Very funny. Smart. It will please the fans. Find the stuff, it's there. Shamelessly weird. Weird collection of characters. Good tuning The length is appropriate. A lot of great liners, including my favorite prophet of all time: "The tragedy of your time, my young friends, is that you can get exactly what you want." <br /> <br /> Warnings: dated. Drug addicts. No land. No linear delivery of any particular thought. At least twenty-five stories intertwined. So, can easily frustrate. May seem pretentious to some. People who do not support Les Monkees do not need to watch, although this is not a reason in itself to avoid it. Psychedelic special effects can kill your sick picture tube or acid-burned eyeballs. <br /> <br /> Match, cut.
