On the basis of its current IMDb classification as well as several plot summaries, I did not expect much from "Two Hands" but as I was wrong. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, you stay immersed in a genre that has not ceased to be original for a long time. Even in terms of staging and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film of great imagination. If you're looking for a film that's not only entertaining but also provocative, compelling and truly extraordinary, make it the next movie you watch. <br /> <br /> I hope that the tragic death of Heath Ledger will have brought more people to get this film. He was an incredible talent and his performance in this area is not to be missed. Do not make the mistake of judging and throwing this amazing movie before you have seen it.
