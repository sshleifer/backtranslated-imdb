Of all the episodes of all the series, this one is the closest to the basic principle of Roddenberry. According to the book THE MAKING OF STAR TREK, in the guide written by Roddenberry for his story writers, he claims that any alien creature, as horribly ugly, unbelievable, benign or wicked, MUST possess a semblance of humanity that television viewing the public can sympathize with and / or relate to. HORTA of Devil In The Dark, which looks like a big stain of cow dung, is a mother who protects her babies, these ball-shaped silicon nodules that miners continue to find in the mining passages and destroy them, as they have no idea what. they are! This is one of my absolute favorite episodes, if only for that!
