*** SPOILERS *** Even though the movie "They made me a criminal" is nowhere as good as John Garfield's classic anti-heroes like "Body & Soul" in 1947 "Force of Evil" in 1948 and his last and very underrated "He made it all the way" in 1951, this is the film that defined his career from that moment until his untimely death on May 21, 1952 at age 39 years old. <br /> <br /> Garfiled plays the role of lightweight champion Johnnie Bradfield and later fugitive Jack Dorney who is innocent of the murder he is charged with, even though he was officially declared dead. Jonnie's director, Doc Ward, Robert "Doc" Gleckler, who during the party for the drunken victory killed journalist Charles McGee, John Ridgely, who was going to publicly expose his fighter, Johnnie Bradfield, lying on the fact that he is a man and non-alcoholic. Mom's boy. Doc Gleckler broke a bottle over McGee's head, while Jonnie was almost drunk dead with several women celebrating in her hotel room. <br /> <br /> Doc was later killed in a car accident with Johnnie's girlfriend, Goldie, Ann Sheridan, but Doc burned and, under Johnnie's supervision, was mistaken for Johnnie. He is told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer, Malvin, Robert Strange, who took $ 9,750.00 out of the $ 10,000.00 of Johnnie's money he had for this great advice. Malvin asked Johnnie to assume a new identity and to call himself now Jack Dorney to get out of New York. talk about ladys shysters. Johnnie now Jack Dorney travels the rails from New York to Arizona to Rancho Rafferty Date Farm, where most of the movie takes place. <br /> <br /> If John Garfield had not starred in Jonnie Bradfield and Jack Dorney, the movie would have long been lost and forgotten. Garfield, who was only 26 at the time, brought the best of everyone in the film. Even the transported Dead End Kids, I guess we can call them the Arizona Kids here, have played higher notches than you would have expected from them and they have emerged as real, sensitive people, not as clown slaps. , as in almost all cases. their films. All because of being on the same stage or the same location with John Garfield. <br /> <br /> "They made me a criminal" is a good story in which the infiltrated champion acts like anything but does not want to draw attention to himself and finds himself not only behind the bars but also under the electric chair. In the end, Jack showed what kind of man he was by not fighting the big fight and all the difficulties in a dramatic way by winning at the last moment, but by making four brutal rounds to get the money from his new family found at Peggy's daughter farm, Gloria Dickson, to open a gas station with her. <br /> <br /> Giving European champion Gaspar Rutchek, Frank Riggi, the fight of his life and winning $ 2,000, or $ 500 a round, to do it, Jack showed everyone watching him like the "Arizona Kids" that sometimes, taking a punch is much braver and braver than throwing a shot. The fact that Jack could have easily scrambled Rutched but did not do so not to expose himself to the police, as with the casual killer Johnnie Bradfield. But instead of going as far as he could, taking whatever Rutchek could throw at him to help his friends, showed more than all the fights he had won in the boxing ring. <br /> <br /> For my part, I have not found the end of the artificial film at all, but it fits the story perfectly. The cop Morty Phelam, Claude Rains, came from New York in Arizona to arrest Jack had to live for years with the fact that he had once sent an innocent man to the electric chair. We were told all this from the beginning of the film. Why do you know that Jack / Johnnie was innocent of the murder of which he is accused, and not know for sure if he will be cleared by a court, would he want to make the same mistake again? I can easily see what is happening in real life, why not in movies.
