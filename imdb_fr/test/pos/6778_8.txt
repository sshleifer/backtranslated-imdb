From Gr√∏nne Slagtere or The Green Butchers, as it is called in English, is a very dark comedy about two losers who work for a popular butcher. They are tired of criticizing their bosses and decide to start their own business. Their store is expensive and there is not even electricity everywhere. And to make matters worse, they have no customers (as their former boss had predicted). When the man visits them in their store, he challenges them to provide the meat for the dinner he is organizing. <br /> <br /> There is a tragic accident. One of the butchers locks the electrician in the freezing chamber when he closes the store. The man dies and the neurotic of the two butchers decides to cut the nets of the thigh of the electrician and serves them for dinner instead of calling the police. It's an incredible success. At the same time, all the inhabitants of the village want to taste this incredible "chicken". Upset by his sudden success, the butcher sees no option but to kill more people, whom he can sell as chicken. <br /> <br /> I guess the cannibalism in question may not please everyone, especially not because it's shown with a lot of humor. Personally, I loved it. This shows how well some people would go in the direction of social acceptance and get out of their isolation. It may sound a little far-fetched, but I'm sure you'd be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act. <br /> <br /> Beside the initial subject, the actors also liked me. performance and humor. As you would expect in this kind of movies, there is no bidding, everything is very sober and realistic (I guess it is typical of Scandinavian and Scandinavian movies). The same for humor. I'm sure I would not have liked it so much as now if the humor had been exaggerated, or with a lot of vomiting, ... as you so often see in American movies. I loved this movie and gave it a 8/10.
