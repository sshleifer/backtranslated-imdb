To summarize my use of the term "realistic" in the summary, I do not know many elderly people claiming to be famous maestros, blind, etc. - and I've never been that old. These minor problems, the relationships between the characters in this movie and the emotions it expresses were quite realistic and authentic. In fact, even though we are not yet 30 years old, I could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife. For those who do not die young (there is a good phrase in the film about this, when the two best friends talk about dying young, and one of them says - and I paraphrase, we missed our chance - we'll just have to hold on), we'll all be where these characters will be someday. I know that many moviegoers would rather be swept away from reality than face it, but even these would appreciate the soft reminder of our mortality - and the importance of living life to the fullest - that this movie is.
