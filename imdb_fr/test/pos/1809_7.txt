This typical teen movie is one of the best. In addition to the story, it is good, the music accompanies the film well. <br /> <br /> Although I do not like classic film unless it is a classic written script and better, this one is exceptional. Maybe the hairstyle and the language should change a bit, in the 80s, I think offensive language is still rarely heard. <br /> <br />
