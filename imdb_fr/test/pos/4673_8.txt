I find it sad that if Edward Norton did not want to be in the film or have nothing to do with it, people automatically think that the film is nil, without even looking at it or giving it a chance. I really hope Norton did not do that. He's a good actor and he's all made a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it amusing. It was not great or anything with crazy special effects, but it was not bad. It was funny to watch. But yes, certainly not a bad / horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
