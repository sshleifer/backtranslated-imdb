The Spanish Inn is full of energy, honest, realistic and refreshing. It is not a comedy or a drama but rather a film of life that deals with this group of very interesting but normal young people who share an apartment in Barcelona for a year. Beautifully photographed with a beautiful soundtrack. If you are older, this movie should bring back an avalanche of good memories. If you are young, learn by this example.
