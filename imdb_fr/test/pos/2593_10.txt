In one of Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck's many caricatures, Elmer Fudd goes hunting and Daffy tries to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has its own agenda. In addition, "Rabbit Seasoning" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it could ruin your speech in a hilarious and royal way). <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of this cartoon is probably the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems to have been risky for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they are doing just fine, as they have always done. In short, it shows to what genius were the authors of these drawings.
