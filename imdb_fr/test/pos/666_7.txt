This special complaint from BRASS EYE's PAEDO-GEDDON was overwhelmed by complaints (it will be discussed later) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate on a possible "Sarah Law" as a result of kidnapping and murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne. In fact, the schedule was delayed when Phil Collins took a legal opinion after discovering that he would have been duped by the creator of the series, Chris Morris, in launching a campaign called Nonce-sense <br /> If truth Be told that the controversy is probably more successful in the series than in a content of very bad taste, but I admit that I laughed with laughter. The edition focuses on pedophiles and how society treats them, as well as their victims. Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous pedophile was launched into space and then admits that an eight-year-old was accidentally placed in the capsule with the pedophile. Cue the frightened cries of the child. As I said in very bad taste <br /> <br /> Other highlights of the series include Dr. Fox giving a scientific lecture that pedophiles share the same nervous system as crabs ("Nobody know it, but it's a scientific fact "). Member of Parliament Barbara Follet warns the public that pedophiles are being equipped while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warns viewers that pedophiles can send gas over the Internet, making young children vulnerable to sexual predators, including a victim who now has the sexuality of a sixty-year-old colonel. "Morris also shows a police officer on the child protection team a series of photos of whether they are considered obscene. Barbie with conjugal helpers and a composite photo of a young boy's head, a dog's body and an erect penis that could have belonged to John Holmes Hey, I never said that this show was good taste, is not it? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical debacle surrounding it, where politicians, children's organizations and p The officers rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject. The series was in bad taste despite the fact that I laugh all the time but it's a biting satire. Critics should perhaps take a long look in the mirror, where a liberal elite will allow people condemned to suffer pedophile mud on the streets of Britain before criticizing a simple TV show for exacerbating tensions.
