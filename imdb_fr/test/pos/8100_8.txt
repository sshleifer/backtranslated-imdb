Ok, it's too long and too satisfied with itself. Yet, "The Great Dictator" is a fascinating film. Chaplin did a remarkable job of satirizing Hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the Jews in Nazi Germany (this was before the concentration camps were known). It's not a Chaplin masterpiece, but it's worth a visit. <br /> <br />
