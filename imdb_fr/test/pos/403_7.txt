Another beautiful entry in the Crime Doctor series [# 4/10], with an almost blackish black-and-white photograph and splendid Hispanic backdrops and backgrounds. And a more offbeat story too! <br /> <br /> A man who looks like the crazy killer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a theatrical dinner. The Crime Doctor is on the scene (apparently as a guest) to proclaim immediately and with resignation that he is a murder. So we are faced with a rather strange group of people to ruminate, because one of them committed the act. Was it the brother of the 1st deceased wife, the 3rd wife and the rich widow Hilary Brooke, the vampire dancing brother and sister, the intense young man, the eccentric carpenter Lloyd Corrigan, on loan from Boston Blackie, irreplaceable butler Jerome Cowan ? Police Inspector Emory Parnell had some work to do, but Warner Baxter as Ordway was as indefatigable as ever. One of the gaffes listed on the IMDb is wrong: While entering the killing room, Ordway says "In the center of the front" and Cowan replies "He did not miss this time". Favorites: Baxter and Cowan traveling between clubs and beer at the disco to be forgiven their dinner; The scene where Braga's resting place is apparently scolded. The plot seems a bit sinuous at times and the way it was all explained was perhaps more worthy of Monogram, but leaving it in supernatural air would not do it either! <br /> <br /> Look if you already like the genre, you will not be disappointed unless you do not really like the genre.
