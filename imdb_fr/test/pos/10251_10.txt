The film was very good when it came out, I attended Cooley High and Cooley High Grade Center. Around 1968, I was also a queen returning home. I grew up and lived in the Cabrini Greens area. it was nice to see friends in the movie who lived in the area as well, and they were lucky enough to be a star who may have been a unique experience in their life, I had a good time in Growing up on the North Side and Hard Times, I can understand the movie Cooley High is no longer standing, but a person like me and others still remembers the fun we had growing up in Cooley High. There is a lot of history around this region on the north side.
