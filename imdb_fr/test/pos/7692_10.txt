I saw this film when I was a child and I've been looking for it ever since.It is worth mentioning Cabin in The Sky, Stormy Weather and Carmen Jones not to be missed in the films featuring the incredible talent of African-Americans in In the 1960s, Los Angeles local TV stations had a movie of the week and some stations broadcast the same movie for 5 days. Porgy and Bess was one of them and my whole family would be showing the 5 displaced on the ads. The South Pacific, Oklahoma and The Sound of Music are all music classics that you can buy at any video store. It would be a shame to leave this collection of talents among the most talented that America can offer to be forgotten or locked in a safe. Please make the film accessible to the public.
