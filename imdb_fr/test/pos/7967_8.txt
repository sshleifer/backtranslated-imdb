I have reason to love the big users of a camera; the fluid direction of action lends itself to fast-paced adventure and humorous storytelling; but such skill, in the hands of King Vidor or Anthony Mann, can also be applied to work at the idea level. This is the masterpiece of Paul Wendkos. His story can be sold in a single pair of sentences. General Hector Cordoba settles almost emperor in northern Mexico and steals a huge gun at General Blackjack Pershing. he sends his divided, uneasy but determined mission unit, led by George Peppard, to retrieve the cannon and bring Cordoba back to life, to end the rebellion. Charismatic, Raf Vallone plays Cordoba; the women in the room are Giovanna Ralli and Francine York; with the team even more composed of Nico Minardos, Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. John Larch and John Russell are among the other pillars of the class. Miss Ralli and an obstinate Mexican, Teniente (Gabriela Tinti), whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba set up, are also preparing for an already extremely dangerous operation. The danger is multiplied when Gordon's brother, an advanced spy, is captured and tortured to death while he has to watch ... and decides that he must kill Peppard. The attack that captures the cannon, when Peppard's orders are not obeyed by a regular army type, is one of the most electrifying visual and stage achievements in film history. the penetration of the fortress of Cordoba, the revelations that were discovered there and the actions which give a chance to the team of the mission to win the victory - or almost - are perfectly presented. It's a beautiful adventure film in color, with exceptionally strong costumes, role playing, lighting, art direction sets and Elmer Bernstein's music. Stephen Kandel's screenplay is probably his best for a feature film. This is probably the most underestimated western at the moment, but I have always appreciated the fact that his heroes are fiercely committed. But, as Peppard reminds his group on their way home, "the problem with being a" hero "is the next morning." To find out why he says it, you will have to see "Cannon For Cordoba".
