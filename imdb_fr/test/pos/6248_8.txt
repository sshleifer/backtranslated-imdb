The lost oasis of Slausen. . . a place to eat, have fun. . . and MURDER! After the disappearance of a man who was going to a gas station, a group of friends went on a trip to look for him. They meet a wax museum where they think their friend might have finished. Unfortunately for friends, however, the owner of the roadside attraction has the power to control his wax mannequins and use them for harm. One by one, tourists are arrested and killed by Slausen and his legion of wax models. Can friends escape or will they suffer the same fate as their lost friend? Following the traces (and twisting) of the classic wax films (Wax House, Museum of the Mystery of Wax), Tourist Trap pushes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its strange history and style. . Regarding character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems to be just a basic movie. But it goes far beyond when the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is. The cast of actors ranges from acceptable (from the main cast) to very good (from Mr. Slausen (Backwoods artist) (interpreted by western legend Chuck Connors)). The writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured, but there are some flaws in the logic because the film sinks deeper into the story. In addition, some scenes are a little ridiculous, like the attack of the mannequin moaning on Becky. However, nothing would hurt the effect of the film. As you would expect from a film on wax mannequins, it is filled with the endless goose bumps provided by the dummies. It is strange that a (mainly) inanimate object can simply remain motionless and be so disturbing. . . maybe it's the human resemblance, or the empty stare, or the fact that you know it's going to trigger an attack. . . anyway, the dolls are extremely spooky and this effect is very well used throughout the film. As far as slashers are concerned, this is one of the best, and it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Slasher mandatory items: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: The movie is full of cool dead. The gore is not excessive, but it is well done and leaves realistic. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is a long skinny scene with very attractive head females (although very attractive). 'is just beginning to describe the delightful future-angel Tanya Roberts) but it's a joke, girls staying mostly underwater. However, they are barely dressed throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Cool Slayer (s): Creepy is just the beginning of Slausen and his models. One of the best slasher sub-genre killers. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: From the beginning of the movie, the movie maintains a great mix of goosebumps of the dummies, from the fear level of suspense in the stalled situation. . . all this is very well done to make a really scary movie. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: The mystery was not really the goal of the movie. . . the meaning behind all this is what counts. <br /> <br /> - Clumsy dance scene: All these pretty girls and not a single dance. Shame. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8/10. See this scary slasher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
