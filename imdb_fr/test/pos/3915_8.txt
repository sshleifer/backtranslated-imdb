I saw this film during the opening night and I enjoyed it. I probably would have liked more if I had not been sitting next to my father. My dad saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through everything. He kept saying that the movie was nil and that it was stupid. The fact is, he did not understand that the creators were making a mockery of the horror genre with the movie. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character described. If they were not in the movie, well, you might not like it too much. The characters of the brand are: <br /> <br /> "The main character": Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) "The boyfriend of the main character": Wade (Jared Padalecki) "The brother of the main character / ( soon to come) reformed Jerk ": Nick (Chad Michael Murray)" The boring sluttish character ": Paige (Paris Hilton)" Characters who are not far to be pretty ": Dalton (Jon Abrahams) & Blake (Robert Ri ' chard) <br /> With these characters, this makes it slightly predictable who will die and who will live. Obviously, you know who's going with what I just typed. The film may be predictable (in fact, I had a pretty good idea of ​​who would die just by watching the trailer), but it was still nice. It may sound stupid (why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted campsite that did not exist at first?) Sometimes, but it's very easy to watch. Comedy and gore were perfect for faint-hearted moviegoers, it gets gore, do not get me wrong, (less than "Final Destination 2"), but it works fine. not as hot as the fire, the decor was going up, but the temperature could still burn the "Wax".
