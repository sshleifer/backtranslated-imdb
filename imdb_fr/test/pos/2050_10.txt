This movie is actually one of my favorites of all time. I'm not a fan of Renny Harlin because most of his films are void, but TLKG hits his mark time and time again. TLKG talks about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis) who suffers from amnesia. she is married to a child and as she says "I am a fucking member of the PTA." and then his world collapses as the elements of his previous identity come into place. Samuel Jackson plays a crook who does concerts with PI. He is trained by her to resolve her identity and get paid a little money for her job. On the way, we discover that Samantha is actually Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy left to death years ago. the plot is great, giving the impression that this story is real and that Jackson does a great job as a second violin for Davis (who always does a great job as an actor). the explosions are endless, the action is intertwined with memorable scenes after memorable scenes. It's pretty impressive visually, although the kid gets on my nerves in the end (watch the cars!) I'm fed up with little kids who screw up a movie to save him, but still, this movie is worth it hardly because the kid adds to the film. once again, this film is really good, I never understood why it did not do more at the box office, but if it was a man playing in the film, I'm sure it would have brought back one hundred million dollars. What is good is that over the years, more and more people are discovering this film and give it good ratings, because the average of this film on this site has increased over the years. I hope it will go further because it's a great action movie. and I like action movies
