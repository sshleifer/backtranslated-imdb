In moments of desperation, we were ready to do whatever it took to win. I loved how the futility of the Maple Leaves was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa. The acting was accurate and far superior to the bogus consumption given by the film industry. <br /> <br /> Excellent editing! At the end of the short film, I found that it was a little incomplete, but life too, and it is life and art that turn into a cinematographic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Excuse me while I rinse the hissing cheese, but I guess it's okay at times. <br /> <br /> Two scenes that I must highlight are: The bathtub and the sofa scene. <br /> <br /> The sofa scene for Tessa was a defining moment for 360 of the human condition. Throughout the short film, I considered her a brute, but now we see her true reality. His mind spoke in front of his heart. Should I say more about the bathtub scene?
