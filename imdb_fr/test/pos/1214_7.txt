It was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX 14 years later, the WWE had accumulated so many matches, some were useless. I will not go through all the games on the card because it will take forever. <br /> <br /> However, one of the highlights of the event was the huge pop for Demolition, which won the team belts by Haku and Andre the Giant, First mixed match with Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri vs. Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire. First clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan. <br /> <br /> Some games have been a waste of time. Like The Bolsheviks vs. The Hart Foundation, it only lasted about 40 seconds, Koko B Ware vs. Rick Martel was short and Big Bossman vs. Akeem was too short. <br /> <br /> Mr. Perfect versus Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBiase versus Jake 'the Snake' Roberts was really very good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating - B
