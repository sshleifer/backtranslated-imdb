I thought it was a beautiful movie. it's not my favorite movie - Chungking Express is this place - this one is very different from anything I've seen of him. he is slow (but not boring) - he takes his time and thinks about the characters .. there is little movement in the frame - the shooting is beautiful. the game is great. the film looks like a long, warm, comforting drink.
