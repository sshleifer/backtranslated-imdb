You want a movie that takes you? Well it's a good choice. If you were a teenager of the era portrayed in this movie - Motown's paradise - or if you want to go back and see what your parents made so much noise, I suggest you take this movie to watch it. At the risk of appearing cliche, you will laugh, you will cry, you will remember and remember. You will come back to a time when violence in school was a fight in your hand. You will fondly remember your best school friends. It's a good movie with a touch of anguish, pain and realism: misconceptions, losing friends, deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone, no matter what their race, their age, their socio-economic status, can get something out of this movie and really appreciate it. So, take a few hours on a lazy day and watch this movie; There are far worse ways to spend your time.
