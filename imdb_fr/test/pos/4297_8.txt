I wish there were more films on middle-aged people. The intellectual journey and the meanders of the moral road of life make the viewing interesting. There seems to be a different standard of judgment for women who have extra-marital relationships compared to men. The hurtful and humiliating behavior of Amy Watson towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one would expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and insightful, she could have told him, she left and waited for a large financial settlement probably after the divorce. The country and London scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich, while the autumn weather superbly adds to the melancholy background. The end is perfect, so in step with the real adult life.
