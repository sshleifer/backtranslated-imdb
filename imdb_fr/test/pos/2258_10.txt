This film was one if not the best movie I saw last year. I highly recommend it. It starts out being a very funny movie, but the progress of the film turns into a lot more. do yourself a favor and see this movie. I've seen a film from this movie but I'm going to buy it not only for myself, but for many real moviegoers, I have the unfortunate feeling that this great film will be largely unknown, as is the case with so much other non-commercial films comic film but ripping it will make you laugh it will make you cry it will make you think and yes you will think when it's over and is not a good movie!
