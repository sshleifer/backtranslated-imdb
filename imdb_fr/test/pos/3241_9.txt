Even if it moves a little away from the book, you can not help but enjoy the music and the atmospheric settings. <br /> <br /> The scenes in Bath are exactly what they should be. Although if you have watched this as many times as you have noticed, you will notice that the characters in the background are the same in each scene, but other than that, I like the scene where they are. in hot baths, but men and women really bathed like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside looking at the women. It seemed as strange as they all wore their hats, but that may have been the style at the time. The scenes in the ballroom were very nice, the dancing and the outfits were beautiful. I particularly liked Catherine's dress in the scene of the first ballroom. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey looked impressive, but I enjoyed Bath's scenes better. <br /> <br /> Schlesinger gives a good performance, but not exceptional, Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance that Mrs. Allen, I think. <br /> <br /> Ugh Peter Firth in the role of Mr. Tilney, he's just talking about a pile of garbage and is not a clergyman as it should, it's hard to think of it was in love with Catherine, but the book never gave her that impression either. <br /> <br /> General Tilney is pretty well played by Hardy, and Stuart is also giving some kind of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not perform as well as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, he gives the impression of a sordid and lewd man, perhaps not the character described in the book, but I like. <br /> <br /> I can handle scenes extracted from a book adaptation. but when new scenes and new characters are added, it usually bothers me. Marquise! I hate her. She's not part of Northanger's story, nor is her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> part of the script is special. When Catherine asks Elinor Tilney about her mother's death, she asks, "I suppose you saw the body, how did it appear?" What a stupid thing to say! Elinor's calm response is also stupid. <br /> <br /> Anyway, tell me if you agree or disagree with me.
