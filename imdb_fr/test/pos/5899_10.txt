I watch this movie every time it is broadcast on television. A simply brilliant film. Three men return home after the war and try to return to civilian life with great difficulty. The three men led opposing lives during the war (Executive Banker became an army corporal, a soda was named captain of the air force and the hero of American football lost both arms in battle) and everyone must rebuild his life and connect to a new reality. The homes they return to, with adult and independent children, working women, and a depressed economy only add to the quarrel. However, it is the scenes that take place outside the camera and the tacit dialogue that resonates the loudest. The awkward intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and her struggle to return to her leadership position (at home and at work) is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is captivating as a beautiful decorated captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with honest characters and everyone is portrayed by a talented actor. <br /> <br /> This film however took another level after seeing, "Saving Private Ryan." The reality and magnitude of what these men have lived for love and country ...... and of course that did not end on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is essential for any collection. <Br /> <br />
