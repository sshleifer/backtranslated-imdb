A huge pleasure both as a movie and as an excuse to sit down and play the game "oh, that's the name of the chassis". Every star of the golden age of English movies seems to be part of it and it was a pleasure to see them. And the greatest of all, Richard Wattis, has been as great as ever. <br /> <br /> There is in fact a plot that is dragging along very well, there are also some nice jokes and funny moments, but the key to this triumph of the film lies in the characters it contains. Alastair Sim is gorgeous and convinces you that a big-footed Scotsman might be the director of a girls' boarding school. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments, but with Alastair and Richard, the star of the series is Joyce Grenfell. She is one of a kind and brings a smile every time she is on the screen ... her rolling accent and plum is done to perfection. <br /> <br /> And for those who play the game "This is the name of the chassis", you can even see Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look closely.
