If you are part of the BDIM audience that has placed high fidelity in the top 200 of all time, this movie is probably not for you. This film is as delusional as Steve Frears is consciously connected. Renee Zellweger is an excellent writer from a trendy city magazine who returns to her suburban nest in Bucks County to take care of her mother, Streep (who gives another performance at the Hall of Fame). William Hurt is ideally thrown and the husband impeccable, unfaithful and egotistical. If this movie does not make you cry and laugh, then you are way too hip to enjoy it.
