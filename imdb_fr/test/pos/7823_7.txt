This is a TV movie for Hallmark. Hallmark has always produced quality movies, family oriented. Just Desserts is a boy and a girl who fall in love with a movie. Two bakers compete for $ 250,000 against a group of professional bakers. It's fun and light. The desserts look great. The film has a catchy and catchy song played during the competition. I guess it's a Roger Bellon song made for the movie. Too bad no soundtrack is available. I really wish I had a copy of the song. I do not even know the name of the song, because the credits are written at the end of the film to make room for hundreds of promos. In any case, the casting is great. It's always nice to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very bubbly and optimistic. Lauren Holly is always an advantage and Costas Mandylor completes the good with a superb performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has a guest appearance. The film deserves to be watched.
