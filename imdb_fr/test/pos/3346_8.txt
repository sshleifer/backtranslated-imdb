This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is really original. Porn equal, fairy tale and musical - this film is certainly a strange piece of the history of the film for adults. <br /> <br /> Alice is a sexually naive librarian who ends up following the bunny in "Wonderland". , where she meets all kinds of "experienced" crazies like Mad Hatter (who likes to get out his dong as much as possible), Humpty Dumpty (who broke his sausage with his shell), Tweedledee and Tweedledum duo -crazed), and the bisexual queen - among others. <br /> <br /> This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is actually pretty docile by the standards of the time - at a time when a lot of pornography was mean-spirited and nasty (as indicated by the sub-genre " roughie ") - this one is actually quite funny and strangely endearing. That's the kind of thing you show your kids - if it's not graphic sex. A little slow to get to "good things" ... but really entertaining. Oh, and some music numbers are downright hilarious. If you are a drinker - take a few, if you are a smoker - roll a couple and try it. 8/10
