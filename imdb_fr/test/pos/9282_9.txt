This is the first movie I have seen from Singapore and it's great. If you do not know much about Asia, its languages ​​and culture, then this film can be a bit confusing for the uninformed. As an Asian American who has studied two Asian languages ​​(one of which is Mandarin) and followed a few courses in American-Asian studies, this film was easier for me to understand, but even without this always accessible to its foreign audiences as long as you keep in mind that this is a type of film about to be major. The film is definitely worth seeing so that you have the opportunity to see what kind of problems young teenagers in Singapore have difficulties and face. It's a fantastic film, but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way. The actors are remarkable.
