I had never seen this movie before it was broadcast on a local science fiction cable network. It reminded me of the Irwin Allen television series of the late 60s (Time Tunnel, etc.). Great effects (they beat Star Trek 5 20 years later, but it was not very difficult to do). <br /> <br /> I found the scenario very intriguing and mature for this type of production. They would have needed a few tweaks to solve some character-related issues, but for a children's movie, it's surprisingly interesting (including the vision of futuristic European politics, surprisingly similar to today's European Union. hui!) <br /> <br /> The plot actually recalls Twilight Zone in general (as other users have pointed out), but in this case it's a compliment. <br /> <br /> By the way, beautiful scenery! <br /> 7/10
