I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in front of a crowd of passionate moviegoers and Indian expatriates. The film is incredibly beautiful and fluid for a first film. Management is assured, particularly with locals being recruited on the fly for extras and parts of pieces. Although the plot and narrative are elementary to non-existent, the pleasure of watching performances and landscapes makes up for the lack. The soundtrack of this movie is a great attraction for world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different place every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration. This was not revealed in the Q & A, but I imagine that Hollywood could learn a lesson from making budget movies by learning from this director.
