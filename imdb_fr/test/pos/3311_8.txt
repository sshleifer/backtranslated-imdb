It's a bad, glitzy, predictable, sticky, salacious? "Best of all" is a guilty pleasure for me, like "Valley of the Dolls". I mean, "Best" has it all. Someone gets pregnant out of wedlock (what was the last time you heard THIS sentence?), There are problems everywhere: drink, stabbing in the back, jealousy and even a tragic death but not quite unexpected. <br /> <br /> Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delightful Stephen Boyd) are the highlights of the news. Their chemical composition is immediate and constitutes the cement that prevents this film from becoming too fragmented. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker, the stunning supermodel supermodel, appears as Gregg Adams, an aspiring theater actress, a role that, according to any biography I have ever read about her, was apparently not exaggerated. But Parker does a surprisingly credible job here, more than standing up to two scenes against Louis Jourdan, who plays David Savage. Jourdan probably took this role for the money and the special credit on the screen because it was clearly directed towards the path of the aging star. <br /> <br /> Diane Baker goes very well as na√Øve and credible April Morrison, Martha Hyer as Barbara Lemont's story is particularly juicy and the legend of the film Joan Crawford recounts her usual scenario as Amanda Farrow , another role, like that of Jourdan in Savage, that Crawford probably took for salary. <br /> <br /> dated dialogue devices and conspiracy (this article dates from 1959) and the predictability of the soap opera genre. But if you like a good soap like me, "The best of everything" will satisfy you.
