I recently bought it on DVD because I had never heard of it and like Robert Carlyle. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this film will not have any special effects in Hollywood, stating that the special effects were decent enough. , and the acting game was good too. <br /> <br /> I found the movie nice and I do not regret buying it. After almost 2 hours, it perfectly matches the length of this type of film. Do not expect a thrilling explosive action from start to finish, it's a pretty well-balanced movie with a decent storyline!
