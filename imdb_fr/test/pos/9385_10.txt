It's really one of the best low budget B movies I've ever seen. I'm not one to get up and applaud during a movie, but this one was well worth it. Obviously, the principle is that there is a bed that eats people, well ... eats is a subjective term, I guess, it really secretes acid bubbles to suck the victims into themselves and dissolve them into a goodness acid. The best part of this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family man actually started his career with this movie ... and an afro. There is a lot of nudity in this film, so obviously not for children, but that should not prevent anyone from seeing this movie. I am convinced that everyone needs a little deathbed in their life at one time or another, it is better to get it sooner rather than later.
