A young heroic scout leads a large group of pioneers along the GRAND SENTIER to the west, with Indian attacks, natural disasters and romantic complications, all part of the adventure. <br /> <br /> As vast and beautiful as its history, Raoul Walsh's THE BIG TRAIL is a magnificent film, as entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago. With a very good acting and excellent production values, he lives up to his reputation as the first epic western director. <br /> <br /> John Wayne, out of obscurity for his first major film role, looks incredibly young, but immediately impresses with the natural charm and masculine authority he brings to the role of the hero; he quietly dominates the film with the attributes that would make him one day a huge star. Marguerite Churchill presents herself as a beautiful belle of the South who warms slowly to the Duke's attention. El Brendel, a comedian of dialects, is very amusing as a Swedish immigrant plagued by the misfortunes of the mules and his mother-in-law; his appearance in a scene makes the spectator laugh. <br /> <br /> In resembling and resembling a human grizzly bear, Tyrone Power Sr., vast and repulsive, is a wonderful villain. Slick Cardsharp Ian Keith is a sophisticated villain. (His physical resemblance to John Gilbert is very obvious here.) The silent movie character actor Tully Marshall is impressive as a cunning mountain old man who helps guide the wagon train. The corpulent Russ Powell, as a friendly fur trapper, uses his vocal talent to make senseless noises. Movie critics will notice Ward Bond among the Missouri settlers. <br /> <br /> What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was filmed during a big movie called Grandeur. More than a name at the height of his name, the photo looks wonderful, Walsh showing a mastery of new technology. He fills the screen, every part of it, with action. Note, during the crowd scenes, how busy everyone is at doing real work, which adds so much to the likelihood of these sequences. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first administrators to use the big screen. In addition, the film is fortunately free of rear projection photography that destroys so many older films. It should also be emphasized that it is natural that the soundtrack sounds a bit primitive; the talkies were still in their cradle. The fact that Walsh was able to use a microphone, with most scenes shot outside, congratulates him more. <br /> <br /> THE BIG TRAIL was not a box office success. In 1930, William Haines' comedies were the ones that brought in a lot of money and the public was looking for products other than smart Westerners. Most of the actors have sunk in the dark, including Wayne. It was not until 1939, when John Ford saved him in STAGECOACH, that the legend of John Wayne really began. And despite its grandiose panoramas, it will take another 25 years before the big screen becomes a reality for Hollywood, largely to meet the economic threat that television represents.
