Hick Trek is clearly an envious movie even on a budget El Mariachi level ($ 7,000). Nevertheless, the creators are able to obtain decent effects at times (often thanks to an excellent edition) such as the teleportation beams, the situations on board the catamaran and the unique way that Slim T. Jerk communicates with his ship without use traditional communication. device. <br /> <br /> The acting has its rough edges but the representation of "Horns" McBoy is excellent and Fluffy is certainly not too hard for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I wish the film had been longer than its approximate time - and this should be considered a compliment. This film is a success because of the sincerity and hard work of the people involved.
