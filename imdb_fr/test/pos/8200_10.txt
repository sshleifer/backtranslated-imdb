I read complaints about court scenes. These people betray their ignorance. This production has made incredible efforts to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story unfolded. Courteous manners are something that few people outside the court ever see. Although the actors' game may seem highly stylized, it is actually a replica as close as possible to the behavior of the individuals in their stations that the director could create. The facial expressions of the actor are a marvel, especially the duplicate Marquis Changxin and the king's mother. <br /> <br /> Relationships between the king, his parents and his father, of course, reflect the Greek and Shakespearian tragedies. love. The juxtaposition of the king from good to bad and assassin from bad to good provides much food for thought on the evolution of the nature of an individual. This film would give a lot to think about in a university course in human sciences. <br /> <br /> At the same time, he rushes almost, even in the slowest scenes leading to an inexorable denouement. We suspect the involvement of a large part of the troop movements, which was quite impressive. This makes the Lord of the Rings battle scenes pale in comparison. Few directors have the ability to literally deploy thousands of humans onto the battlefield just for the sake of art. I remember a scene in which at least 30,000 soldiers could be seen moving over an immense plain. The logistics for such a plan would have been stunning. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but simply, I can not recommend this film too much.
