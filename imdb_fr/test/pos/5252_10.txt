The melancholy and almost unbearable melancholy of Amalia Rodriques's music has a place in the soul that only music can move. In his voice and magical presence, lies the exquisite agony of fado, an art form I did not know before seeing this film. <br /> <br /> For me, the success of this documentary beautifully and lovingly realized lies in the fact that the filmmaker resists the temptation to editorialize and allows us simply to share the magnetism and the elegant passion of this icon . There seems to be an inevitable correlation between Portuguese fado and American blues. <br /> <br /> Making documentaries at its best takes us to a hitherto unknown reality. and after having this overview, we are transformed. <br /> <br /> Abrigado, Sr.de Almeida
