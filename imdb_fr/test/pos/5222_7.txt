"Father Hood" is a little gem forgotten of a "road movie". Beautiful performances by Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, two really fun of Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, <br /> <br /> and a great success of Patrick Swayze. The film is helped by an unconventional scenario, but seriously diminished by its flashback framing that culminates in an abrupt and formal ending. "Father Hood" would have worked much better without these "bookends". Nevertheless, the film raises important questions about "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state intervention. As long as the host family system will reward state institutions for the NON placement of children, such abuses will exist. <br /> <br /> Choose this one. It's worth the "ride".
