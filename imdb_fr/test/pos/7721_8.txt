For beginners in cinema, I think they did a great job !! We need to support the emerging sector, especially the northern one. It was very popular when I was at the movies, a good house and very good reactions and lots of laughs. It's a movie that feels good and that's what I felt when I came out of the cinema! He has a Nordic humor and is positive about the community he represents. The film has just opened, I hope it's going well - people should support this little film. I think this person 'vinny ...' is very bitter, about something! And become too personal ??? shame!! I say congratulations to everyone involved - have a drink on me !! I look forward to your next adventure.
