Fantastic movie! Wow - it's really a treat. I can not believe that I discovered such a movie gem. <br /> <br /> An attractive girl traveling to South Florida meets a senior and friendly couple with a RV, after having an apartment at a stop. However, she learns that things are not what they seem to be and that the couple becomes a little scary after spending some time on the road with them. <br /> <br /> Everyone inside was so perfect for her roles Believe that you watch this happen in real life in front of you. <br /> <br /> Newcomer Emily Grace did a fantastic job as a very cute Alice, but a little shy. Emily gives you the impression that you can understand what she's going through and you can see how she got into the situation that develops in the film. I'm sure we'll see Emily more often in the future in more movies. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others have said, the lighting and photography were just perfect. The editing has also been well done - the right way to collect images of the highway to make you feel like you are traveling with the actors on their road trip. <br /> <br /> I did not see it. on the big screen, but I can only ask everyone to go out and see him. More movies like this are * exactly * what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
