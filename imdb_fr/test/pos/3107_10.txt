The Ghost Walks is a clever little mystery with a great twist, a lively dialogue, and the best of all a pansy played at the twitterys shovel of character actor Johnny Arthur who never belittles or disparages his character. Mr. Arthur is terrific in his role as Homer Erskine, who brings comic relief as the secretary of Broadway producer Herman Wood, played by another great actor, Richard Carle. <br /> <br /> They play beautifully with each other. <br /> <br /> Although the acceptable words of sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of Homer, it is never devoid of meaning or denigration and is not pronounced by men virils of the film, by his employer, who dismisses him and re-engages him on another stage and who displays an affection almost exasperated for his devoted employee. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful scene where Homer tells his boss that he dedicated the best years of his life to him and was anything but a mother to him. <br /> <br /> The mysterious angle of the film is very amusing, and the turn at the end may leave you in the bust. <br /> For a picture of low-budget poverty row, this film has a superb decoration and a superb scenography. <br /> <br /> Direc Tor Frank Strayer skilfully manages his casting and this film stands up better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts, but he had a good script to use and fantastic actors to bring him to a successful conclusion. . <br /> <br /> This film is a must for film lovers about poverty, the old mysteries of the black house (they actually managed to work in the lines "It was a dark and stormy night) and it has the added benefit of being an early representation of a gay character in a movie where nothing happened to them in the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is available for download in the movie section public domain on the Internet Archive at archive.org.
