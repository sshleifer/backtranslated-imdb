Man! I remember this nostalgic series ... I really dug Bravestarr because he was not the conventional hero. He was more than a futuristic cowboy from Texas. The man had the strength of a bear, the vision of a walk and the agility of a ... I do not remember that one anymore. <br /> <br /> The action sequences were great! I remember that Bravestarr always used his bazooka named SARAJUANA (translated into Spanish) whenever he was in trouble. <br /> <br /> It was a quality action cartoon. I loved the characters, dialogues, music and of course the sequence of opening credits! Bravestarr! Long live him. A cult classic in my opinion and to see absolutely.
