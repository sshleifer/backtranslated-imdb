Over the years, some of their most entertaining movies are about dysfunctional families. <br /> <br /> Hello, Mr. Sholmi is such a movie <br /> <br /> This is an Isreali film about a Moroccan Jewish family. <br /> <br /> This could affect any family, regardless of their culture. We all know or would like to know people like those of this comic gem. <br /> <br /> This 2003 delight was written and directed by Shemi Zorkin. Hope he will have a long career. <br /> <br /> The film is seen through the eyes of his 16-year-old son, who seems to care about all members of the family. Heis is brilliantly portrayed by Oshri Cohen (he was 18 years old when he shot the movie. <br /> <br /> He's been in some since then and I know I'm going to get them.) I hope this young man will become an international star. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is beautiful, I hope I'll see it again. <br /> <br /> I loved each person in the casting to a certain degree. I think everyone who sees him will agree. <br /> <br /> He has been nominated for many international awards and won 8, he deserved everything. <br /> <br /> Now, being a film in a language other than English, he had a very limited shot in the United States, which seems to me regrettable. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, you will be happy to have done it. <br /> <br /> Notes: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> NOTE: As the story is not new, her mark is as high as she can get it.
