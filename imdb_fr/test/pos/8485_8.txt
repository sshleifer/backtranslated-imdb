Let's not talk about bush here, Taylor Hackford's unmistakably shiny film does not have much to do to make it stand out from the biopic genre apart from Jamie Foxx's outstanding performance. Remember the year they presented the Oscar special effects to the undisputed Terminator 2 boffins? They should do the same thing with this year's best actor. <br /> <br /> It is not disputed that Ray Charles's story is worthy of filming. Indeed, the many backtracking of his traumatic childhood are well managed and used wisely. But for such a unique life, the film seems incredibly formal and familiar. It follows literally the model of "the story of an imperfect genius": difficulties and exploitation, women and drugs, recording quarrels, group disputes, re-education, yeah yeah yeah. And surely there was more humor in his life than we knew here? <br /> <br /> I appreciate Charles's music, but where perfectly cut medley would have allowed the story to continue, Hackford indulges in almost full-interpretations of too many songs - in gin joints , recording studio, in concert halls, to infinity. Narratively, and for non-devotees, they begin to act as a cinematographic brake. This may seem like a harsh judgment on a musical biopic, but with a catalog as complete as Ray's, one must not taste the whole dish. Otherwise, we would buy the albums. <br /> <br /> Intrigued, I took a look at my watch more than once. So, despite all the brilliance of Foxx, maybe Ray would have been better served as a two-part HBO?
