SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> I had this DVD on DVD at Christmas 2004. I could not wait to see it and I was not disappointed. The score is memorable (my favorite <br /> were the theme song "Sauropod" and the song "Winters Coming"). The effects were dazzling, you could almost believe they were there. In fact, you are learning something too. Stegosaurs MAY have been able to pump blood on their plates. T-Rex females MAY have murderous madness before laying their eggs. I know that many people think that this is too much speculation, but there will always be questions that we can only guess. And there are also many undeniable, hard and fundamental facts. We know that some dinosaurs have traveled in groups, we know that Diplodocus has swallowed stones to crush the vegetation in their stomachs. Despite this "speculation", the series went extremely well. In fact, this resulted in a follow-up, a prequel and several specials. If you are a dino-fan, then this is for you. Jurassic Park looks rather small and overgrown with weeds.
