Who's the man ~~~ what do I hear? A loud cry from Kevin? Well, if you do not shout for the "usual suspect", I would recommend that you change your prescription drug. Anyway, it's not a first class movie, it's just a very well-produced story, which is almost credible. Considering it's an Alien, you're probably wondering what? All the actors are top and it's also the first one I've seen a balanced sarcastic Alien. All I can say is nice and almost for the whole family (if not for the scene later in the film). SEVEN STARS
