The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that offers everything you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course from Poirot. It is located in a country house one weekend. As always, all guests are suspects and it is up to Poirot to determine the truth. With movies like this, it's always best not to reveal too much, so I'll stop there. What I liked in the Hollow is that it's an old-fashioned mystery. When Poirot arrives, everyone is around the body for example. Everyone seems to be the culprit. There is this suspicious look and the atmosphere is perfect for the story. <br /> <br /> You can expect a wonderful time by letting guess who did it and how and why, and maybe even in the end, be surprised. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you had a very pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. As curiosity, note Edward Hardwicke who played Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes. Nice to see him after a few years. Suchet is amazing as always and, fortunately, stays on the screen most of the time. <br /> <br /> I found out who the murderer was but it's still not predictable and it's very believable. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, a good movie and as always a pleasure. <br /> <br />
