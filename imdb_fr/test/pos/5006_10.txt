I am dismayed and dismayed to learn that the network has canceled the talk show with Spike Feresten! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with The Fox Television Network, the cancellation of the talk show with Spike Feresten and his replacement by Wanda Sikes? Wanda At Large was canceled because the audience was fed up with the nasty insults that made him fearful and Wanda Sykes spewing his own brand of vindictive jokes that make no noise, that's not humor, it's is mean and disgusting. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the Fox television network has rewarded Wanda Sikes for standing up to President Barak Obama. There is no doubt that the recent incidents of Wanda in front of the President of the United States are not fun and that the laughter of the audience was only to please Barak Obama. <br /> <br /> Talk Show with Spike Feresten has a sense of humor and has never deliberately or vindicatively insulted any guest or performer. Spike's well-rounded personality always enjoyed himself, making fun of life and himself. Her first two-season plays with AFTRA actress, Mary Mae Atwill, in the 21st century Mae West were absolutely hysterical with Spike Feresten's sketches: Judge Joe Brown, The Merchant Spouses, and the James Kyson episode Lee from Last Season where Spike chats with Erica via the internet on the show. <br /> <br /> Despite the budget constraints imposed by the network for the elaborate field work and the WGA strike of the second season, Spike Feresten has not given up his sense of humor or integrity. Talk Show with Spike Feresten has always had new talent and his parodies of Nanny 911 and Idiot Paparazzi of Comedy for Stoners were considered to be at the forefront of progress and had excellent value for money. <br /> <br /> Professionally, Spike Feresten was the best executive producer and Brett Webster, set designer, with his fabulous production team was one of the best production teams I worked for in my career AFTRA It would be really ridiculous and shameful to cancel Talk Show with Spike Feresten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, its success could be brought to Comedy Central or another network, which would be a valuable loss of revenue for FOX Television. <br /> On behalf of Saturday Night, audience of Fox Television, supporters of Talk Show with Spike Feresten, including all actors and members of the team, we ask the network to keep the talk show with the Spike Feresten franchise and give the team a second chance to become a Fox Show success.
