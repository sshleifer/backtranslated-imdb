Last night, I saw this film at the Boston International Women's Film Festival and was saddened to hear Ms. Troche tell us (in her Q & A after the screening) that she did not expect to see too much American distribution, because of his insistence. on including all so-called "gay content". It was a comedy FANTASTICALLY entertaining, and it seems to me that the American public could enjoy it in the same way as "The Full Monty". So it is really regrettable and ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing keep away from traditional theaters. A beautiful cast, a scenario FABULOUS, and of course, the realization of Rose Troche make it one of the funniest movies I've seen.
