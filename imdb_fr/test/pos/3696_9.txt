Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She does not have many friends and she has a tenacious mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade gets closer to her mother's boyfriend, Billy (Rob Estes). Maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I do not need to tell you what happens next. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This film shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This film also has the best acting game I've seen in TV movies. Beverly D'Angelo does a very good job as a gentle and loving mother, but careless and blind. She could not see what was happening under her own roof. Rob Estes is at his best here as sleazeball. Jenny Lewis is the star. She seems to be exactly like her character. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to like this movie!
