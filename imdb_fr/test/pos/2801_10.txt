This film is about Xavier, a student in exchange Erasmus of Paris who spends a year in Barcelona. Meanwhile, under the influence of all new impressions, it changes and grows. When he returns, he has a much clearer vision of his life and finally takes it in his hands. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, and the reason is probably that I've been in a very similar situation. I come from Germany, not from France, and for me, it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is a very accurate description of what you will do in Erasmus semester in Spain. From what I've heard, the story is autobiographical and that's probably why it's so realistic. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some examples (SPOILER light alert) - Xavier shares an apartment with other Italian, Danish and German students. , Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks EXACTLY to all the Erasmus apartments I saw in Madrid. The main characters are well developed and some funny scenes are derived from the usual stereotypes. The Spanish owner is also 100% accurate. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martine, stayed in Paris, is also very typical. About 90% of all relationships break up during an Erasmus semester (or soon thereafter). - There is a wonderful scene in which Xavier tries to convince Wendy, his roommate from England, who is a bit "not cool", to go out with all the others. He finally succeeds and Wendy probably spends the night of his life. <br /> <br /> Another asset of this film is that it is really trilingual: the students of the apartment speak Spanish or English, and Xavier speaks French with his mother and girlfriend There are subtitles for that everyone can understand what is being said. I really hope this movie will never be duplicated anywhere. <br /> <br /> I imagine that for non-Erasmus, it's just an entertaining comedy, but for all my Erasmus colleagues, I can only say: this is YOUR movie! If you have not seen it, do it. But get ready for nostalgic feelings ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
