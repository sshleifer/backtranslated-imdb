I never understand why people take the time to watch movies they did not understand well. I know that people will read scathing reviews on these pages of this film and prevent them from looking for copies of this rather forgotten film, dating back to the late 1920s but dating back to 1932, which should probably be described as "indecent" because it's the name on the main titles. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy, best known as a comic actress in countless distinguished roles, is questionable in all of them. She was a real dramatic actress, something I did not know before watching this film, which precedes all her famous roles. She is exciting and moving here, two things she has never opposed to William Powell, graceful and refined. I am still quite shocked by its quality. <br /> <br /> Becky Sharp (1935), the first Technicolor three-band feature, is more familiar, but it is much better artistically and adaptive. It's also very poignant as an expression of a film style about to die. You can not take my word for it, you must see it.
