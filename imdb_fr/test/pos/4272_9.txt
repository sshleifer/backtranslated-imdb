Big show! It is about time that a reality show comes to fill the gaps of the generations. Candidates vary by age, some seem old enough to have watched the film on its first release. And others seemed so young that parents or teachers may have transmitted the film in the hope that it would touch their lives as she had already touched it. Fat has really become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie that kids and adults can relate to. "You are the one we want" is sure to win even more Grease followers. The only thing I would like is the story of the characters, it's rather nice to leave some of it to the nostalgic imagination of the 50s. I can not wait to see the next show ... and then on Broadway !!!
