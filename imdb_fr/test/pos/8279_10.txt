I have been passionate about chipmunks since the late 70's - early 80's. When this movie came out, it was a must to see it. And after seeing it, I went to get it and bought it! The film is excellent, I like the animated action it brings, and the music is excellent (yes, I bought the soundtrack on CD ...) A recommended video to watch and appreciate by all!
