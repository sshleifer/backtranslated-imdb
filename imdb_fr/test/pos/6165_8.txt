Compared to the Battle of Britain, it's a real movie, with real characters and a real plot. The Battle of Britain is essentially a documentary with occasionally Lawrence, Lawrence and Michael Caine, but the protagonists are the Spits, the Hurricanes, and so on. ground. I highly recommend it to anyone, even those who do not like war movies very much. It's well filmed and I wonder what the director could do if he had the big capitals behind him. And I do not think it's too sentimental. It's only in the fighters that you have real people, with real feelings and real life - as real as any fictional life in a big movie.
