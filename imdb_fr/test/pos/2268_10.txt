What an original work. I always liked Liev Schreiber "the actor", but now we have to appreciate man on a multidimensional level. How did he get this field of sunflowers? It was computerized, it seemed real. And how do you audition a dog knowing that you will get that kind of performance? Does the academy have a category for animals? I guess what I'm saying is that I really, really enjoyed this quirky and quirky little indie film. From the excellent casting (we never know that Eugene Hutz is not a pro actor) to the filmmaker (some beautiful shots), the music (bought the CD out of the theater) and of course the two "D". Overall, a "10". <br /> <br /> /
