When I saw this movie at the age of 6, it was in the CHILDREN section at Erols Video because it was animated. We watched it and it was a completely different ball game! A very violent story and graphic dead are VERY entertaining and compelling, but not for kids. To avoid in family, my mother almost had a heart attack and tore the video!
