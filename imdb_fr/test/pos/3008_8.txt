I give this movie 8/10 in general. On a visual level, much of it is not surprising: the dream of an artistic director to associate Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dali, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe - and a valid testament of power of the film as a serious art. The beautiful use of color, shapes, images, the environment - and a fabulous overall design combine with cutting-edge computer graphics. So, 10/10 for that! Wow! <br /> <br /> The plot is more predictable. You know they will save the girl and get the killer in the end, but the story is always interesting and pacy enough to attract and keep you. 6/10 for that. <br /> <br /> Squirm factor ... I will not give him a note, but the film certainly made me wiggle and I watched video on a television screen. Of course, it would have a lot more impact on a big screen. Graphic violence of twisted and erotic nature in a surrealistic landscape - though beautiful - is highly unpredictable. The world in the killer's head is not - thank God, my world. Because I watched this film in video, I was able to replay two sequences and I have many things to admire the second time, when I was not so worried about where the scene would be, and I suspects that the whole movie would be worth seeing a second time, just for "visual art". <br /> <br /> General Suggestion: Do not take conservative children or grandparents to this one, but if you like the visuals of movies, like surrealist art, do not be afraid of some perverts , and just want to make a "trip of the mind", this one is a winner. Oh, and if you like girls, Jennifer Lopez is pretty sexy. <br /> <br />
