Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first with Namak Halal (although it was technically a drama). The story is not revolutionary, but the complications that are added make it great. Aamir Khan is a total design. Just look at his expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He's incredibly good at comedy, I never knew it. Salman Khan was as good as dimmer a little of both characters. The sounds he makes are almost as funny as the faces of Aamir. Raveena and Karisma serve their purpose but are not surprising. Paresh Rawal, as usual, is the best choice. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They do not believe in hard work and just want to get rich easily. Then, their brain discovers the idea of ​​seducing the girl (Raveena Tandon) of a rich man (Paresh Rawal) who comes to India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet during the trip and join hands to chase hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they succeed, they must now get rid of each other. Somehow, they both go to Raveena, Amar as a wounded man and Prem as a doctor. From there, they try to overturn. But things get complicated when Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) breaks for Prem and pursues him. And the devilish twin brother of a rich man (Rawal too) is trying to get rid of the heiress and his father so that he inherits the money and sends his two most trustworthy but awkward fools for do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you do not want to miss. Look at this! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, it's good. And if you like this movie, I would also recommend Gol Maal if you have not watched it yet. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
