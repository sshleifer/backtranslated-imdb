This production was quite well done for a television original, providing a very appropriate original perspective on Swift's work. For the frame story to work properly, the film begins with Gulliver's arrival at home. Everyone who has read the book knows that it will happen anyway. The story of the book's framework presents Gulliver's senseless confusion in sections. For example, he is horrified to trample on the little English because he has just returned from a country of giants. But the film contains all the sections of the book during a long trip. When Gulliver recounts his travels, editing editing from England to the trip is very effective. I admit that I found them intrusive and irritating at first, then they became natural. Moreover, in the end, they became a welcome addition to the story. As he tells his adventures to an increasingly large audience, more and more people are listening to him, even if they doubt his truth. For example, his hate of loathsome Yahoos and his admiration for the pure logic of the fourth section prove to be good when he defends his own sanity. The interconnections between events in England and similar events or scenes in the narrative are very effective. For example, tearing the fabric off the table to suggest the towing movement of a group of ships is inspiring. The addition of Gulliver's family, threatened by the lecherous doctor, works well. Swift only emphasizes this by asking his long-suffering wife to protest new journeys. It becomes a natural part of this story. The actors and actors were competent overall. Some roles were exemplary. The crazy magician of Omar Sharif is superb. The little Emperor O'Toole dodder deliciously towards senility. Many of the specific complaints made by other writers here appear to me as a mere personal preference, which, after all, is what we are talking about here. I read the abridged version several times a year from the fourth year. I may have missed the full version until the end of the course, but I have read it many times since. And I had to do it again when I started reading about this movie. Although the version of Danson is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the book. However, I think this will bring many readers to the book. If you have not read the book, enjoy this movie then go to the source. If you like his satire, find Swift's "A Modest Proposal" and his "Drapier Letters". The two satires attack the miserable treatment of Ireland and the Irish at the time of Swift. The draper protests against cheap swollen copper coins dumped in Ireland. They were light pieces of Wood, which were not good for paying taxes and official debts. The outcry over Swift's satire provoked the sending of the pieces to another mistreated British territory, the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this film make a good laugh; they can not change human nature. Give a chance to Danson's torture experiments. I think you will find them stimulating and entertaining.
