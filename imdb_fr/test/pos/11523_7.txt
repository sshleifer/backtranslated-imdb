An interesting film with Jordana Brewster as a young woman traveling to Europe to find out what happened to her older sister (Cameron Diaz), mysteriously deceased years ago. Brewster is very good and allows you to stay involved despite unrealistic plots, like letting her discover and start surprisingly a romance with her much older boyfriend (Christopher Eccleston). Yet, especially good. CATEGORY B
