If you want to see a movie starring Stan Laurel comedies Laurel & Hardy, this movie does not suit you. Stan would not begin to find the character and the rhythms of these films before two years. If, however, you want to make a beautiful parody of the movie Blood and Sand by Rudolph Valentino, made the previous year, this film is for you. All stops are stopped, both in physical comedy and on title cards. If the film is not held by a character, the plot of the film Valentino is used - somehow.
