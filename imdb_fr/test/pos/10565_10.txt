Wow! Where to start? <br /> <br /> This adaptation of Sarah Waters's third novel is one of my favorite movies of all time !!!!! <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of fiction novels (seriously, I NEVER read fiction), but the book is as FABULOUS as the movie! Or should I say that the film is as FABULOUS as the book ?! I LOVE JUST THIS STORY !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm slow to watch this three-hour film (two-part DVD series, 3-part series on TV / books) for about a year and a half. It just did not look interesting ... BOY I TAI IF SO MAU! <br /> <br /> I immediately immersed myself in the rich and suspensive plot ... quite fascinated! Just like the book, you can not stop watching / reading. It catches your attention for the whole 3 hours ... and when that ends ... you would like it not to be the case. <br /> <br /> The story flows wonderfully and you will wonder where the time went. <br /> <br /> The lesbian subplot was just the icing on the cake! The parts I love most are the subtle facial expressions and the looks / eye contact between the two characters. You really feel their desire for each other and yet they can not act on it until they are. <br /> <br /> Can I emphasize that the "lesbian theme" is an important part of the film, obviously, the heart of the film is a real love story unexpectedly, but it is certainly not what the together the movie is about. For me, that's what makes this story so unique and intriguing. I have never read or heard of anything like this. Sarah Waters is a pure genius! <br /> <br /> The turns he takes leave you hanging on the edge of your seat. Seriously! My hands were clenched in my couch with every amazing bounce and I even screamed over and over again ("OH MY GOD, NO WAY IT'S NOT JUST ARRIVING!" AFFECTED IT? have NEVER done that! <Br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that I wish they'd added more to the book. But obviously, the adaptation being limited in time, they could not add everything I would have liked. How awful ... I think I'm just brutally selfish now ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes seem a bit rushed. However, they put all the important elements in a place where even if you only watch the movie and choose not to read the book, you will be more satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> The actors are simply superb! BRILLIANT same! Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Maud) have such chemistry on the screen that they heat your TV. Simply electric! The emotions ... the despair ... the struggle felt by each of them is apparently expressed effortlessly by these actresses with wonderful talent. Rupert Evans plays as good a villain as Gentleman. I was upset every time he went on the screen, but I loved it because he is so cute and always charming even if you want to twist his neck. Imelda Staunton gives yet another fantastic performance as Mrs. Sucksby. She is such a warm actress that you can not help but love her ... even if the character she plays is not so charming. All the other cast members were perfect! They really represented the characters and corresponded exactly to what I thought I was after reading the book. <br /> <br /> It's a must for all movie buffs! In fact, EVERYONE should watch this movie AND read the book! Chances are you will not be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars of me! There are only four other films for which I have awarded the same rating. It's very rare for me to appreciate so much a film that I give it 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingersmith is really a masterpiece!
