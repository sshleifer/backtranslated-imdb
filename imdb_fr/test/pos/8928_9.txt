This movie was amazing! Seemed to have a big budget, but felt genuine and original as an independent. The most amazing part of this film was the amazing performances of David Beazely, Mark Hildreth and Paul Anthony who plays the lead role. He carried this film with ease, humor and charisma, with enormous depth. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was really beautiful even if some subjects were ugly enough. It was not very realistic, but it was not necessary to argue a broader point. It was really great to see Alan Cumming too. The scenario was tight and propelled very well with some of the best actors I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Go see that.
