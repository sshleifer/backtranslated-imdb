Never, never, have I been as impressed by a film as this little article about four groups of people, facing a crisis or several. In some ways, a bit like Short Cuts, but totally different at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of main characters that we all get to know very well as their stories unfold. , while people show their good and bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, with a lot of drama and laughter. <br /> <br /> The closest equivalent in an American film, I think, which is much weaker in all respects, is the Royal Tenenbaums. <br /> <br /> Four Shades of Brown, the title in English, tells the story of a stressed hotelier, his wife and elderly parents (who travel as magicians); about the receptionist at an animal crematorium and the misadventures of his family; on the members of a cooking class (who talk mostly about their sad lives) and fourthly on the funeral of a jockey trotter, who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond the grave, singing and appearing in 3D at the funeral, thanks to a high-tech equipment that cost all his fortune (the family has lost nothing, we do not even give the famous horse to the family)! <br /> <br /> This film is full of warmth and compassion. sorrow and laughter, which I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were new to me, with the exception of Robert Gustafsson and one or two others, but they all deserved the great slam of the Swedish film Guldbagge extravaganza (= "Oscars" "Swedish) a week ago! <br /> <br /> The awards of male, female and male supporting actors went to this film, along with a few others, to get started! <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, go see it - the hours go by very quickly!
