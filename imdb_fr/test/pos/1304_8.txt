I just found all 3 Wal-Mart DVDs in the bargain box for $ 5.50, so I thought I'd come back. Total of 13 hours to watch everything (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and I saw most of them on television in the sixties. Many independent stations have repeated them for many years. <br /> <br /> Better than expected, the weather has favored the obvious sincerity of its creators, as well as the obvious gratitude and respect they show to all Allied fighters. and women. More abstract and artistic than a simple documentary, but very truthful in its description of the causes and final results of the Second World War. This war depended heavily on shipping and the ultimate victory depended on the person who mastered the oceans of the planet. It was the Allies who were able to do it. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see how they try to balance major events with the soldiers and sailors who created them. The score is impressive, even if it is a bit too much compared to current standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett contributed as much as Richard Rodgers to the final grade. I imagine that Rodgers provided all the main themes and that it was incumbent on Bennett to adapt them to the images. Excellent work! <br /> <br /> Must be seen by every sovereign, or potential ruler. A warning to tyrants that ideals, determination and livelihoods make it possible to win wars. Logistics: Their quality and delivery will determine the potential winners. The Allies have surpassed and surpassed the material quality of the Axis, attacked their very source in the process, and assured their eventual defeat. <br /> <br /> Sorry to see that the producer, Henry Salomon, lived a very short life. The facts of IMDb were rather meager, I must know more about him. He did some other outstanding documentaries before his untimely death. Maybe we'll have more to say later <br /> <br /> Trivia: All 3 records were recorded from the background music, which is pretty good overall. Unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the latter, immediately relegating the status of novelty instead of listening to serious music. Too bad too, because it contained interesting but minor themes in the series. Silly stuff like 16-inch gunshots, torpedoes, bulldozers, planes ... just for kids. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
