The good news is that the director is committed to the cause of Amnesty International and is eager to deliver a strong message on freedom of expression and the scourge of oppression. The plot is distinctly original and the actors are two of my absolute favorites. The bad news: "original" is not everyone's buzzword when visiting cinemas or video libraries. In addition, well-known critics such as Mr. Maltin and Roger Ebert described the film as a real attempt at failure to convert a play into a film form. If I remember correctly, the title is taken from the fairy tale that the character of Stowe wrote and who made it a possible suspicious and subversive suspect in the fictional place where the story unfolds. His dreams are dangerous for the government, represented here by Rickman as an intense manipulative interrogator. Since these two people are practically the only ones to appear in the film, the director is faced with a real challenge: to hold the spectator's attention. In the end, I found the whole thing fascinating. Not irreproachable and certainly not for everyone, but rewarding. It is far from a masterpiece like Kieslowski's "A Short Film on Murder" or as explanatory as "The Old Man Walking". But if you like these films or one of the political thrillers of Costa-Gavras, you may enjoy this one as well. But do not expect over-explaining sermons or fascinating action sequences.
