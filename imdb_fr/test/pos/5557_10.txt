Faqrscape is really one of those shows that has everything to please, excellent performance, excellent distribution, fantastic writing, sets, chemistry, muppets ... everything is there, apart from a house. This fantastic series seems to have everything but the end. TPTB seems to think that this is a series of consecutive shows, where all viewers know that this is an epic love story, in progress, whose end must be seen. If you've never watched Farscape serve you and watch it on DVD when you release Season 1 in October ... and Season 2 is the best! Watch the reruns on the SciFi channel to catch up, then the new season starts from January to March, when most shows are in hiatis and make sure to watch. If all goes well, we will have our end!
