It's really not worthy of a "better picture" consideration, but as entertainment, it does the job! It's a movie that I've seen, with an acceleration of the pulse every time, at least a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done and we can recognize other works. Those who do not have current name recognition probably do not want it. <br /> <br /> It was a fun adventure. A bit like The Little Rascals if they just had to be serious.
