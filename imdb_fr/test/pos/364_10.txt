This is another of Hitchcock's top rated movies and rightly so. Here is the story of two men meeting on a train and exchanging fantasies of murder. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to become confused with the law. Another fast Hitchcock movie with a lot of great scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match are worthy of mention). Not a movie not to be missed - it's unfortunate that no one re-publishes it on DVD with lots of extras - just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD, that's all there is right now.
