Human Traffic is without a doubt the most original and convincing film I've seen for a long time. It documents 2 days in the life of a group of young people, bored by their daily existence and their dead ends, and taking ecstasy in raves at the weekend. It's funny, extremely poignant and sometimes very sad. In the same genre as "Trainspotting", it has an excellent soundtrack and presents young British stars in full swing. The film was made with a tiny budget and I look forward to future offers of writer / director Justin Kerrigan when his talent will be discovered by leading filmmakers.
