Bill Paxton took the true story of the opening of the 1913 American golf course and made a film that is much more than an extraordinary golf game. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and addresses the deep anti-Catholic prejudices of British and American institutions. But basically, the film speaks of the eternal favorite of triumph against all odds. <br /> <br /> The acting game is exemplary. Stephen Dillane is excellent, as usual, but Shia LaBoeuf, revealer of the film, delivers a disciplined, dignified and very likeable performance as a young French-Irish working class fighting the prejudices of WASP in New England. For those who only know his batting performance in "Even Stevens", this demonstration of maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter, the youngest ten year old, threatens to steal all the scenes in which he appears. <br /> <br /> An old-fashioned film in the best sense of the term: beautiful action game, clear staging and beautiful story that captures the end - the final scene, a blink of an eye affectionate eye in Casablanca is only one of the many pleasures that fill a good movie.
