"Two Hands" is a hilarious Australian gangster movie set in a truly stunning Sydney city. I bet the tourists never foresee that Sydney and Bondi look like what it is in this film: all the sweaty bodies, the oppressive night and gangsters in nylon shorts and jandals. Heath Ledger plays an amateur boxer with the intention of being part of the local boss gang, King's Cross. He looked pretty gorgeous in his green wig suit and blue wig smuggler. A sweaty tattooed body becomes it. I've always had him as a boy "Home & Away", and he's been in that soap, which is a little sweatier than Weetbix's tasteless "Neighbors". The film is definitely worth watching for its combination of sardonic humor and unpleasant violence - the drowning scene should soon have nightmares.
