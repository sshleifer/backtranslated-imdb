I'm sure the Americans do not know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they should not talk about what they do not know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocritical as the United States. The only countries where sex between teenagers is illegal are the United States and Islamic nations. In France, for example, the age of consent is 15 years. In Brazil, he is 14 years old. In Spain, he is 12 years old. Teenagers aged 16 and 17 at the time of production do nothing illegal. Nudity is not considered a problem in almost all civilized countries. And only a monster could consider a teenager's love as a sexual assault.
