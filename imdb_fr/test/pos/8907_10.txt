Like so many other commentators, my memories of this show are universally warm. In fact, the dear memories are so dear to me that I recently bought the DVD box to revisit this happy and carefree time of my childhood, during which I remained totally fascinated by the current quest of Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy . , Tripitaka and later, Yu Lung, a horse / dragon / man (you really have to watch it to understand), when this much-loved show aired on BBC 2 on Friday night, if I remember correctly. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm happy to say that even after all these years and now that we're watching this with adult eyes, that is to say, more cynical (!), The series has lost none of its inimitable charm. <br /> <br /> A simply wonderful entertainment. from the magical characters and their comic interactions with each other to perhaps not so special effects (which actually serve to increase the pleasure) and of course, without forgetting the sequence of the extremely memorable opening title of the first season, time passed no form, no shape diminished the spellbinding charm of Monkey. <br /> <br /> As Monkey would probably say, 'Oi! You there! Get out and take some nostalgic fun.
