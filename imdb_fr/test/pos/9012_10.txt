I never had to write a review about anything, but seeing such reviews on such an innovative show made me say something. First, it is enough for people to overcome the fact that the voices are different. Once you watch an episode, you will never remember it again. The humor is original and, certainly, some jokes of the report are delivered fresh. Some even recall Shrek - self-referential humor. Many of these jokes seem to target as much teenagers as young fans of the film. Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both hilarious as they take over their roles in Kronk and Yzma and their Annie Awards nominations were well deserved. <br /> <br /> This show takes time to enjoy, to really get into the groove of things, so to speak.If you ignore the horrible theme song (which should not really justify the way you judge a show, since this is only 30 seconds of the entire product), this show is a hilarity not to be missed in the spirit of New Groove Emperor.
