"Crossfire" is apparently a mystery of murder, but what distinguishes it from other similar films of the time is the motive of the killer, which is anti-Semitism. The story highlights examples of the type of ignorance that feeds sectarianism and contains references to a hillbilly and an Irish immigrant who are also victims of abuse because of their ethnicity. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is based on that of Richard Brooks. novel entitled "The Brick Foxhole" which speaks of a hate crime where the victim was homosexual. It is ironic that this censorship has provoked intolerance on the part of the censors who stipulated that, for the on-screen version, the type of fanaticism involved should be replaced by anti-Semitism. Another irony is the behavior of a soldier who seems extremely proud to have served in a war against the Nazis and yet embraces his hatred of the Jews. The director and producer of this film also suffered another type of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee. All these points simply seem to emphasize the deeply rooted and insoluble nature of the whole problem of bigotry described in this film. <br /> <br /> When police captain Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), he discovers that the night he was killed, Samuels met with a group of soldiers and one of them, Corporal Arthur "Mitch" Mitchell (George Cooper), is quickly identified as the main suspect. Montgomery (Robert Ryan), another of the soldiers that night, and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), Mitchell's friend, also gathered new information. Keeley, with the help of other soldiers, then looks for Mitchell and, when he finds it, hears what he told on the night of the murder, including his meeting with a hostess from the ballroom called Ginny Tremaine ( Gloria Grahame). Keeley helps Michell not be arrested and tries to identify the murderer. Ginny Tremaine is interrogated, but her information is insufficient to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigations lead him to recognize the motive of the crime. Subsequently, he installs an elaborate trap that leads the real culprit to reveal his own guilt. <br /> <"Crossfire" is a movie with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed very early in the story. The "message" is conveyed in a way that was probably appropriate for the period in which it was created, but which, by today's standards, seems rather cumbersome. J Roy Hunt's cinematography is wonderful with sober lighting and the creative use of many strategically placed table lamps, combining to evoke a look perfectly compatible with the drama unfolding on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite this As a low-budget production, "Crossfire" was a box-office success and had a captivating and highly relevant story, accompanied by a wonderful cast. Two of them were nominated for Oscars for best supporting actor (Robert Ryan). (Gloria Grahame) The additional nominations of Edward Dmytryk (Best Director), producer Adrian Scott (Best Film) and John Paxton (Best Screenplay, Adapted Screenplay) are just further proof of the positive recognition this film has received.
