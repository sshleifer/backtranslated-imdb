Back from 20 years in China, a young missionary refuses to become THE CAT'S-PAW for a thug gang in the hometown. <br /> <br /> This film was a bit different from Harold Lloyd's previous films. The comedy derived more from dialogue, often quite serious, prevails here, rather than elaborate visual gags that have fueled the classics of Harold's past. There are, however, some wonderful moments that are pure visual pleasure, like when Harold tries to follow a convertible in a crowded street or tries desperately to prevent a stripper from losing his clothes. There is also the culminating scene, which takes place in a basement of Chinatown, in which Harold happily jumps into the darkest comedy. But most of the humor comes from Harold's refusal to be the poor of criminals who have run his hometown for years. <br /> <br /> And it's all a bunch of rogue politicians and thugs against whom Harold finds himself, played by a host of great actors: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer and Fuzzy Knight. Pert Una Merkel is present as a tobacco seller who captures Harold's attention and intrigues him with his realistic perspective on life. <br /> <br /> The characters in the film will recognize Samuel S. Hinds as Harold's missionary father; Charles Sellon, former member of the Stockport clergy; and Herman Bing as a German gangster - all uncredited. In addition, Noah Young, a familiar face of Harold's silent films, appeared for the last time in a Lloyd film. <br /> <br /> Fox gave the film an excellent production. values, especially in the opening scenes in China.
