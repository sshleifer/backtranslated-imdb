It does not surprise me that this black and white short film (91 minutes) that was shot 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called "ottepel" or "the thaw" won so much love and love. admiration among moviegoers from all over the world. It's sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes have the impression of being outpaced by their time. The camera work of Sergei Urusevsky and his creative discoveries have been included in the manuals and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of a love destroyed by a war without mercy but eternally alive in memory of a young woman. It's also the film about loyalty, memories, the ability to live when there seems to be nothing to live on; it's about forgiveness and hope. The film received (absolutely deserving) the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special prize in Cannes for playing Veronika, the girl in love with the best man in the world at the beginning of the film month. After the separation with her beloved who went to the front, the loss of her family during the bombing and the marriage with the man she never liked and who wanted only that there is never, she turned to the shadow of herself, she died inside. His long journey to redemption, to finally accept the death of his beloved and learn to live with, is fascinating and heartbreaking and will not leave any spectator indifferent. <br /> <br /> For me, the film is very personal and expensive because I was born and raised in the city where his characters lived and were so happy at first. I walked the same streets, squares and bridges on the Moskva River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one, but often more than one family member, as a result of combat, concentration camp, ghetto or hunger, cold and diseases during the Second World War. My family is no exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never cured the pain of loss, not just movies and books. "Cranes fly" speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me deeply. It's a masterpiece of making a film, but it's part of my life: my past, my memory and my past.
