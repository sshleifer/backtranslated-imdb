This is one of the peripheral narratives told by the Animatrix that are not directly relevant to the end of the war. A plot glorifying movies, but Trinity, voiced by Carrie, is there. it features a private detective who is hired for a lot of money in search of a hacker named Trinity. we see his research that features other IPs, only one he meets, who seems to have gone crazy about his own experience trying to find Trinity. he eventually gets in touch with Trinity that he presumes to be a man of course - told in the narrative and something that places us firmly in his own perspective despite what we already know - on a hacker discussion forum and solves a enigma that forces him to take a train. he forgets his hat, but his trusty cat throws it to him in a moment of ridicule so absurd it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> he meets her in the train but the trick is thus revealed when agents attack; the agents used it to go to Trinity and Trinity was trying to free the PIs sent after it, which he does not know of course, and which are not explicitly mentioned in the animation itself, common in the titles of black film, It is often hinted at a story, subplots, developments, etc. interesting, but do not show yourself more than the main story and a limited point of view to create an extra air of mystery and intrigue. <br /> <br /> Almost everything in this short film is in black and white, the music is reminiscent of the film noir and the quirky detective, both obsolete and dedicated, is the ideal protagonist for a film noir title. The "trivia" section of the entry of this title in IMDb also presents some references that this title makes to hard literature, something that it also borrows, a kind of mystery for detectives, gangsters, etc. who engage in difficult conflicts easily and often. aptly directed by Studio 4 Â° C and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, it is a nice variation of the usual matrix story.
