I was a little surprised by the PG rating on the back of the DVD case. I certainly would not want my children to look at this one. I think it would scare the shit of a 10 year old child. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: A girl who tries to integrate with the clique is terrified and tormented by the "in the crowd". They persuade her to spend the night in this frightening mausoleum (which reminded me of Phantasm ...) and they torment her in the night. Little do they know, a recently deceased clairvoyant comes to life and resurrects the dead around them! It sounds terribly old-fashioned, but considering the age and budget, which was probably quite small, this movie is fun in many ways. <br /> <br /> Expect an EG Daily to become one of the most popular. I enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 7 children out of 10, children.
