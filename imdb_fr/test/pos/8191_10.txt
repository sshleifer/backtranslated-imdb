This three-hour epic (which seems much shorter) explores the will to power and conquest and the contradictory motives underlying this quest by tracking two parallel lives: the Emperor Q'in, whose desire to unite the Chinese feudal states are based on lofty goals but result in violent oppression, isolation and ultimate powerlessness; and the assassin Jing ke, a mercenary assassin who comes to recognize the unexpected consequences of murder and find a form of salvation. As with all great arts, this can be understood on many levels. The film evoked for me images and ideas of Homer, Euripides, Machiavelli, Shakespeare and Freud. <br /> <br /> The story itself is true (I checked it on britannica.com!), so this movie will please history buffs. It is ironic that Q'in has spent most of his last years in a vain quest for immortality (not visible on the screen, but consistent with the plot). <br /> <br /> The film can also be considered an allegory of Maoism and the Cultural Revolution. Throughout the film, one can understand that the last 50 years of Chinese history have had their precedent over the past 3,000 years. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for the public, these complex ideas are developed in a film rich in images. , action and pagent. Battle scenes alone are worth the price of admission.
