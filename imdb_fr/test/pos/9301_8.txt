The movie seemed a bit slow at first. But it picked up speed and went straight to the point. It showed exactly how the government and the scientist were defending humanity and the reasons for the "gadget". I liked that. It's very close to reality, as in any film about atomic bombs that were to be dropped in Japan. I recommended it to friends. I was particularly pleased with Dwight Schultz's acting ability.
