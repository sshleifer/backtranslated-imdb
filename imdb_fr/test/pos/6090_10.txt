I like this movie above all others. It's "multilayer"; there is so much to see and enjoy. Each view brings a new appreciation of the plot, the plot and the characters. Without fail and extremely pleasant if you take the time to look at it and appreciate it. I love the interaction between players. subtle relationships; the atmosphere of the period. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly in the role of the monstrous lover and Geoffrey, the injured husband, is beautifully downplayed by Colin Firth. The scene of the Sandstorm where Catherine & El-Masy discuss different types of sandstorms is one of the highlights of the film and the beginning of the case. The other relationship between Hanna and El-Masy is another "layer" of the film, totally enchanting (and heartbreaking). A worthy winner of so many awards.
