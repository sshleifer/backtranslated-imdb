This representation of the helpless Japanese forces in the Philippines is a tour de force in the total absence of any sense of war. It is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after the Second World War. In the film, Japanese soldiers were left to fend for themselves in the jungles of the Philippines. Facing the imminent famine, they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose the little humanity they have left. To say that this film is depressing would be a euphemism. The viewer has the desperate feeling of the loss of value of life in modern fights. The final scene is almost too nihilistic but the film is nevertheless a statement worthy of being. Highly recommended.
