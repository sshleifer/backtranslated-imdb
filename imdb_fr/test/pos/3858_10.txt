The Aristorcats is a hilarious movie that few people have seen. Clearly not much because he only got 6.8. There is nothing wrong with that at all. This is my favorite Disney classics, which already have a ton of fantastic movies. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the movie is. I hate to say that, but I do not blame Edgar for what he does. I would probably have taken care of them too. I would be devastated by an old bag with which I had been working for so many years, just decide to give his will to cats. I would have killed them too. I do not even like cats, so I do not care. I think The Aristorcats is so funny and cute. There are many hilarious characters, like Edgar. The Aristorcats are my favorite Disney classics, and it's definitive. The cat is out of the bag. <br /> <br /> The Aristorcats: **** / ****
