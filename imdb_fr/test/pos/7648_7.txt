I did not really know what to expect from this movie and found myself pleasantly surprised. I understood that because I recently came across Norman Reedus and try to find more movies he went to. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of toads or scams, but I have to say, this one spun me in minutes. Probably because I could not stop knowing exactly who was pushing who. This film is elegant and fast, with a story that is credible thanks to its location and fantastic performance. <br /> <br /> While most people impress me in the film, I must say that Dagmara Dominczyk was just excellent. <br /> Let yourself be tempted, it's a very funny movie.
