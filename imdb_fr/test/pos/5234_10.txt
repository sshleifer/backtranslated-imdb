I had never expected such an old film to be as impressive as what we saw in this 1930's western. Scenes of pioneers heading west in their boxcars, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks and all sorts of trials and dangers are astonishing in their rough credibility. Much of the film was shot outside and the film has a really epic feel. The actors must have known about the same conditions as the original pioneers and the results are staggering. Trolleys, clothes, every detail look and feel. The characters are simple but credible, with a simple story, which travels like a train of cars to its destination. <br /> <br /> John Wayne is slim and young in one of his leading roles, scouting at the head of the cars, and doing a good job as a young frontier idealist. He comes up against a trio of wonderfully scurvy scoundrels, including Ian Keith as a skilled player, Charles Stevens as a Mexican teammate, and Tyrone Power as a bear-like growing trapper. The portrait of bearded power, surly, larger than life is both comical and threatening. I still imagine him with a bandanna, a gold earring and a black eye patch, a parrot on his shoulder, as he grunts and grunts various threats and insults. His character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship without any difficulty. It flies almost the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Tully Marshall is an adorable old foxy frontier who is Wayne's best friend. The charming Marguerite Churchill is a lively heroine, whose initial encounter with Wayne is a hilarious confusion, resulting in a long courtship display of insults and feigned indifference to escape her persistence. The results are quite humorous and we are happy to finally see them together at the end. <br /> <br /> The landscape is beautiful, trolleys crossing real meadows and to be lowered by ropes. Indians, who are clearly the real article, and not white actors in disguise, appear both as friends and enemies and are treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells a group of admiring boys that the Indians are his friends, who taught him all he knows about survival in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a simple story, well told by a talented cast and crew. It will probably seem naive to many modern viewers, but there is a quiet dignity that never lets it go bad. There's a lot of intentional humor, including a pioneering naughty pioneer, who screams loudly, animal noises do not hide, every time the very talented player, Ian Keith, tries to convince the beautiful heroine to marry her. His florid speeches about the plantation he is supposed to possess are interrupted by very realistic imitations of meower cats and quack ducks, which would incite the seducer to look around with annoyance at the invisible creatures. Highly recommended, both Western fans and fans of old movies in general. It's really a classic movie for ages.
