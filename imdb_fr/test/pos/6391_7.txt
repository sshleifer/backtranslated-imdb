During a routine mission in Iraq, a group of Delta soldiers retrieve a hard drive from an Alqueda training camp detailing the location of the weapons specialist, Dr. Walsh. After witnessing the end of his highly secretive weapons development program, Dr. Walsh found an alternative source of funding and opened a new research center in the heart of the infamous Belzan Forest in Chechnya. sent on a mission to recover the doctor and his technology before the Russians find him, as well as his laboratory. What the Delta team are soon discovering is that the doctor's newest weapons are a flock of big carnivorous bats genetically engineered to give a taste for human flesh. I found this movie much better than I expected. There is a lot of action and a lot of blood. It's more or less what you expect from a creature feature. The acting is not great but it's passable. I certainly saw worse. Overall, it's a nice movie for what it is. A good movie of popcorn.
