We like a film like "Fame" because we imagine we are ourselves - students in music, dance and theater, taking advantage of our self-expression. This film had humor, entertainment and must be an inspiration for young people to get into the performing arts. Bravo "Fame". Definitely worth 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Chris
