*** SPOILERS *** This film describes the brutal bloodbath caused by Johnny Carson's retirement to determine who would succeed him. The imitations of David Letterman and Jay Leno are satisfactorily performed by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, although the performances were not excellent. Reni Santoni is the most successful of the "execs" (he plays NBC's John Agoglia), and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is nearby. I was shocked by the way Littlefield enthusiastically discussed the dumping of Johnny Carson. It was Johnny Carson! This scene is a testament to the fierce TV universe of what you did for me recently. Kathy Bates presented the best performance of the film as an agent, Helen Kushnick. Another speaker claimed that Leno was described as a mere fool in the film. I respectfully disagree. The relationship with Kushnick was close to domestic violence. She orders him to move and, when he rebels against her at the end, she tries to play the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); However, when Jay ends their relationship, she becomes violent again shouting "Do not leave me, bastard with two faces!" before breaking a photo on the floor. Overall, the movie is hilarious and I hope it will be shown more often.
