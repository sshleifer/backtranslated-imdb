During my trip to a forum of young leaders, I surfed on channels until I found "Tommy Boy" on TBS. Since I had never seen this movie before, I wanted to check it. My roommate, who has already seen this, told me, "This movie is a classic." After watching the film in its entirety, I came to the conclusion that he was right. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is constantly entertaining from start to finish, thanks to the humorous duet of Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is a riot as a main character, a spastic doofus who navigates in life as if she were not important. His lazy ways stop soon when his father (Brian Dennehy), a wealthy "Break Pads King," dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. This brings Tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend Richard (David Spade), to hit the road to sell enough protective gear to save the business. <br /> <br /> The main reason why "Tommy Boy" works is fun performances of the main cast. Farley is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person being Spade and the third being Rob Lowe, the bad luck movie villain. Dan Aykroyd plays Ray Zalinsky, a famous auto parts actor. <br /> <br /> Another reason the movie works is the large number of jokes. Chris Farley has hilarious burlesque moments, and David Spade has funny sneaky comments and one-liners. The gags in the movie (some involving a deer and a plane bathroom) are funny, thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), screenwriters Bonnie & Terry Turner <br /> <br (3rd Rock From the Sun, That 70s Show) and Distribution. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is a really funny movie, although, for some unknown reason, most movie critics (including Roger Ebert) find it awful and not funny. (I wonder when their sense of humor is dead.) I recommend "Tommy Boy" to those who are big fans of comedy. Thank you very much, roommate.
