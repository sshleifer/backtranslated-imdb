John Travolta was excellent as "Michael" in the movie of the same name. I do not think a better representation could have been done. The movie was funny, but touching. Michael is a very "human angel" (if that's the case). Andie MacDowell is superb in her role as a journalist, because she goes from incredulity to conviction. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are excellent as journalists, all determined to prove the angel's hoax on earth. Each of the actors is wonderful, especially the older woman (I do not know her screen name), who plays Michael's mother! One of the cutest movies I've seen in years ... I could watch this movie dozens of times!
