This film marks the end of the "serious" era of Universal Monsters (Abbott and Costello find the monsters later in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein"). It was a somewhat desperate but amusing attempt to revive the classic monsters of Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula a "last" time. <br /> <br /> I say desperate, because in the previous movie, "Frankenstein's House," Dracula and the Werewolf are killed according to the way legends of vampires and werewolves say they should to be (Dracula in the light of the sun and the werewolf to the silver bullet). Yet they return to Dracula without any explanation. This film could have played as a sort of prequel to House of Frankenstein if the Frankenstein monster's plot did not continue chronologically in House of Frankenstein's House of Dracula, and if the werewolf was not cured. Then there would be no ground holes. But since this is not the case, the intrigues of Dracula and the Wolf Man make no sense. <br /> <br /> However, ignoring these holes of the plot, House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric horror movie and fun to watch. He has a lot of strengths. Especially see the wolf man heal. I know I just said it should not have been included, but it was nice to see him heal after all this time. And the scene with the lady playing "Moonlight Senada" at the piano, then suddenly playing a haunting melody while Dracula was under the spell was very strange. Mr. Edleman's transformation into a "Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde" character was also very well done. <br /> <br /> And it's a pleasure to see Dracula, Frankenstein and the werewolf together, a "last" time. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
