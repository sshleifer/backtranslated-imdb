In this episode, Locke and Eko go in search of "?" symbol that we saw when locking a previous episode. Michael, after shooting Ana Lucia and Libby, wrestles with his actions as Libby approaches death. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this episode (I think). Is during the commercial break. Locke and Eko discover a hatch under the plane that killed Boone during the first season. A new training video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989" In a next commercial break, a rather bizarre and indescribable advertisement "The Hanso Foundation" (a planted commercial) and the advertised website (www.sublymonal.com .com) guide the visitor into a world of information about life outside the LOST scenario. A must for all fans!
