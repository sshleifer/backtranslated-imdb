This is not your typical Indian movie. There is a great sense of humanity and the characters are quite realistic. Interpersonal relationships are very dynamic and there is a feeling of guilt, sorrow, passion, passivity among the many characters. Seeing this, one sees the heavy burden of 5000 years of layers and layers of history of the social existence of one of the oldest civilizations. The last scene of an elephant moving away from the rural area was an excellent footnote for such an ancient civilization, but human relations are still preserved and maintained. Seen on DVD, the two interviews of the director and the main actress are very interesting. Was surprised to learn that the film did not do well (or was not shown) in India (... but maybe not too surprised). The artistic heritage of rural societies is slowly being lost and its heritage is not taken over by younger generations, with some of the older musicians in the film no longer alive today. A good film.
