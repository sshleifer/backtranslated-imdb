I thought it would be a more fantastic tale. But the subject is rather down-to-earth in relation to the story of the carriage I was waiting for. In fact, there is much more social drama. As usual in "European auteur films". <br /> <br /> The actors are interesting, not exaggerated as in the average silent film. The pictures are not beautiful enough to stay in your mind as in Bergman's Smultronstället. <br /> <br /> It is true that the comparison between the two films is essential here. Smultronstället begins with a vision of a mortal carriage in which the character of Sjöström can see his own body. There are clocks without hands. He has to come back to what he did wrong. There is a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen, Sjöström's wife does not cheat on her, but she wants to run away with the little children, because it will never improve. Finally, Edit's confessions are a kind of live judgment. <br /> <br /> Well, I would just like to add that Sjöström destroyed the door with an ax because his wife locked it up and considering going with the kids reminds me of Brilliant. Which was much more a fantasy tale with death hanging out.
