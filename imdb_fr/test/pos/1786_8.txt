One year after his first triumphant special, "My Name Is Barbra", Barbra Streisand teamed up with his production team to produce this special CBS-TV sequel in a revolutionary color. Released for the first time in March 1966, "Color Me Barbra" follows a format similar to its predecessor - three segments, the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the corridors of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she is dressed as a housekeeper, walks in the galleries and becomes part of the work by the song. Streisand expresses a variety of moods ranging from the comic scheme of "Minute Waltz" to the melodrama of "No it's nothing" in a painting by Modigliani to the frenzy to the beatnik of "Gotta Move" set on abstract art. My favorite moment in the stage is when she turns Queen Nefertiti singer into a haunting rendition of "Where or When" by Rogers and Hart. <br /> <br /> Opening with another comic monologue full of sequiturs nonsense, this time in French, the second segment is back in the studio for a colorful circus medley where she interacts with animals, including her beloved poodle Sadie. She finds a proper context for "Sam, you made the pants too long" with a crowd of penguins and comically compares his profile to that of an anteater with "We have so much in common". As for the first special, the program ends with a captivating solo concert in which she sings chestnuts, "Any place where I hang my hat is at home", "Where am I going?" and "Start here, start now" among them. There is also the brief introduction she filmed in 1986, ironically dressed in white, when the special was first published on VHS. The juxtaposition of venues and songs is even more effective than in his first special, and a 23-year-old Streisand is in top form.
