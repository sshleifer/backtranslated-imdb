It is hard to imagine nowadays how much a Norwegian immigrant and a chemist had a popular impact on the American public and how much his national tragedy had been seen by his sudden death in 1931. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary man who revolutionized and popularized university football and put on the map a small Catholic college. <br /> <br /> I've heard clips from Rockne's famous pep interviews and it's amazing how Pat O 'Brien has perfectly understood the voice and the inflection. In his role as a career, Pat O'Brien embodies the integrity and fighting spirit of Rockne. Rockale is assisted by Gale Page in the role of Bonnie Stiles Rockne who complained that her home was a training camp for Notre Dame, but never threw anyone outside her home. <br /> <br /> Rockne's first impact on football was a player with Notre Dame not a coach. One fine day in the second half of a losing football match against highly favored Army, Rockne and teammate Gus Dorais, played by Owen Davis, used the pass forward as an offensive weapon. Previously, football was simply a game in which you had to have bigger players on your side and that you lead the defense. Rockne did not invent the pass forward, but he became popular and football became a strategy game, but also power. <br /> <br /> Rockne also knew how to work with the media. His high-profile media coverage was not just about inspiring his players. They were highly publicized and it is largely thanks to him that university football has become a major sport in this golden age of the sport of the roaring twenties. <br /> <br /> Ronald Reagan plays an important but important role. As the first player Rockne coached George Gipp, Reagan not only got a good performance, but always after a name that was useful to him in his subsequent political career. This scene on the death bed that Rockne swore to be exact became a Republican war cry, while many GOP sealants came out to win one for Gipper. to recover President Ronald Reagan at the Notre Dame graduation with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan has always called O'Brien and Dick Powell, among the stars of the Warner Brothers period of this period, to have been the kindest and most encouraging for a young player looking to outdo himself. <br /> <br /> Our Lady herself owes her prestige to Rockne. It is quite possible that Notre Dame is an obscure little Catholic college without the reputation that football gave it. <br /> <br /> Although George Gipp and the famous last Four Horsemen field certainly had their place in the sun, it was Rockne who had the reputation. It is no coincidence that Warner Brothers was able to call Knute Rockne, Alonzo Stagg's All American Amos, Glenn Pop 'Warner, Howard Jones and William Spaulding, Rockne's contemporaries and their renowned coaches. It was a way to pay tribute to the guy who was the number one in their profession. <br /> <br /> I think more than football fans will appreciate Knute Rockne, All American. Although you can become one after watching the movie.
