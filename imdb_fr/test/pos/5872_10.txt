I saw this film for the first time as a teenager (I am now in my forties) and has long considered it my favorite movie. The story is extremely moving, without being sentimental. The acting, especially by March and Loy, is without appeal. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for her role does not detract from the credibility of her romantic relationship with Theresa Wright (who, in my opinion, is the only major character in the film that is still alive). It could have been another post-war melodrama, but the story and the cast are just too good for that to happen.
