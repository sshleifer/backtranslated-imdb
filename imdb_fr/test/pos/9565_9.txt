I saw this film with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was written, directed and acted so that every minute is a delightful watch. People do not seem to act, but rather real people who really train dogs and lead the life described in this film. There are wonderful moments where you laugh or laugh, some jokes can be dry but are presented in a very visible way. Highly recommended!
