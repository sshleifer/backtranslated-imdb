this movie has a big chase scene, if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are going on, it looks a lot like the soundtrack of the movie ball, you'll hear the offset of a speed at 4 and they'll show the The brake pedal in Roy Schneider's car is an automatic brake pedal!, I think one of the funniest moments of the movie is when the naughty Richard Lynch looks at the driver of the car in which he is riding find, as if this guy was crazy! ........ the scammer who manages the garage is also the one of the first rocky movie, the boss of rocky. good movie! moreover, when the door is torn, you can see the guy sitting in the car that opens the door, the guy who helps him out of the car looks a bit like Mr. Brady from the Brady group, is not it? not?
