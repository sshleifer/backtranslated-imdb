One of the BEST movies I've seen for a long time. Bechard has a very unique way of seeing things and this film does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> This film lets you guess, and with the seemingly taboo subjects that are addressed, you stay glued to the screen. There is no villain or nice guy, Bechard makes sure of it. The characters are so perfectly complex that you feel for each of them, you care about what they went through. <br /> <br /> The use of Bechard is unmatched in the world of "FAST FOOD MOVIES" subjects can make some uncomfortable - you like the feeling that it gives you. <br /> <br /> I have heard too often that there are NO NEW stories to tell. Thank you Gorman Bechard for proving it was wrong. <br /> <br /> Run, do not walk, to see this movie.
