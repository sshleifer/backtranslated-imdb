If you've ever been a fan of MTV's The State, these three guys will be familiar to you. But even if you only meet them on the Internet as I did, you'll soon appreciate their unique brand of comedy. <br /> <br /> Born from their trio of comedies "Stella", Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and David Wain produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to be shown at their shows, and now after being available only for download from two websites, they appear in virgin glory on a DVD. <br /> <br /> Think of a comedy sketch without censorship, and you would be halfway there. No stone of decency is left behind. who love their impolite, complaisant and childish comedy, (and I mean that in the most flattering way), here is the DVD for you! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth paying the comment of both Michaels and David alone, you can not help but love them by explaining their actions, grumble at their own ex-toys romp and alternately caress their backs and launch insults. <br /> <br /> Fantastic. <br /> <br /> That must mean something for Stella's call that the likes of Julie Bowen and Paul Rudd is ready to engage in action so fearlessly. And you should follow their fine example, throw preconceived ideas in the wind and prepare to laugh yourself.
