I first saw All River Run on TV when I was a child and loved it. It was great to see a mini-series that was shot and filmed in a place so close to home. Living fairly close to Echuca, I loved going to the historic harbor to see the steamboats. The first one I ever went to was Pevensy (Philadelphia in the movie). I like the way he takes his time to let events unfold. Nothing seems rushed like most of today's movies. The acting was fantastic. The entire Rivers Run was in full swing and I love the Philadelphia team. Mac is always fun to watch with his raw onion sandwich after a big party. Easily deserves a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorite mini-series of all time with the Dirtwater dynasty.
