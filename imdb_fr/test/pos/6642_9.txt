I watched this film on the big screen a few months ago. I did not know what to expect, and for the first ten minutes I was afraid of not loving this movie. It started very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was even less exciting as the sound was bad and the subtitles were sometimes impossible to read. <br /> <br /> But I do not regret having continued watching him. It's one of the most beautiful Bergman films I've ever seen, human, ruthless and psychologically convincing. <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen actors play so wonderfully, with such intensity. Faces: Liv Ullman's interpretation is unforgettable and Sydow is also excellent. <br /> <br /> There is always emotional abuse in Bergman's films, and this one is perhaps the most violent of all. The tense relationship between man and woman is evolving alongside the physical violence that surrounds them ... <br /> <br /> Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth. An excellent Bergman. <br /> <br />
