As in Rififi, the most fascinating scene of the film is the perfected silence of the jewel stealing. The scene is masterful in its execution, each of the robbers having their own specialized work to perform, each successfully combining his unique talent for the purpose and each, until a month before, complete strangers. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are played very slowly. In fact, the opening scene is a long introduction of the character to Corey and Vogel, as we see Corey get out of jail and Vogel escape a capture as he heads to the jail. The two characters are then methodically united by fate in a roadside restaurant, while Vogel hides in the trunk of the car Corey. From this improbable breakthrough, the two foreigners agree to become partners to commit a perfect and precise flight. <br /> <br /> However, to shoot from this robbery, they must call on a third man, Jansen. Jansen is hired as a safe shooter. His inclusion in the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. At the time of his hiring, Jansen is in a battle with DT and spent most of his day on his bed hallucinating in front of lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the wild and hallucinatory world of a William S. Burroughs dream to a firm and sober and sharp shooting game is very fast and perhaps the only real faux-film moment, but it's very difficult for me. <BR /> <br /> Another slightly false note was that of police inspector Mattei. Sometimes he seemed brilliant to force the right people or gather information and wait for his escaped prisoner to make his move. Other times, he seemed to have retired 10 years ago, especially at the beginning of Vogel's escape through the woods. <br /> <br /> I wonder if I have too much hidden meaning since the beginning of the film. At the beginning of the film, as the police car is traveling at full speed in the city, the first image we see is a red light. My first thought was that this could be the "red circle" and that if I want to find a deeper meaning in the film, maybe this car, or rather the people inside that pass through the red light, will be the ones who will "stop" the jewel holdup. Hmmmm? <br /> <br /> Maybe the red circle refers to the ring of the triumvirate thief? Maybe it was the sled on fire? It does not matter. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it does not feel like that. The end is a little disappointing. It seemed too hurried for a film that looked like a delicious slow burn. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
