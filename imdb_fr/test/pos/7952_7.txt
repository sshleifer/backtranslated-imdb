Korean "Romance" about the owner of a photo equipment store who is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. As his daily activities and preparation for his end, he meets a young girl client. A friendship and a love grow, even if neither express any kind of affection for the other. A good movie is different from anything you might see in America just because the studios would insist that the "couple" act according to their feelings. He will not say anything because he will not have much time to live, she will not do it, because that is not what is done and he does not react as she thinks. Of course, it's a lot more complex than I pretend and, in all honesty, that's the kind of thing you should discover for yourself. Is it a good movie? No, but it's a good way to move you. The last lines of the film always haunt me: "I always knew that the love would fade like a photo, but you will stay in my heart as you are in my last moment.Thank you and goodbye". It may seem strange out of context but with the context of the film it is very moving.
