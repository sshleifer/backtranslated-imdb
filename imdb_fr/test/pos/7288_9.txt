OK ..you need people to settle! This movie is not so bad. I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love! I must admit that I have never been a LeeLee Sobieski fan, but she grew up with me in this movie. I think Josh Hartnett is beautiful, but that's my ... Chris Klein is the most beautiful man I know !!! He improved this movie for me. C'mon girls..when he does not have a shirt and goes to get water, I know that your mouth has fallen. Yes, I know at first he's a fool, but in the end, he realizes how he acted and learns to be a good guy. If he had not come in the end, then I would have been angry. I think he does not need to say a few lines, but overall, it was a good movie! I really recommend it!
