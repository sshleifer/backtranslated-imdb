I just watched The Dresser tonight, having seen it only once before, a dozen years ago. <br /> <br /> This is not a "big" movie and it does not try to make waves. God, the brilliance of the two tracks leaves me almost speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing but great in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Dresser tells the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his Norman dresser (Courtenay), a sort of valet, starring a production of King Lear in the blitz of London during the Second World War. They are two men, dependent on each other: Sir is almost defenseless, without the help of Norman, to cajole, slander and encourage him to go on stage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Monsieur needing him, in any case, he is nothing, or thinks of doing so. <br /> <br /> It's a character-driven movie; the plot is secondary to the interaction of characters and, as such, first-rate actors are needed to make it happen. Finney, who is only 47 years old, is quite credible as a very old, very sick, petulant, intimidating, but brilliant theater actor. He hisses and smokes on his fellow actors even when they take their bow! And Courtenay is no less convincing as a meat trainer, who sometimes has to act more as a mother than as a valet at his former employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use, however. Although, technically, their relationship is that of an employer and that of an employee, most of the time Sir and Norman behave like old married couples. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are others in the distribution of this film. but there is no doubt that the real stars are Finney, Courtenay and the wonderful scenario of Ronald Harwood. This does not mean that there are no other great performances, especially Eileen Atkins in the role of Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge speak of old desires, old regrets and what could have been. <br /> <br /> Even if we do not talk about it today, it's worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Oscars: nominations for the best actors for Finney and Courtenay, best film, best director (Peter Yates ) and best adapted scenario. <br /> <br /> I remembered it as a good movie, but I was not ready to be as fascinated as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what a good acting game is and if you enjoy yourself a lot all the time, then I encourage you to see The Dresser.
