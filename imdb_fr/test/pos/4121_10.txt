It's at least very close to a perfect video post. A group of messianic metal, rock n 'roll dinosaurs, the most influential and influential band in the world plays their hit songs and evokes the past of their group. What do we need more? and ends with "Paranoid" and in the middle all the most important and significant classics of the original lineup: "Electric Funeral", "Sweet Leaf", "After always", "Iron Man", "Children of the grave" "... and of course my favorite" Into the void ", I'm glad they did not forget it. Well, how could they? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this video is not limited to music. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward trace the colorful story of the band. The only thing that bothers me a bit is when a song is interrupted by interview passages. For example, is it necessary to inform how the song "N.I.B." You have his name, right in the middle, one on the other? I doubt. It's always a small flaw, so it's not that bad. <br /> <br /> The members of the group also lounge on chairs and talk together: pleasant material for a Sabbath lover! I admit that I have trouble following what Ozzy Osbourne mumbles but it's fun. I had the privilege to participate when "The last supper tour" entered Finland and for me personally, this video is an ideal way to remember this magnificent show.
