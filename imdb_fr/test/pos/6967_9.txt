Ghoulies 4 is a rather macabre suite. The ghouls are very different from the first three, but they remain fresh. There are some nice steps back, from Ghoulies the first film. Jonathan is back in this one. He was not in parts 2 or 3 though. The film is small budget sometimes, but fun to watch. You have Tony Cox as Dark Ghoulie and Arturo Gil in Light Ghoulie. The ghosts of this movie are actually good men, instead of being mean as in the first three movies. The two Ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. Then you have the hot Alexandra! It's a great black comedy and fun! All fans of Ghoulies movies will love watching Ghoulies 4. The DVD will be released in July 2007! Hopefully one day Ghoulies III will be on DVD in the United States. I would really like to see a sequel to this movie someday too. I doubt that it happens We are in 2007 and we do not see yet. I hope Jim Wynorski will succeed if there is a sequel. <br /> <br /> I give Ghoulies IV a 9/10
