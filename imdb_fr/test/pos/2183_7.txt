After two years of researching Humphrey Bogart's film "Two Against the World," he unexpectedly appears as an MCT offer under the title "One Fatal Hour," a first national film of 1936. The character of Bogey is Sherry Scott, the man who runs WUBC, a radio station whose programming is losing listeners. The owner, Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass), is a pathetic executive who takes things in hand at the station, but hides behind his decisions by pledging them on Scott. <br /> <br /> In order to reinforce the public and Reynolds has the idea of ​​relaunching a twenty-year-old murder case and offering it as a fifteen-page radio play. Scott asks the help of Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) to write the play and present it on air. <br /> <br /> The murder case in Pembroke involved a woman who had been acquitted of the murder of her husband, the circumstances of which are unclear. However, Gloria Pembroke is married and now lives with Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is about to get married (the same day as the radio play must reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke). On the verge of facing the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs embark on a crusade to end the program. At the same time, Edith's future parents-in-law react by demanding that the wedding not be celebrated. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the final result, the film takes a devastating turn that shocks the viewer. Edith Carstairs confronts the directors of the radio station, scolding Scott and Reynolds vigorously. While accepting his share of responsibility for the result, Scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job, sacking his secretary and taking her out of the office, recognizing her for the conscience he once had. With a completely abrupt finish, the film leaves someone as disoriented and unstable as any film that has no happy ending. <br /> <br /> With about a dozen films to his credit, Humphrey Bogart is fortunate to play a central role here with intriguing results. Without a player name, Bogey is up to the task by taking the controls on the premises of the radio and directs the show as if it were his. In an interesting characterization, he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands over the slanted head, nearly a half-dozen years before the same effect as we will see in "Casablanca". For Bogart fans, it's a real treat to catch an unexpected nuance like this.
