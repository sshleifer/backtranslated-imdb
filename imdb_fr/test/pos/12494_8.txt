And I like it!!! Wonder Showzen will attract a cult audience and, once it's canceled, DVD sales will go all the way. It's a very entertaining show in its own way. It's a parody of children's shows, namely Sesame Street. Our puppet characters are made of Chauncy, a monster with yellow fur and hat, who is our host. Clarence is a blue lizard who makes his own scenes when he goes out into the street. He is a strange dog as something that refers to the third person. Wordsworth is the evil one whose brain always shows. Then there is the press presenter and the pink puppet. It's a very funny show, not as bad as you would expect, but more situations. They take 7-year-olds to the streets, tell them what to say and make jokes they do not understand. My favorite segments are Clarence's videos, especially when someone does not want to be filmed. I prefer TV Funhouse, which was a similar show, but it's still a very funny show that, I hope, will last for many years. <br /> <br /> My note: *** *. 30 min. TV MA.
