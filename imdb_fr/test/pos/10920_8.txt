In & Out is a comedy with a simple premise. He succeeds admirably in the mission to be funny and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The comedy in this film goes from ridiculous to sublime, physical comedy exists alongside dry humor, with a nice veteran Bob Newhart. Predictably, Kevin Kline is in excellent shape in this film, alongside Tom Selleck who does not play in the expected manner of his main character "square jaw". Mr. Selleck plays his humor well and displays a good sense of comic timing. Distribution is the success of this film. <br /> <br /> All films on homosexual themes are not designed to advance some sort of sinister, hidden agenda of Hollywood's liberal agenda. some of these films let the viewer think, so it was a by-product of the well-done work done by a formidable cast of professionals. Frequently, I laughed at the right time. A solid "B."
