The relationship between the main characters that I found very realistic. How both find themselves involved is believable. It does not have all that "oh yeah right" that most Hollywood movies have. Do not mention how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of the trapeze. I am a trapeze student and I love the fact that they show how hard it is for the body, the hands and yes, these burns are brutal! Must see both for the relationship as for the art made in the film. I liked it! I'm happy with the end of the film but I really wanted to see more. Make sure to sit through the credits for a special hehe treatment. Great scene!
