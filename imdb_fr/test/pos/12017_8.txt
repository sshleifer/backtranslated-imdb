This film is a coveted member of my film library. Although it's not a mainstream film, it's, in my opinion, a very effective black film in which Eric Roberts is totally underrated as an actor. (I would call him a much better actor than his sister Julia, who is overrated, but that's another criticism ...) Roberts interprets the ex-reporter who lacks luck with a perfect blend of narrative accuracy and idealism blazon : two ingredients that are an integral part of any effective black film. Roberts' first-person narrative improves the quality of the film and prevents us from guessing what the real motive of the crime is. <br /> <br /> In Palm Springs, all that happens in the film slowly advances metaphor of the theme of oppression: Asch (Roberts) is oppressed by his past; the police are oppressed by the wealthy inhabitants of Palm Springs, who treat them like servants; the rich, on the other hand, are oppressed by boredom (observe the classic performance of Johnny Depp as a rich and insightful man who only wants to be loved ...); the isolation of each character is omnipresent and is further reinforced by the heat and isolation of the desert. <br /> <br /> There is an audience for this film if it looks for a more contemporary version of the film noir. Although some elements of the film may have been tighter, I recommend you get a copy and place it correctly between The Big Sleep and Chinatown in your movie library. (The film is based on Arthur Lyons 'book, CASTLES BURNING, and if you like Roberts' acting in this one, you might want to get a copy of The Ambulance, in which he presents his side funier and lighter.) BEST LINE IN THE MOVIE: "Be careful what I should have asked, only fools ignore the strange warnings of the ladies in the caravan park."
