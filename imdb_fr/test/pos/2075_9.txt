If you want to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this version of the BBC. Indeed, it lasts more than four and a half hours, but Jacoby's performances as Hamlet and those of Patrick Stewart as Claudius are well worth the effort. <br /> <br /> It never ceases to amaze me how "Hamlet" is clear when you see it. in its length and order as defined by the bard. Each film version of "Hamlet" has been tinkered with its structure. Olivier focused on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to collect all these aspects of Hamlet's character using Shakespeare's complete script. <br /> <br /> Why does not Hamlet kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says, "I am very proud, vengeful, ambitious ..." Hamlet is extremely upset not only by the death of his father (and by the alleged murder), but also by the marriage of his mother with his uncle, but also and especially by the fact that Claudius usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious with his mother for marrying Claudius (marriages between royal parents are not unknown, it is for political reasons) but his marriage strengthened Claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it by itself. He is therefore powerless to do anything. And this is true even after hearing the vengeance of his father's ghosts. He can not simply kill the king, otherwise he will lose the throne. He must "reveal" the secret of the king and here is the tragedy! By the time Hamlet succeeds in showing Claude's guilt in public, he has the opportunity to kill him and does not. WHY? He wants everything! He wants vengeance, throne AND damnation of the soul of Claude in hell. Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in a classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his loss. He kills Polonius thinking it's Claudius and the rest of the game spirals to the final death of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet himself.
