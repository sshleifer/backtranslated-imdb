Appears to have been made as a vehicle for W.C. Fields and Carol Dempster and they dominate it. Fields already has his well-developed movie character. Carol Dempster seems to be dancing in the film and her play reminds me of Mary Pickford, who has also worked for a long time under D.W. Griffith Technically typical of Griffith's latest films. <br /> <br /> Later, picked up in Poppy (the original title) with Fields in the same role.
