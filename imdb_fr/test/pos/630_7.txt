This is without a doubt one of my favorite horror movies! I really can not believe that his popularity did not gain much more popularity when it was released, especially when the main contenders at the time were Wes Craven's usual sequels and the horrors of copycat. Hitchcock / DePalma movie, coupled with a very strong black comedy and a great plot. It never promises to be a good movie of popcorn and hot dogs, but it's hard not to just enjoy the movie as it is. <br /> <br /> The plot centers on Billie Hughes - a dumb girl working on the set of a horror movie in a Russian factory. Following a series of events, she finds herself accidentally stranded and falls on the set of a snuff film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is the lack of screams that seem to invade all the horrors. movie never done. The main character being silent, she can not make noise, which is a blessing at some stages of the film and a curse to others. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well, Even the opening scene is a nod to both Hitchcock's "Psycho" and fairly generic slasher movie scenes. <br /> <br /> Even though the acting can sometimes be hammered, the whole film keeps it together, not only by presenting two excellent scenes that place you on the edge of your seat, but also a few small questions interesting on the end of the film. <br /> <br /> An incredibly neglected, well-paced and action packed psychological thriller that I would recommend to any jaded spectator looking for something a little different from the usual regurgitation of Freddy / Jason / Scream / Michael Myers / Damien on Halloween.
