Okay, I admit that if I did not have children, I would never have seen this movie and I would never see it. But, considering all the rotten movies I've seen (such as SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY), this is a significant improvement. And, there was enough so that I do not miss my skull completely or that I do not think about suicide (which I have done several times in the two other films). Of course, the performances are quite wide and the plot is a bit ridiculous, but it's a children's movie. And, compared to other films of the genre, it's significantly better than the average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually seem to have some talent and will probably continue to make a career after puberty - at least on infomercials or dubbing. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie to see with your kids, you could definitely do a lot worse!
