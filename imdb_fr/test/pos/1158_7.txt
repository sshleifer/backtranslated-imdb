It is an adventure movie that is perfectly viewable to watch, with excellent distribution and a good story, based on real events. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the film's story is based on real events. It is above all a story of adventures with all the usual ingredients of an adventure movie taking place in an Arab world. So a lot of sword fighting, a good old-fashioned honor, a religion and a proud and rich country. But the film is also full of humor, making it a light and enjoyable film to watch. <br /> <br /> The constant coming and going between the Moroccan plot involving Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot involving Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) was not the best possible approach in my opinion. The two things have totally different rhythms, totally different characters, they are only totally different worlds! Of course, the two scenarios are linked and focus on the same thing, but the contrast between the two worlds is too important to let it work. The film does not always feel connected and a little disconnected. The American plot is mostly more political whereas the Moroccan plot is purely adventurous and action-packed. In the end, maybe you could even ask yourself what was Roosevelt's goal in this movie. Apparently, John Milius is just a big admirer of him. Often, the American plot would slow down most of the Moroccan plot, much more interesting and more eventful. After all, John Milius has always been at his best as a director of action. <br /> <br /> We have to wait half the time for the film to grow. The most important and biggest action of the film begins then. Especially the great end battle does not disappoint. I wish the whole movie was like this. In this way, this film would also have been better known, no doubt. <br /> <br /> The film has an excellent musical score of Jerry Goldsmith, which is perhaps better known than the film itself. The film is also beautiful, with a superb production design, beautiful action sequences and battle. Apparently, the film costs only $ 4,000,000, but it's hard to believe, given the settings and the size of the film. I mean John Milius, his best-known movie, "Conan the Barbarian", cost about $ 20,000,000, but he was a lot more campy and had a less impressive size. <br /> <br /> Enough to see an Arab speak a big Scottish accent but hey, it's Sean Connery, so you just tend to accept that. He is well suited to his role. Candice Bergen too. It is always difficult for a female character to appear credible and to train in a film like this, but she succeeds. John Huston also plays an important role in this movie! <br /> <br /> It's a perfectly fine film that can be viewed! <br /> <br /> 7/10
