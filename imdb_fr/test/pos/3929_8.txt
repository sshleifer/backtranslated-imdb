Although HOUSE OF WAX is never confused with Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it attempts and ultimately succeeds in being a valuable asset for producing quality horror movies. There is enough tension and implicit gore to appeal to today's young audience, and enough explicit gore to please some of the purists of yesterday. All in all, it's a pretty good movie that should go well on DVD. <br /> <br /> Six children on their way to a football match find themselves stuck in a DELIVERANCE-like setting and what follows from it actually looks like a released Deilverance sequel and the backwood hicks seem to taunt the group. Eventually, the group must separate and half of them go to the desolate city to get car parts. The other half of the group stays at the camp and the second part of the film is prepared. <br /> <br /> House of Wax has many assets. The first is that it has a very nice cast. Paris Hilton is doing well in her role but she is far from the center. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds a bit of panache, credibility and flair. I had never really heard of Chad Michael Murray, only that he was a pin-up idol. But he has a presence to him. He imbues him with an intangible that seems to translate into his performance. He is instantly friendly and has a strong character trait. I enjoyed his performance much more than I would have thought and when he was on the screen, the film sank. <br /> <br /> The question now becomes: "Is this film a valid horror film?" And the answer to this question is a resounding YES. As I mentioned earlier, it's not in the same class a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE LEFT, nor even THE RING, but it's relatively tense, pretty graphic, and shows scenes from dead very inventive. This is not the HOUSE OF WAX that your parents told you about. Vincent Price can not be found. When you begin to see cut fingers and hot wax covering the comatose bodies, you realize that this film is a little on the limit. <br /> <br /> I would like to see an uncut movie rated version X of the director. I bet there is one somewhere that would be much more violent than this one. Anyway, it's a very good entry into the horror genre and it's above the faint movies like I KNOW WHAT YOU MADE LAST SUMMER and DARK WATER and a few others. This is really worth a look. <br /> <br /> 8/10
