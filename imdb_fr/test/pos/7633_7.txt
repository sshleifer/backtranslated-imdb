"The Ossessa" (published in English under many titles and the strangest of them is certainly "The strange midnight horror show") is one of the best Italian scams of "The Exorcist". To really enjoy this movie, you must have a sense of humor. "L'Ossessa" is at the same time sordid (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even moving. <br /> <br /> Danila (Stella Carnacina), art student, goes to an old church to see the statue she is going to restore. It is a wooden statue of Christ, a demonic Christ, perhaps already defeated by evil, or fighting against it, or perhaps foreseeing dark deeds. The face shows infinite torment. The statue dates from the 15th century. Danila is impressed by the mastery of the sculptor: the statue seems almost alive! She lives with her parents. His mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) leads a dissolute life and cares little to keep appearances. His father, Mario (Chris Avram), watches everything with disenchanted eyes. <br /> <br /> The wooden statue will soon take on a human form (Ivan Rassimov) and will possess Danila in the carnal and spiritual sense. An incredible scene! Poor Danila will now suffer the torments of hell. <br /> <br /> Danila (the lovely Stella Carnacina) has been ravished, raped, possessed by the devil and will now obey his orders and try to seduce. other. Is not she imitating her sordid mother Luisa (Lucretia Love) who feels a great pleasure when her lover whips her with a bouquet of roses? There is a scene ridiculous enough to be sublime and moving, when Stella Carnacina runs desperate in the narrow streets (possessed by the devil, do you remember?) A small Italian town that screams its heart. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. His performance is, as usual, intense. The scenes of exorcism (especially the final battle) are very, very amateurish, but it will only enhance the pleasure (and / or emotion?) If you really have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Stella Carnacina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and it is a factor that adds to your pleasure when she is naked, but I think the film could have further explored her natural beauty . Lucretia Love is a very good companion sleaze (her nudity scene with roses ... well. :) <br /> <br /> Other Italian exorcist scams I would like to recommend are: <br> /> <Malabimba (very sordid and published uncut and digitally restored) <br /> "Evil Eye" (Malocchio) - "The Exorcist" was the main source of inspiration for "Evil Eye", but other films, like, for example, "Rosemary's baby" should also be taken into account. "Bad eye" is completely above. Not so fishy but with many beautiful Italian and Spanish actresses. You will drool throughout the movie. The movie is ridiculous, the story does not make sense, but if you see it in a good mood, you might feel moved! - a diabolical sect, possession, murder, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women all around. A crazy race! <br /> <br /> If you liked "Bad Eye", see also "Ring of Darkness" (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This film can be found on the alternative market. Look for this title in the IMDb. There are good reviews about it. <br /> <br /> P.S. - "The Ossessa" has many different faces. It is exploitation, but it can also be serious and moving. It's cheap, nerdy ... ladley (but not that much) and has an underlying "moral" message. This strange beer can sometimes be very funny. We all know that "L'Ossessa" is an "Exorcist" scam, so why can not we see her on her own terms? Yes, Mario Gariazzo was trying to make quick money, but he was able to make the most of a tight budget. The story is well told, the film is atmospheric and the actors are generally attached to their roles. Watch the movie with an open mind and you can discover two or three new things.
