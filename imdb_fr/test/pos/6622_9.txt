My skateboard career ended in 1974 when my steel skateboard with steel wheels hit a rock and I collapsed for days on the sidewalk in front of my parents' house in Boston. By the time the cast left my arm, summer had already passed. <br /> <br /> But I have always admired the types of X-Games and surfers in particular. I think I spent the first month after moving to Southern California, on the beaches and the docks, watching the surfers, lamenting that I had missed my call. This is the kind of thing you should learn young, before the awful ideas of self-preservation and self-awareness disappear. Or else, at best, you'll be so worried about not hurting yourself or laughing, you'll end up watching. like a trained bear. <br /> <br /> I have always admired the fact that a good surfer seems to care about nothing, except this moment, this wave, this experience. In harmony with the forces of nature. A good surfer gives the impression that there is nothing but this wave and the way you interact with it. There is a lot of zen for me. <br /> <br /> This documentary explains how some young people have adopted the concepts of surfing and extended them to skateboarding. Ramps, downgrades, low curves while interacting with cement waves under their feet. In their day, everything was new. radical. Before the Zephyr Skate team, the idea was apparently to go as fast as possible in a straight line on a skateboard, hence my long "Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace" as a fall on the front of the road. <br /> <br /> This film is a look at time, on America, before ALL is labeled, labeled, marketed and sold as an "Extreme". (Seriously, what's more "extreme" about an "extreme meal" at Taco Bell? This apart from the fact that it is an extreme danger for your colon ...) /> <br /> Watch this movie and watch the birth of "extreme sports". Before the X-Games, before Boom-boom Huck-Jam, before Crusty Demons, before the ASA ..., there were these young street kids who created "extreme sports" without really trying. They did it only for the purity, the pure pleasure of skateboarding in the sun with friends. <br /> <br /> I hope they will receive some of the "extreme" money. God knows they do not get the credit they deserve. Maybe this movie can correct that. <br /> <br /> Excellent film with a superb soundtrack, a portrait of a Southern California, or even an America, which no longer exists. <br /> <br /> take care of Sean Penn but he does a decent job.
