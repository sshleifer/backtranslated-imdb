Surface was great, I do not know how many Mondays I survived school just thinking of the new surface episode. I liked it, sometimes I had to call home and tell my mother to record it for me. I was pretty upset when I learned that it had been canceled. I mean, I do not care as a way to let ourselves hang. So, they can have their new comedy Tina Fay (you could not pay me to watch that, I think seeing the commercials made me silly). I'm going to miss my Monday night surface plan, even though my sister made fun of me. Well, the kidnapped look good and they always have L & O: SVU (I think I have to check) (I only wrote the 2 lines above because they said that I needed ten lines).
