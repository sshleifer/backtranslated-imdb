I think John Houston's "The Dead" is a real classic. Not only was it Houston's last film, he reportedly said, "All I know about film making is in this movie." The story, inspired by James Joyce's "Dubliners", is a superb ensemble piece featuring the exceptional performances of Angelica Houston, John's daughter, and a cast of English and Irish actors who bring the world to life. history. It is a film that should be part of any serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but also because the story is timeless and very appealing. The film is not in a hurry or action packed. The story takes place rather inside the characters, which bring light and meaning to the dialogue. The end of the film is breathtaking, poetic and haunting. I highly recommend "The Dead" as one of the best movies ever made.
