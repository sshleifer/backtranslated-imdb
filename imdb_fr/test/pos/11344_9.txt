SPOILER ALERT !!! <br /> <br /> You can listen to Wong Kar-wai's films as a radio play: invisible vibrations between the characters, the pieces in which they stay, the rhythm that animates them, attract them and hate them - all the spectrum of the atmosphere is reproduced by the sound track. Most of the dialogue is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The narrative is like a childish amorous look of a beautiful woman and a sad man whose griefs are visible, but helpless. "In The Mood For Love" is said from the point of view of a child, but this one never appears as a narrator. The aesthetic of the film is based on an extreme dramaturgy in colors and light, hard cuts, an almost documentary camera and a complex and discreet sound. <br /> <br /> The great use of Nat King Cole's film "Maybe, perhaps, Maybe", whose mysterious power grows the more it is repeated and the melancholic waltz contributes to the graceful choreography of the two protagonists. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant, the perfect vis-Ã -vis the beautiful and stylish Tony Leung. The public assumes a love story between them, but Wong sees only a sad resignation. The two potential lovers turn around like satellites, knowing that they will never share the same orbit. You want them to meet again. They will not want it and the emotional power of their relationship without love-sex makes the film extremely fascinating. <br /> <br /> This is a broken chance and a tacit love. In all of Wong's films, they are leitmotives. Love, whether it comes too early or too late to take one and not the other. The burning desire of characters who are never satisfied, their loneliness, their mourning and the luck they experience when it is too late.
