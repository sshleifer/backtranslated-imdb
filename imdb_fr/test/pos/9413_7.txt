Maverick director Seijun Suzuki was finally able to film his dream project, "Princess Raccoon". Fortunately he did not try this in the 1960s. Special effects and computer graphics have certainly made this type of production easier to achieve than the old matte film technology. <br /> <br /> A certain familiarity with Japanese history and theatrical traditions will help the enjoyment of this film. A good knowledge of Shakespeare's "The Tempest" would help Peter Greenaway's "Prospero's Books" density. These two films actually have a bit in common though "Princess Raccoon" is much more colorful and easier to watch for a person without a background to fully appreciate. <br /> <br /> Although the artistic design, the game and the direction are good for most of the film, it seems to this spectator that the energy is exhausted in the last third of the film. Most of the interesting backgrounds have already been introduced and the camera seems to be taking a step back for more filmed gaming experience. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a unique cinematic experience and I recommend it to anyone interested in alternative forms of film performance. It's not really meant for children, although nothing happens that might upset them. If the last third was better, I would have given him nine stars.
