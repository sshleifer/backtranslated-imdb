The '90s were a terrific decade for the British sitcom, with many popular creations such as ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, ABSOLUTELY FABOULOUS THE MINE BLUE LINE, THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN MENBODING, arriving for the first time on screens. television. <br /> <br /> However, MR. BEAN is undoubtedly the biggest sitcom of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> MR. BEAN represents the first major attempt to return to the era of big names in silence such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. He brings to the audience a unique character - Mr. Bean - interpreted to perfection by Rowan Atkinson. <br /> <br /> Many people who commented on this page as well as the bulletin boards of this site and other sites have engaged in debates about whether Mr. Bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties resulting from such a disability. However, I think that this debate is useless, because I doubt very much that the creators of this show expect of all the spectators, for a moment, that they even consider Mr. Bean in such a context. <br /> <br /> Mr. It is shown that Bean is a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems on his own, without the help of others. Some of his methods of dealing with daily tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are discussed in a bizarre way for anyone watching the show. That's where the humor comes from. Mr. Bean is not necessarily a person with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person used to managing things in his own way. And of course, some of his methods of carrying out a single task often result in a disaster that Mr. Bean then tries to solve. <br /> <br /> Sometimes we see Mr. Bean show a medium or small line, often trying to compete with his entourage or prank those who least expect it. However, at the end of the day, no one is really hurt and the results are always reassuring. <br /> <br /> Unlike most examples of British comedy of the last 30 years, MR. BEAN is a simple, harmless and harmless U-rated entertainment that suits all members of the family. It is for this reason that the television series has become a great success in dozens of countries around the world. This is also why we will remember this in a few decades, when many other television shows would have come, gone and forgotten. <br /> <br /> Some critics say that this program only attracted children, but I laugh only. as much to Mr. Bean's antics as I did when I first saw the episodes in my childhood in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as entertaining viewing repeated only the first time. <br /> <br /> The television series gave rise to two derivative films, BEAN and M. BEAN'S VACANCES. As you would expect, the kind of humor shown in the TV series does not translate success on the big screen. Both films do little justice to the TV series and fail to capture the magic of the episodes. The biggest flaw in both films may lie in the change of scenery. In both films, the producers take Mr. Bean out of his usual British environment in America (the first film) and in France (the second). As a result, the characters in the movie surrounding Mr. Bean react differently to his behavior compared to their counterparts in the television series. Both films reuse the gags of the TV series, and the evidence shows that these gags were well done the first time. In the second film, it is shown that Mr Bean behaves in a distorted way, some aspects of his personality being exaggerated to the point that some gags seem more stupid than funny. At various times, I thought that the character I was looking at was not Mr. Bean, but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson was not having as much fun as in the TV series. His heart was just not in the performance. After the release of the second film, he publicly stated that he would no longer play Mr. Bean. I realize how he felt. <br /> <br /> Back to the television series, each episode shows the evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and performance in each scene. Even the weakest episode remains very nice and well ahead of both movies. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes are the first three - they set the high standard that was to continue. I consider the last episode to be the weakest, but nevertheless hilarious. <br /> <br /> To summarize, MR. BEAN is a really beautiful sitcom that suits the whole family. Rowan Atkinson is a true genius of comics and the 14 episodes of this TV series are the proof. My recommendation - watch and enjoy. But do not see movies unless you consider yourself a fan after watching the TV series.
