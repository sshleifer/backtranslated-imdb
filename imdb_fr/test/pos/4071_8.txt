If you've seen the trailer of this movie, you know pretty much what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. And even if you have not seen the previews, it will not take you long to understand what you're experiencing - especially, a good time and a lot of laughter - from this brilliant satire of "reality show" show and Buddy Cop, Showtime, directed by Tom Dey, starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a LAPD detective and he is gifted for what he does; but at work, one night, things turn south when another cop, Trey Sellars (Murphy), inadvertently intervenes, a television press team shows up and Mitch loses his temper, resulting in legal action on the part of the TV channel that is going to cost expensive big sub department. Except that they may be able to get around the problem, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch - enough to come up with an idea for his boss for a police show "Reality" would feature none other than Mitch Preston, whom Chase considers a real "Dirty Harry" life. <br /> <br /> His boss likes the idea and gives Chase the green light. All she has to do now is convince Mitch to participate, which should not be too difficult, since the TV station agreed to end the complaint if it makes the show. But Mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he does not want to have anything to do with it - until he has a heart to heart with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who casts a brief look about Mitch's future perspective for him. And just like that, the show is. Oh, yes, there is one more thing. for the show, Mitch is going to need a partner. And who do you think they will find for that? Let's say it: Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects. <br /> <br /> This is Dey's second film as a director, his first film being "Shanghai Noon" - also a comedy - and he clearly shows a penchant for the genre. From the beginning, he sets a pace that advances the story and allows his stars to make the most of their talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing. With stars like De Niro and Murphy, Dey, of course, had a leg up on this project, but it's him who keeps him on track, showing he knows what works, realizing the right mix of physical comedy and action, and using the intricacies of dialogue with great effect. <br /> <br /> There is no more natural actor in the company than De Niro, and he gets into Mitch's skin as if he was born. And after years of dramatic and dramatic drama (in which he performed remarkably well after another), with such films as "Analyze This", "Meet the Parents" and now this one, he firmly established his skills to do comedy, as well. Mitch is not a particularly complex character. In fact, he's sort of an "ordinary" guy, but that's the challenge for the actor - make him credible, portray him as a guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community. And in all respects, De Niro succeeds. It's Mitch, the guy you meet at the grocery store or at the bank, or say hello to your job; who likes to watch the game on television and has a life, just like you and me, who makes a living by being a cop. This is the character that Mitch must have to make this film work, because it gives credibility to the angle of the "ordinary type in extraordinary circumstances". It is one of those roles - and work - that is often wrongly rejected because it seems so easy; and, of course, that's what makes De Niro so exceptional: he makes it look easy, and he does it with ease. <br /> <br /> As Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy achieves a winning performance, Well, and it's a role that suits him like the proverbial glove. Trey is a cop, but also an aspiring actor - and a bad one - and this gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the too exuberant side of his personality (sufficiently reigned by Dey, however, to prevent him from taking flight high in the territory of Jim Carrey), which works perfectly for this character and this film. From his melodramatic interpretation at an audition to his discarding of an interlocutor - delivered by directly looking at the camera (which, according to him, is not even there) while filming the show of "reality" - Murphy is a riot. And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really slams (which is not surprising, because it is another of the many talents of De Niro, his ability to connect with and bring out the best of his stars, who - all the evidence he has support for - are better at their job after working with him, including Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken, and Ed Harris, to name a few). More importantly, it's a part that allows Murphy to excel in what he does best, and he makes the most of it. <br /> <br /> Russo also takes advantage of his role as Chase, a character who is not very difficult artistically, but it presents deliciously, with a strong and credible performance. And William Shatner (playing himself) steals absolutely some scenes as the director of the series. <br /> <br /> Secondary distribution includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday (Camera Man). Well designed and presented, "Showtime" is a comedy that is what it is supposed to be: pure entertainment that provides a lot of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will make you laugh for a while. It's the magic of cinema. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
