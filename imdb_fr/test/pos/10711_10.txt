I love this movie and I've programmed my TV to record when it comes back on November 2nd. It's a very beautiful love story with a twist. The song that is played at the end of the film is a song that you think would not be very successful, but it's a song that stays in your head and I'm trying to find that song for myself now can hear and play it. I really do not have any style of shows that I see or songs that I like to hear and that makes me open enough to see things new with an open mind. I would like to say that some parts of this film are not meant for the whole family. This film shows the skin. It's a bit like a movie for life for women, for women. I say to watch the movie and you can love it as much as me.
