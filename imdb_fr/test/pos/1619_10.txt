It's a monster low-budget stop motion film from Brett (A nymphoid barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper ... and it's exactly what I expected from such a production: a light (albeit nerdy) dialogue , cute actresses and a lot of stop motion critters. That's why I gave the film 10 out of 10 - because it gives what I expected from it ... and a little more: Brett does not pinch for anything when it comes to putting his creatures on the screen. He throws a lot of insects to his casting for the final. And, anyway, I LOVE stop motion monsters that, compared to CGI creatures in big budget movies, just seem so fun to watch.
