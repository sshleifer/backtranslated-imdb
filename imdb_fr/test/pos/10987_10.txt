The manna of heaven is heavenly. It's a movie for the family - teenagers and grandparents can enjoy it together. But it's not syrupy or stupid. The characters are really "characters". The plot is a bit complex and you have to pay attention, but it's like putting a puzzle, because everything is set up little by little. The beginning of the period is like looking at an old photo album or remembering when. It is extremely well done with very precise hairstyles and costumes. The story evolves quickly with twists, turns and lots of fun. <br /> <br /> A treat is to watch the large distribution of familiar faces, many of which have not been seen for a very long time. Part of the fun is to recognize them and name them mentally at the onset, though it may be distracting. At the end of the film, Cloris Leachman looks like he has been revamped on "Oprah". I had never seen Faye Grant in a movie - I only knew her as Grace's mother in the television series "Saving Grace". She was great, even without the southern accent. And I did not even recognize Shelly Duvall. The five sisters who created this beautiful film form a very talented quintet and Sister Theresa is a heavenly treasure.
