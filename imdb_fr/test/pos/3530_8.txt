On September 29, 1990, I marked a turning point in my appreciation of horror movies. It was on this date that BBC1 aired (for the only time I know) the shocking wonder of Jeff Lieberman in 1981, Just Before Dawn, and it made a huge impression on me. Nearly twenty years later, I am delighted to announce that I finally got hold of the two-disc special edition Shriek Show / Media Blasters. It's as disturbing and disturbing as I can remember, if not more. <The plot, as it is customary for genre films (and it was Lieberman's first film as a "director for rent", although he at least removed from the screenplay all the cult religious mumbo-jumbo snake manipulation), is a little thin - five friendly young people over twenty (including Chris Lemmon, son of Jack, in a pair of extremely tight white steps) venture into the dense forests of the Oregon to go camping and discover a piece of land that was bequeathed to one of their own. But just before, Dawn stands out from the crowd of imitators, because Lieberman was quick to show us how overwhelming the situation is on this part of the mountain, with an innocent skewer and a drunken preacher's truck pushed on a hill and engulfed by the minute flames of the beginning of the film. Young people arrive in Winnebago's image, Blondie's "Heart of Glass" pounding the soundtrack, and before you can say "Texas Chainsaw Massacre!" they crushed an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first aggro taste of the beefy maniac responsible for the initial disasters. Ranger Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that things are probably going badly if they go further, but they still continue the journey, refusing to drive the raging preacher although he is naturally scared to finally camp from all over. Needless to say, things are getting out of here. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not lack bloody horrors and well-managed action scenes, the highlights for me are those where Lieberman lets his camera zoom out, Slow, clich√©s seemingly innocuous of fun kids playing in nature, or just letting him settle for a moment in the dense, awesome, dwarf woods. It makes the Oregon outskirts as threatening and disturbing as Kubrick has created the spacious interiors of the Overlook Hotel in the Shining, and Brad Fiedel's score (by concealing the horribly distorted racket that runs on the titles) remains the side right of the intrusive, highlighting the growing threat with subtlety and talent. Throughout your journey, many surprises await you: Deliverance discovers a daughter of Backwoods and her troubling and disturbing family, as well as a really strange destruction technique deployed shortly before the end of the film. I will not spoil it for you. I have said enough. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to determine with certainty why this undervalued horror gem fell in the gold and became a cult object instead of an escaped success, but we hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years. Come on - it's worth it.
