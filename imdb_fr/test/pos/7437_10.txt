I can not believe how good this movie is. Great CG graphics, a good storyline, and fighting, oh fights !!! This movie was great !! Characters. They look real enough to be considered real. They really look like those of the game to perfection. The scene in which ... well all the scenes dropped my jaw. Fantastic 10/10 graphics The story. Perfectly explained. In addition, Aeris helps Cloud at different times in the film. They explain it very well and make your jaw fall from perfection. But repetitive fights take away a story, but it's only a minor thing. History 9.5 / 10 Everything else, great. The movie was just amazing. I really do not know what else to say except that this film was almost perfect. I LIKED IT!!!
