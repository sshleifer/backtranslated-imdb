Hilarious, clean, light and worthy of quote. What more can you ask for in a movie? This is my favorite movie of all time, number one. Since I was a little girl, I dream of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble. <br /> <br /> The snapshot characters in ridiculous situations are what makes this movie so much fun. The wonderful comic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) makes up most of my favorite parts of the film. And who did not like Flynch's desperate clumsiness? Do not forget the antics of Leon's friends at the airport, dressed in Hari Krishnas: dancing, singing and playing the tambourine - unbeatable! The clues are great, the places are classic and the plot is timeless. <br /> <br /> A word to say it wise, if you do not watch this movie when you were little, it probably will not win a place in your heart today. But nevertheless, give yourself a chance, you may find that "No matter what you say, no matter what you do, you must play."
