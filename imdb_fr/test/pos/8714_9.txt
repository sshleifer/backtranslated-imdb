Bridgette Bardot, still sexy, plays the spoiled but innocent daughter of an ambassador from France. She forced one of her father's best collaborators (martial artist MICHEL) to marry her and this turned out to be the best thing for both of them. Michel soon flirts with his old friends and to teach him a lesson, Bridgette flirts a lot with a married PRINCE CHARLES. Michel is surprised by his jealousy. A game of cat and mouse ensues between Brigdette and Michel ("I'm going to have an adventure" ... "No, you will not do it ... ...) and finally Michel realizes that she could and would abandon all the other ladies in his life Bridgette and Michel settle comfortably in their country where Prince Charles returns home to England. <br /> <br /> It is a piece certainly light but incredibly charming. some think it's a product of its time, I found it completely enjoyable and worthy of a rental.
