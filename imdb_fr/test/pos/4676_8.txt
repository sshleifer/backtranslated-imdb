One of the benefits of my work is that when the situation is slow, I can watch the movie in our downstairs room (I work in a small two-screen movie theater) in the tear room while watching the booth of the concession. I have seen the Italian job probably twenty times and I am still not tired. The atmosphere makes me think of Ocean's Eleven, although the acting is not as good. Mark Wahlberg is fine, Charlize Theron likes the guys, but Seth Green is AWESOME in this movie. I thought Edward Norton was doing a very good job playing badly, although many people do not agree. I also appreciated Mos Def as an explosives expert scared by dogs. I highly recommend this movie and will continue to watch it whenever I can!
