I am a Petty Officer First Class (E-6), a member of the USCG for 6 years and who feels that this film is a strong representation of the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were very much in demand. The most unrealistic was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) descended inside the sinking ship to take the captain out of the engine room ... that would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to enter a ship, regardless of the circumstances. Secondly, the command center (supposed to be in Kodiak), it looked more like a NASA command center ... we do not have equipment as sophisticated as this one. Third, Airstation's captain would not handle search and rescue cases with a number of people equal to 10. In reality, it would be an E-6 or an E-7 as as a SAR controller and perhaps 2 other support personnel, such as an assistance SAR controller and a radio observer. Otherwise, the film was dead, I think they should have incorporated more tariffs into the CG and their roles in search and rescue instead of just aviation-based fares. Some scenes from school "A" reminded me of my days and their idiotic stuff and caused me trouble in my youth.
