I never remember reading Sarah, Plain and Tall at school, but when my son told me about it and said that they watched the movie in class, I wanted to see it too. I borrowed the video from the library and watched it with my family. It was a wonderful story. However, I did not know until a few months ago that there were sequels. I have finished watching these this week. I discovered a little oops: in the second film, Skylark, Jacob remembers his childhood and tells Sarah "my brothers and sisters and I, we would dream ...". In Winter's End, these "brothers and sisters" do not exist in the conversations between Jacob and his father. But it's a very small oops, and I caught him just watching the trilogy the second time. Excellent movie, to see absolutely for a good family.
