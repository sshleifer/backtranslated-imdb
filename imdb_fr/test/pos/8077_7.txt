Then forgive the game scene * really * lame, the cardboard background and the studio like a stadium. For this part, I should have given the movie 5 instead of 7, but keep reading ... <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the plot, there are a lot of similarities with "The Replacements ". Some say that this film tears "The Replacements", while others say that this script has written before. <br /> <br /> Both films require a kind of "suspension of disbelief on the basic principle", which is particularly difficult for "Second String", which has an NFL license team and all the antecedents that underlie it. It seems too lame for some people, and not to mention it in "Second String", Bills has to overcome big scores again and again, with the limited budget to turn the gaming scene, that makes it look even worse. <br /> <br /> In "Replacements", the premise and the league are fictitious but you know it happens in real life. I think it's easier to accept a fictional story and relate it to a real event ("Oh yeah, that happens before!", Rather than real scenario / context with fictional scenario ("He does not It's not possible for Bill to win a Super Bowl! "Some scenes were shot in Raven's pre-season games, a real stadium and real spectators, as well as different shooting angles. > But let's say that the two movies were released the same day and that we delete the budget factor (so ive the game play action scene): Overall, I like "Second String" to "Replacements", not much, but I like it better. <br /> <br /> The development of his characters is "relatively better" In "Replacements", the character of Keanu is too "out of sync with the world", and all that Interested, maybe it's a girl In Second String, you see the fight the QB is doing to recover n work and you look after his past with his coach. Or the problem of the fumble guy. This solution of "holding the ball all day" is of course not new, but we are seeing progress in solving the problem. <br /> <br /> And what about these tips? I think it's "relatively realistic" as "Replacements". The "Dan Marino" looks like a fake knee, flea, mowing wild cat, all the real ones, except that sometimes it looks a little too easy. But for me, it's better than the center-catcher of "Replacement" and attack for 50 yards, or that placing a field placement at 60 yards seems too easy. OH BTW, I'm glad they did not force the kicker TE to shoot. <br /> <br /> Of course - if you look objectively at this movie above all the other movies on football, it could easily be a 5 out of 10 film. But some say it's the worst football movie? Try "The Comebacks".
