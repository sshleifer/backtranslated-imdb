Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: These are the two couples whose lives of addiction, crime and misery are brilliantly portrayed in this raw, honest HBO documentary. They are petulant, charming, repulsive, surprisingly stupid and devoted: to drugs and to each other. They are also very different from each other: Matt is a working-class boy who is clearly fond of his wickedness, while the abandonment of pre-school preparation supports the couple with the money of Western Union handed over to his father, who makes a surprisingly nice cameo towards the end of the film. . Meanwhile, widow Michelle (whose husband died as a result of an OD) earns her daily bread by pretending to be an NYPD vice-policeman, willing to make her future John accept a bargain to avoid her prison sentence. You will be drawn into their stories and want the film to last twice as long. Unlike most documentaries of this type, no coda gives us an update on their progress (Matt and Tracy can they really keep this apartment in Brooklyn?) Michelle will return to Bellevue for more detoxification? Will Sebastian become more pathetic?). As a result, the film seems incomplete, but that may have been the goal. An essential viewing, as long as you are not completely opposed to the scenes of people being filmed.
