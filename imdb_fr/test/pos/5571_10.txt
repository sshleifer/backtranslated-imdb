I admit that the first time I managed to catch Sci-Fi's "Sci-Fi Prime" was last week, but despite being a big fan of Sliders, Farscape is now my favorite among the four shows. <br /> <br /> Unlike most modern Sci-Fi series (including, unfortunately, the two new Star Trek series), this series manages to be fun without presenting itself as a food for MST3K.
