Yes!!!! Fassbinder and Ballhaus are at the peak of their art in 1973! It's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a much better movie than THE MATRIX (1999), at least it was 200 times cheaper! Very nice camera work by Michael Ballhaus and the wonderful "Albatross" of Fleetwood Mac at the end. Fassbinder creates a moody mood for the entire movie. It's a shame that this movie was never released on DVD. But now, after 37 years, they have finally come to the conclusion that this TV movie is not only one of Fassbinder's best films (though there are many better Fassbinder movies), made without much money . Buy it!! Look at this !!
