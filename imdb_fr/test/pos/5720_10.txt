After seeing this routine of John Leguizamo, I finally realize why he is such a talent. I enjoy working on stage, and it's the stage work at its best. I can not say it's a stand-up routine, because Leguizamo is so intense when he plays different characters. The only time he breaks the character is when it is necessary for him to complete his role in which he is so cold that you can not help but appreciate his talents. I was not really sure what I felt for him as an actor, but Freak reinforced my appreciation of him. For those who have not had the opportunity to see this show, I feel it for you. Certainly check. This is one of the nest routines I have ever seen. Grades with Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars and more.
