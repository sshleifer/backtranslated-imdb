Renee Zellweger is a housewife in Kansas whose dominant husband is involved in drug trafficking. Morgan Freeman and his son, Chris Rock, murder the husband in his dining room. Zellweger, whom the assassins do not observe, witnesses it and undergoes a dissociative reaction by assuming the personality of a nurse - the eponymous Betty - who is a character of his favorite soap opera. Believing herself to be the character of the television, Zellweger takes off in her husband's car, which has a load of dope in the trunk, and goes to Los Angeles where she hopes to join another character in this crazy drama of the afternoon. noon, "Dr. David Ravell", Greg Kinnear. Not realizing she is pursued by the two successful men, she goes to Los Angeles where she manages to connect to Kinnear and is actually registered in the series as a nurse named Betty. A handful of knowledgeable men, including the local sheriff, understand what is happening and are also looking for Zellweger in Los Angeles. The end is credible and poignant. <br /> <br /> If it sounds crazy, it's because it's true. And that's the responsibility of the author, John C. Richards. What is curious is that Richards and the director, Neil Labute, with the considerable help of the performers, succeed just about everything. This is not a plot that has been molded into a familiar mold. Nope. I give him bonus points for his pure originality. Someone came out on a branch. Someone tried a movie that was NOT a copy or a remake of something that brought in money ten or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved, kneeling every night, praying fervently. I do not know if the film was profitable, but it is especially successful on the aesthetic level. <br /> <br /> This is what could be called an "initial project" film. You start with a single transformative event, in this case the murder of Zellweger's husband and his adoption of a truly new personality, and follow the logical paths that result in a realistic way. The "Groundhog Day" is another example, better and more complicated. "Nurse Betty" has her logical cracks, where incidents give up their plausibility. For example, at a party in Los Angeles, Zellweger finally meets Kinnear, the guy who plays his ex-fiancé on TV. She is stunned (because after all, she thinks she's Betty, who has lost her fiancé for a long time). She approaches Kinnear and some colleagues and introduces herself as "Nurse Betty," the character. She addresses Kinnear under the name of her television character, "David Ravell". The group is at first puzzled, then convince themselves that she is an aspiring actress who insists on staying "in the character" during the conversation - and after, too, after Kinnear has become fascinated by her and the others who are are bored. Kinnear takes her home and even when she kisses him, she's still in the picture, leaving Kinnear staring in amazement at how she captures Betty's character. The next appointment, Kinnear makes his love. This development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at this point, is a crack in logic, the missing kind of "Groundhog Day". At the end of Night One, Kinnear, like any other person, will understand that Zellweger is just a few circus clowns. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, which includes many digressions, succeeds beyond all expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his nihilist and insolent son is wonderfully described. Morgan is flawless in his exasperation. He manages to fall in love with Zellweger's image as he discovers clues about his whereabouts and activities, but in the end he can not bring himself to shoot at him. She is too nice to shoot. After transforming into Betty, she left a note in Kansas. "I want to help all life, be it animal, vegetable or mineral." Who could hurt the author of such a connative statement? Her admiration for her comes as an epiphany, as he stands near one of the spotlights at the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed in Dorothy, or maybe the Good Eastern Witch - well, characters who, like Zellweger, are from Kansas anyway - appear to Freeman. He kisses her and kisses her tenderly. It's a scene that's both strange, romantic and a bit scary. One day, in front of one of these lights, I threw shredded paper into the updo of the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand swirling bats that had misunderstood the floating shreds like moths. <br /> <br /> Good. Where was I? Okay. I was trying not to run out of space. Zellweger's performance deserves applause. Everything she does, every movement, every utterance, is naive and timid. It's really a nice character - and that's despite the fact that she's not a glamorous girl compared to Hollywood. But what an actress. Compare his performances as a brilliant 19th century in "Cold Mountain". Completely the opposite. But then, everyone is ready to take their place in this nice movie. Allyson Jannings does a great job in a minor role. Watch her when she tells Greg Kinnear that she plans to kill her character in the soap opera in a drowning accident. Kinnear is one of those narcissists who wears the kind of $ 10,000 black leather jackets that were popular at the time. He laughs and says, "Oh, one of those shipwrecked contracts, okay, how do I get back?" Jannings does not answer. She just smiles at him with those huge blue eyes and nods mockingly. <br /> <br /> Not a filming masterpiece but a good original and professional work from all concerned.
