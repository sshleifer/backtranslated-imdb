The critics and the public have almost all failed in this film, but I did not think it was too serious! Even critics with whom I normally agree have thought it was shit, and I normally despise the "horror movies" of PG-13. So that means one of two things: either (1) I'm too easily satisfied and my taste in movies has decreased over the years, or (2) "When a stranger calls" is not as horrible as it is claimed to be. Now, to be fair, some of the critics of the movie are true - there is not a lot of character development, and there is not much going on in history. But, living men, what did you expect from a movie about a hunted babysitter? Cut them a little! As a former babysitter watching this movie late at night with the lights off, I can safely say that the stalking guy was a scary mofo! Who knows? I guess stuff like this just gives me willies. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit that I had fun watching this, and I do not care about the size of the minority that puts me in it.
