I watched this series on PBS in the eighties and I always watch old tapes every two or three years. Very atmospheric and scary sometimes. This is a very good show because the characters are all well defined and played. You are drawn into the plot and come to treat these people. The wicked are almost perverse, especially the sheriff of Nottingham. Dude, I'd love to beat this little bastard. Nicholas Grace is doing a great job and must have had a good time as sheriff. His guy, Sir Guy, is as silly as it is pathetic. Many murders and chaos in this series, with tons of black magic and devil veneration and things like that. I noticed that he received a prize for children's television, which is surprising. If I had children, I would not let them watch that. Exceptional use of the venues of this show as well. It's now on DVD, so buy it.
