I like Dylan Moran for his work in Black Books, although I found that some of his speeches were really lenient in terms of long, confused gaps ... but I was intrigued to see this film starring Michael Caine and him. best of me. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. <br /> <br /> Dylan's vocal range and the characterization of the different people he portrayed in the movie were absolutely perfect, something that went beyond the skills of a simple actor and really tied with alec guinness, john wounded and the other big ones: he was really good at his interpretation. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine was a very convincing prima donna and the classic British movie The device of having an early child on hand to be too wise and thirsty - the only aspect I did not really like was the incredible plot of chemistry between Dolores and the hard cockney gangsta man played by Dylan. <br /> Apart from that, it was great. <br /> <br /> I also like the ends without derogations where it was finally happy, but with MC beaten. OK, your goolies and your soldiers are not fired on (that's what a real crime leader would do if you removed Â£ 50k from them), but it showed at least a small part of the reality in the story . <BR/> <br /> I liked the movie, and I would recommend it to everyone - but I would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes, because the movie started a little slowly. If you stick, everything will come back. <br /> <br /> And as for swearing, they are in Ireland. It would not be real otherwise.
