I was flipping through the chains and I had to stop laughing when I came across this movie. In the early 80s, I spoke so clearly of teenagers that I called my mother: "Hahaha, turn to channel this or that person, the kid looks totally like a daddy if." Yeah. It turns out that this movie is about my father and his friends. <br /> <br /> Even if it's not based on my father's childhood, I'd say watch this movie! <br /> <br /> It's odd, the apathy that prevails among teenagers, even at the time. It is a good "human interest" that highlights some strange aspects of the psyche.
