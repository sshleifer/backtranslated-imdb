Richard Schickel's 1991 documentary about Gary Cooper - "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" gives us a glimpse of the American superstar through his films and his life. Narrated by Clint Eastwood, the theme is definitely "Gary Coooper, American", as it presents us with quick excerpts from his many appearances in westerns, and scenes from "Meet John Doe," "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," and "Sgt York." The best part of the documentary consists of Cooper's and his family's movies, as well as his childhood photos, showing him as a gorgeous blond boy with a radiant smile that would give him all his life. There is also a hilarious clip of Cooper in "The Jack Benny Show" making the return on the "Bird Dog" number - and Benny loses it. This documentary also briefly introduces us to his tumultuous relationship with Patricia Neal, who almost ruined their lives. <br /> There is some missing cohesion in this bio / retrospective - it jumps a lot and shows no interview Cooper footage, which would have added a lot. In addition, Clint Eastwood's narration has been described as unobtrusive. boring and monotonous. Since Cooper himself tended to be the loud and silent type on the screen, we could have used a little animation. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Gary Cooper is one of the most beautiful men lived - there were glances in his early films, not enough for this fan. That smile, those lips, that bone structure - he's been handsome all his life, but in movies like "Morocco" and "Desire," he's devastating. Instead of attending a scene of one of his worst performances, like Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead", delivering a speech he confessed to the author, he did not understand - a young and suave Cooper in a tuxedo would have been a nice touch. . This documentary, alas, was definitely produced by a man.
