He reaches the spirits and feelings of all leading them to the bottom of the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and sound layers and edgy score. The landscape develops its own personality, in parallel with the inner geography of the three characters as their stories unfold. The absolute emptiness of lost love, the fear of the unknown, then the transcendence of emptiness by the very opening of this desolation. Three lost souls struggling to find something absolute and positive in all this negative space. The drama is convincing. James Franco and his co-stars offer skillful performances. Na√Øve schoolboy, suicidal blonde, bitter car thief - everything converges with unexpected twists. Together, they create an explosive portrait of fractured love - a portrait that involuntarily conspires to repair some of the worst forms of adversity and illusion - the blindness of human emotion.
