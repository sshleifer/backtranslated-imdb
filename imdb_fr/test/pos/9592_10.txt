For those who are interested, I managed to get this on DVD at Ebay (I have not received it yet - no day now). <br /> <br /> I was desperate to get it, even if it was a quality VHS put on a DVD does not bother me. So, if you are interested, contact me and I may be able to help you. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it's ridiculous to have to wait almost 7 years before seeing it again, but it will be worth it. he. <br /> <br /> All my colleagues at work are desperate to see him too. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I will post later about quality. <br /> <br /> Just do a search on Ebay if you want it guys. it's here to buy
