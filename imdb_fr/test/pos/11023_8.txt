Wow! I recently noticed him at the IFC after watching But Im A Cheerleader. I had never heard of this movie, but the description seemed interesting. I went there with few expectations and now I have to say it's one of the best love stories of all time in a movie. Robin Tunney does a great job in describing a person with turrets. The relationship between the two and the minutest details of the film are so precise and credible. I usually hate love movies and romance, but this movie really touched me. I therefore recommend this film to anyone with a vision capability.
