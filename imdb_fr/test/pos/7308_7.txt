Norma had spent most of the twenties playing great recipes, but her first talkie featured her as a scarlet showgirl in "Mary Dugan's Trial" and she was doing brilliantly. From then on, her soft, adorable resources were put aside and she grilled in passages that call her a sophisticated woman of the world or a girl of society in search of thrills. "Let Us Be Gay" was created before but was published after "The Divorced". It was an unusual twist in the drama series that Shearer created. <br /> <br /> Norma appears for the first time without makeup like a tiny cat. Brown, whose main purpose in life is to please her very ungrateful husband, Bob (Rod La Rocque). She rushes to play golf - but in reality, he goes to see his mistress. When Helen, the mistress, comes to the house for a confrontation, Kitty copes with the situation civilly but behind closed doors she is a mass of emotions and Bob leaves for good. <br /> <br /> Three years later, Mrs. Courtland Brown (Kitty) comes to stay as a guest of the eccentric Mrs. Bouccicoult ("Bouccy") (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now a knockout and "Bouccy" has a job for her. She wants Kitty to make love to a guest from home, who in turn makes love to her granddaughter Diane (the beautiful Sally Eilers). Shock!! Horror!! - The man is none other than Bob, his ex-husband !!! Kitty takes the meeting with sophistication and spiritual resolution - "there seems to be something strange about this man" !!! - and no one is wiser. <br /> <br /> The film then installs in one of these first comedies very "talkie", boring "salon". Kitty casts a spell on all men and Bob is desperate to start again. Women all have strong roles in this film - men are just puppets. Raymond Hackett seems to be in the film as an extra butler - "give me a cushion", "go get me a drink", "move this chair" instead of Diane's harassed fianc√©. Norma Shearer is of course the whole show, Marie Dressler adds "Bouccy" to her list of eccentric portraits and Sally Eilers is a real nugget like the beautiful Diane.
