This film of what I remember was such a good movie! I watched it on television when I was 11 and I could not remember the title anymore. If I remember correctly, I thought it was a special Christmas TV. One of my friends at work and I was talking about it several years ago, but none of us remembers the title. But we remembered almost all the film. Nobody at work remembered having ever seen it! Thank goodness someone on a TV movie website responded to my message! Now I have the pleasure of locating a copy! It's amazing what you remember when you were a kid, but this film definitely stays in my head ... even after 28 years. And I think I have only looked at it once. It may be because I am the oldest sister in my family, or perhaps because I care and work in child care, that it has lasted so long. Regardless of the real reason, it remained one of the movies I really wanted to watch lately !!! If anyone knows where to look online or has a copy, please let me know. I would love to see him again !! Thank you so much! Seriously, I tried to post this and it says that my comment is not long enough. So, apparently, I have to type more, did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is the sister of Peter Billingsley who played in A Christmas Story? I know I'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea where to find it, I'd appreciate it a lot.
