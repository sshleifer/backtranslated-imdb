Better than he has any right to be, this film died of a quick and painful death at the American box office. Sometimes sophomoric, sometimes satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde are almost always the perfect reflection of time, loaded with drugs and sexual humor, reminding at one point or another all that comes from Woody Allen: "Everything You Always wanted to know about sex "at Mel Brooks from" The Producers ", Saturday Night Live at Monty Python, Carlin at Cheech and Chong. Look, listen carefully, because some of the jokes go by very quickly, and remember a time when the comedy was offensive and hilarious.
