It's a good movie to watch, since it is so beautifully directed by Andrzej Wajda but at the same time, I wish the film had more depth, in terms of history. It is a historically relevant film about the last days of the French Revolution, but the film forgets to focus on the motivations of the character, which makes it a bit too superficial for such a film to be brilliant and relevant. . <br /> <br /> In a way, the film is not less pleasant to watch. It is made with passion and attention to detail. All aspects of the film are beautiful, such as sets, costumes and camera work. <br /> <br /> The story is still so powerful, although it could have been so much better and more powerful with just a little more character development and insightful historical information. If you know perfectly the French Revolution and the stories of Danton and Robespierre in particular, this film will be perfect to watch. <br /> <br /> It is rather typical of a French film. a slow and subtle story, without ever going into too much detail. It often works with charm but in this case, the film could have been done with a little more depth. Apart from that, this film is still a fine example of French cinema, even if it is directed by a Polish director and features many Polish actors. <br /> <br /> GÃ©rard Depardieu is a great actor. his role, although the film also decides to focus a lot on many other characters. The movie may have a bit too many characters, but each performance is excellent, so it does not really become a big complaint, except that it slows down the story a bit at times. <br /> <An excellent film that could have been great. <br /> <br /> 8/10
