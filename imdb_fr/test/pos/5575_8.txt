I remember ignoring the TV show on its first appearance because of its "look" with Jim Hensen's muppets. However, recently, a friend let me borrow his Farscape DVDs and I just realized how terrible this mistake was. <br /> <br /> As in any television series, there are episodes that shine and others do not. I surf on adrenaline and emotional rush during big episodes and I suffer through those who are without brilliance. However, I still persist because of the basic scenario that connects all episodes. What I'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. Let me warn you, it's something that is absolutely irresistible to watch. I can not remember any other television series (Babylon 5, Buffy, Angel, etc.) that cleverly and cleverly concocted such a heartbreaking (sometimes) and suspenseful journey. <br /> <br /> I think that at the end of the fourth season, things finally became very concentrated and I am shocked by the decision to cancel the series. I look forward to the release of the mini-series and invite others to discover this incredible jewel.
