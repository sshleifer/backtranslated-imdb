This film might sound a bit boring for some people, but I find this film very interesting in terms of trying to reveal a tradition. <br /> <br /> The director, Lim, has made two films about traditional music in Korea before this film. The film before this one showed the music throughout the film, and this film tries to achieve similar things by having backgrounds in the film similar to those of a painting. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that the story is written by the director and a philosopher, Kim, who is a well-known scholar in Korea (holds many diplomas - including that of doctor in Havard), I do not say that educated people make better movies but that philosopher is an expert of traditional culture in Korea, so that gives more credit to this film.
