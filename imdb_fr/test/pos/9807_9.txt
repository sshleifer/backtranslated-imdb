You understood well! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend throughout the movie, even at the beginning of his trip to California. His mother knew Bobby and did not discourage Mike from relying on Bobby because imaginary friends were common among young children. <br /> <br /> That's why they both had a stomach ache at the same time. That's why the boys were so close. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mike let Bobby go. The "king" has been arrested. Mike could continue without Bobby. This is also why Mike's mother did not seem bothered when Mike received the postcard (which Mike had written and mailed) from the Bobby the Ol 'West tourist stop and other maps. from all over the world. You noticed that Mike's mother returned the first card and examined the postmark. What a wonderful mother who does her best in the late sixties. <br /> <br /> A 9 out of 10 for me. Memories ...
