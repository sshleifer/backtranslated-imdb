Am I the only person to believe that this American version is much better than the 1934 English film? The English version has no suspense, seems antique, his budget is very low and his acting is exceptional (except for Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, in addition to having the best production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect "innocent" American abroad and gives Doris Day his best role ever. The music is particularly remarkable - the music of the American film is almost classic; Compare the sequences of the "Albert Hall" and you will agree that the music of Bernard Herrmann is much more exciting than the original version (even if it is basically the same music!). The only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous meeting of taxidermy. I would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the English version is better.
