As a mini-adventure series, it's about as good as that. I watched it when it was initially shown on HBO. Sigrid is totally credible in its role as Philadelphia, and all the production was top quality! See every 400 minutes if you can. I highly recommend this mini-series. Unbelievable that I can not rate it officially, but for you readers / users, I will let you know that it is a solid 10!
