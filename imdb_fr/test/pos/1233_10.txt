hello to all Denver fans! <br /> <br /> I totally agree with you! This show was so cool and cute, I watched it as a kid in the late '80s. Among the Denverers, there are other favorites, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I'm now 24 years old, but it's still one of my favorite series and my favorite 80's design. It brings back all the memories. The theme was great too, I get goose bumps every time I hear it. It is unfortunate that it has lasted so little time, but it remains a favorite. It's great that I'm not alone and that there are people who loved him too. This is one of the cartoons I will keep for future generations. <br /> <br /> Viva Denver! :)
