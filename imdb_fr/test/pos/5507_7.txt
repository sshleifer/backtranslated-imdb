This quirky horror movie seems to receive only bad reviews. My question is; Why? I think this film is very good. Dee Snider played very well for his first (and only) achievement. He also plays the antagonist, Captain Howdy (Carelton Hendriks). This film seems to have a vision of the future. Although it was released in 1998, it seems to be modern problems. Internet predators seem to be the underlying plot here. Although pushed to another level, it is a problem that we are still facing today. I admit, the story has fallen a few times, but it's not a bad movie at all. Robert Englund is even in this film, it automatically makes it better. The acting was not bad, the characters were also very good. Hendriks was a very good antagonist, I think. I give this horror off a 7/10. Recommend for fans of Saw.
