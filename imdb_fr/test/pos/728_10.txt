I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years ago in high school. I thought it was a thought-provoking film that made you want to look at the power behind riddles. I think people who would not like this movie would be the ones who do not like to solve the problems or the ones who are frustrated when they can not solve the puzzles. it's a good movie, based on a true story that happened in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario. So, if you want a true story of what's happening in the aisles, watch this movie. And for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws, realize that in real life these same things happen. but that's all I want to say about it. The riddles are good, some hard, others not. But the film also lets you want more, more puzzles, more explanations, just more. I would like to add something more, is that the ideas of this film, the mysterious world of riddles, exist, but there is much more than that. To find it, you can not find it. Never looking for it would not be a way to find it. Leave your mark, and he will find you.
