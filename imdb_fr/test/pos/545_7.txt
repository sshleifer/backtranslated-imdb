I thought Anywhere But Here was a good movie. It featured two wonderful actresses, Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, that when I heard that they were part of a movie, I resist watching it. It was a rather nice movie. There was where I felt as if they were trying hard, and there was also some really exaggerated and worn out material, but there was nothing in the movie that I absolutely hate. I even liked the way they used the film's pop-up performance. Thora Birch, uncredited, and all the little moments of happiness / sadness are touching and effective.If you want to watch this movie, go for it, because even if I do not recommend it, it's not something you should avoid, and a rating of 5.9 seems unfair in my opinion.
