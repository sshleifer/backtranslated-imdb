Sensational. I have never seen or heard of this movie. He just came on TV (2:00 am) and I am completely amazed. Setting up: a group of fat and rich cats play golf. You hit a ball in the rough. He arrives by a NINJA !!!! A man in a tuxedo approaches to pick up the ball. The ninja catches him. Crushes him in his hand. The man pulls the pistol. Ninja pulls a blowgun. Ninja blows an arrow in the barrel. GUN EXPLODES !!!! This is just the beginning of greatness, people. Everyone must see this movie. 10 big stars of confidence.
