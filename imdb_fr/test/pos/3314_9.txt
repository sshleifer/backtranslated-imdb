Growing up in the age of typing pool and facing office politics and men who were inclined to turn a banquet of beauties into a delicious day-to-day meal, this film strikes perfectly. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this film to play against the gorgeous GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to participate and I think it worked well and resisted over time. Best kiss on screen between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd. <br /> <br /> It may not seem plausible, but in reality it was and is probably still given the fear of sexual harassment. I thought the movie was well composed, except for the terrible role of Evans. What a ball of fat, but he found his niche elsewhere. Other than that, everyone was up to it.
