I grew up outside Naila Germany (where they landed), every detail of the movie was authentic, the power lines they flew over, the prying neighbors, the grandmother telling the kids that they could not watch the movie. West German television, etc. This film brings many good memories to Europeans, a great Disney production ... The same film in German Klaus Lowitsch and Gunter Meisner using their own voices to translate the English version into German ... for La German version also uses Cookoo birds, a bird from Germany serving as background noise to let you know that you are in Germany..I have shown this move to many of my German parents and they really liked this movie. made a prototype balloon that they had to give up because the materials used were too porous and 2 other balloons they used for the leak. The problem of the burner was solved by flipping the propane bottles.)
