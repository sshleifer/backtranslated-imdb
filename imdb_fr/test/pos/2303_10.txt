Empire of Passion begins misleading - if you immediately expect it to be a horror movie. Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), a father of two, is a devoted wife and hard-working rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he is not there and is at home with the baby, the timid and aimless young Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes to bring treats to Seki ... and a little extra. They'll be sleeping together soon, but after he does something (let's just say a "shave"), he knows he'll know it and he'll immediately propose killing Gisaburo. They drink it, strangle it and throw it into a well. Of course, it will come back to haunt them - but literally, at least for them (first, Seki super terrified and then only skeptical, Toyoji), turns into "Kaidan", a Japanese ghost story. <BR/> <br /> It's a movie where the horror does not just come from "oh, ghost, ah", but from the total fear created by the characters. In a way, the mechanics of a film noir is at work, if only vaguely translated by a Japanese village of the nineteenth century, as opposed to a city or a small American city (the police snooping, the "evidence" found perhaps by another word circulating, suspicions aroused, etc.). This is convincing because Seiko was actually against the plan from the beginning, manipulated by Toyoji, lecherous but poorly prepared, and his reactions to Gisaburo's reappearance seemed staggering. Take the one that comes closest to poetry: Gisaburo's ghost, his pale blue face and his mostly silent and icy gaze, signal to Seiko to ride on the rickshaw. She does so reluctantly, and he pushes her down a road she does not know, just before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories wish the sky to become as atmospheric as it is painful. <br /> <br /> Even as he begins to sink into hordes, there is so much that director Oshima manages to make this film a distinctive piece. After having hit him immensely in the world of international cinema with In the Realm of Senses (which, paradoxically, was banned in his country), he realized something that, he says, was even more daring than "Senses" . Perhaps he was right; Empire of Passion has far less graphic sexual content than its predecessor (also featuring Tatsuya Fuji, an actor both physical and beautiful, with immense reach), but his daring lies in the creation of a world creepy. You can believe in the ghosts in this story, but you must also know how much these two lovebirds will go far in their own hell. The detective who searches or the inhabitants of the chatting cities are the least of their worries: the destiny of their soul is at stake. <br /> <br /> And Oshima takes what in other hands could be simply a pulp Juicy (unfortunately, I would not be surprised if an American remake was already in preparation) and the DIY was going on a piecemeal, repetition making its way into the deception (that is to say, the plans of Seiko and Toyoji walking down this road, the camera (the world has tilted and surrounded them in a dark blue color) as well as moving movements that will remain long after I finish typing this (ie Toyoji throws the leaves with one hand into the well in slow motion, or how Seiko's naked body is revealed after she becomes blind.) It's daring to build ties at the level of the mind - not to to confuse with the spiritual, even though there may be something similar - the links between life and death, inextricably. It's a classic waiting to be discovered.
