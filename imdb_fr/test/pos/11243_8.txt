Of course, it seems like there is only about 17 minutes of actual content in each episode, but it's certainly fun to watch. You may find yourself backing up on your chair while a friend will put his foot in his mouth and be shot, or chuckle and shake his head while a ridiculous line actually works. The host group has a more friendly and friendly (I dare say, Canadian) commentary style compared to a fierce American reality TV program. I think people who complain about this show do not understand the joke. They take the series more seriously than the series itself. The VIP keys are a big caricature of reality TV shows, sports television culture and the club scene. I hope they will do another season and I would like to know if an American version will appear. It is certainly a fun and original place.
