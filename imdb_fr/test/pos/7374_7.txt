Campfire Tales is an often scary and always fun adventure through several popular stories, and not just for the aficionados of urban legend. It's also a film that has exceeded the (low) expectations I had. A horror film that I had never heard or read, a video output (the latter often entrusts us with a pleasant surprise, but with horror movies nowadays, it can be all or nothing), an essentially unknown cast. .. well, I leave you the calculation. <br /> <br /> The film turns out to be an entertaining, exciting and very enjoyable experience overall. The four stories are well paced and satisfying. The only one that seemed a bit weaker was "The Locket", for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation of its plot or the actions of the characters; However, I have always loved the tale, its atmosphere and its end. My favorite was the third story, "People can also get licked" - the suspense is not only palpable, but also educational. <br /> <br /> I discovered that Campfire Tales was one of those horror gems that we discover luck, and then continues to recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
