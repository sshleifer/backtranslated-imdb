How often do you see a movie of any type featuring a talent show with refreshments? The last Waldo stand is a refresh. Here, Waldo sells lemonade but does not make money. Alfalfa, Spanky, Darla, Mickey and Buckwheat come to visit him, which is ironic because 3 Men In A Tub and Came The Brawn were competing with Alfalfa and Waldo for Darla's affection. Back to the story: The Gang tasted lemonade to see if Waldo did it right. A fun time is when Alfalfa gets a glass cup for lemonade and Waldo fills it and gives it to Darla. Alfalfa has an angry expression on his face. Spanky offers a show on the ground to accompany the lemonade and even Mickey agrees that she is cute. When the show starts, there is no one at the barn but a guest enters (Froggy). Spanky asks him if he wants lemonade, but all he does is acquiesce. Spanky asks him how many times he spends in the court and every time Froggy nods, no Spanky displays a lot of expressions on his face, which is fun. Spanky tries many ways to make him thirsty. One way is when after that Mickey said in such a cute way "These crackers are salty and made me thirsty". There is also a lot to entertain the music is this short. The first issue is Darla's, which she types and dances. The second includes Alfalfa singing falsely (as usual) with Mickey, Leonard, Spanky and Buckwheat about "How dry I am!" (I think they're singing that to make Froggy thirsty, that made me laugh too.) The closing number includes boys and girls all dressed in the old fashioned way. It was the last short film of Our Gang of Waldo. A great short musical that is a pure 10 out of 10.
