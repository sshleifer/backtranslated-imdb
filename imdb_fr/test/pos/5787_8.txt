The End of Suburbia carefully gathers many of the concerns about the next "spike" in oil supply around the world. As the world's population grows, so does the demand for oil and electricity. As we extract oil and electricity, we reach a "peak" of production. The more oil you demand, the less oil is produced. The inevitable result is a conflict and a major change. <br /> <br /> This film will be disturbing and alarming if you are new to the subject. You can react at the beginning with anger and denial, because the implications are terrible. It should be necessary to watch. Beyond politics, beyond optimism, the calculation is undeniable. <br /> <br /> The suburbs are at the center of our concerns, as our suburban living areas will be the most affected communities when the price of energy soars. If the intuitive logic tells you that big cities will be the places to avoid in times of crisis, the extended nature of the suburbs will make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us. <br /> <br /> Peak oil is no longer a topic of discussion for survivalists and underwater enthusiasts. This question will be on our doorstep sooner than we think. This film is a lucid and coherent look.
