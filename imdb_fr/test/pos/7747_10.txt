I thought this movie was fun. I had never really watched old movies and this one was a very good first film. There was warmth and heart and mind. It was a bit cheesy, but in today's film industry, cheese is cute. I gave him a figure of ten and I strongly suggest renting, buying or seeing the film anyway. Gene Kelly was very dreamy and a little sarcastic and you knew that the character thought he was going to have everything. The main female role was interpreted perfectly because their two personalities had the spark and you wanted to keep up to date and see what would happen. The grandmother in the movie was priceless. The perfect addition to a good old movie. I like the fact that it's black and white and Gene Kelly is so nice to all the kids in the movie that you can not help but love him. To see him.
