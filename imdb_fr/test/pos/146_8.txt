A beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a failed medical experiment and turns him into a vampire. <br /> <br /> Physical and psychological changes drag her into an affair with a wife of her childhood friend, repressed and tired of her mundane life. <br /> <br /> The former priest falls deeper into despair and depravity. As the situation worsens, he struggles to preserve the rest of his humanity ... <br /> <br /> The vampire movie really should have disappeared thanks to the meager efforts of the Twilight franchises and Underworld is injecting new blood into the world. the story of the vampire, putting into perspective simple things. <br /> <br /> These vampires have reflections and no fangs, but feed and die in the same way. Making the priest the main protagonist really opens a Pandora's box to question his actions. The priest feeds mainly to make himself better, but when he meets his friends, an unsatisfied woman, the carnal instinct sets in. What makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple consents for the first time, live an experience they have never seen before, forbidden passion, which makes the scenario all the more sensual. <br /> <br /> Chan-Wook adds a well-deserved sense of humor to the film, but it only happens in the last third of the film. We see the girl lifting her mother on the chair in front of everyone and, when she realizes her own strength, rests her and continues. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> and the final act would not be misplaced in a report, nor even in the three Stooges since the couple is fighting for survival / death, respectively. <br /> <br /> CGI is subtle and fantastic, and the scenes with these jumping from building to building are so graceful that you could watch a ballet. eroticism and intensity that are lacking in most vampire movies these days. It's violent, but from the director in question, I would not expect anything else. <br /> <br /> A really interesting story, with fantastic characters and a beautiful cinematography.
