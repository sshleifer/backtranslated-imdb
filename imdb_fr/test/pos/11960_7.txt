It's a simple fact that many of us in the 80s generation like John Cusack's wacky comedies made by Savage Steve Holland. Although I prefer this other weird and stranger film, Better Off Dead, it's hard for me not to like One Crazy Summer, a movie I grew up and loved wholeheartedly as child as a teenager. OCS followed Better Off Dead, reporting Cusack and Curtis Armstrong's film. <br /> <br /> Cusack, it's Hoops, who follows the graduation buddy, Joel Murray (George), in Nantucket for the summer and has fun on the beach. Hoops finds himself involved in a feud with a punk blond named Teddy Beckersted, whose lecherous father plans to bulldoze a neighborhood's houses to build a huge condominium. One of the houses for which mortgage repayment is required belongs to Demi Moore (Cassandra). There is a sailboat race that may well be their only hope of saving the home of Cassandra's grandfather (he had just left it), but Teddy has won it in recent years and Hoops has a deadly fear of the crossing of the waters. But with the help and motivation of new friends from Nantucket (such as Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as twin brothers mechanics!), George and Cassandra, a lover in the making, maybe Hoops will be able to overcome his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. Armstrong has some support as a son of a kooky and arms-manic salesman, General Raymond (Joe Flaherty of SCTV in an inspired casting), Ack, who uses his father's training to help Hoops and society to achieve their goals. win the race. <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes in which Bobcat is caught in a Godzilla (!) costume creeping across an entire model of Aguilla Beckersted (Mark Metcalf, barely recognizable as the foolish pop Teddy condominium), while that Hoops is hunted George has been the victim of toxic flatulence, Bruce Wagner's growing madness, uncle Frank hazel, every time he tries to improve his chances of winning $ 1 million from a radio show, and the wonderful Billie Bird, George's grandmother actually bills the group after a meal! Jeremy Piven as (you guessed it) a brutal idiot who associates with Teddy and causes problems for Hoops and his band, the delicious Kimberly Foster as Cookie (.. The daughter of Teddy trying to get out of Hoops while having lunch with his father) and the one and only William Hickey in the role of Old Man Beckersted, who will not reward his son and grandchild of an inheritance if they lose the race. Demi Moore is cute, but it's Cusack's vehicle, although Bobcat and Villard steal most of the scenes in which they are. Once again, charming Dutch animations are sprinkled throughout the film (Hoops is an artist, rightly). If you like his films, I highly recommend the underrated, how I entered college.
