Symbolism galore, great tunes, this film has crushed the expectations of their audience "soon eliminated". These monkeys and naturally selected members of the group have witnessed the subtlety, but in your face, kissing goodbye. The message rings true today, the cage through which you escape and the bridge through which you want to jump are the disappointments of future generations, there will always be new children to replace those who break off the chains. The film can sometimes be frustrating, because the themes covered by the film are so obvious outside the American way of life, a person who thinks and reasons can not help but look at his own reflection in the scenes of Head and to question his motives for continuing the madness of American daily life, but the motives of those who want this to continue for insanity. The final scene, similar to Don Quixote's chivalric audacity about the caged tiger coming out for battle, shows how most dreams are delusional and impossible.
