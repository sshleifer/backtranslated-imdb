I always liked this movie. Music, history and action. I particularly like the opening and closing of the film. The music has stayed with me throughout the years. The air battles of the First World War were excellent and the comedy is typical of Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his forte after all. Julie's song is incredible and keeps me stuck on the screen. The sets and scenes are beautiful. The characters are attractive. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie sang them. I wish she sang for me in Vietnam. I also enjoyed the old cars of the time and the music of the First World War. I was happy when the DVD arrived. Now, I can whistle in the dark by watching him again and again.
