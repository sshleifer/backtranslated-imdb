Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree on a few things. First of all, this movie has nothing to do with THE CARS THAT ARE IN PARIS. Not in my humble opinion. Nothing like. <br /> <br /> I think the film had surreal elements, but I think the filmmaker's basic approach is not "surrealistic" in itself. therefore, it's not really like CARS Paris, I think rather like a strange work in Euro, with some scenes bearing the mark "wierd" not surrealist. <br /> <br /> Second, I think Heuzenroeder's music is brilliant. They used the whistle, that old sound of country and western records, and its best result than most Australian films, which usually associate the filmmaker with an indy band with the stupid sound that the company wants to promote. <br /> <br /> for the name of the film - I do not know why it's called Modern Love, I was hoping that David Bowie would appear dressed in flirty and lipstick ... Ops that I begins to show my age.
