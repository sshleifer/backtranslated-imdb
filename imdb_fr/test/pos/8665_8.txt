It would seem that we should recognize Scandinavian cinema for more than just the 1995 Dogma movement, created by the Danes all these years. Den Brysomme Mannen, or The Bothersome Man in English, is a surreal and deeply thought-out film, both entertaining and rich in content, both on the surface and below the surface. Only film is a scathing comedy about society and attitudes in the post-modern world in which we live; a world that, judging by The Bothersome Man, has reached the regions of Norway and others. But along with this feeling of dark comedy, it seems that the film deepens the question a little more and raises, at least for me, metaphorical religious spaces and our human instinct to want to discover the truth among so many materials of our world that Can it seems to us stranger. <br /> <br /> It was, in truth, a fantastic introduction to contemporary Norwegian cinema. The film fits into this category of the European art canon with its deep themes and ambiguity enveloped in an enveloped atmosphere while maintaining an open finale and less a narrative than a procession of events that could mean one thing or another . We have seen so many times movies that use the Bothersome Man's configuration and that have turned into an almost predictable routine that revolves around a detective story or a pursuit story or something, but that film allows his situation to serve as a backdrop for his protagonist, named Andreas (Fausa Aurvaag), to explore who he is; where he is and what are the possible mysteries behind this place. <br /> <br /> The installation I'm talking about implies that the hero arrives in a place where he has no memory, nor what happened before. I will go and say that, in my opinion, he died and was sent to a sort of purgatory, like all the inhabitants of the city. All the people in the city with whom Andreas interferes are of the same age; the same mentality and attitude suggest to me that most of them are victims of their own suicide and have been sent to a purgatory devoid of emotion, feeling, color or, more importantly, pain. <br /> <br /> When we see Andreas for the first time, he gets off a bus he later discovers with strange abilities and approaches a gas station in the middle of nowhere. He is disheveled and has a huge beard, but he will soon be the opposite: he wears a suit and a tie; face shaved close and his own home complete with a new work in which the film makes one of the best changes of transformation that I know between rural and urban. But the new job as well as the new city are worried. you can take breaks whenever you want; the bosses are exceptionally nice and there seems to be no emotion or reaction to anything. It's in the cinema that these ideas are best expressed when Andreas, who is still a beginner in the city, cries and is clearly touched by a film but everyone looks with stone. There is also the initial example where a man jumped out of a window and remained impaled on peaks but everyone goes by without any fuss. <br /> <br /> To support my idea of ​​all those who are already dead and the acting city as a kind of purgatory, death and evil in general are impossible. There is a particularly unpleasant scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and someone's thumb, but everyone's reaction to the event is flawless and it develops within an hour. In the same way, a suicide attempt involving trains is pointless and gives us the perspective of what it means to be dragged on rails with invulnerability on your side. The city acts as a barrier, a painless society in which the masochistic need to self-harm is impossible; a place where sexual intercourse can occur and break evenly, but in both unemotional and passionate conditions; a place where people can try to commit suicide but where it is impossible to die. The city adopts these powers because the damage has already been done in the "real life" and therefore, the film says you can not kill yourself twice, because you can not feel pain or pain. emotion in the beyond purgatory. <br /> <br /> But the best part of the movie is the one that invades you. Judging by the last five minutes of the film and the parallel story that begins with music from another man's house, it seems that there is a fine line of demarcation between the spaces that the film dictates as than "paradise" and "hell". We only see these spaces very very briefly ?? so briefly that they consist of a single shot. "Paradise" is a colorful cuisine where music and children play: it offers life, hope, emotion and happiness while hell is a snowy nothingness that haunts you through its hopeless construction and its worrying breaking point. The introduction of these two spaces at the very end of the film suddenly informs you of the reality Andreas and co. face: purgatory and all that went with it, the afterlife was just not ready for Andreas and his free spirit, adventurous ?? and see where the thinkers end.
