This film clearly shows something and highlights what is happening in most institutions today, and shows how a gurl succeeds, with the help of his newspaper, in getting things done. Her editor has every confidence in her and does not publish anything important because it would hurt her friend ... and in due course, she took the necessary action. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film got a score of 9 from me, because it has everything, I mean it keeps you amused, and what's more, they played very well, for a TV movie, his quality of a truly high quality actor who deserves a lot of credit.
