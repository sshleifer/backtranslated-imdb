I liked it. Others have revealed spoilers, but I will not do it. It was an unusual place, actually quite strange, but I completely accepted it. Camille was difficult to succeed convincingly. maybe that's why some people hated him. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills allowed her to play the role perfectly - without being ridiculous or ridiculous. I do not know why she was even interested in a loser like James Franco, but married her anyway. I love him as an actor and I also think he did a great job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There have been movies with similar configurations, for example. "Ghost". I just like Sienna Miller and followed the situation as it is described in the script. I think her great talent as an actress is greatly underrated and hopes that she will be more recognized by the public. I thought that all the actors played their part very well and hope that more people will be able to see the film. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that my local Block Buster store has about 10 copies. I intend to buy it.
