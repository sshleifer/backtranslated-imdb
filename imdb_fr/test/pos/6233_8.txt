A group of young friends who have car problems while traveling off the beaten track accept an offer of help from Slausen (Chuck Connors), an isolated resident who owns a nearby museum full of historical wax mannequins. Once on the track, friends are harassed by a masked madman who can bring the models of the museum to life through the power of the mind. <br /> <br /> The villain of Tourist Trap is a crazy crossover Leatherface of Massacre, Massacre, and Anthony, the scary kid of the classic episode of Twilight Zone, "It's a Good Life", while the plot is a mix of elements from MCT, Hitchcock's Psycho and House of Wax. However, the atmosphere and performance of Tourist Trap are so out of sync that it is almost impossible to compare with previous films. <br /> <br /> Director David Schmoeller has always dealt inventive and unpredictable way his own scenario gives the film a nightmarish quality, and with a brilliant performance of Connors on the left field, an incredibly scary score of Pino Donaggio , a collection of truly disturbing dummies with removable jaws and the presence of the sexy Tanya Roberts, who passes the film in (and releases briefly) tiny denim t-shirts and a slinky figure, Tourist Trap is an experience of horror totally unforgettable and finally unique, which deserves its worship.
