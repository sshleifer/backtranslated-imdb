I just watched this short film at PlanetOut Movies. <br /> <br /> Starcrossed was a very sweet and sad little movie about two loving brothers. There are very good subtle acts on the part of men. Often, films dealing with this subject seem too caught up in the controversy and shocking value of the plot, forgetting that there is a real story. Fortunately, screenwriter James Burkhammer does not do this and lets the story unfold with honesty. The sequences of the first two boys who fall in love are very sweet.
