It is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their "Erasmus year" in Barcelona, ​​which is also one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and an ideal place. <br /> <br /> The idea itself with all languages ​​is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are clichés about countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries. <br /> <br /> Having experienced "Erasmus" in myself during my exchange semester in Italy, I can say that this film is incredibly authentic. I had many experiences that looked like the characters (except that I did not do so often). The movie is also quite funny but does not look like all those stupid American college movies. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film also addresses important issues such as the transition from student life to professional life. <br /> 9 / / 10 (I may not be very objective though)
