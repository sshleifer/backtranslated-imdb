The Gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber describes Jane Hawkins, a seriously injured, world-class gymnast who now earns her living as a certified massage therapist. <br /> <br /> The promotional material suggests that the plot revolves around Jane's accidental meeting with a former teammate. Although this meeting takes place, this plot is secondary to the main plot, which involves Jane, her husband and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women develop an act of the type of Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other - Jane is more experienced in height and has tremendous upper body strength. Serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, she is also capable of incredible physical feats. <br /> <br /> The movie works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie, who cares and who shows compassion, while her husband takes for granted for the many years of their marriage. <br /> <br /> Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has a lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. Obviously, they really do their job and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would succeed in Las Vegas or wherever they traveled. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension between women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act in question forces them to kiss while suspended. A woman with a careless husband and an attractive partner creates an explosive situation, which is not solved in a neat and orderly way. <br /> <br /> Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this one was the best. It will work on DVD, and it is really worth looking for big or small screen. NOTE: stay for the credits!
