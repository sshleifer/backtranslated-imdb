If you have not heard of this film, the film follows two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa and traveling to America, where they convince themselves to find success and wealth. Life is harder than expected in the United States, and this film magnificently illustrates the frustration felt when things are not going well. Lives are so well captured that many moments seem programmed as they are perfect. Whether at work, at school or in-between, Peter and Santino are very honest with the filmmakers and make very stimulating comments about life in the United States. It's one of the few documentaries I remember, when it ended, I wanted it to last another two hours. This film may be difficult to find because it's not very good distribution, but check in your "art house" or in your independent theater and try it (note: if you're reading this while it's already on video, so it's really worth the rent). Rating: 28/40
