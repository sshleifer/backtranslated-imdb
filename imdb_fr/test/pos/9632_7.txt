Dude, I think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. Everyone thinks they are a critic. They comment on things the average moviegoer does not even know or think about. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie. This was what I expected so I was not disappointed. Steven has a bad time for putting his views in his movies, but it's also a reason to watch him. What's even more funny is the people who complain about his movies, say he's the worst and you do not watch his movies, but watch his movies anyway. All this so that they can comment on how bad they are. Who is the model? If you do not like his work, do not look at him. In this case, you will not have to submit to this supposedly painful event. <br /> <br /> Stop comparing movies with other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis.
