Since others have complained of putting Sherlock Holmes in a contemporary setting, I will not do it. Basil Rathbone could have integrated at any time with this voice, this knowledge. It's a beautifully crafted mystery that loosely rests on "The Dancing Men," one of Conan-Doyle's best stories. Instead of the original plot, it makes men a Nazi plot. Holmes becomes a spokesman for the British war effort. His opponent is Moriarity, who seems to die quite often to compete with the central figure of the Friday 13th movies. He is creative, but the Rathbone Holmes is unshakeable. Watson is just there for the ride in this one. He does not have a lot of nonsense to tell in this film and it's a real plus. The plot is complex enough to keep his interest. There is a final speech that is almost a travesty of itself. But then I can not criticize an era and a nation that have been subjected to great constraints. If they needed to call Holmes, so be it.
