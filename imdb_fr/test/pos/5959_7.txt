I just saw the movie, it's actually pretty good. The trailers left me with an impression of another film by Dujardin shot (at the _Brice de Nice_) or an expensive and stupid French comedy. Surprisingly, it's neither one nor the other. Secret Agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows it, while I've always found James Bond stupid but acting like a smart donkey. The dialogue is witty with a lot of ironic humor that one would expect from a British rather than French film. The women and the music are beautiful. A refreshing trip in the past, when the bad guys were ex-Nazis or Soviet brutes, the cars were brilliant and France had colonies!
