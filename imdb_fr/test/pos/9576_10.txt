This is the only Christopher Guest film that rivals Spinal Tap and Princess Bride for entertainment alone, but never approaches recognition. The plot surrounds the candidates - the dogs - and their owners as they venture into the world of competition dogs ... OK, this is a dog show. The owners are really characters, as they should be so attached to their dogs. That's really all there is to it, but it makes it quite funny. <br /> <br /> You'll never be able to convince me that a mock dog show on dog shows would be funny before catching the hilarious scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry's house Miller on TV ... but it's really all you need to convert skeptics. Spinal Tap was a non-stop hilarity, joke after joke, while Best in Show had undergone some extra breaks (and by that I mean 3 minutes of MOST where nothing ridiculous happens), but the big laughs are even bigger. <br /> <br /> The cast of this one is awesome and even the movie typically moved from, uh, movies in general, Parker Posey does a good job. In fact, his tirade directed against Ed Begley Jr. and a pet shop owner about a lost dog toy is probably the funniest gag of the movie. <br /> <br /> What surprises me in this film is how writers managed to weave a plot, as simple as it is, around these good jokes to give the impression of having a direction. I suppose there is a freedom to have such a small plot. The role of each is pretty well designed here and the characters are rarely exaggerated. The realism of their pathetic appearance abroad is what makes him funnier than Mighty Wind or the unequal Guffman. In fact, I meet wierdos like that from time to time. If you like Guest items, you should definitely have one.
