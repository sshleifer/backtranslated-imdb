"Western Union" is a bit of a forgotten classic western! The reason may be due to the fact that it is not available on DVD in the United States. However, not everything is lost because it has now appeared on Region 2 in England. This is a blessing in some ways, which is not only incongruous, but also totally ironic when you consider that a film describing the founding and creation of an uniquely American organization, such as the Western Union Telegraph Company, is unrelated for region 1. It stutters belief! It just does not make sense! <br /> <br /> Produced by Fox in 1941 "Western Union" was directed by Fritz Lang. This is only the second time that the great German director undertakes to direct a western! He had done a great job the previous year with Fox's "The Return Of Frank James" and would only have one out west in 1952 with the splendid "Rancho Notorious". Lang was not a Ford or a Hawks, but with "Western Union", he made an excellent solid western that resists very well. Beautifully photographed by Edward Cronjager at the beginning of the three-band Technicolor movie, he had a fine cast directed by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female role is taken by Virginia Gilmore, who has really little to do in the photo. An actress who has never done anything of her career. His presence here is only cosmetic. <br /> <br /> It's curious that Robert Young has the best of luck on Scott! This is clearly Scott's picture from the very beginning when we see him for the first time in the great opening scene of the film, continued by a band across the plains. Young does not have much to do throughout the film and seems out of place in a western. He just looks totally silly fighting Barton McLane in a shootout! An actor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with "Crossfire" (1947) - Young appeared in a series of romantic comedies forgettable in the 40s and 50s, culminating in his greatest success when he was for seven years "Marcus Welby MD" the seventies. He died in 1998 at the age of 91. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" relates the telegraph connection of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays the role of a reformed outlaw enlisted by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to protect Sioux's raiding line and also to attack McLane and his gang who are trying to destroy it for sneaky purposes. Robert Young is the young engineer from the East who joined the company and competes with Scott for Miss Gilmore's affection. Slim Summerville and John Carradine play a comical role as a doctor of the company, which annoys a little comic. <br /> <br /> In total, even if it's a good western, although in region 2, but sparkling quality that will delight fans. My only cradle is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and this terrible cover with these matte graphics. UGH! <br /> <br /> Footnote: It is interesting to note that the associate producer of "Western Union" was Harry Joe Brown who, later, with Randolph Scott would create a partnership that would produce some of the best westerns of Scott in the fifties.
