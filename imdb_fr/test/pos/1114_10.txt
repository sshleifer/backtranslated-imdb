Speaking of the elements of the competition at the Split Film Festival, we have titles from around the world. China, Korea, Canada, the United States and Australia, and many of these stories indicate that the world is really a valley of tears. Modern love ... that's for sure. <br /> <br /> In this film by Alex Frayne, two newlyweds and their boy go from a city to the coast to visit the tomb and the house of the uncle of this man who raised him a long time ago and who died mysterious circumstances. The coastal village seems to be something in an American horror movie where the village is weird and people are rare mutants. But the episodes of Alex Frayne's pastorelle can not be described as horror in the usual way. In fact, it's an extremely interesting drama where we see relationships and horror through flashbacks and more. In this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors, we are shown a peep show of Australian films with eccentric charm. This is the case of Frayne. Always something new and fresh. The visual intelligence and unique sensitivity of some Australian filmmakers are amazing. Frayne's movie is great. There is something in the Australian landscape that shows their so special films as we see in FRAYNE's Modern Love and in the films of RAY Lawrence, Lantana and Jindabyne. <br /> <br /> It looks like it will be the same in Alex Frayne's next titles
