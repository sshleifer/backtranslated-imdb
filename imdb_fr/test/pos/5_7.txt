I only went to see this film because I always liked Kevin Costner. I felt that Ashton had done a great job in the butterfly effect. Unfortunately, even if these two actors were / are able to have good times if not excellent, some of these moments were missing here. Some scenes were simply not credible and did not have enough scenarios. <br /> <br /> Although the film claims to have been influenced by Hurricane Katrina, there has been very little (none) of this effect in the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, I appreciated the fact that the film presents some of what helps save lives from the water point of view. <br /> <br /> The special effects were pretty good and not intimidating. Not sure that I'm going back to deep-sea fishing ... <br /> <br /> I was expecting a little more emotion in the film than what was presented. <br /> <br /> A film that could well 'We have been seen on DVD.
