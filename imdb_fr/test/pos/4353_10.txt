The questions and the answers of the human spirit are all united in this masterfully designed historical documentary. The beauty and horror of a man who goes through life is revealed in their totality. Dieter and Herzog are combined and connected by a mental labyrinth transformed into a single rectilinear corridor whose walls have been covered with images created by the characterization of man by the vibrations of his own vocal cords. This film, for about 80 minutes, discovered a new dimension of storytelling. What do I call this seemingly new meaning? After all, only God knows that MIRACLE is not something God does for us, but chooses to remain ANONYMOUS? <br /> <br /> It's a requirement to see. If you like to live the beautiful horror of war, this documentary will clean your soul to the marrow.
