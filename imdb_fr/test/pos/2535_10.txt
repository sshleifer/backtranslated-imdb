The film begins with the director talking to the camera and says he will show a story about Brazilian street children whose families live in poverty and have to steal and kill to survive. In fact, the main character (Pixote) was played by a real street kid, only 11 years old. The following is one of the most brutal, depressing and horrible movies I've ever seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with "Black Orpheus") and I have never forgotten it. I do not think I ever want to see him again, it was too much. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD !!!! The scene that does not leave me is the one where Pixote meets a prostitute who has to abort her own fetus. You do not see her doing ... but you take a look at what she pulled out. It's almost 20 years later and the simple fact of reminding me that this scene upsets me. END OF SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> The film becomes more and more brutal as it advances and ends as it can. What is even more heartbreaking is that stories like this really happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and are still happening nowadays. <br /> <br /> A heartbreaking and brutal film ... but you have to see it if you can handle it. . I'm surprised it got a rating of R - I saw movies rated X that are less graphic. A 10.
