I watched this film for lack of something else at the time. Quickly, the film captured me with the depth of the characters and the subtle intrigue. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give revelations to the plot or result, but most characters in cash value. Until the last minute, I did not know how it would happen. Frequently, you can take the formula and predict the direction of the story. I could not do that with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it as one of the best movies of its kind.
