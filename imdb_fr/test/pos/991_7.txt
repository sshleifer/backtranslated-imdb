Since Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern English poetry, I was expecting a film subject to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary, the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a linker and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. Of course, one could argue that all this is an advantage when one is an artist and especially a poet, since one of the aims of art is to overturn the norms of conventional morality, but I still do not think that a model positive from such a bundle of personality traits. Anyway, I found the other male hero of the story, Captain Cillic, a more endearing character. Both female roles were played by actresses Knigtley and Miller and were really charming especially the first when she played songs in slim dress to inspire Londoners bombed during the Second World War. Another positive point is the role played by sexual jealousy even in relatively progressive circles who think that secular conventions can easily be overcome. as opposed to those who argue about it by theorizing about possible political outcomes. I think we could recommend such a movie.
