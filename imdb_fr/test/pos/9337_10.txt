The video opens on a horror movie scene in which a man offers to his girlfriend. He begins to tell him that he is "different". When the full moon comes up, he turns into a werewolf. He then pursues it through the woods and, just before attacking, we are led inside the cinema. Michael and his girlfriend are inside the theater. She is too scared to look any longer, so they leave. When he leaves the theater, he begins to tease her. ("It's almost midnight, something is not so good in the darkness ...") Michael sings and dances in the street with his girlfriend. This scene shows Michael's skill with the camera. He never acts "aware" of his presence once, as many other artists do. As they cross the cemetery, the graves begin to open ... Once they arrive in an alley, they are confronted by a horde of undead. Then we see the horrified face of Michael's daughter. Who would not look horrified if his date became a zombie? Yes, he becomes one of the undead. (A very bright and brilliant, though.) He and his zombie colleagues then begin what may be the most well-known dance choreography of any music video. To tell you more, the end would be lost. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite clip of all time! You do not want to miss it! I give him a 10/10. (Yes, I know you can see the curtains at the back of the sound stage, and the werewolf looks rather old-fashioned by today's standards.)
