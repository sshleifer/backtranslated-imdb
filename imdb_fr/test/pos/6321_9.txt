The mystery and its solution was a great black vanity. I have some questions though, maybe I was not paying enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the replacement girl and why? <br /> <br /> And some small scruples, they should have shown the stop at the hotel for the change. Not that they should have shown the switch, but Jim and the girl who was going to the hotel, Jim going to the bathroom, going out and being told by the bartender that his girlfriend had gone to the car without him. <Br /> <br /> So Jim goes back in the car and sees the sleeping woman and the little girl in her back seat. <br /> <br /> This would have given the spectator a sporting chance to find the solution. <br /> <br /> I would like to film it, but I would like to see it again.
