This film probably gave me the most pleasant surprise I have ever seen. It was not a big budget production and its principle, its middle-aged amateur jazz musicians who get an unexpected professional engagement in a complex resembling Catskills, seems rather modest. What is not modest is the success of the film. It's a little movie of life that is the most entertaining. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script, which is full of secondary intrigue and unexpected twists. <br /> <br /> The actors are companions who do a solid job. The biggest revelation for me was Cleavon Little. He plays a professional musician who is hired to replace a sick member of the group. His attitude immediately comes up against others. They see it as an opportunity to have fun and have a unique experience, but he sees it as his job and not as a particularly interesting job. This creates conflict, but when the group has problems, it directs them. Little, who died too young, really showed me that he was a good actor with this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a real sleeper, the kind that a moviegoer always hopes to discover. I recommend it without reservation.
