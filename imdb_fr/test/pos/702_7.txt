Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once outlawed friends, but now Scott is a sheriff and the young Ford still rents his gun. He is hired to find a job at a bank, but is delayed in the city and those who hire him hire someone else. This leads to all kinds of complications, many for a movie that does not even last 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Randy and Glenn have the girls here. Claire Trevor plays her usual girl with a gold heart. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who cracks for Ford without realizing who he is or why he came to the city where Scott is the sheriff. <br /> <br /> It's a western, but unusual time and for Columbia Pictures he received the complete technicolor treatment. The Desperadoes was Glenn Ford's first film in technicolor, a process reserved for the most expensive films of major studios. Harry Cohn was certainly not the type to claim it. And certainly not in time of war. <br /> <br /> The plot becomes a bit complicated as Ford and Scott are both put to the test of friendship versus opportunism / duty. The plot also involves high-class hypocrites skunks in the city of Randy, who are the real outlaws in the movie. <br /> <br /> The four main roles are excellent and the best secondary performance is Guinn Williams as Ford. adorable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick. The highlight involves a cattle rush and shooting in the city hall and is one of the best ever made in a Western movie. <br /> <br /> Fans of the four main and western movies will appreciate this one.
