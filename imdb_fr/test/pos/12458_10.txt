Before re-reading this film, I have to make a rather daring confession as a film critic. Anyone who has read my previous reviews may know that I have always been controversial, giving a high note to flops such as "Captain America" ​​and "Creature" dating back to 1985 and sweeping film classics like Alistar Sim. "A Christmas Carol" and "Shakespeare in Love". Keeping this in mind, this confession is not surprising: <br /> <br /> The fact is Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Woah, now, is not going crazy on me right now. Let me explain: I do not think he is the greatest actor in the world. I confess clearly that he is not. He certainly is not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I would say that his ability to act is probably somewhere up there with at least Bruce Willis. What I admire about him, however, are the human qualities he brings to his action heroes. He's just an ordinary guy who laughs, cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to. In my opinion, it takes a lot to highlight these qualities in a character (especially in the films in which he worked), and Lambert's heroes are far from those of Schwartzennegger or Stallone. Frankly, Lambert's characters are easier for me to understand. Therefore, he is not the greatest actor in the world .... He is just one of my personal favorites. <br /> <br /> I can not say as much of his films. Whatever my taste for his game, it would be foolish not to admit that his choice of films leaves something to be desired. Quite frankly, most of them are terrible, and the ridiculousness he's had over the years on my part is not due to his acting, but rather to his bad choice of script. <br /> <br /> Keeping this in mind, I can say that his first film, "Tarzan", is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance. As I said, it's effective because of the humanity it brings to the role and the seriousness with which the director, writers and actors manage the content. It's a distant leap from the B-movie action adventures with Johnny Weismeller of the 1940s. In fact, I would hesitate to call it an action movie. Instead, it's a serious drama that takes all ER Burrough material seriously, showing Tarzan's quest to find out his real family in Scotland after realizing he was not part of the "White Apes". . He is torn between his old family and his new family, in which is a magnificent Sir Ralph Richardson. To try to adapt to humans, his monkey instinct also comes into play and he can not decide what he likes most: his real family, or the one he has always known. In summary, this is a wonderful commentary on the company and an excellent study of the characters. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, this has propelled Lambert into an international celebrity, which lasted until the 1980s with movies like "Highlander" and "He Sicilian." Unfortunately, it did not last. But wait a bit ... His latest moves in the career such as "Gideon" and "Resurrection" have proven that although he still has a long way to go, he is an actor competent enough to perhaps make one. .. Uh .... come back if he chooses better his roles. <br /> <br /> For now, here is the verdict of his first film: <br /> <br /> *** on ****
