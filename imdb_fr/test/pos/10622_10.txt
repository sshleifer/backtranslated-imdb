This film made me suffer and I loved it! I loved! It haunted me for days. I think Erika is the kind of character you hate and lament at the same time. The most terrifying sex scene ever filmed. This is the best of Haneke's work so far. He is the only director alive to redefine the rhythm since Kubrick. The violence in this film is magnificent. In a nutshell, the movie is about self-hatred. In one sentence, the film talks about trying to find love in order to stop hating you and discover that it is hopeless hope.
