As a cameraman, I could not help admiring the beautiful look obtained by this photo. The performances were excellent, as was the story. Just when I thought this film was about to slow down, it was not. A thrilling tension, a good rhythm thanks to the editing and a score that knows when to be silent meet under a competent and competent direction. The camera was always in the right place. I like this.
