just another showcase of zeppelin led to their best and their absolute best rock. each band member is at his best jimmy page and his JPJ bow and guitar with his thunderous bass bozo and Robert sing like theirs tomorrow. I must say that when we go into the first song I'm going to groove, it's the beginning of something very special. This DVD follows zeppelin through their 11 year career, Carree, starting in 69 in the Royal Albert Hall, then at Madison Square Garden 73, followed by a much older and older group in 75 at Earls Court and finally by a group different at their last concert in English at Knebworth in 79 This DVD is a fantastic showcase of Zeppelin and if you're not a fan, you'll want it.
