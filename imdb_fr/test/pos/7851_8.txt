I was surprised by this first performance of Clint Eastwood. I did not read a movie summary when I decided to watch it on TV. Thanks to Mr. Eastwood, I expected beautiful shots and no in-depth story. I was wrong. I found some topics that were unusually discussed, and until the end, I could not decide who was good and who was bad. This film is certainly not typical of Eastwood, but certainly worth watching.
