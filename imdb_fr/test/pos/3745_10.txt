Before talking about the end of this film, I will talk about the plot. A guy, Gerald, breaks his engagement with Kitty and goes to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months, Kitty and her aunt ventured to Scotland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty discovers that Gerald has grown older and has become more mean. Gerald has some rules for the castle (the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but Kitty insists on remaining apologetic. One night, his aunt sees the monster crossing the hall. It scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) they have to stay longer. Kitty starts to worry about Gerald after trying to go into the maze, but Gerald catches her and is even meaner to her. Kitty then sends reinforcements, she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his off. Then, so that things do not seem suspicious, they invite some friends (who do nothing at all). Blah, blah, blah Kitty and her aunt find themselves in the labyrinth where the most outstanding thing in history is. They are sort of separated and they try to find each other. But the aunt is falling on the creature ... this is the moment we were all waiting for, what creature is hiding in the shadows? ... it's a GREAT FROG !!! OMG what better than that! After seeing the aunt, the frog goes crazy and runs, oops, I mean climb the stairs to the top of the castle. The frog then jumps through an open window. We then take a picture of the ground and see the frog galley towards us (oh yeah this movie was in 3D). But you want to know what's funny, is that the frog that falls through the window is actually a toy, because it is 1/10 the size of the frog before making the leap. It is then revealed that all this was due to evolutions fault, blah, blah and Kitty and Gerald get married. Then the last shot of this masterpiece is the frog's grave in the labyrinth, the only place where he was really happy;).
