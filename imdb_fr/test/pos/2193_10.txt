I watched my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances just as striking as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course, was the master of Sweeney's role; his determination to take revenge on those who, in his opinion, caused the death of his wife and the disappearance of his daughter never falters. at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for vengeance has led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrait, like Ms. Lovett. She understood that Sondheim wanted this role to be something of a Sweeney comic counterpart; and even brings a certain tenderness to his Sweeney Court and his education of the boy Tobias. For those with long memories, this performance is a comeback in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight; well before the murder, she wrote. Just a year ago, I saw the Lyric Opera of Chicago's musical. with the superstar of the current opera Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others commented on the lyrical quality of the score. My conclusion is that "Sweeney" works best with actors who can at least manage vocal lines as opera performers with limited theater skills. In closing, I congratulate the artist who described Tobias. with his mixed loyalties and confusion about what's going on around him. It seemed appropriate that he had practically the last word.
