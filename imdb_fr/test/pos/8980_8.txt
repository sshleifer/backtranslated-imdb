Narrated in flashback, the film opens in 1989 and Charlie is awarded an award for his role in the defeat of communism. I must admit that my heart sank at the thought of having to endure another serious story, somewhat boring and too long. How wrong I was, because this short scene is as close as the movie becomes boring. <br /> <br /> The film is full of entertaining and entertaining settings and heartbreaking dialogues in some of the most unexpected places. The next scene after the awards ceremony is Charlie in a hot tub with naked women and a guy trying to convince him to invest in a TV show. Charlie, a group of his rather sexy secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffmans CIA Man and a bottle of whiskey are another rather amusing scene. Regarding dialogue, how about a line, "Senator says: He can teach us to type but can not teach us to grow breasts." OK, schoolboy, I know, but the movie is dotted with beautiful lines. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene in which he finds himself. Hanks is OK but, surprisingly, Julia Roberts who is very good in the role of a Texas Oil Millionairess rather eccentric. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is one of the best non-musician biographies in a long time, in addition to being that rare thing, a movie that entertains, amuses and informs all in equal measure.
