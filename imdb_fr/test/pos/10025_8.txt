Errol Flynn's mischievous charm really shines through in this entertaining and exciting, but historically bankrupt, biopic of the famous (and some would say sadly) General Custer, who has been following his career since his first day at West Point, during the Civil War. Battle of The Little Big Horn, while striking his rival Arthur Kennedy and the beautiful novelist Olivia de Havilland. <br /> <br /> One could say that Flynn, who delivers a great flamboyant performance as a general, is essentially playing himself playing Custer! <br /> <br /> A sumptuous production (which should have been in Technicolor) well directed by Raoul Walsh, They die with their boots has some really well staged battle sequences. Anthony Quinn also plays Crazy Horse. <br /> <br /> The previous year, Flynn faced Jeb Stuart alongside Ronald Reagan's George Custer at Santa Fe Trail (also with De Havilland), another action game Warner Brothers' production is designed to make you fail in history!
