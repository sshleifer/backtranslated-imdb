Granny is the best movie of all time Ganny is the best movie I have ever seen. the plot was like nothing has ever been seen or done before these people are really blessed with a joke-free talent I love this movie. I need to buy it but I can not find it anywhere. it's a dream for me to meet the actors and try to make a grandmother. 2.i rented GRANNY's video on Broadway and kept it a week longer than I should have. I asked them if I could buy them, they said not a big disappointment and even bigger the week after my return, I wanted to go rent it again, but come to discover that the video of Broadway was bankrupt. if anyone has the movie or knows where i can buy it at then tell me please email me at iloverot@aol.com
