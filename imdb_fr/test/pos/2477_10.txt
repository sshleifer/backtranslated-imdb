Well, I liked this film, even if sometimes it turns too much to a stereotypical situation. I did not know if the "Punishment Park" existed in the past, but I think the problem is not really there. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie differently. It shows how much violence can be found in our world. It reminds us that we live in a world of violence and that no one can escape. If someone refuses to "take responsibility", you will be expelled from our society ... Our whole history is made of wars, we should never forget it. In fact, it is only when we finally accept the truth that, perhaps, we will change and understand that our "intellectual skills" have improved. We could use them to find other ways to solve our problems. <br /> <br /> In two words, this film is a must, it may help us to accept the truth ...
