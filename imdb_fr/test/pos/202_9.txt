In Moscow, the young couples Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are deeply in love with each other. During the Second World War, Boris volunteered to join the army and was sent to the front on the eve of Veronika's birthday. They do not have the chance to say goodbye. While waiting for the news of Boris, Veronika is raped by Boris's cousin, Mark (A. Shvorin), who is getting married. However, Veronika does not forget Boris and is still waiting for him. <br /> <br /> "Letyat zhuravli" is an impressive and heartbreaking novel in wartime. The staging is excellent and uses ellipses throughout history, including on the stage of the capital when Veronika is raped by Mark. The camera work is amazing, with sophisticated shots and angles and long trips. Veronika's scenes in the middle of the tanks, or in the train station with many extras are impressive. The magnificent cinematography is underlined by the restored image of the DVD. T. Samojlova has an extremely beautiful face and a touching and sensitive performance. The speech of the last scene is another excellent example of an anti-war film. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Quando Voam as Cegonhas"
