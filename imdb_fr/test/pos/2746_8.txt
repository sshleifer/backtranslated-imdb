I loved the airport plans - Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc. - simple buildings bearing the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-engines, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast forward in 75 years .... <br /> <br /> But what really happened to me was the emblem of the hammer and the sickle and what seemed to be a Chinese ideogram next to the logo, at the rear of the pilot's seat, on the starboard side of the fuselage. Do you remember when the reciprocal meeting between Neil and Jill announced that Jim would become a general in a Chinese rebel army? This, based on the hammer and the sickle, could only be the revolutionary popular army of Mao Tse Dung !!! Regardless of underwear and unmarried couples in bed - would this logo and reference have survived during the Cold War? <br /> <br /> Further comment 12/27: This 1930s film bearing the emblem of the Soviet Union can / should also reflect the influence and charm of communism in Hollywood and in much of the world. America during the Crisis. Add to the historical value of this great movie. <br /> <br /> I also liked the American aspect of the dream of two guys from Winnemucca storming at least part of the world to the assault, Red Blooded (literally and heartily in Jim's case) ), American Boys. <br /> <br /> Others commented more adroitly than me on aerobatics, etc. I liked everything. <br /> <br /> This jewel deserved more than the mere 1.5 stars that Osborne and Co. noted on TCM, if only for the recording parts of American history of early 30s.
