22. JOE (play, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist factory worker known to hate "hippies and dwarves". He meets Bill, a businessman who has just murdered the lover of his drug addict girl, Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill fled and joined a hippie town on the outskirts of the city. Bill turns to Joe for help. Their search leads them through the most sinister neighborhoods of the city where the hatred and inner hatred of the two men are then tested. <br /> <br /> Criticism: It was the first time that the director John G. Avildsen had been transformed: 'Rocky', 'The Karate Kid', 'Split-Image', 'Weekend at Bernie's') . The film is quite interesting in that it served to summarize the themes and ideas of the turbulent 1960s (Vietnam war, black power, women's freedom, etc.). Peter Boyle plays Joe, one of the first antiheroes of cinema. He has always been good at playing with frightening and authoritarian monsters whose abstract ideas are reinforced by his intimidating presence (he would embody the Frankenstein monster in Mel Brook's young Frankenstein parody). He reminds me of a little child trapped in a big, stupid, clumsy body. The film has a weak scenario (the meeting of Joe and Bill, for example, is a bit casual), but its end is particularly horrible after the taxi driver. <br /> <br /> QUOTE: Title: "I saw a guy who was selling junk to kids, he's nervous every time I walk in because he knows if I catch him I'm going to kick him in the head and kick him.
