I saw this 1918 film recently in our Helsinkian film archive. It seems that the Danish Film Institute rebuilt it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Nordisk filmcompany, one of the largest in the world at the beginning of the 20th century. I believe that there are currently several copies with English translations in Europe. <br /> <br /> I found the film fascinating and the trip to Mars well thought out. The plot is certainly original, but I really do not want to reveal more for the moment, because the danger of spoiling things for you really exists ;-). <br /> <br /> The film is also available on DVD, check the web pages of the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) at dfi.dk with 'Himmelskibet' for more information.
