SOME KEY SPOILERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN WARNING <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Venice Film Festival and I have to admit that as a fan it was really impressive. Excellent graphics, excellent music, excellent dubbing, excellent action sequences, etc., but there is a but. ALL the film was thought EXCLUSIVELY for the players who liked it, and who can enjoy each reference, character, joke (you should see a joke with a winning music that is particularly comical), etc. A poor man who is not in the world of FF will obviously see the magnificence of the technical part, but CAN NOT grasp the inner satisfaction of seeing, for example, Barret appear and shoot Bahamut TOTALLY NIGHT. He will wonder, "WHO IS THIS GUY?", And I can not blame him. He can not even understand what a player feels when in the OPENING SEQUENCE, there is the opening music of the game, Nanaki running in the canyon with her two little ones, screaming on the ruins of Midgar, then "498 years ago ...". Almost all the characters made an appearance or a quote (including Reeve, Tseng and Elena), and Reno & Rude were really clumsy and comical to watch, but the final impression the film left me was "the last dream of hardcore gamer, but much less for a fan of FILM ... "
