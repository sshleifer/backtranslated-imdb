WONDERBIRD, certainly an incredibly refined drawing, deliciously old-fashioned and sensitively fashioned in almost every respect, takes place in a kingdom ruled by a wicked and obnoxious monarch; As a result, the kingdom, or at least what we see around the king's palace, seems destitute and uninhabited. <br /> <br /> Some inhabitants are away from the sun in the dry underground city. <br /> <br /> A tip: call it an allegory, call it a parable, but do not call it a fable. <br /> <br /> Because IMB encourages prolixity and perhaps for other reasons I will add that this caricature is the work of the great Paul Grimault.
