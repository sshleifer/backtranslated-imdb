I am not sure how to solve this problem in ten lines, but I will try. <br /> <br /> When Julie went to the ball and they were dancing on slow music. What was the name of the song that played and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love this song! And I watch the movie again and again just to hear this song. <br /> <br /> I did several searches online and I even watched the soundtrack, but I still can not find the song. <br /> <br /> This may be because the song they were dancing in was not complete and partial. I would appreciate anyone who knows the name of the song and the band that sang it. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Frank
