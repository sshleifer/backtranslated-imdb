Although it is a low-budget and clearly last-minute film, it still has a certain charm that is hard to pin down. I tend to believe that it's the scriptwriter - Grant Morris (see Dead Dog), who, despite the twisted plot, has injected a great deal of humor, which is sorely lacking in many boxing successes office. Must see for the Sunday afternoon party. Really single and very skeptical, this film did not particularly inspire me, but lit a small flame of hope for a love life. Not my love life, as much as the love life of my crazy neighbor who lets her hamster sleep in bed with her. She can find someone.
