<br /> <br /> **************************** AMPLE SPOILERS COMING SOON ********** *** ************** <br /> <br /> We Dive at Dawn is a film directed in English with John Mills in the lead role. The second time I watched the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I must say that the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the same screen. Maybe it's the big-screen viewing that helped? <br /> <br /> I always say that the first segments of the film are confused, but once the submarine has left the dock and begins its mission, the film takes off too! The search for the German battleship named Brandenburg and the adventures that accompanied it were absorbing and the details shown in the film are interesting! <br /> <br /> I increase my score to 7/10. If you like movies from World War II, I think you'll find this interesting once the submarine gets under way. Some of the men on the submarine also have a sense of humor!
