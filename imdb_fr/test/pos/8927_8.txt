I rented this movie with very few expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. This film is extremely good. And you would never guess that this is a small budget. <br /> <br /> EIGHTEEN, directed by 'Richard Bell', is centered on a young Pip, aged 18, performed by the superb 'Paul Anthony' who leaves his home circumstances surrounding how his older brother is death. This event overwhelms him with guilt and falls into the hard life of a teenager on the run, under the influence of drugs and alcohol. On his eighteenth birthday, his father finds Pip and gives him a cassette left by his grandfather, whom he had to listen to on his eighteenth birthday. <br /> <br /> The whole film is told as follows: with two simultaneous stories taking place at the same time. Pip's current life and his grandfather's past life during the 11th World War, of which Pip listens to the tape. <br /> <br /> The three outstanding performances of this film are those of "Paul Anthony" in the role of Pip and "Brenden Fletcher" plays Jason, the young soldier of the 11th World War, aged 18, his Grandfather In addition, the role of the wounded doctor of the 11th World War, Macauley, played by Mark Hildreth.All perform well. <br /> <br /> Some concerns and scenes that I did not like too much. .. the priest, Father Chris, portrayed by "Alan Cumming", who is gay and in broad daylight pick up the street hostler that the whole neighborhood knows, and then we have the local store clerk named Jeff, a love of game played by the seductive "David Beaszely" who just wants to be loved, and for some unknown reason, is attracted to the very clandestine and discreet street dealer, Clerk, who sleeps with anyone and probably a toxic time bomb. In addition to all this, he is not a very friendly person. does not sound right. <br /> <br /> What I like most is the flashbacks of the war. They were so well played and very touching. There is a scene at the end where one of the soldiers is dying and the other, "Jason" is there to comfort him and show him his love while he is seriously injured and dying. It's such a wonderful and touching scene that I'm in tears. Beautifully played. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It is a love, a redemption and the power of the human spirit to survive.
