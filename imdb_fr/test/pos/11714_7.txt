"Sharky's Machine" is clearly a Burt Reynolds vehicle designed to allow the showpiece to unveil its talents. He paints the machine, the plot of the film, with colors from other films and other styles, offering a variety of moods in a nourishing story. . <br /> <br /> Made in 1981 to 119 minutes (which is long for the period), the film is doing well, with box office recipes of $ 37,800,000. There was a lot to gain: the actor and director of Burt Reynolds, a solid one to two shot; a novel adaptation of William Diel and the US South Atlanta, Georgia, a land of opportunity for Hollywood film production. <br /> <br /> Tom Sharky Reynolds falling in love with Dominoe, the hooker Rachel Rachel-with-a-heart-of-gold is here taken as in "Hustle" when he played in front of Catherine Deneuve, and this film also had a corrupt politician at its center, but with a slow end not ending the Hollywood bliss of "Sharky's Machine". <br /> <br /> The story is a pure detective / action procedure. Sharky, a narcotics detective, monitors the bust of a drug dealer, causing the death of innocent people, and is demoted, literally transferred to vice, to treat perverts and other petty crimes that prominent "police" consider as a latrine duty. His new excavations offer him the opportunity to meet many other remarkable officers who do the dirty work nobody wants. When some attention is drawn to a certain pimp, Sharky examines some evidence and discovers that a particular prostitute, Dominoe (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe is protected by police and political forces and Sharky is building a 24-hour monitoring to monitor it. . As he watches, he learns that the current elected governor, Hotchkins (Earl Holliman), is going to Dominoe, as well as an astute Italian gangster, Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before the police can prove the evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, an armed man with coke (Henry Silva), opened the door of Dominoe's apartment, seemingly to have killed the magnificent Dominoe, but when Sharky discovered that the victim was actually a roommate. Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharky confronts Victor and tells him he will stop him. Sharky is captured by Ninja killers led by Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and is tortured for driving to Dominoe. But Sharky masters them, stops the governor and kills Billy after killing Victor after he kills Victor. <br /> <Reynolds wants to expose the inner workings of a hardened policeman falling in love, but the black-robed police plot and Reynolds' ability to develop films tend to hide the dynamics of relationships. <br /> <br /> We learn something about some men, which leads us to wonder why they are trying to get their pension instead of fighting the real crime. This element of the film seems blurry under Reynolds' flippant direction. and performance. <br /> <br /> A Reynolds film is always unique. He likes to hire stars, actors or other characters, then let them improvise, sometimes with varying results. <br /> <br /> The team of "Sharky's Machine" allows him to have good times and sometimes to be surprised. but always a sense of togetherness and kindness. With Reynolds as an author, it works. <br /> <br /> Reynolds, the actor / author always seems to make fun of himself and the viewer as if to say that everything is wrong, but very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Main line: In the scene with Victor when Sharky throws the glove "You walk on people as you own them and you want to know the worst aspect? You are out of state." This seems to be the greatest insult the officer can inflict on a criminal. <br /> <br /> Reynolds shot the film in Atlanta at one point in his career, pulled himself out reading the directory and would surely have targeted and demographics. <Br/> <br /> The film marked the appearance of Rachel Ward, named New Star of the Year in 1981 by the Golden Globe. <br /> <br /> Reynolds has always had a star presence and power and chose to make movies near us, Georgia. <br /> <br /> I received my half.com DVD at $ 7.99 and, unfortunately, it does not contain any comments or editing, which is a shame. Maybe the next generation will have them. <br /> <br /> The movie is still fun and Reynolds and Ward are both great actors.
