This film stayed in a pile of dusty videos at home for centuries before watching it. We knew it was there. Whenever someone wanted to watch a movie, it was suggested. It's almost become a joke ... "I know, let's look Throw mom on the train" ... I do not know why this has always been denied, but just. We did not know what we were missing. It's still hard for me to understand why it took so long ... I mean, it stars Danny DeVito, Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsy (whom we nicknamed "The Lady of the Goonies"), a cast of stars that should have pleased everyone in my house. But here he spent nearly ten years. Until the day it was suggested to us and we could no longer refuse it .... <br /> <br /> It was like looking for the tomb of King Tut ... <br /> < No film has made me laugh so much, and I doubt that a film can ever do it. I had to rewind almost every line because I was still laughing at the previous line and lost the ability to hear or pay attention. Not just laughing, either ... the kind of laughter that spends more energy than running ten miles in the cold. The kind of laughter you can not control, which causes rolling and spasms, and tears and snot running down your face because it's just that funny. Once I learn the movie by heart, I'll say it has faded, but I do not think I'll get tired of looking at it and finding new quirks to enjoy. I think that's all I can say. I would recommend this film to anyone, but if you do not like it, do not let it know, I will probably be offended.
