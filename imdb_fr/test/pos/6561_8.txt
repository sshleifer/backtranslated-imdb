Uzumaki is a visually stunning movie, and I do not think anyone can discuss it. Unfortunately, the story falls a little flat. <br /> <br /> The film is nevertheless very amusing. He uses his wild style to tell a story that does not exist. The film runs almost, based solely on its characters and style, but in my opinion, leaves something to be desired.
