I think it was a very good movie. It shows that someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man, but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him, it led to his destruction. This shows that you can not trust anyone, especially in a world that treats a lot of money and envy. The character I liked the most was Sebeva. She was another ambitious, powerful and ruthless woman in a world of men who loved and respected Kilo. She also knew that business was a dangerous business. All she did was risky but did the job. She helped Kilo become rich with his relationships. Overall, I really liked this movie and have it in my collection while waiting for El Padrino 2.
