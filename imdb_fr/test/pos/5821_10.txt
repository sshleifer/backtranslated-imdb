Oz is by far the best TV show ever seen. Better than the Sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Uncompromising, daring and utterly disturbing but deeply moving. Oz made us forget any image of prison imagined on television. Tom Fontana really did a brilliant job with writing. No subject is taboo. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is the proof of the quality of television. He follows characters of all backgrounds and races, but always returns to your man Tobias Beecher, in jail for manslaughter. We see what we do not want to see, pain, death, chaos. Oz will bother you, make you cringe, make you look away, but most of all, it will make you think. To see Oz is to see a truly magnificent television production
