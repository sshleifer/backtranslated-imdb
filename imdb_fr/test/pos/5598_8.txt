In this particular film, the themes of the end times and Satan against Jesus are treated in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan is thwarted in his attempt to send another soul to hell ... Armageddon, Armageddon and Josaphat turn out to be a - company!, Difficult to open. <br /> <br /> What is memorable in this film are the slanted images, the blurry shots and the light effects, which are effective but sometimes irritating. And of course, Donovan is great as a disillusioned Jesus trying to understand what the world and its people have become! So, go see if you have the opportunity!
