This film was released when I was 15 and I could easily understand the themes. <br /> <br /> It was over 24 years ago and I have not seen the movie since. This time, I fell in love with some actors but I still enjoy the film for what it is. <br /> <br /> Life is not always right and good guys do not always win. In fact, I think the film went well to reflect that, especially in adolescence, the bites were always better with many girls. Plus, no matter how nice you are, you can not do someone like you. Girls / boys love who they want, no matter how difficult you try otherwise. Sometimes you just have to let go and say afterwards. <br /> <br /> Gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for Karen. It's so true of teenagers when they are obsessed with someone. <br /> <br /> I remember sitting with friends laughing at some of the antics. The acting is not quite up to Fast Times at Ridgemount High, but it just makes this movie ridiculous, simply because FTARH has a nice ending for lame viewers, while this movie has a realistic end. Good guys finish last !! Gary seems to be a pretty crazy material, but we all know guys like this, who are far from sensitive. We all know David, a fun guy who makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Some people present say the end but hello the end is exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks go back for more, no matter how much the guy treats them, especially at this age. I experienced this first hand. <br /> <br /> Excellent soundtrack too !!
