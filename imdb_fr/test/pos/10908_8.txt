The first, and much better, of the two gay roles of Kevin Kline. (The second is the sad "De-Lovely" in which he played Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks' moving acceptance speech for "Philadelphia" in which he released his theater teacher, the film nominated in this version was obviously "Forrest Gump" as "Philadelphia". Matt Dillon plays here the character of Hanks. <br /> <br /> The reaction scenes of most movies are very entertaining and, as has often been pointed out, particularly effective, as did Kevin himself, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck (a courageous gesture since he himself was the target of such rumors, which he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as a deserted future wife. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks' teacher criticized the graduation scene by saying that people do not do that in real life. But it's a joke and not the real life. That being said, it's not as effective as it could be and the wrong direction of the final "wedding scene" that suggests that Tom and Kevin are about to be had, I find rather useless, boring and a cop out. <BR /> <br /> For me, the highlight of the movie is, of course, Kevin's scene with the real-man-man audio cassette and it's hilarious, but certainly not at all realistic when the tape reacts to that of Kevin shares. <br /> <br /> All in all, we have fun!
