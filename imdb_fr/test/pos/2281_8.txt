I am very impressed by the critics I read about this film - generally well read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who love movies and think about it seriously. I can not add anything to the excellent editing that IMDb members have already done. If you will allow me, I would like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many critics: Mr. Baseball was American and behaved ugly, but he was NOT an ugly American. The original American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous novel by Burdick and Lederer dating back to 1958, and the exact opposite of Mr. Baseball. Homer was an archetypal American and an archetypal engineer - he went to Vietnam to work with people, he respected and loved the people he met, he used appropriate and sustainable technology in cooperation with his hosts, and he was justly appreciated and respected by them. because he embodied democratic values ​​and American virtues. His ugliness was purely facial, purely cutaneous; his personality and his humanity were deep and authentic. <br /> <br /> Mr. Baseball illustrates all the crude, ignorant and insecure rudeness that we, Europeans and Americans, inflict so often on other cultures; Homer Atkins, the ugly American, was the other side of our coin, representing our humanity and our decency. I think ugly Americans are even more numerous than baseball players. they are always our last hope.
