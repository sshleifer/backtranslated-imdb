I do not think this film deserves the low note most people will give it. This is one of the best horror movies "teenagers" I have ever seen; and that says a lot. Nothing remains without explanation, the characters and plot break countless stereotypes of horror movies, and it has nothing to do with other horrible pieces we have been subjected to recently. (A clear example is the "Holy Angel" without brains.) The first 30 to 40 minutes can be downright boring except for the beginning, though small, minor mistakes are easily spotted. However, after arriving in the village, the horror begins - a kind of different and twisted horror. <br /> <br /> The plot and the details make the gaffes are minor; the characters are the highlight of this film, so many clich√©s are broken. For example, the two main male characters, Nick and Wade, are by no means idiotic types to which we are accustomed; Although Dalton fits this stereotype better, he is not the only one paying for this lack of awareness. Some scenes are really horrible and compensate for the moments of tension scattered throughout the film. And in the end, and while everything is explained with care, it's easy to see that things will not happen so easily for the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> The only mistakes I can see that do not involve continuity (that is, Carly does not find her own cut finger in Bo's pockets, unconscious) lighting, which is annoying for the first time, annoying for 30 minutes. Despite the intrigue and effects, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters in Ambrosia, this little village in the middle of nothing, so I'll tell him. It has been argued that about 70% of the film was illogical; "How can two people build a whole house of wax?", "Where do they find all the wax?" These would not be uprising issues if people would have paid more attention to the film. The Sinclair brothers did not build the wax house; their mother worked on making real wax figures and they were exhibited at the museum. And the scenario where the unfortunate character of Paris Hilton meets his untimely death is the answer to the second question; What about all the personal belongings (cell phones, cars, clothes) of the deceased? Using their third brother as a connection to the outside, it is questionable that the Sinclair twins get the money to buy the wax, in the manner of the Second World War. think the movie deserves a lot more than it receives, and no one should lose the opportunity to watch it. Go see the wax house. Now.
