It's easily my favorite movie. A tragic love story intertwined with a complex mystery whose threads are almost invisible until they finally reveal themselves in a fantastic race. Pure brilliance. <br /> <br /> I would love to see the work of Gilles Mimouni, but at least according to imdb, he did not make other films. Did the high quality of this work make it too difficult to produce another? Has he returned to another sphere of creative activity? I hope it will not be his last feature, but I can not really blame him if he decides to stick to this gem as the only contribution to the world of feature film.
