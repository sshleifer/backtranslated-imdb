I'm not a fan of Faulkner (which is considered sacrilege, especially since I grew up near the author's hometown); However, I think it's a great movie. On par with the quality of the movie "To Kill a Mocking Bird". If you have not seen it, buy it anyway. It's well worth having in your permanent collection. TCM recently played the film as part of the Race on Film series. I wish they play more often. Very moving. <br /> <br /> A little further, the people of Oxford, Mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the images of the town square as it was in the 1940s. The courthouse, the town hall, etc .: they are all on the screen. I never knew that the film was shot there until I noticed the familiarity of the buildings. When I saw the arch in front of City Hall, I started to be suspicious. Look carefully at the pennants on Chick's wall: you'll see two for Ole Miss!
