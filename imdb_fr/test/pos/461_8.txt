A highly literate and intelligent drama about a group of international travelers virtually imprisoned in Hungary in 1956, invading the Russian communist regime. Kerr and Robards play lovers, she a British baroness, he a Hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his part for his country. Anne Jackson and E. G Marshall play in an American couple traveling with their two young sons, including Ronny Howard in his film debut. The character of Jackson is extremely pregnant and does not wish to give birth in a country soon communist. In the third act of this film, she makes a passionate appeal that evokes the naturalistic playing styles we know today of Redgrave, Fonda and Streep. Yul Brynner is at the head of the Soviet Wolf Squad. He is magnificent as a commander and his most sexy since he played against Kerr in "The King and I". He is mean and mean and terribly at odds with his attraction to the beautiful, patrician and heroic Kerr. This is one of the great transition films of the last part of the golden age of the American film. Do not miss it.
