We had not heard much about this movie except it was a national award and an Oscar entry. It's a Marathi film, I can not distinguish an orange apple in Marathi. But when I saw the movie playing on DD1 late Sunday night, I found myself stuck. Now, I'm not a judge of cinematographic techniques and acting skills. But I have watched a good number of films, of various genres, and for an average viewer, I will highly recommend this film. The sensation is very earthly and realistic, although there are melodramatic moments. Look at it to feel human. Lately, I have not seen any film that touches the heart, especially in Hindi cinema. The film is crowned by the return of the young child to the house. The camera moves to reveal the kid, wearing dark glasses, having lost his eyes, the kid hears the other kids splash in the water and starts to clap. I was stunned. And the two hours I spent watching the movie - it's worth it :-)
