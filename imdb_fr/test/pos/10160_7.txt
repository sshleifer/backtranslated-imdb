In appearance, a story about the young child of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The child is kidnapped so that his parents remain silent. They know something about a plot to assassinate an unnamed country's ambassador during a performance at Albert Hall in London. <br /> <br /> The film is rich in Hitchcockiens incidents. A friendly but opaque French seems to grill the innocent Stewart - an Indiana doctor - a little too intensely to just be curious. Later, the Frenchman appears under an Arab disguise, a knife in the back and murmurs information about the assassination plot in Stewart. Stewart told his wife - Doris Day looked very sassy - but refused to cooperate with the police and risked her son's life. <br /> <br /> Instead, the couple tries to find the killers, buy them back, and pick up their son, taking them from Morocco, where Hitchcock gave us the usual view of his tourist on the customs, places and food in London. There is a hilarious pursuit of wild goose involving an arrangement between Stewart and the staff of a taxidermy store. Staff members are more concerned with keeping their specimens half-stuffed than they are, and they walk around in a protective manner holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. During the fight, Stewart managed to save his throat swordfish beak, but is bitten by hand by a stuffed tiger, the action is reinforced by Bernard Hermann's cumbersome score. The scene ends when Stewart rushes to the door. Hitchcock ends it with a lion's whimpering blow in front of the slammed door. There is also a race gag, well done, about some visitors waiting in the couple's hotel room in London, waiting for explanations to be provided. <br /> <br /> There are two serious problems that are slightly addressed. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as rosy as it should be, considered a bourgeois ideal. She is a star of the scene for several years and is known worldwide. And she gave everything to marry an ordinary guy who happens to be a doc. This is understandable, for example, in a nurse or flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star with a promising career in its own right. This is not thorough, but the nervousness is noticeable, because it was not in the original version. It reminds me a bit of the exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then wife, Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from entertaining the troops in Korea. "Oh, Joe," she said, "have you ever seen ten thousand people get up and applaud?" "Seventy thousand," muttered Joe, a former New York Yankees hero. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that of allegiance. Who has greater social value? His own young son? Or an unknown ambassador. Are we putting ourselves or our loved ones at risk to preserve national stability? The day is facing this dilemma in its toughest form at the climax at Albert Hall. His solution opts for allegiance to political stability, although his motivations are problematic. Is she screaming to save the life of the ambassador or is she simply doing it to release the worry that overwhelms her? (See: Alec Guiness lands on the detonator at the end of "The Bridge on the Kwai River.") The photography is extremely good and the setting can be threatening, even on a quiet street in a residential area of ​​London. It's noon and Stewart is lonely and determined, but scared too. There are resonant steps on Gulliver Street from someone, somewhere. Is it followed? Is his life in danger? And where the hell is everyone living on this street? Hitchcock pays such attention to the details of the site that we can distinguish the collage of the garden walls with the bricks next to it. <br /> <br /> The director had a rare disagreement with François Truffaut during an interview for Truffaut's otherwise commendable book. Truffaut argued that the previous version of "The man who knew too much" did not have the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied, "It seems to me you want me to make films for the art house audience," but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur and that this version was that of a professional. No arguments there. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock is almost at its zenith.
