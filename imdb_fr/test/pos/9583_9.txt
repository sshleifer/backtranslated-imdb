It's such a shame that such an important film is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> I do not think Alan Bates made a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> It has never been shown on television. . The only time I can remember that it was shown on British TV, it was in the summer of 1998. I have it on tape but, unfortunately, the quality is not excellent because of an antenna At the time ... I remember having wanted to see this film some time before its broadcast on television. It was broadcast on channel 4 early in the morning, which allowed it to remain invisible, except for a very small audience. <br /> <br /> I lived in Bristol at the time and it was ironic that when I finally saw the movie, I realized that I was in front of the same house where he had been shot several times before !! The film crosses a fine line; a married couple trying to make fun of their tragic situation by having fun with their seriously mentally handicapped daughter and even involving the child in their jokes. <br /> <br /> The staging and acting of the actors are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and never risk falling into bad taste. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I saw an excerpt from the theatrical production filmed with Eddie Izzard in the role of Bri and Victoria Hamilton playing Sheila. <br /> <br /> He showed Izzard the improvisation and jokes and Hamilton jokingly told the public to ignore him when he was like that. <br /> <br /> Maybe I can take this out of context I only saw a brief clip, but after reading the play and seeing the movie, it's clearly a subject so delicate that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Izzard was commended for his performance, but I felt uncomfortable with what I saw. <br /> <br /> It's perhaps surprising that a successful piece failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed. <br /> <br /> One of the best British movies of the 70s and, hopefully, will be released on DVD one day.
