You know, before seeing this movie, I had little sympathy for those involved in criminal cases. I mean, if they were arrested and charged, "they must be guilty," I reasoned? <br /> <br /> I formed this opinion for a few years. You see a good friend of mine has already worked as a detective in some of Sydney's most seedy neighborhoods. He has often complained that his law enforcement efforts have been in vain because of "bloody heart" lawyers and magistrates. He would hit the crooks in the morning and they would be "back in the street at noon". It had disastrous consequences ... they exhausted it. He quit. <br /> <br /> He has quarreled since. , not unreasonably I thought, this collection of creative evidence, to keep the bad guys "where they belong", was ... well ... "acceptable". <br /> <br /> My arguments about the rights of the innocent have been lost "What are the chances that you will be arrested and charged with a serious crime," he says, "and being a law-abiding citizen, his argument convinced me that he was right The odds I thought that the fact that I or my family members or friends were charged with murder or a serious offense was not equal to zero. <br /> <br /> Hmmmmm. <br /> <br /> I send him a copy.
