I like a lot of other people who saw this while I loved it and it horrified me to adulthood. I was trying to find that film and even look for it to see it on TV one day, since it was broadcast on American networks. Does anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have one and would like to make a copy for me? Also, does anyone know if there is a chance to read it again on television? Maybe all of us, fans should write a radio station in the hope of seeing it again. I do not think they've done a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows, people only know the movies of Stepford's wife and husband. Nobody knows that there is a children's version. Maybe they should also do the same thing again because they seem to be doing it a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller / horror movies. Well, if someone has a contribution Please, please write to me with information. Thank you Taira tcampo23@aol.com
