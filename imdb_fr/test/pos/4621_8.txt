Yes, 2:37 is somehow a scam of Gus van Sants Elephant. These are students who face their problems leading to the suicide of one of them. Yes, it's full of clich√©s, but it's life. You can not deny that scary nerds, disabled people or popular students who, despite their popularity, have problems exist in the real world. <br /> <br /> But that's not the reason for this film. It's not about life in high school. It's not about the misery of life itself. <br /> <br /> If you look beneath the surface, in social relations evoking a leaf of soap, you will discover poignant and stimulating critics of our society. <br /> Why do people commit suicide? Do we really understand their motives? Or are we just trying to understand, after it's already too late? And why is it always someone you never imagined? <br /> <br /> This film does not answer this question, but it raises it. And this is done in a very intense way. This prevents you from guessing the blood you see at the very beginning. You follow in the footsteps of some students, all of whom have a more or less good reason to end their lives, just to be forced to watch the macabre act of the finale. <br /> <br /> Did you know who he is? Or have you been caught off guard, as in real life? <br /> <br /> The message is ultimately formulated by one of the surviving children. We are always so focused on our own problems that we forget to see those of others. There may be someone, a colleague, a friend, who does not want to live anymore. But if you do not open your eyes, you'll never know it until it's too late. <br /> <br /> This film is good. There may be some flaws, but they do not matter when everything is over. Either you see a reflection of society, or you are blind to reality.
