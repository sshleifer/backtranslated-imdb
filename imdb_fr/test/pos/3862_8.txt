It's NOT the masterpiece of Snow White, Cinderella or Bambi, but it's a very sweet, nice, romantic and well done Disney animated movie. <br /> <br /> There are of course lessons included in this document. for children and some very suitable children, but there are many for adults too. <br /> <br /> This is sort of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, but elements, which belong only to AristoCats. O'Malley is the "tramp" and Dutchess is the "lady", but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home. <br /> <br /> Phil Harris is our sailor O'Malley. You can recognize his voice because he has also provided the voice of Baloo the Bear in the jungle book and Little John in Disney's Robin Hood. Eva Gabor lends her soft and silky voice to Dutchess. <br /> <br /> Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who directed or worked on every Disney animated film worthy of mention until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> one of my favorite animated feature films from Disney and is part of all Disney collections. The special 2-disc edition is due this summer (2007). <br /> <br /> The rating is 8.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
