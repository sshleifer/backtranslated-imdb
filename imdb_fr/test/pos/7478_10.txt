I loved this film! Fantastically original and different! A solid, intense, hard-core and suspenseful film that has just the right touch of humor (black?). If you are tired of Hollywood B.S. typical, excessive and ridiculous. movies, how many big explosions and terrible and unrealistic shots that insult your intelligence can take us, so this movie is for you. Fantastically original and credible fantasy characters, and strong performances of all actors, not a weak character or a performance in the film. The film of Skip Woods is a breath of fresh air and I applaud its originality and efforts. His film has the feeling of a cross between a film by Quentin Tarantino and a film by the Cohen brothers (not a bad mix at all in my opinion). This film takes you by the throat and do not let go, there is nothing boring or bubble gum in this film. The only disappointment is that no one seems to know it, all the people to whom I recommended it thanked me and shared my opinion on it. This film is a welcome change / alternative to the canned consumer waste produced in Hollywood today, even with their big players, their explosions, their special effects and their huge budgets. It's an awfully wild, intense, violent, graphic, humorous and raw ride (I mean that in a good way, no fake Hollywood polish here). Thank you to everyone involved in making this film, you have done an incredible job!
