No, I have not seen the original series and I will not compare the two if I did. This series is shot in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well written in a different story each week. Some are few but most of the time, it is the quality of the narration. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the episode of Deprogrammers with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a deprogrammer in a world where man became the slave of a kind of lizard reptile . It's funny how lizards and reptiles are our favorite aliens like V, but anyway, he has three days to program a man totally brainwashed to serve exotic species on Earth. The stories are usually a bit distant but very fun to watch.
