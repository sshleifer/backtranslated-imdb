I wish they would bring the surface back. I really enjoyed the show with my family. I felt that the development of intrigue and intrigue were first rate. As the other person said, it seems that everything is reduced to the lowest common denominator. Nothing but rubbish, politically correct garbage survive. Just look on the Internet to see how many people were watching the show. In addition, it is not pleasant to leave us in suspense as to what happened to all the characters in the series. It's the same thing that happened on the time travel show, which I think was called 8 days, but should have been called backstep. Did the Olympics kill the surface? I know that the writers' strike killed another of my favorite shows called the greatest American hero a few years ago.
