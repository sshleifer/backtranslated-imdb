Even though it was a less than forty-minute film, it's one of the best directed and interpreted stories I've ever seen. It achieves in less than 45 minutes what most movies can not achieve in more than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's the story of two brothers, one 18 and the other 10 years old. They come from a poor farm family in Mississippi. Both are caught up in the war and the conflict of duty in relation to the love of the family. <br /> <br /> It made me cry, especially because the whole film is so well played and so much about the history of wars where one is used and the other left behind. <br /> <br /> I can fully recommend this film as beyond superb!
