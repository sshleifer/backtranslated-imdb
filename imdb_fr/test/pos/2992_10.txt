I loved this film! OH MY GOD! This film has rocked so much! I found it among old cassettes and I did not know what it was. After reading the back of the cover, I could see what summer had to say about it. more than once the film did not mention the subject of the film), I found the sound interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older movie. <br /> <br /> "What controversy?" I thought putting the tape in the player, I was curious to understand. And my expectations have certainly been met. I liked it! I guess it's a really feminine movie genre, but it was so sweet and sweet! It was a beautiful romance, although the realization sometimes reminds me of the camera work in "The Graduate", which I thought at the time of looking at it, the director had to be acidic with some of their close-ups. <BR /> <br /> OK, so it was not entirely conceivable for these two children to go live alone ... but that could happen ... in a fanciful way ... <br /> <br /> But the end just simply ticked me off! I was so angry with the way they ended that ... it leaves you hanging out, and I guess they can tell what's really happening to them afterwards ... because the suites are almost never as good as the first ones. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to anyone sixteen and over! It's a great movie ... Awesome!
