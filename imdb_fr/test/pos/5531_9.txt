It is not always certain that by mixing comedians, you provoke laughter. The comics involved must really love each other or admire each other, or be willing to support each other. GO WEST with the Marx brothers asked Buster Keaton to write the scenario as a gag man. Groucho did not care much about Keaton's ideas and bothered him in a scenario meeting. And although some of Keaton's gems still appear in the final film (such as the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a weapon), the film was one of the weakest ever produced by the Marx Brothers. <br /> <br /> A best film, but also affected by comic ego duels, was WC Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, who dumped the scenario of a series of duels between two doubles. But the linings were just as funny, the film remains a success. <br /> <br /> But SIX OF A KIND is an example of six comics that worked well together. The reason is simple: there are really three comic teams working together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were paired in about half a dozen comedies in the 1930s, usually with Boland as a somewhat domineering wife and Ruggles in her husband's wreckage. Fields (usually only one act) were paired three times with Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS and IF I HAD ONE MILLION were the other two times). Skippy has always figured out how to control or thwart her man's bulky activities - this is the actual movie she's taking in hand with the stolen money she's been looking for (she knows the local sheriff, Fields, does not is not the one to trust that). As for Burns and Allan, they manage to get involved effortlessly in Rugby and Boland during their road trip. <br /> <br /> Ruggles quickly realized what a mistake it was to agree to travel with Gracie - at one point she managed to make him fall off a cliff and hang from a branch. He is relatively helpless when he wants to 1) photograph him on his perch and 2) correct his grammar. The presence of George and Gracie's huge dog ("Ran Tang Tang" is the name) does not make travel arrangements for Charlie and Mary easier. <br /> <br /> Fields have special moments. When he insists on shouting against the foursome, he says he's allowed to do it - that's the sheriff! He also explains, during a billiard game, the unlikely story of how he got his undeserved nickname, "Honest John". You have to listen carefully to the story, because he is interrupted when he tries to play billiards a few times (once he has been accidentally knocked out by a billiard ball), but that shows that there were items that even Fields would have no reason to steal. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the "Summary Line", I mentioned a forgotten actor called Bradley Page - he's the one responsible for the problems that Charley Ruggles is suspected of. Bradley must have a reason to leave the city to catch the reckless Ruggles and Boland, so he phones his girlfriend. He tells her to call back his work and tell him that he has to leave the city because of the death of someone. There is a pause as he apparently hears a question from the girlfriend. "EVERYONE!", He said - clearly annoyed. Although much of the humor in the film is carried by the sextet of the performers, Mr. Page had the most fun and unexpected line of the film.
