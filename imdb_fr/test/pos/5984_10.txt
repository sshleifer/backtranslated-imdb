This is one of my favorite movies. a delicious comedy; So I was delighted to hear that it is about to be released on DVD in the UK, in September 2007. <br /> <br /> Romuald, played by Daniel Auteuil, is a rich president of a dairy enterprise. Juliette, played by the excellent Firmine Richard, is a housekeeper in the Parisian offices of the company. Juliette, a black mother of several children, discovers a plot against Romuald who ignores first of all his attempts to warn him. Slowly, he seizes what this charming lady of the lower class of Paris tries to tell him. he seeks refuge in his overcrowded apartment while his marriage and career collapse. An improbable love flourishes. The cultures clash in what is a delicious light comedy.
