One of the many speculations about the Y2K was that the world would end with the midnight stroke of December 31, 1999. In "The Book Of Life", writer / director Hal Hartley looks at the possible ramifications of a new millennium. Armageddon, beginning with the return of Jesus to Earth on New Year's Eve, ?? 99. The story examines the task of the Son of God, who is to open the other three seals contained in the Book of Life (now contained in a Mac laptop), which also include the names of the one hundred and forty-four thousand good souls that will be spared the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan) and Magdalena (P.J Harvey) arrive in New York to prepare for the fulfillment of his Father's testament, but this one begins to have doubts; must he judge the living and the dead? Do they deserve what must happen to them? It is a cup he would rather not kiss at this particular moment, which encourages Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) to fear that the fruit of all his hard work is about to be erased at midnight because he may only continue to work as long as there are people around who cling to their dreams and pitiful hopes. Hartley presents this film conceptually in an intelligent and inspiring way, taking care to treat the sensitive subject so as to render it harmless, even for the most ardent fundamentalist. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan intrigues and stimulates, as well as the effect of their presence on those they encounter during their bodily stay in the city. It is a captivating meditation on the spiritual side of man's fragile existence and a contemplation of what was prophesied in the revelations of St. John in Revelation, the last book of the New Testament. And there is a logic in Hartley's approach to the second coming; it maintains the aesthetics of contemporary d√©cor by using modified film speeds that visually give the film an ethereal quality. Christ discreetly wears a suit and a tie, blending perfectly into the crowd, while Satan's outfit is a little more casual, his appearance a little sullen; he has a bruise above his left eye. Donovan plays the role of Jesus well, lending a benevolent look and a sense of urgency restricted to his character that is very effective. This is, of course, a unique representation of the Savior, and perhaps the best since Max von Sydow in "The Greatest Story Ever Narrated". It successfully transmits a sense of inner peace and tranquility, serenity, that is the essence of the character. And Ryan is deeply committed to his role as Prince of Darkness; he has a distinct manner of speaking and a quality of resonance in his voice that makes him absolutely fascinating to watch. His eyes are penetrating, a trait he uses effectively with stealthy glances and captivating looks. It's the guy who could sell you anything for your soul before you know what hit you. This is a memorable performance that contrasts so well with Donovan's portrayal of Jesus. The secondary cast includes Martin Pfeffercorn (Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edie), Dave Simonds (Dave), DJ Mendel (lawyer), James Urbaniak (true believer), Katreen Hardt (legal assistant) and Anna Kohler (hotel clerk) . In his own inimitable style, with "The Book Of Life", Hartley has designed an interesting, fun and truly unique perspective of the last days. It has a way of capturing life because it's just off-center, a method that works particularly well with a movie like this. Comparatively short for a feature film (63 minutes), it is nevertheless one of the best in Hartley and is well worth the ticket price. It's a movie that will stay with you and maybe make you think of things you may have hidden in a corner of your mind for later. And that's part of the attraction of this movie; you realize that "later" is most likely now. I note this one 9/10.
