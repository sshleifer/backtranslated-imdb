German-Turkish director Faith Akın ("Head-On" and "The Edge of Heaven") follows the German musician and composer "Head-On" of film music "Alexander Hacke" from Einstürzende Neubauten in Istanbul for this documentary that immerses himself in the modern music scene from la arabesque to indie rock and was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Alexander Hacke is a kind guide when he travels to Istanbul with a mobile recording studio and a microphone in his hand, where he runs and records records like classical rocker Erkin Koray, rapper Ceza, Kurdish singer Aynur Doğan, singer Arabesque Orhan Gencebay and pop star Sezen Aksu, as well as rock bands Baba Zula, Duman and Replikas. <br /> <br /> The director has assembled a diverse collection of popular artists and innovative acts among what was at the time a very competitive short list to give an eclectic account of modern Turkish music such as as seen in the streets of its cultural capital. I love and entertain even if sometimes it seems a little hasty and vague. <br /> <br /> "Music can reveal everything to you in a place."
