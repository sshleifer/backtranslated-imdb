It's certainly one of the best Western movies produced in the new millennium. It is a tribute to all the stars of the great classics of Western television, and it is the ultimate renaissance of the Western movie. The story of two brothers who met after the war between the states and who found themselves on different sides of the law is not new but interesting, nevertheless, and the shootings and the atmosphere are great. There is graphic violence such as villains hit to death with an ax or cold-blooded women, and Lee Majors does not take part in the action until the end, which is why I gave 9 out of 10 points. But it's still one of the best new western productions I've ever seen. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Chris McIntyre at the Festival of the West and chatting with him. I also had the chance to meet Buck Taylor, who plays the role of doctor of the city. In my opinion, we should be very obligated to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to bring together so many stars of the classic television westerns and SASS around him in a new western like this one. Chris also has an exceptional talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters. Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more in future Western productions. I really enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute. I hope Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other Western films and present us with other exceptional productions like this one. Great job, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
