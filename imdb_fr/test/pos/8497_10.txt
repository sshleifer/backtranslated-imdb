First of all, it's pure happiness to hear the legend play such wonderful and timeless music. This movie and this soundtrack are a tour de force. Ray Charles is unique and amazing. I really loved the movie, inspiring and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx has become one of the main actors in Hollywood, as Ray clearly shows, and he should get an Oscar for this role, it's unprecedented. In fact, everyone who has worked on this film should receive praise. I really liked Kerry Washington playing the exceptional wife ... Ray Charles was obviously well married. Regina King is a remarkable actress, as well as the extraordinary Sharon Warren, who plays a young mother in trouble. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, I would say that this whole project was providentially organized. The whole cast was perfect, a fantastic scenario and awesome sets ... major props from director Taylor Hackford and his team for doing such a remarkable job bringing Ray Charles's life to the screen blamelessly. This is my picture of the year, certainly one of the best biographical films ever made.
