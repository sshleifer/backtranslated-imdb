I saw The Conseguenze Dell'Amore at the 2005 Rotterdam Film Festival, it was the first of the ten films I saw there. <br /> <br /> The Conseguenze left the most striking impression of the ten films. From the first shot, you know that the movie is going to be something special. The beautiful cinematography left me impressed by what can be done with a camera. The music is also up to the visual elements, complementing the colorful and elegant architectural style images. <br /> <br /> Toni Servillo plays the main character of the film, Titta. It's a tax expert who went wrong and lives in a hotel. Every week, he brings a suitcase containing money to a bank and the story unfolds around this story. <br /> <br /> He is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone; Look calculated and well dressed. He's used to ignoring people who do not care about him. For example, Sofia (very well played by Olivia Magnani), who works as a waitress in the hotel where he lives. Although she has been working at the hotel for two years, he never greets her, even if she greets him. One day she confronts him with this, and the next day he sits down at the bar, instead of his usual place near a window. From there, the story really begins and will unfold in a strong narrative of love, sacrifice and mafia. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the rest of the movie. Watch this movie if you like stylish movies like David Lynch, The Godfather, etc. Do not see it if you love action.
