Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Shot in Southern California <br /> <br /> in the California desert using his fake documentary style, Watkins <br /> <br /> creates a unique film. He follows two groups of prisoners (one <br /> <br /> pre-sentenced the other post-sentenced) throughout the photo. After their <br /> <br /> trial in a military court, they have the choice between <br /> <br /> serving a prison sentence or participating in the Park <br /> <br /> punishment (a trekking three days in the desert with <br /> <br /> clothes on the back) while being hunted by local law <br /> <br /> Law enforcement officers who use the park as training in real action <br /> <br /> on the ground). I can not say enough about this movie. Sometimes you get the feeling that <br /> <br /> you are watching a real documentary. This is one of Peter Watkins' most accessible films <br /> <br />. I advise you to look for it. You will not regret it! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
