When will ART overcome racism? I believe that the American people have grown since this film was shot. Porgy consists of a stellar cast and music. This film is an excellent adaptation of a great opera. that is to say that Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, that Les Miz is based on a classic book. Recently, an opera was introduced here in Los Angeles, based on the movie The Fly. AN OPERA !! So be it !! <br /> <br /> Disney is reluctant to publish Song of the South. The NAACP has not announced any competitions for racing issues and let's not forget that Amos N Andy was a huge success in the 50's as a television series. Ethnicity is part of our heritage in the United States and we should accept all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> PLEASE COMMUNICATE 'PORGY' ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> j hartz
