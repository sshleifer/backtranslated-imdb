We just saw this movie in Austin Texas at Alamo South Lamar yesterday afternoon. He made me laugh a few times! The scene about Albert Einstein's thoughts on humanity struck me again and again and I could not help but laugh. It's a shame that it's no longer in theaters, I know many friends who are dying to see this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you." ... great job to everyone involved! Plus, if you see it, make sure to stay until the end of the credits! I will surely bring my family to see him again this weekend! If you're a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, you have to go see this movie. It's a classic and nobody knows it's out! So, if you're in the mood to see something funny this weekend, take a look at it.
