I'm crazy about Gone With The Wind, but I was disappointed that the movie Gone With The Wind and the Scarlett mini-series are so different from the books. Gone With The Wind left so much in the movie and they did the same thing with Scarlett. Both were good films, but I really liked both books better. There were so many characters left of Scarlett, and the age of some characters did not seem to match the book. The timelines do not match either. Scarlett realizes that she is pregnant on the boat bound for Ireland in the book, but she realizes it when she vomits to Savahanna. Sally is also made to be an ugly monkey like a woman in the book and the film starring Jean Smart to play it, which is obviously not an ugly woman. Overall, Scarlett is a good movie, and it helps all those who were disappointed by the way Gone With The Wind ended to see what would have happened if Margaret Mitchell had lived to write herself a sequel.
