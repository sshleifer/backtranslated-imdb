My tastes in the movies continue to amaze me and probably make the readers of my critics furious, but to each of them, and I have a weakness for crazy horror, slasher movies and See No Evil, it's exactly that and more !! I think the biggest mistake made by the film's producers and filmmakers is that they confront it like a WWE film and "starring" KANE. WWE may have a lot of fans, but it's a very specific group that follows the kind of "sporty" trailer park that's incredibly lame and (sorry), and those who do not like it, do it HAATTTE IT !! This would prevent them from being in front of a gore and typical movie slasher, which people would come out in droves to see. See No Evil breaks NO new horror, that's exactly what happens with typical horror with bloody and horrible scenes that honestly scroll your screen. They really drive her home and go to free violence just cause. There is no specific psychological aspect, although chasing this monster has elements of fear. <br /> <br /> KANE (the wrestler), also known as Glen Jacobs, plays Jacob Goodnight, a physically and physically tortured man. He is the ultimate cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. This is not an original killer and even his murders do not really go to the one or the original with the major exception of choking a girl to death by forcing her to swallow her mobile phone ... yeah! ! He does a good job and the man is legitimately huge !! It stands 7 feet tall and without any special effects is monstrous !! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, and Rachael Taylor all play the typical group of party teens who think they are invincible and will involuntarily fall victim to the serial killer. The story is that in exchange for a month of suspended sentence for minor offenses ranging from theft to possession of drugs, they are sent to an old hotel to do "community service" by repairing. A serial killer lives upstairs and removes his victim's eyes to cleanse them of their sins. Luke Pegler is a shoulder bag that ends up becoming a hero, even saving his ex-girlfriend he used to beat up. The others all play their part very well, but it's not an amazing talent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, porn director ... yes PORN ... Gregory Dark is doing a good job putting together the modern slasher film. He even has a little history with the murderer and although his story is not unique, it is still quite interesting. And in the few shots where the viewer actually sees through the killer's eyes, it's interesting to hear the voices and see things distorted as he does. He throws in the obligatory shot nudity soft core, and grotesque scenes, soaked with blood and everything turns upwards. It works well and for a horror fan like me, it's entertaining. Kane's serial killer is horrible and kills them all with brutal intelligence and a silent horror. The film is spinning and cracking and I do not blame anyone because it's really bad, but is not it the goal? It's a horror movie and I thought it was exactly what it should be. It made me jump, it made me cringe, it even made me turn away from several points ... impressive in every way. It's fun, with a decent story, and a lot of things to do to put See No Evil in series until the 15th episode if they want it and I tell them to do it! It is true that the film is full of holes, laughable details, but the bloody death and the horror that prevails. All this is like loving horror movies? Really love them ?? If so, then you will think that it is an excellent slasher ... otherwise, you will hate it ... simply. 8.5 / 10
