Remove all parts of the movie that were "present" day and stick to flashbacks. Then you would have had a nice story. The story of Faith and Wolf and their relationship was the best part. Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful. Brewster had a hard time sitting down. Surprised to see Blythe Danner as mom. She was great. Also look for Patrick Bergen as a father, always like him (Sleeping with the Enemy). It's a hippie, save the world, kind of movie. Do not worry about it, but I recommend seeing it only for Diaz's performance. It has excellent range and should be used more. Eccleston is, as always, convincing. He is wonderful!
