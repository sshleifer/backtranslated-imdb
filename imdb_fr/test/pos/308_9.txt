Well, I've been watching this movie for over 25 years and it's still as interesting as when I saw it for the first time. It's definitely one of the most unique films ever made. <br /> <br /> I still think Martin Sheen has been "dissected" a lot in the film. He dominates the film, but his bill is inferior to that of Marlon Brando, who appears only in the last 30 minutes of this film of 2 hours and 17 minutes (theatrical version). How unfair is it? <br /> <br /> Sheen is fantastic, especially her narration that continues. It's one of the best stories, if not the best I've ever heard in a movie. His voice haunts as he recounts his thoughts on this incredible nightmarish adventure. I never fail to appreciate his work in this film. <br /> <br /> The other thing that strikes me over the years is the number of memorable scenes I've never forgotten, such as .... .. <br /> <br /> Sheen loses him in his hotel room in the first scene of the film; Robert Duvall and the surf scenes totally irrelevant, then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music resounding helicopters; The Playboy Bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest is scared to see a tiger close up in the jungle; the strange scenes on the long boat trip; appearance of the hippie journalist Dennis Hopper, who salutes the crew in Cambodia, then the strange character of Brando. It goes on and on with strange scenes. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that I liked everything. No, there are some very unpleasant scenes, like the one in which an ox is cut in half (I can not look at it anymore), an innocent family is murdered on a small boat by the young stoned crew of Sheen, and the L ' crew is a little too awkward at times. Then there is the huge amount of blasphemy, driven by too many words. <br /> <br /> There are so many good and bad things in this movie for almost everyone watching them. One thing is certain: it's a movie you'll remember!
