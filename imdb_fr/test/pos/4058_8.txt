It's really very funny. I really enjoyed it, even though it was not that original, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together! All the characters are cool and the story is pretty good. In addition, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy are simply incredible! Rene Russo is excellent in his role, and there is a lot of laughter all along (especially when Deniro plays Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover), and the finale is just great. Yes, it's just another crime detective series "Buddy Buddy", but it works because of the fantastic chemistry between De Niro and Murphy!, Not to mention some great car chase scenes! This is nothing great, but I thought it was a lot of fun and a great way to pass the time! However, the main villain was very weak and was not very good at all. It's far from being the best detective film of "Buddy" Buddy ", but it's still a very entertaining film, and I thought it was pretty well written and written too, and that the end was very funny !. It's really very fun., I really enjoyed it, even though it was not that original, Robrt De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together, I highly recommend this one! very good! Tom Dey does a very good job here with great camera work, cool angles and keep the movie at a fast pace.Playing is very fun !. Robert Deniro is amazing as always and is amazing here, he's hilarious, very friendly, has a fantastic chemistry with Eddie Murhpy doing some of the usual cool stuff, who made really funny faces, who seemed to have fun, who had fun lines and who had a really cool character! (De Niro Rules! !!!!!!). Eddie Murphy is also amazing Here hilarious, as De Niro did his usual funny tricks, obviously loved being in front of the camera, and as long as he In his sleep, he still had a lot of fun watching! (Murphy Rules !!!!). Rene Russo is fantastic here!, She had a great character, and although she did not have much to do, she added a lot of presence on the screen and made her character interesting forever, she was just great ! (Rules Russo !!!!). William Shatner is curious here, surprising and did not do too much, and made the film laugh. The main villain is OK, but weak and rather bland, he still did what he had to do. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall, I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 out of 5
