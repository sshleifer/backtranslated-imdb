NVA combines oriental humor, military comedy and teen film. Although it's kind of a typical German sentimental, I think it's a great and funny movie. You will not only laugh in NVA but will also have a glimpse of East Germany's armed forces in the late 1980s and how young recruits as well as professional soldiers have experienced the fall of the Wall of Berlin and the end of the German democratic conflict. Republic. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy NVA if you liked Sonnenallee (another film directed by Leander Hau√ümann), but not necessarily if you enjoyed Good Bye Lenin, who is much more serious and less funny in appearance. <br /> <br /> The acting is acceptable. But watch former singer Kim Frank who has only two facial expressions: natural and shocked!
