Study of one of these universally familiar, physical and / or emotional states: isolation. I think the film also comments on the cultural shift too. <br /> <br /> The film presents the experiences of two Turkish men (cousins). We have money (and the comfort of being "made" with a stable income); the other does not, and goes out looking for a job. Neither are happy. Do not expect a celebration of life here. It's loneliness, warts and everything. <br /> <br /> The film manages to offer a powerfully dark crossing through the "lowlands" of the human condition. Brave filming. Well done and well shot in my eyes (the shots outside the port being my own favorites). A film that should inspire gratitude to anyone who is no stranger to happiness and fulfillment of life (not to mention employment); everyone will find a companion in this movie. A film with all the heat and rhythm of an ice floe. Expect a bitter pill, not a "happy pill".
