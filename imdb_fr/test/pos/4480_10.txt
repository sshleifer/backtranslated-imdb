The truly bizarre news of Honore De Balzac, on which she was based, receives a troubling treatment, even breathtaking, here, as a kind of forbidden love that flourished in the early nineteenth century. The English actor Ben Daniels, very thin and very blond, plays the role of a young soldier of the Napoleonic wars who gets lost while escorting an exiled French painter (?) Through the steep and dangerous landscapes of the Gobi desert . After literally turning in circles, the two men renounce any attempt to reach civilization. They therefore decide everyone (against your judgment, to separate you) by promising to return to the same place, when and if a source of water is actually found. This is of course how the Daniels character meets the creature (a wild and indomitable female leopard) and ends up forming a seemingly indestructible bond, or rather a love, which saves her life and destroys her almost at the end of the film . An exquisite cinematography, a minimalist dialogue, a somewhat demented story that probably suggests a possible bestiality in about three scenes, are finally what leads professional critics to pan the film like a pretentious and amazing. Even if it is a film that does not suit all tastes, I find that it is a subtle mix, although resolutely left of center, of fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, underlined by the fact that Ben Daniels is forced to play in the face of a wild animal (four leopards were in fact used in contrast to one), which, according to common sense and a slight theatrical knowledge, wants it to be a difficult and difficult work that he managed to shoot pretty brilliantly if you ask me! Overall, I think that the passion for the desert takes a little time to warm up, but if you're a patient who is willing to spend some time with him, he's actually casting a unique spell on you anyway. ; and unlike most platonic stories about the relationship between humans and animals, it's not necessary for a pig, a monkey, or a hairy dog ​​to speak to keep your interest alive.
