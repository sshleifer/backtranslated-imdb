Words, colorful characters, family relationships, coping with difficulties, living with fun and humor. This film has everything and more. What a beautiful story of all men (and all women), with a plot and a scenario of the highest order. It offers just clean fun, lots of laughter, lots of smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family. Other commentators describe the story in part. I'm just going to offer this comparison teaser ?? it is part of the movie "Best of Show", "Grumpy Old Men", "Millions" and many other comedy and life films. <br /> <br /> This gem of a movie probably had a limited release not very available for rent. But, it is now out on DVD and I highly recommend it for purchase. If you like good old movies fun and entertaining for the family, you can not miss with "Manna from Heaven". This film is a sure remedy against the blues or to chase the gloom in bad weather or bad weather.
