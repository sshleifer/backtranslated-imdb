Having recently seen Grindhouse, I was looking in Video USA for films that could have been shot in real Grindhouse theaters downtown in the 1970s. The Hong Kong action film Five Fingers of Death seemed to be just one example . The sound effects of the cartoon and the quick cuts seemed a little awkward at first, but after a while, I was so involved in the story and the characters that did not matter to me. Parts of the score sounded like the theme song for "Ironside" television, later used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies. Some scenes involving the hero's fianc√© seemed to skim the parody, but they were so short that they did not ruin the movie. The most exciting games are the tournament and some revenge segments afterwards. Worth the detour for kung fu fans!
