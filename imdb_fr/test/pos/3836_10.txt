"Balance of Terror" is still one of the best Star Trek episodes ever made. It was inspired by the movie "Enemy Below" (starring Robert Mitchum), a movie about a cat-and-mouse game between two captains during the Second World War. In this episode, Captain Kirk and his crew play the same game with a Romulan ship. It is the program that famously portrays the war-weary Romulans who are distant relatives of the Vulcans. It's an incredibly suspenseful episode, tightly constructed for maximum effect. It's also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story. Mark Lenard debuts in Star Trek as a Romulan captain (he will later play ambassador Sarek, father of Spock). An episode to see absolutely!
