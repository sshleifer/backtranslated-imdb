Meryl Streep as Kate, a woman dying of cancer, plays her role admirably. No wonder she's ready for an Oscar. In this part, she proves that caring housewives are just as important as their sisters in the business world. And the lesson she teaches about the expectations of life and their lack of fulfillment as the relationship grows is the most important thing she teaches her daughter. We can expect too much from our friends. Realize that there are many slips and that forgiveness or understanding are the essential ingredients of a happy life. It is a dark film and the end, though sad, shows the reconciliation between father and daughter. I give this one a ten.
