It is possible to have a good time with this movie while regretting all that it is not. In the 1980s, a refined US Congressman (Tom Hanks) supported Afghan supporters who resisted the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Hanks is in the form of a light breeze, greeted by colleagues, politically incorrect Charlie Wilson, glimpsed for the first time, sharing a whirlpool with three women looking deep. If only the film had the same careless air; but apart from the role of Philip Seymour Hoffman as a cynical agent of the CIA, he also tries to be perceived as a patriot. Aaron Sorkin's well-known staccato dialogue serves his purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of Wilson's great stories. And there is a strangely unexpressed subtext: Wilson's Afghan friends later mutated into Taliban and other anti-Western groups, leaving the world in worse shape than it was during those events.
