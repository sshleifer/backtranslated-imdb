I saw this film during a small projection. Although his budget was low, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this film a gem. It's now April 8, 1994, when each character has reached the age of 20 and is pursuing a kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) by learning about the suicide of Nirvana's singer, Kurt Cobain. They are quickly inspired by the trip from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It is here that the film resumes its life and proposes a series of amusing and emotional scenes. Highlights include: a visit to Jimi Hendirx's grave, Kurt Cobain's childhood home and a campfire. An honest and original job.
