Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with dark shades. It contains a story of childhood and love with ecological implications, but it is not a preaching. Hayao Miyazaki has merged Andersen's little mermaid with the myths of Japan and its legendary flights of steam punk, and the result is very rewarding. There are scary storms at the edge of the ocean and floods, but they are exciting, not horrible. <br /> <br /> If you have always wanted to run with the waves along the shore, ride on a jellyfish like elevator, Transform completely or make a friend for life, Ponyo is a fable for you.
