Hitler's rise to power in 1933, and his "German National Socialist Workers Party", which of course we know as Nazis, tightened their grip over the country over time. At the beginning of their harsh stride of the German people, they called all the artists, journalists and filmmakers within their Nazi headquarters in order to be informed of what the newly declared "Third Reich" ("Empire") had been waiting for. 'them. <br /> <br /> WHEN the master director of the era of silent Impressionists and Expressionists of German cinema, Mr. Fritz Lang, was invited to meet Mr. Goebels; he listened attentively and did not say anything. Immediately after leaving the office of the Minister of Propaganda, Mr. Lang went directly to the station and took a passenger directly to Paris. Not even returning home, Fritz Lang did not return to Germany (at least not until many years later), but stayed in France and finally emigrated to the United States of America. <br /> < Mr. LANG went to work in America and for several years created a series of films among the most amusing, the most solid and the most literally literate, among which there is now the lucky subject of this Last, WESTERN UNION (20th Century-Fox, 1941). <br /> <br /> Typically, a film about the Old West and the Pioneer Days required both quality and a large number of actors. two criteria: we receive a wide range of talents in the show as well Every minute and every scene is a feast for our senses. <br /> <br /> At the head of the playbill are Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore Other people in plain view are people like John Carradine (who plays a vampire or other scary guy, but a doctor), Geor ge "Slim" Summerville (veteran character actor, Silent Film veteran and Mack Sennett's Keystone Comedies), Chill Wills (Supporting player and former still reliable singer in "The Avalon Boys") and the nasty villain Barton MacLane. Added to this are names such as Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Watson Miner, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (brother of Ken Maynard). <br /> <br /> Among the American Indians represented are Big Tree, Thundercloud and Jay Silverheels. Another representative of the Aboriginal Peoples of North America is this remarkable, singularly impressive and memorable example of the red man, the man from Louisiana, Iron Eyes Cody (born Espera DeCorti, of Italian Sicilian immigrant parents) . <br /> The shooting of the outdoor scenes was done on-site in Arizona and Utah, in the highest rank of Technigolour available. (There is no Monument Valley, but then it's the province of Mr. John Ford.) In some ways, this film is a much more amazing achievement than we think; because it took a kind of pulp magazine story, adapted to the tastes and idioms of pre-war America in the late 1930s and early 1940s. All this was done by a German-born director who had been in Hollywood and the United States for only a short time. <br /> <br /> In his last analysis, WESTERN UNION, while it may not be the most historic. a precise example of the western genre; we do not care. It counts in all the categories necessary to spend a good evening in the cinema! SO, who really cares about small details such as "precision"? <br /> <br /> WE give Mr. Lang and 20th Century-Fox a **** rating! <br /> <br /> NOTE: * We have just seen a special show on the PBS WTTW station here in Chicago. it was all film actors, filmmakers and other craftsmen that the Nazi rise to power had forced to take refuge in America and Hollywood. (It would seem that film specialists and scientists were Germany's main export at that time, the scientists who built the atomic bomb, as well as the future members of NASA, came from Europe at that time.) <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
