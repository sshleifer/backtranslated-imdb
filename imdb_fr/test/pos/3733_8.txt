I'm a guy, so I was very hesitant to watch the movie because I know Richard Gear likes to be in Jeremers movies. I would rather watch action / adventure / science fiction. I was right, the movie is really a tearful. Diane has tended to play several times, like Richard, but they brought her and put her to work. The girl was a repressed teenager with a huge attitude, so you started to hate her. The film is too predictable, but for entertainment purposes it was a masterpiece. Go rent it, see if you do not shed a tear.lol If you like the notebook, you'll love this one. The beach scenes were perfectly filmed. Even though the hurricane scenes were a little out of sync, he was still a little panicked to see them react.
