This film moved me to 39 years in the same way that all the pictures and the cover of Dogtown touched me at the age of 13 years. All those who criticized the self-promotion of the interviewed Z boys have the last word to laugh. It was their business ", we are better than all of you and here's why ... (insert a sequence of the most beautiful pool imaginable)" It was a movie to tell their story and that was their story if you did it love or not. It was their opinion of their skating that mattered ..... not yours or mine. I thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as I remembered in the '70s. The reality is that they revolutionized skateboarding, they were the driving force behind extreme sports and they injected a paradigm. cultural that touched every corner of americana. This film revived the images of Bertleman on a wave and Alva and Jay Adams tearing the adaptation that constituted the Californian dream to a whole culture of young American teenagers who wanted only to have fun and be radiant! Watching this film, I realized that it was with these images that I lived every day until I was old enough to move back to So Cal after my family moved to Nor Cal when I was five years old. Until I could come back, my friends and I built and beat ramp after ramp, searched for all possible empty pools and imitated all that Stecyk had covered with these guys. We are all educated and now have a family and careers, but this movie reminds me of who I was at this age and why I'm still surfing. This is an inspired movie that will appeal to anyone interested in pop culture, extreme sports, the '70s or even a good documentary. Whenever it happens on the cable, I can not change channels. Congratulations to Stacy Peralta for making a beautiful work of art!
