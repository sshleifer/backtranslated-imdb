"The Journey" is a very good movie. Produced in the spring of 1958 in Vienna and released in 1959, this film was very popular in its early days. Despite the political problems that have influenced the success of the film (because the story takes place during the Hungarian Revolution and the Cold War), "The Journey" is a very good film, but little known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most people who have seen it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry that exists between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their intense relationship. All their scenes together are very important, but they also reveal the strong feelings, the great passion and the love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is the script, which is very well written. It has even been published as a novel by the viewer George Tabori. The film keeps its tension from beginning to end. At first we did not know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary, because the communist major discovers that Diana's friend, Paul Kedes, is Hungarian and is not allowed to leave the country. The major falls deeply in love with Diana and that's actually the real reason he does not want to let her go. But after kissing her and giving her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on the screen, and kissing her too, he let her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic ends ever filmed - Major and Diana say "Goodbye!", She arrives at the border with all travelers, including Paul, while Surov is shot repeatedly by Hungarians. he dies. Yul Brynner is very, very beautiful and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, refined, like an English lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the greatest couples in Golden Hollywood. A real viewer should watch this movie. "The Journey" has all that a good movie should have: a beautiful captivating story, interesting characters, a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is, in my opinion, at its best). Finally, I want to send a message to Warner Bros. Studios. or those who restore and release classic movies: Thanks for releasing "The Journey" on DVD as soon as possible.
