This film is not the scariest of all time, but it's a fine example of a horror film from the 80s: low budget, no stars, inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep teens their place. The premise is interesting and amusing and the three evil children play their roles well. A good starting point for "Just Say" Julie Brown unveiling her talents early in her career. This movie will not be seen by many, but for fans of the horror of the 80s, it's a must.
