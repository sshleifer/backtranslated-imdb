This film takes a very deep look at the relationship between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who have just returned from Vietnam, face very tense problems. The relationship is not intimately intimate and gives a clear idea of ​​what life is like with a person who is wrong and who examines only the surface of problems. Kathy Bates does a great job in describing a woman of false faith who is unaware of her cruelty, who forgets or simply does not want to be confronted. Jeremy's anger is never to be feared and this leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his father's love for him. It is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event that leads to despair.
