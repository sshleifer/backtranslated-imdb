I love meatballs! Terrible characters and poignant situations make him very much loved. Bill Murray is hysterical and you have to love this 4-mile race at the end! A total classic and one of my favorites for about 20 years now. This brings back good memories of the camp and nicely deals with the experience of rejection by insane peers and the empowerment of being saved by a sympathetic adult. Tons of excellent one-liners and an assortment of wacko advisers. This is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases among friends for years. In addition, nothing grossly open and what a sweet soundtrack of the late 70s to bring with just enough nostalgia. I can not say enough about Meatballs; it's a classic. Be warned! All suites are putrid stinking bombs that simply bought the name of the rights for marketing. They have no connection with Ivan Reitman's masterpiece.
