I do not think I will include spoilers but if I do, I can cover my buttocks. "The Last American Virgin" arrived at a time when adolescence was such. Films such as "Prepies" (1984), "Hot Times" (1974) and the popular "Porky's" (1981) reported a lot. Yet, it's the "Last American" that actually has a more serious plot history among nudity and sexual situations. This is the story often told of three high school friends who want to lose their virginity. They go to the wrong places (prostitutes), the dangerous ones (older women with a jealous boyfriend) and the more convenient ones (attracting their high school counterparts). The film has a lot of fun moments, and although the cast did not produce a single major movie star, it should be remembered for a fantastic soundtrack of the 80s including: Devo, The Cars, Journey and others. Today, the standards are rudimentary and may have earned an NC-17 rating, but it's a well-told story that sometimes, a personal fixation can only cause pain, while the love may be in front of us. This is a small piece of Americana from the 80s that deserves to be included in your movie collection.
