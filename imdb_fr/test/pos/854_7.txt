It was a surprisingly good film and an interesting idea. However, it was a little disappointing in that the 'Twist' was a little too predictable and just a little too early in the movie. While watching, it started to get a little weird and confusing to the point that the only reasonable outcome was the inevitable turn of the plot, but it certainly did not spoil the unfolding of this movie. There have been great performances, there has never been a boring and boring moment, so it's worth it to look at this one. That kept me interested until the end, and for me, few movies can do it these days. I highly recommend people to watch this wonderful little movie.
