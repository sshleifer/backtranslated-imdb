Amazing, amazing, brilliant, beautiful. These are the four adjectives that come to mind when I describe "The kite". The adaptation to Khaled Hosseini's book had already captivated many minds. In fact, he is said to have burst into tears after watching the prime minister. Before I begin, I must say that I read the book before seeing the advanced projection of "The Kite Runner". So, my judgment and my points of view may be slightly biased. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say, although in my opinion the book was better than the final product of the film, it was by no means a bad adaptation. I mean, for a two-hour movie, it has the deserved answer. Things seem a little fast in the last twenty minutes, but other than that, they've managed what the book did. He has captured the spirit and imagination of millions of people all over the world. The magic woven by Khaled Hosseini, to give us a feeling of remorse of joy, sadness, pain, loyalty is clever in this adaptation. Especially in the very first scene, when young Hassan says, "If you tell me to eat earth, I'll do it, but I know you will not ask me." Such a touching line is meant to capture the hearts of many. The two young actors were great, absolutely superb. Especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal Hassan, a boy, who refuses to give up a kite he caught because he promised his best friend that he would bring it to him, then be mistreated by fat tyrants who beat him and used him sexually, and then be reprimanded by his best friend as a coward. The act as a whole is so touching that it can only wet your eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole film is well placed, except the last one. The moment Amir discovers his true relationship with Hassan and reads the first and the last that is not intended for him, when he falls in tears, feeling helpless, isolated and remorseful, it seems a bit hasty and feels that Amir is behind a facade. In the book, Khaled Hosseini devoted 10 to 12 pages to describing Amir's state of mind in this position. But that's what he compensated in the penultimate segment of the film, when Amir defends Hassan's son, his nephew, Sohrab, in front of his father-in-law. The end was well deserved and I'm sure it will be appreciated. He seemed to witness the passing of the torch from one generation to the next. <br /> <br /> Turning to the technical aspects. First, the acting game. Just a word, superb. From beginning to end, the young Hassan and Amir, their father, his friend Rahim Khan. Everyone was superb, especially young Hassan. Second, the direction was amazing, coupled with brilliant camera work. The bottom score was also impressive. From the beginning of the credit until the final credit, and I particularly liked the one where Amir is at the mosque in Pakistan, the Western and Islamic fusion made this event very special. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's certainly one of the best movies, and it's a welcome break from all those Iran-inspired movies that we all floated this year . 9/10 !!!
