It was such a funny film that we quickly forgot, probably because there are a lot of comedies for teenagers and young adults, like this one. The movie is not as predictable as one might think. The crawl is unattractive, but fun and attentive, and especially a very dedicated friend. Yet an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend at home. When he helps her to feel more at home in school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become friends, but it's completely platonic. When she realizes that her boyfriend might make a proposal, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to enjoy her relaxed party life. College life is not yet ready for a life of marriage and responsibility. You know somehow what a good friend Crawl when he tells her that he will help her get out of her marriage. When her boyfriend offers him, in front of the whole family, she gives a kick to Crawl and puts it on the spot. He tells the whole family that he is offering her, and gives him his diamond ring, which is returned to him all the time (he has to come from money or something else ... Well, they never really show a big shot of the ring). The movie's message seemed to be not to judge people by their appearance or to judge people until you knew him. Rebecca's boyfriend, whom his parents love, became mean when we learned that he had drugged his new girlfriend after Rebecca, (Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl, thinking he it was a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was angry at him, which, thinking about it, was a little unfair, since they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to enjoy. And I think she thought there was more. The film never showed them to become a couple, they left the choice open to viewers. They never kissed at any time, although they did almost the same. This is something most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said it would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or shock, but they were just friends all the time, even towards the end. And she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; they never told her parents that they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did it. Even if he would never become his boyfriend, they could have remained friends. In the 90s, for whatever reason, females were there, and there was this big stereo guy that females liked to females (not that there is something wrong), think it comes from that women love the sensitive kind turned out to be, by his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I must admit that if I was looking for looks, I thought I would have left for the first boyfriend. It was still a creative film, trying to give a lesson in friendship and to judge others.
