Some time ago, I saw this when HBO showed it and from what I saw, it seemed like a good movie. so I'm in blockbuster today and I see it there with the DVDs and I decide what the hell. So I rent it. After watching the movie, I was shocked to see how good it was. <br /> <br /> This film touched my heart. Everything was so amazing. Stories, actors, black humor, music !!! Oh, do not get me started in the music of this movie. PT Andderson is one of the greats. Without a doubt the best thing to do since Quentin Tarantino (a god.) <br /> <br /> After finishing the first viewing, I watched it again with Anderson's comment (I was surprised to see how cool it is.) <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in cinema should watch this film, if it's not already done. Anderson is obviously a movie buff. In the film, he rips apart many other filmmaking techniques. Like the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. Obviously snatched from "I am Cuba." But I have no problem with that. The film is very respectable with its scams. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who can handle the film content (porn.) <br /> <br /> 10/10
