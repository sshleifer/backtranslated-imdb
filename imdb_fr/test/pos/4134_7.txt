I have to say it. Gary Busey saved this movie. Without his fine acting skills, this film would have been disappointing. I recommend the movie but hardly. <br /> <br /> The greatest difficulty of the film is its total lack of respect for historical, geographical and physical precision. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How is it that Buddy's producer, Petty, has been ignored? Where are the daily trips to Clovis Studio, New Mexico? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp to destroy the Holly sound? Why was Buddy's two-week course with Maria treated as a complex, taboo, mestizo stereotype? Why are the boxes of Buddy tiles as light as feathers? Finally, why are crickets described as having trouble hindering Holly's talent? <br /> <br /> These inaccuracies, as such, should be condemned to the loss of any film proclaiming "The Holly Holly Story". However, Busey delivers a moving portrait as a man whose death finally led to the day when the music died.
