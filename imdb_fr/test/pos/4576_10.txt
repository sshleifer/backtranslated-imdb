I recommend Idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the film is insightful and made me laugh so much that I had tears in my eyes many times. Until the end, when I caught my breath and realized how close we were to Mr. Judge's vision of tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye out for the comrade's ad for Mac (Justin Long) as Dr. Lexus. I found his performance worthy of an Oscar, especially given the Oscars that have been awarded to him lately ... in addition, he is cute. <br /> <br /> In short, Idiocracy is a fatally amusing preview of a possible future. when people have the brand names of products (the middle name of the president is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion, there are mountains of waste because no one is smart enough to understand what to do with all this, and nobody cares anything but money. All because only stupid people reproduce. It sounds familiar to me, in a way. Oh yes; That's what I think when I see a professional fight ... <br /> <br /> Seriously, watch this movie. It's a good laugh and it will make you think.
