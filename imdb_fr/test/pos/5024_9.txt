An offbeat but delightful performance by John Travolta unleashes this hilarious comedy. His interpretation of the archangel is that of a man with a ruffled, overweight and overweight woman. And, he certainly has a hypnotic effect on the women he meets on his trip to Chicago. John Hurt is very discreet in his role as chief reporter of Chicago Tabloid owner Bob Hoskins. Angie MacDowell plays a role much as she played her role in "Four Weddings and a Funeral". Maureen Stapleton is neat in a cameo. His comment, "Michael does not suffer fools," is just one of many memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only one of the main artists not to connect, a little too far from the wall. Especially since you are here to see Michael take a bull, hypnotize waitresses and dancers in a Western-style restaurant, and fully demonstrate that he is a totally free soul. It's a memorable comedy that's worth more than watching.
