On June 22, 1941, the city of Przemysl, in Poland, is divided between German and Russian. When the Germans invade the city, the Nazis send the Jews to a ghetto. The young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), alone with her younger sister, houses and hides many Jews in the attic of her house for two and a half years until the end of the war. "Hidden in silence" is another good story of human sympathy during the Second World War. This movie looks like "Rescuers: Stories of Courage" and is also based on a true story. Unfortunately, actress Kellie Martin plays a strong and powerful main character, but she is very weak for such a role. In many dramatic situations, the expression of his face is not convincing. I noticed that many IMDb users liked his performance, but I'm not sure they like it or not. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ocultos no Medo" ("Hidden in fear")
