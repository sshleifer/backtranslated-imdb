A serious Australian film, with all the elements of success. Two Hands represents the ability of Australian filmmakers and actors to produce high-quality, popular material. The film has a new angle of view and uniquely incorporates drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very entertaining on many levels - but I can also understand that it may not be everyone's cup of tea. The film carries a distinct Australian humor, depicting Sydney's seedy underground world and exploring the lives of a young man (Ledger) and a young woman (Byrne), trained in the local crime scene. <br /> <br /> Two Hands addresses the theme of good and evil, personally and interpersonally, and discusses the implications for "our" actions. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is delusional and humorous dialogue. With Bryan Brown playing Jimmy in Pando and Heath Ledger, take on the screen in the most bizarre situations - this Australian film is certainly not short of talent for drama. <br /> a bit of a cult favorite, and one of mine too.
