Well, what do you know, I was painting my house today and a song by Elton John was broadcast on the radio, which immediately brought me back to that movie I saw in 1971. There is so long and so far. Ten years later, I hitchhiked across France and would have liked to see Michelle. The film is probably not very sophisticated compared to current standards, more damage, but it seemed rather racy at the time. A few years later, a sequel occurred. Michelle lived in a Parisian building and Paul came back to meet him, just like the life that had left them, the film was very disappointing. Still, the original was fabulous, and if you can get a copy, praise it, but remember to pay for it and treat it gently. I notice that Americans can be rather prude, so take note, contains scenes and themes likely to disturb Central America.
