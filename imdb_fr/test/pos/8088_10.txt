This film is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It's a movie for both kids and parents, and it's "timeless". I saw this film before Ocean's Eleven and I must admit that the actors of OE have course in advance, but the piece of Klatretøsen is much more realistic and moving. Why I say Ocean's Eleven is the fact that these 2 films have a lot in common and that Klatretøsen is so good! that he can bear the comparison with OE. The 3 youngsters play their role in a perfect way not to believe, compared to what we are used to living in Denmark. The different cases of impossible acts, are treated in a way that does not appeal to many young actors (and sometimes not even to "old boys"). The story ? Once again, he has something in common with Ocean's Eleven, except that the money has been stolen. At Klatretøsen, they must go into the vault. The part in which young people have to take care of Ida's youngest brother gives a good dimension to the film. Try to imagine how to steal a bank with a 2 year old child with a diaper on your arm :-). <br /> <br /> This film can be compared to most "adult" films like MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes, I think it's so good. It is better to see him in a theater, because all the children in the room are commenting on the film and these comments will remain forever engraved in your heart :-). <br /> <br /> Greetings Klavs.
