BLACK WATER must be one of the best Australian movies I have seen in many years. My friend and I sat, shaking hands and jumping to the right places. It's as much a movie about crocodiles as OPEN WATER was a movie about sharks. In other words, creatures are only part of the dilemma, the trap in which people find themselves through the circumstances. How Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich, directors, get as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold. And when I speak of terror, these are not artificially constructed, artificially depressed moments, but small extra touches when you ask yourself "how would you feel about this situation" would lead you to conclude "frightened". The performances were excellent, the cadence and the beautiful cutouts for life in the mangroves were excellent and the last moments of the film were very positive. This is a first feature film suitable for two directors who should, rightly, be very proud. Go see this beautiful film shot and played.
