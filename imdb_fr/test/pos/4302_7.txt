This is an episode of Columbo well done, with a good character but the story does not know enough to interest and does not appear as complex and structured as it was often the case with a film Columbo . This is also for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and does not seem as well thought out. Maybe this movie did not really take itself seriously enough, its atmosphere being mostly light. At least compared to different Columbo films. <br /> <br /> For example, the film has a large amount of comic relief, mainly from the character of Columbo himself. This makes the movie enjoyable, but it also makes you feel like you're doing too much, especially since it does not fit most other Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> The characters are good and Martin Landau plays a double role. It's always funny to see how different he looked when he was a young man. For example, a person like Peter Falk has hardly changed over the years. The film also stars Julie Newmar, among others, who is best known for playing Catwoman in the action series in "Batman" life of the '60s. It's funny how she always moves like Catwoman in this movie . Intentional or is it just the way of acting? <br /> <br /> It's a nice and enjoyable movie to watch, but it also gives you the impression that it could have been much better with a better-thought-out scenario. <br /> <br /> 7/10
