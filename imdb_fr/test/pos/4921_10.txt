This is a classic animated film from the cartoon series! Most of the main characters have plenty of time on the screen, as well as additional characters! The movie focuses on superstar character holidays and everyone has their unique summer fun! It's very funny from start to finish! It has great colors, great music and believe it or not, I've seen it more than any movie. It's great and in my opinion it's perfect!
