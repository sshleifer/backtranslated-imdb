This film tells the life of the author and poet Mishima. He jumps through his past, his last day, and some of his stories, but he is expertly constructed as he moves from section to section. It captures the flavor of the man, his work and his time ... the difficult 1960s. <br /> <br /> I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works. The sets (specially designed to work with the camera) are amazing ... stylized, beautiful and effective. They could serve as an example to any set designer. I woke up at night dreaming of the golden pagoda. <br /> <br /> The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and art. After watching this film, I wanted to know more about the works of this artist. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics or Japanese history.
