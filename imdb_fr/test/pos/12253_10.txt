Jane Craig (Hunter), producer of TV News, meets Tom Grunick (Hurt), current news presenter at a seminar. Their mutual attraction brings them back to his room. The romance, however, is cut short when it appears that Tom is, in his own words, "no good for what I'm doing", and Jane realizes that he personifies everything she hates about the direction television news. The fight comes when Tom reveals he is about to join his news bureau in Washington. <br /> <br /> The initial attraction of Jane and Tom has a second chance, but Jane can leave aside his professional opinion of the man, she is attracted - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is Jane's highly intelligent colleague and fellow journalist. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron's career is losing momentum as he lacks self-confidence and relational skills - and all the classic charm - to become the success of his new colleague, less qualified and less intelligent - Tom -. He also fears that his good friend Jane falls in love with Tom, despite her better judgment, as it becomes more and more clear that Aaron has her own romantic feelings for her. <br /> <br /> This central romantic plot is set in the hardships and tribulations of a television news network office, where moral dilemmas and ethics are quickly resolved and where appearances and dramatic effects become larger and more important. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the bite of well-observed comments and scenes lie. One of the many moments is a scene where Tom meets for the first time the most important animator of the network, Bill Rorich (a role played by Jack Nicholson), and where the camera focuses on their handshake. In a film full of beautiful lines and dialogues, long and short, you realize a lot about the character of these two men with this quick shot with two hands. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the characters is one of the most intelligent and intelligent. Spiritually, you are likely to never find anywhere on the film and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best part of it, which fits his character, but even the shortest, casual and perhaps overheard conversations of one or more characters moving into a crowded room must be listened to. <BR /> <br /> Hunter is a tour de force in this role for which she was nominated to an Oscar rightly (and not alone), and for which she would probably have obtained it if he was acting in a movie 'imitate some of what had become a closely related industry - and against the strong performance of another actress in a more traditional, comic, rom-com style. <br /> <br /> Brooks is as good as Aaron Altman, sometimes too unhappy for his good. <br /> Hurt, although possessing the looks and bringing the required personality to his character, does not always convince that he is so weak spiritual the character says he is or is supposed to be. He displays a latent intelligence that allows him to make the most of his apparent limitations, which may be plausible, but I do not think Hurt gets away with it altogether. Aside from telling us that he "stinks" or "does not understand," Hurt seems to be a little smarter than that. Otherwise, it's an effective performance, in a role where his character is compromised by his intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter slightly mask Hurt's performance. That's the only negative thing I can say about the whole movie, and who can say that someone else would have done better, or better, when he would be next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this film. <Br /> <br /> Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles and Joan Cusack, among others, provide their support, and Christian Clemenson, the legendary legend of Boston Legal, also has a role to play, as well as the shortest excerpt from Joan Bit brother, John Cusack, whom you do not even see the face. <br /> <br /> James L Brooks has provided us with many quality movies and TV shows. This film should be ranked among the best. Despite seven nominations, he may not have won Oscars, but he has won many other awards and made Holly Hunter a star.
