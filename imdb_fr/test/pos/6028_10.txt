I must tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to watch this movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think this part really worked ... pretty well actually. However, the movie was very good too. Some parts of this movie are really good. <br /> <br /> The film also has a great action. The mystery is pretty hard to understand and Rose [McGowan] plays some "Oscar-worthy" roles at the end of the film, but I do not want to reveal anything. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow are also very good in the film, along with some of the other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like mysteries, action movies or just Rose, I think you'd like this movie.
