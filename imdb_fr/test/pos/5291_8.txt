Like the protagonists of her latest opus, 5 years old, Hayao Miyazaki's "Ponyo" enchants with her boundless innocence, as if the animator had become a child by weaving a story that savored her simplicity. emits an infectious charm during the process. Miyazaki, recalling his earlier works, describes a world of bright colors, visibly clearer, and raw effervescence cheerfully erases the sinister thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessors. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (kindly expressed by Yuria Nara), a fish with a girl's face (making her look like a cuddly child dressed in a pink Halloween costume), escapes from her home underwater and his group of siblings to explore the surface. Stranded to the ground, she is rescued by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year-old boy who, with his mother Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi), resides in a house on the nearby cliff. This initial meeting and, eventually, friendship have a profound effect on Ponyo, who now wishes to become a human being, but by inadvertently becoming so, shifts the balance of nature and unleashes a terrestrial whirlwind. With Sosuke's help, Ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and become a human being. <br /> <br /> Despite the intrigue that lacks the philosophical sophistication of its newest "Spirited Away", "Ponyo" is nothing less than a mind-blowing follow-up, characterized by the extremely minute attention to detail and by the masterly balance between reality and fantasy, as well as simple joys and great fears. It's a simple story that, although sometimes blocked by its tendency to wander like a toddler, stays in step with its childhood pedigree to magically captivate. "I'm going to protect you," Sosuke told Ponyo in a factual way, a childlike statement that is reminiscent of how Miyazaki's story is clever.
