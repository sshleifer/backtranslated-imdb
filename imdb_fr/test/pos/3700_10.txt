This is one of the best TV movies you can see. The values ​​of interpretation, writing and production are first-rate. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo, superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes, just perfect as a boyfriend of the male. However, the best part of this film was showing how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the happy ending. This has shown that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wrecks lives. It's both challenging and entertaining. Congratulations to everyone involved in this exceptional film. <br /> <br />
