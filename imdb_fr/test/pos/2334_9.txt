I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the video tape several years ago and I watch it at least once or twice a year. <br /> <br /> Grammer has an ironic mind that makes this movie a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but it's still very funny. I am very surprised that he has not received higher in the odds. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite comedies. It's just a fun little movie that makes you feel good. And sometimes, that's all a movie is supposed to be.
