Like many others, I had been attracted by the combination of Pollack, Ford and Scott-Thomas. I enjoyed the work of Pollack and Ford on Sabrina, a well made film and a careful rewrite of old material. Upon learning that this film was in production, I ordered and read the book. Immediately, it seemed like it would be a more difficult story to film. The characters are not always friendly, there is little or no humor and the author offers many shortcuts for the plot to focus on its main theme: In the air crash, the brides completely surprised were looking for. Moreover, he imagines that the resolution could be taken at the same time by a bitter exploration of the hidden life of adulterers and that this experience of "big and small" could give a deeper love than any of them before. Although much of the book deals with their bitterness and the growing hatred of their former partners, we finally find acceptance and forgiveness. The scenario retains only the air crash and the difficult situation of the spouses. Where the woman is the aggressor of research in the book, it is the man of the film and the woman is never a voluntary co-researcher. The film has a completely new dramatic sub-plot for Harrison Ford that seems even more artificial than the double coincidence of the air crash. The sub-plot "woman in Congress for re-election" of the woman is also new, but it works better. Public, the expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy can not be satisfied because this story is centered on a very bitter pill. However, when the book reaches resolution and forgiveness, raises the burden of bitterness for the reader and allows lightness, there is no corresponding moment in the film. Although forgiveness is never mentioned, it remains for us to assume that healing after a shooting has a double duty. The character of Ford does not have to be such an unenthusiastic man, and Scott-Thomas's change of accent is a little disconcerting at first. This film is not the dead loss suggested by others. However, it is a difficult film to appreciate because the rewriting and adaptation to the screen are below the standards previously achieved by the distribution.
