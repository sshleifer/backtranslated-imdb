David Suchet, (Poirot), "FoolProof", '03, gave a remarkable performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a towel to mop up the excess mouth with incredible perfection! You can simply look at the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never misses an important element in the suspect's behavior. The beautiful Falls Colors across the English countryside were breathtaking. Megan Dodds, "Bait", 2000, gave an outstanding performance as a very sexy wild woman, able to keep very important secrets away from Mr. Poirot. A very nice film if you really like the game of David Suchet in the role of Mr. Poirot!
