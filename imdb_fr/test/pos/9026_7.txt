This film, will not win any prize for greatness. But if you have an hour and a half free and want a light entertainment, you could do much worse than watching this ... <br /> <br /> The actors are mostly young and pretty, the scenario has some really funny moments and the soundtrack is pretty cool too. Rupert Penry-Jones as Jake seems to have the most fun, while Laura Fraser as Justine is sweet, friendly and fun. <br /> <br /> I rented because I like the series "Spooks" in which RPJ is currently showing And here he is young and buff and the feast for the eyes perfect for a girls' night. <br /> <br /> Get some wine and ice cream and have fun.
