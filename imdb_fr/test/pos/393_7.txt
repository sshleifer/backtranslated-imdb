50's Western very nice. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans. <br /> <br /> Primarily the film of Victor Mature and quite well done in my opinion. <br /> <br /> It's a trapper who joins a border post as a scout. Red Cloud has caught three on their lands and belongings. They all joined the ranks as scouts after their loss. <br /> <br /> Victor has set his sights on the colonel's wife and lives his life at the post without worrying too much about regulation. <br /> <br /> A very convincing action but not a lot of depth or a lot of feelings for the other characters. <br /> <br /> The westerns of the 50s are my favorites and it slides easily to satisfactory satisfaction. A Westerner of this kind is in the pages of the past and may never be transformed again. One to enjoy. Given a score of 7. Likely 6.8, but such films become more and more valuable over time. <br /> <br /> For movie fans ... "The Big Steal" "They live at night" "Side Street" are the most wonderful movies to be enjoyed. Purchased and seen. Black seems to resemble Westerners in a certain way. Some long ago and never forever.
