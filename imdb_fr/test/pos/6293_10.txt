One of our favorites of all time family. When we need to laugh ... we just put this one in and we laugh as if it was the first time we saw it. This film has a good family humor. Pauly Shore is awesome! Without plans for Thanksgiving holidays, Crawl (Shore) is invited to spend the holidays with a conservative student, Becca. Crawl, being a great city dweller, has to adapt to life on the farm to fall in love with Becca. But Crawl is not the only one learning new things. Crawl teaches Becca and his parents how to be more open about their feelings and accept others. It's fun for viewers of all ages.
