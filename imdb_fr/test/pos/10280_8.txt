Not all movies should have this predictable end that we are all so used to, and it's good to see movies with really unusual twists. However, having said that, I was really disappointed with the end of the apartment. In my opinion, the end does not really correspond to the rest of the film and basically destroys the story told. <br /> <br /> You spend the entire movie discovering everyone and his feelings, except the events of the last 2 minutes of the movie would have had a major impact on the character of Everyones but the film ends and leave it too wide open. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was very well done and unlike similar movies such as Serendipity all the scenes were credible and did not go above.
