I just saw Monster Man yesterday. It had been a long wait and after much anticipation and reinforcement, I am happy to say that it has been achieved and met my expectations at all levels. Granted, you really can not expect to hear the intrigue story too much, but after reading some of the reviews about it, I was ecstatic. I mean, what fan of garbage would not want to see a gore movie about a bastard bastard who kills people with his improvised monster truck? I was waiting for a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and I have so much more. It was a horror comedy that really worked. The filmmakers were right to make you feel uncomfortable and make you laugh at the same time. Congratulations to Michael Davis for energizing and pushing the boundaries with sickly humor. Let me list a few reasons why I like this movie so much: First of all, it's the story. This has been done to death in so many other films. A college student knows that his childhood was in the process of getting married. He, the 25-year-old virgin he is, jumps into his Vista Cruiser and decides to make the trip on the road to confess his love, hoping that she will fall head in the hills and all this beautiful life. Hidden in the back of his break, there is a good friend Harley. Harley is the big mouth, former friend, who laughs and talks like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You can not help but love this guy, but if he was your friend in real life, you had to keep a whiffle ball stick on hand (laugh all you want, but do you have any) already been hit?) in check. So, he is a bit odious, to say the least, but we can say that he is a faithful friend, deep in him ... Anyway, they are on the road and when they stop in a bar, they annoy the population. Now they are hunted by a leatherface clone in a monster truck. That's all. Yes, along the way, they find a beautiful hitchhiker, but I'm too lazy and have a hangover to get in now ... so watch the movie. This second thing I like is humor. . This one had the wildest laughs of all the movies since Cabin Fever. How bad is it? Well, I'm not even going to get into the whole cat scene and as far as the "corpse burrito" is concerned, I'll leave that to your virgin eyes as well. The bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and this guy who looked like John Turturro bothered me too. Harley, although a completely odious type of frat boy, can really pull the liner. I love hooves, by the way. I need a new pair. <br /> <br /> The GORE. He pours it heavily. While the first hour is a comedy on the road, the last third is about blood and guts. If the film had not kept such a light tone from the beginning, it would have been a bit disturbing, but considering how all this was played to laugh, there is no way that it bothers you. If you're still in your shoes when that happens, you'll probably see some humor too, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets containing red stuff. I did not see the intrigue coming and when the credits were credited, I was completely satisfied. I had exactly what I was looking for and I'm really happy to have bought it. Just like Cabin Fever, there will be a lot of reruns. <br /> <br /> The look of the film was exceptional. There was this deliberately cheap look that made all this sound in the late '80s and I loved the exaggerated colors. It is obvious that Monster Man was made with a relatively low budget, but a bit like Cabin Fever (sorry I still compare the two), it actually works in favor of the movie. Cabin Fever was an ode to the big 70s, it was the answer of the 80s to that. So take that for what it's worth. No CGI here. This is what we all needed. I'm not quite sure why he did not have a theatrical release because that's all Jeepers Creepers should have been. Thank you my God for the door of the lions.
