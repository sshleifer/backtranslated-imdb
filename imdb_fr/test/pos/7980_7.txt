With "Batman Returns", Tim Burton has given in to a major priority of the American cinema: to give a continuation to a blockbuster. Three years after the most successful film of the year, "Batman" (1989), here is the hero of Gotham City again for the delight of the audience. Like its predecessor, "Batman Returns" had a huge commercial success. Tim Burton has Batman come back again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the Joker did not improve the image of Gotham City. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist and here the second word is summarized by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two crooks wanting to take control of Gotham City will make life difficult in Batman. Her task will be more difficult with the appearance of Catwoman ... <br /> <br /> Tim Burton still worked a lot on the set and it seems that he tried to correct the mistakes of the first film. This means that the director has given way to more controlled sequences than in the first Batman. But he did not neglect the psychology of his main characters. If in the 1989 film Burton had focused on Bruce Wayne / Batman's psychology, here it was the penguin that obviously interested him. The director tried to make him, very well played by De Vito, an ambiguous character. On the one hand, he is full of bad intentions (previously mentioned), but on the other hand, he is looking for his past and would like to be considered a real man. <br /> <br /> "Batman Returns" also appears crazier than its predecessor, especially with the cast. I think of Mich√®le Pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as a Catwoman. In addition, as I write this review, it reminds me that a new version of Catwoman is currently in the cinema. But given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), It is certain that its performer Halle Berry must play an insignificant role next to Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is one of the best films of 1992 and it allows to develop the particular style of Tim Burton. We also find his taste for the strange and the Gothic. For other Batman adaptations for the screen, you can ignore them. "Batman Forever" (1995) and "Batman and Robin" (1997) are useless. I heard that Christopher Nolan was filming the beginning of Batman's story and that it was due to be released next year. Will it correspond to Tim Burton's work?
