This movie was amazing. I was in tears at the end of the film. Okay, I know that acting is bad, but that's not important. The message was clear and clear about God's love for us and the sacrifice of Jesus. The film was realistic and showed real human feelings, whether it was Pete's anger at the blonde's sneers or the guy asking questions. But it also showed the joy of a true relationship with Christ. The cars were great and the actors very hot and that caught my attention. But what I liked the most about this film is the clear message of the Gospel. The mother and pastor supported Ben in his new journey with Christ and tried to be a divine example to others. Nicky D showed that no matter if you have everything the world has to offer, without Christ, it does not matter. Nina showed how a lost but good person can easily miss the target. I loved this movie and I think it will bring many teenagers to Christ.
