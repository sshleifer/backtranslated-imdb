I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. How surprised I was! This is a very beautiful twisted movie that will allow you to prepare well! It's not easy If you only like the police style, brainless, it's not for you. The Cell is a deep and complex film, inspired by films like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, and offering many totally new ideas. Wonderful environments, twisted, good acting and a fascinating story make this movie one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! Be open minded and you will love it!
