I come from Ireland and I thought this film had a weird or two minutes, where the accents were a little different, but not worse than those of Brad Pitt or another American who does it. In addition, I rarely saw a British actor manipulating an American or Canadian accent with the exception of Colin Farrel in Minority Report. This film is a little film and it was fun. No it was not a blockbuster Hollywood production but frankly I'm tired of this shit. I laughed more than a few times and had a good time. It was worth the rental. The main character is a parody about other British gangsters. At least that's how I saw it. If you expect a $ 100 million production, you will be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is: a little entertaining film.
