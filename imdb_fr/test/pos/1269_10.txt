An excellent first film for the director of Batman Begins, comes from the sequel, a film about a man who follows the others to draw on the characters of his stories. A man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he had planned. <br /> <br /> Use a cast of non-actors and his uncle, write to stage the production and make it completely different. Fully autonomous film with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is more than you expected. <br /> <br /> For all those who love Memento and the complex turns, turns, shocks, and messing with the weather, it's definitely a movie for you.
