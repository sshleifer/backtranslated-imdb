This film is excellent! Afraid to watch documentary films? Cancel your shrink and look at Dieter's story. You will not believe how captivating this movie is before experiencing it. I can not wait to say that almost every film about the Vietnam War, including Apocalypse Now, is published. It's a true story, it's a personal story, a love story in flight, a dream of a pilot and a nightmare of being shot down over the enemy's territory. Everything is shot in the style of "back to ..." - Herzog asking the questions on the spot, Dieter answering with a memorable German-English accent, and with a beautiful memory reminiscent of what happened there about 25 years. There is this part that I have repeated many times to my friends: freed from his US Navy plane, Dieter becomes a prisoner of war of the Vietcong. Blindfolded for most days, he is dragged through the jungle of Southeast Asia for miles and miles, barefoot. Tortured, insulted, disoriented, hungry and covered with infectious wounds, they arrive in a small friendly village where they spend the night. The next morning, after walking for several hours, Dieter discovers that someone has stolen his wedding ring. That's it. He can not take it anymore. He starts crying as a result of total exhaustion. The Vietcong men react surprised. Dieter manages to explain what happened. Immediately, the group returns to the village and begins to search for the person who stole the ring. They find the man, immediately cut off his finger and bring the ring back to Dieter. - The film is full of these amazing and surprising situations. The immense cultural differences, the shock of the east and the west, the fear of the unknown (that is to say all that is American, on the one hand, the Asian jungle and its secrets, of the other) are felt throughout the film. Back problems? It's because you sat at the edge of your seat for two hours and you did not notice it.
