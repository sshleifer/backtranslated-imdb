OK ... The end of the present may be somewhat disappointing after what happened before ... And Klaus Kinski should have separated by 10 seconds ... But we must not forget that it is a European thriller really wonderful ... I can not believe that I've never seen this so far ... It's good to know that there are films that still deserve to be spotted ... is really ... Beautiful visuals ... Haunting ... And creates an incredible atmosphere ... Florinda Balkan is perfect as our heroine ... And the scene on the beach with Nicoletta Elmi is one of the most relaxed and perfect that you can see ... Lila Kedrova is another visitor of the city that may or may not be what it seems ... If you miss the hay of European cinema, continue this ... There has a decent wide screen copy going on ... and please, take this out to a restored DVD, someone ... they did it a with the director "Fifth Cord" ... And it's a much better movie
