One of my favorite movies of all time, I've seen it three times already. He summarizes very well the sectors of Isrelai, his humor and his seriousness, as well as most of the problems that live the Israelis. Universal theme of wanting to be accepted and accepted for who you are. A good subtle humor and charisma of the characters that make this film magical and tell a lot about Isrlaei culture and about irony, contradictions and humor, with a great actor, Oshri Cohen. I highly recommend it to everyone, and it's a perfect movie for almost everyone, family film, boyfriend / girlfriend movie, and also says, in addition to Israeli culture, wanting to be accepted, more that everything, how important is the family, with all its diversity and imperfections. <br /> <br /> A very good movie.
