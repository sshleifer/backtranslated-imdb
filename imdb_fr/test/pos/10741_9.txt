This exceptional film is about the best acting you'll ever see, making it a must-see show. The entire cast is excellent, but again, it had to follow Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. I quickly became attached to this film and, apart from a simply good audience scene, it is a first rate entertainment. It's a rare film that deserved all the Oscar recognition it has received. See for yourself and you will certainly not be disappointed.
