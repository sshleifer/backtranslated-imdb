When I first saw this movie, I was just a small child and fell in love with this movie. They do not really make movies like this anymore, I'm looking at it a little bit older now and I still love it so much. <br /> <br /> Humor is perfect and fits perfectly in the film. All gags are a bit childish, but will make adults laugh too, and in a children's movie, it's really very rare. <br /> <br /> The animation is amazing and watching a hand-drawn animation is a breath of fresh air for all the computer animation we see today. The backgrounds are amazing and the coloring amazing. <br /> <br /> The characters are exactly the kind of characters you fall in love with as soon as you look girls will think that the Chipmunks are adorable and that the guys will think the Chipettes are really a little sexy. <br /> <br /> The songs are fun to listen to and some really make you want to cry or get up and dance, it's also fun to watch the visual humor that accompanies them. <br /> <br /> The dubbing is excellent, although the majority of the dubbing is a high-pitched sound, but an interesting thing came up and one of the songs in this movie was slowed down to show the real voices. behind them and it's really a little fun to watch. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a shop or a place to rent, say it, check it out, it's definitely worth it and it's a perfect family movie, it's absolutely incredible, words can not express this movie.
