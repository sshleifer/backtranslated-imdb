Just watched then. It's really awesome. The fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool! It's really like a piece-to-point video game, with incredible melee fights. <br /> <br /> This movie is for fans: "For those who loved this world once and have spent time with friends, get together again and spend your time ..." from this disturbing opening, the story was not very difficult to follow and I never played a game of Final Fantasy. I think it's worth learning about role play in general; the knowledge of the genre helps you a little better to understand some of them. I think though, if you pay attention and accept what the film throws at you, it's pretty easy to understand. There are many things that are not explicitly explained, and if you insist that this is the case, you will probably be disoriented and irritated. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie is like dropping it in the middle of a big saga, and having to put as many puzzles as possible. I like this approach. you are caught in the mystery and confusion that all characters go through. But as I said, just accept. If a strange talking red lion thing comes on the scene, start breaking feet and taking names, and the other characters just say he's an old friend, accept him and move on; you do not need a biopic flashback, or a sit-me sit-me-down. You are here an observer, going beyond your experience and your understanding. <br /> <br /> So: Fantastic graphics and animation, excellent voices, video game style music, involving a story and characters, and maybe even the coolest fights you'll see in a moment . It's worth it, and even if it's the case for fans, it's perfectly accessible to people like me who have never played games.
