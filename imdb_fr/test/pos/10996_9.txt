I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a relaxing, fun and stimulating movie. The absence of sex, vulgarity and violence made the evening the most enjoyable. I particularly enjoyed the Buffalo scene, but it's probably because I live a short distance away. Even so, this film could have been produced in any city. this is the theme that is so important here. I'm just grateful that Manna From Heaven has fallen on us. Try it ... you will like it!
