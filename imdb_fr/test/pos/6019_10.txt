It's easily one of my favorite musicals of all time. Bette Midler is as close to the real magic on the screen as anyone, in turn, is the mother of Gypsy Lee, her gruff, bosomic, brave and very scary mother. It evokes a despair sometimes comical and tragic, but always authentic and very beautiful. Such a charm and energy that she is truly a pioneering woman without borders. This border is discovered for children. Which in turn must be forged in a world ruled by his domineering mother. <br /> <br /> This version is, as I understand it, in its entirety, including the brilliant choreography of Jerome Robbins, as well as the original version. directions of the scene.
