I just saw this movie the other day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I was delighted by his honesty and humor. It was the most provocative film I've seen in a long time - I just can not get away with it for whatever reason. It may not be for everyone, because it makes you think. I do not know if people like to think so much about cinema, which is a shame. The actors who play the Franklins are a find. I could not imagine playing these complicated people with such frankness. Although I thought that some secondary characters were not as good as Franklins, I can totally forgive them - because it's an important film for me. I did not expect so much to like it, but as I think for a few days, it turns out to be a very relevant entertainment.
