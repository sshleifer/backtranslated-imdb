OK, so it must to Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion, it has its own voice and its own identity, mainly because of the direction style of the video, the story resembling a sketch and great performance. Thomas Jane is excellent (the drug show is amazing), Aaron Eckhart too. James LeGros has a short and effervescent appearance - a great mood "they have home Wong". Porzikova's interrogation and the rape scene are memorable, as does Mickey Rourke's cameo appearance - "take a hit". <br /> <br /> Great production B of Hollywood popcorn with strong performances of aspirants and renegades (Rourke). <br /> <br /> Well, take a pic, it's worth it.
