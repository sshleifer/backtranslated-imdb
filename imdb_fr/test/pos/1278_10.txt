Given Christopher Nolan's succession of hit films, it is clear that I would like to consult his filmography: his first feature film shot in black and white in England, lasting less than 70 minutes, produced on a limited budget but containing all the features that made him a great filmmaker and storyteller. <br /> <br /> Although short, the film is no less captivating with its sinuous plot that will let you guess, because the principle does not even scratch the surface of this story, which is quite surprising considering the depth of the structure and the characterization of the story. As we have said, we follow a writer called Bill (Jeremy Theobald) who begins a habitual obsession with following random people he imagines on the streets in a voyeuristic way, which could initially be conceived as a search. , before starting to invent his own. He returns to the charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw), who turns out to be a thief with a particular sensitivity and modus operandi, and soon finds himself hanging around with him making break-ins and speculating on their victim's livelihood , as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blonde (Lucy Russell), a mafia gangster who refuses his advances. <br /> <br /> Telling in a non-linear way that presents scenes that are not quite cluttered at first, it prepares the film for multiple viewing as you study how Nolan maintains this suspense and this intrigue with the public, who waits and asks for more, what is duly delivered. There are enough twists here that make the film turn into a vertiginous crescendo, where the two ends begin to merge, and the brilliance of the stellar story begins to shine. <br /> <br /> It's also amazing to see how, as the first feature film on the cheap, that something clever and sophisticated can be crafted from his own burglary experience, Nolan being involved in all stages of the production, from writing to realization, through the realization and realization, having worked on the project for a year since the shoots can take place only on weekends. I guess this is an example of the modest roots of a successful filmmaker, which should inspire and inspire new filmmakers. Now, I'll wait patiently for Christopher Nolan's Inception, which should be released later this year, and whose trailer is already such teasing.
