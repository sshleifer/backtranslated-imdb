The ultimate basic movie. Elements from Bogie, Welles & Sinatra will leave you sweating and satisfied. In comparison, seeing recent movies, such as "Oceans Eleven (remake)", reviewed with such esteem, especially in Europe, upsets the basket of apples. Films like Rififi have to be projected, evoked and kept alive to remind (pathetic) critics what the true Black classic is. <br /> <br /> Criterion must be commended for its flawless and chic transfer.
