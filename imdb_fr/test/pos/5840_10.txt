Tom Fontana's unforgettable "Oz" is undoubtedly one of the biggest television series ever created. Brilliantly written, played and directed, it is as close to perfection in all forms of art (film, television, literature, music). Hunting in his extreme brutality, he creates a prison world filled with characters ranging from compassionate to terrifying. It's a show that no matter how brutal it is, you can not look away. The combination of professional theater actors with film and television actors allows a range of diverse and original performances. that it was underestimated when it aired on television because of other HBO series such as "The Sopranos", "Sex and The City" and "Six Feet Under". And while all of these shows are true masterpieces, many people forget that "Oz" was HBO's first entry into a one-hour television drama series. It was a brave and risky first entry and with it, HBO hit a grand slam with it. It's as good as that.
