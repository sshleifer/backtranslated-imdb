It's cute. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of black. Another little treat is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the owner of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is the most glorious story to have ever been told. He should sell more copies than the Bible. My parents helped to suggest the release of this film in a local movie theater. The film lasted a week and we were one of four families to see it. The lady who gave the green light (friend of the family) was let go to the theater. I was 3 years old. I burned 4 copies on VHS and finally converted it to DVD. It's beautiful.
