Wow! I just have to say that this show is super cool! I fell in love with the show from the beginning! The idea of ​​the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance of two charming ladies, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they are just wonderful! I'm mostly a big fan of Lauren Graham! she is not only a pretty face, she is also a "monster" actress! I'm not saying that Alexis is not a wonderful actress too ... I think I like Lauren better! anyway, it's a real pleasure to see them on screen, "thrifty" with words! in the words of the immortal Jim Carrey "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
