I recently started watching this syndication show and finding it a bit random. Some episodes are stupid - Doug is unhappy with something trivial / juvenile and behaves stupidly, and so on. <br /> <br /> Others, however, are quite funny and sometimes touching. These include episodes that deal with the complexity of the characters. For example, the theme "A young overweight man in marriage marries a sexy woman" appears in several sitcoms. (Carrie also has something about her appearance - not just a sexy girl.) But, Carrie has an edge - she may be pretty to look at, but she has some extra personality traits, not too far different from his father. <br /> <br /> And she willingly admits - for example, an episode revolves around her lack of desire to be kind to her colleagues. Personally, I find it sexy, but you have to be the right person to be able to live with it. Amiable Doug is a good match. And, basically, to see also likes simple things. Maybe not as much as Doug, whose nirvana watches TV and eats a big snack next to his giant screen, but no culture. This lack of an overly sensitive side is one of the reasons why both have no children. <br /> <br /> Of course, the simple pleasures of a guy have nothing to make fun of one or the other, and add to the charm of the show. They live in the queen like an ordinary working class - that's realistic in that sense. And, overall, sitcom prices fun and enjoyable, especially. if you just want to relax. He is a little tired at the end, so it's probably good that it ends. He ran well. See also Becker.
