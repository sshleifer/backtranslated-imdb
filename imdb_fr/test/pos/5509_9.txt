I do not understand where these bad comments come from. The film caught you on the edge of your seat and made you a little afraid to go to your car at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> The part that gets you is that all of this could happen. Not in the measure seen in the film, but the idea is reality. This film took this reality to make it a nightmare Dee Snider. <br /> <br /> Three inches in the air (the third comes from the corpse in my freezer).
