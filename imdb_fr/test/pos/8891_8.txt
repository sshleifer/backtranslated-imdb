Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: his wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left him, he has a new relationship with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist), he does not know how to start his book. , and his students in his screen writing class are more foreign than most. However, a student (Danny DeVito) is very strange. He lives with his bad mother (Anne Ramsey) and he can not have the courage to kill her. So, he's going to ask Larry for help, making his life from crazy to crazy crazy! <br /> <br /> Stu Silver should have done more! The dialogue, the characters, the whole script is almost perfect! And Danny DeVito proved to me that he was more than an excellent actor: he is an excellent director! Her child's movie, Matilda, is one of my favorite family films and is now one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> It's a black comedy, most jokes talk about murder, but it's funny! All actors fully exploit their potential, whether they are main characters (Billy Crystal) or minor characters a little (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like comedy (who does not?) you'll like it! 8/10 stars.
