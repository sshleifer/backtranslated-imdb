It was a very good 50s western, one of the best I've seen in a decade, and it was on television and on screen. There were certainly three big actors on the marquee: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. It turns out that Ford was the star of this film while the other two stars played supporting roles. Ford had the bulk of the dialogue. He was also the "good guy" while Robinson was the "bad guy" and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson. She played the main role in this film and the character she played was sometimes a little too contradictory. <br /> <br /> Ford performed very well, as usual, especially in Western countries. He played a good guy who did not want to fight, was a peaceful man ...... but if you pushed him ..... look out! <br /> <br /> The story has a good mix of action and rest, without overdoing it. It was a vast Western setting that was put to good use with the CineamaScope widescreen. He also introduced realistic people in a realistic setting. This credibility with the characters, especially the support players, was very impressive. The men surpassed the women in this film, as characters. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak - the only negatives of production. It's easy to understand why these two actresses have never become stars. <br /> <br /> Even though he's over 50, this western is the one you'll still find fast enough to enjoy, no matter what your age. are or what you are used to seeing. For classic movie buffs, it's almost a must with this cast and this good story. Highly recommended.
