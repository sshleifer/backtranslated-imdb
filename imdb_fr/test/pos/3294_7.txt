Director: Tay Garnett, Ford Beebe, actor: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christy, Fritz Ford, Tay Garnett. <br /> <br /> From the number of comments I see on IMDb, it seems like a forgotten movie. It sounds kind of ironic to me, because it's actually one of the first movies I can remember. My mother and little brother took us to see this movie at the Garland Theater in Spokane during its first appearance in the mid-1970s, and I still remember it. <br /> <br /> I'm going out of memory, but I think this is a trapper who has been charged with a crime he did not commit and who is being prosecuted by the law. I think it happens in 1800 in Alaska. A narrator tells the story of the trapper played by Mike Mazurki. Really, it's a very good movie with a fantastic setting. It could be compared to the 1981 Death Hunt movie with Charles Bronson. Both films have a very similar story. Death Hunt is an adult film while Challenge is a family film. <br /> <br /> Mike Mazurki and Tay Garnett were both quite old when this movie was shot, which I find quite impressive when you know that this film was shot in wilderness in Alaska. It was the last film made by Tay Garnett before his death, a few years later. They had both been around since silent times.
