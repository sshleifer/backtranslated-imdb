I'm a big fan of Naruto, even though I did not watch all the episodes nor read all the mangas. <br /> <br /> I really liked Naruto's first film and, to be honest, I was a bit nervous. that it would not be as good (or action-packed) as the first one (mainly because this one in Australia had only one PG instead of one M, which is a US PG-13 or 12 UK). But I was wrong (thankfully)! The animation was more improved (although some of the drawings of the characters by points were rushed) and was very good, especially in the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, let's talk about fighting scenes! The animation and action in the fight scenes were spectacular and very fun! I particularly enjoyed the battle of genjutsu with kankuro and that of Gaara against the warriors metamorphoses! All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari were in the movie, Shikamaru could save her from the warriors dramatically! And maybe they could have a passionate kiss! In my summary at the top, I say that this is more a piece of cinema than a prolonged episode. And it does! The action is very cinematic and the quality of the animation is very elegant, especially during the fighting! Overall, it's an excellent anime movie to see absolutely for all Naruto fans! 5/5! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! Ok, I stop!
