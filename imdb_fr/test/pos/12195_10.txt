Although this film does not have the darkness of the books, it is in my opinion an excellent film. It is a pleasure to camp with the magnificent Stuart Townsend as Lestat. He may not have the blond hair or blue eyes so strikingly portrayed in the book, but to be honest, he would not look good with blond hair, and Lestat clearly aims to look good. . He moves like the predator I always imagined to have for Lestat. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. This is not an interview with the vampire, so do not try to compare the two. The interview is the story of Louis. This is a copy-and-paste version of Lestat. In any case, I highly recommend it.
