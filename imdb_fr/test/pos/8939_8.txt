It's been a long time since a black comedy so original and funny enough has surfaced. If "Eating Raoul" is in your list of the top 100 results, do yourself a favor and find "Entreprendre Betty" immediately. The subject of death being funny has already been attempted (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). Although this film has some brilliant black comedy moments, "Undertaking Betty" is much more stable, with better distribution. Who could imagine that the corporate venture could be fertile ground for an original, uplifting and sincere comedy? I was surprised and you will be too. I highly recommend to see "Engagement Betty" - MERK
