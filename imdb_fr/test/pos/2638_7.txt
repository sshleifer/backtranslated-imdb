_Wildlife_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _Wildlife_ is up to par. <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> Another person wrote the comment above. Of course, The Wild Life is not Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the flica par excellence of the 80s. However, Wild Life is nice if you are not mad about brainless movies (it's especially when you know it's a brain-less movie). The little Latino of Scarface is in this film and he is downright disrespectful ("I have Visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge !!") The colonel also makes an appearance ("Lawsuit ..."). RIP The Colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> This film is no worse than a 6 in comparison with other genres, by the way. It's no worse than a 7 in terms of other teenage comedies from the 80s to that. It sounds a lot like a Cameron Crowe movie. Only the staniels gave him a 5.
