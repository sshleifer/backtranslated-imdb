It is not uncommon for a director's latest film to become a moving masterpiece, brilliantly interpreted and filmed. The casting is excellent, as well as the camerawork. What begins as a merry gathering of a well-educated citizenry from an early twentieth-century Dublin turns into a dark, philosophical narrative of all our fears of death and sometimes dark shadows of the past. Thank you, Mr. Huston, for this last piece of great cinema!
