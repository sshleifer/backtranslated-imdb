I had never seen the original Death Wish in the book, nor Death Wish I (movie). However, Death Wish 3 was the very interested movie. The well-known activist, Paul Kersey, tried to visit his friend, Charlie, but he only visited him a few minutes before his death because Charlie had not paid for the protection of the huge and infamous underground gang directed by Manny Franker. After some altercations during his time in jail, Kersey learned that Franker, with whom he had fought in prison, had his own agenda to make New York a hell (and also his influence) by sending his henchmen to embody the crime every time. everywhere and every day. Because of the luck given by the insp. Richard Shriker who knows his profile well and likes it a lot. Kersey decided to start the war with Franker and his gang. <br /> <br /> I accepted the fact that Death Wish III was one of the most simple and extreme action movies about violence I've seen from the past. This film used the simplest method to tell the story. No heavy narrative story and less useless scenes that was the merit of the film. In the next issue, Violence has been widely used in the film. I thought a lot of viewers might like the Death Wish III action scene because it showed the raw, extreme and explosive action every minute of the movie, especially the climax scene of the movie and the death of Manny Franker to which I thought. it was the maximum action scene. <br /> <br /> As for casting, I think everyone has been good and played well. Charles Bronson made everyone believe he was still as great as Paul Kersey. He did not look like the "big old cat", but the great vigilante. Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very well. His main role in the film made him mean and looked like the big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this film was pathetic. She did not look like the main character. I thought she only had two or three scenes before Franker and his disciple murdered him to heat Paul Kersey. She could have more role to play. <br /> <br /> For my comment, the simple style and extreme violence made this film ideal for fans of extreme action movies. The fast pace with the back and Forth style has made this movie very interesting to watch. Nevertheless, this film had a silly scene and a plot. First, the scene where Insp. Shriker faced Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very lame because you had attacked your guy before he wanted to help him, it looked like the way you hit a guy before he tried to borrow money from him. Haha! it's like a joke! Although I liked the plot when Inspector Shriker was shown later that he was helping Kersey because in the beginning, Shriker looked a lot like the villain because of his gesture for Kersey, but when the film reached its peak, everything was erased so that he did not have a hidden agenda with Kersey. <br /> <br /> In another case, the final scene of the film came back to me. Everyone feels like they are falling because it ended too easily. Franker's gang members seemed unbelievable after discovering that Franker was dead, before his girlfriend and other supporters decided to escape. Finally, Insp. Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to leave his town before the police caught him. I thought this late-stage style could be found in many of Cannon Film's films, but I do not like it. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I agree with Death Wish 3 because of my explanation that I typed first. The casting, and the action was very good and so extreme, even if there was a scene that I do not like. Straightedge and Extreme of Violence could be the best short description of this movie.
