A bunch of feature films featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been shot, but "The Muppet Movie" is the first of all, and the first of the original trilogy, which also includes "The Great Muppet Caper" "and" The Muppets take Manhattan ". He came out seven years before I was born, so I obviously could not see him at the time (and I did not see his two successors on their first outing). However, I saw a lot of Muppets during my childhood, mainly after Henson's untimely death in 1990. I finally had the chance to see this film for the first time in the mid-90s, after hearing the band. original. Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years has not really been disappointing. <br /> <br /> One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing "Rainbow Connection", a Hollywood agent named Bernie, arrives in a boat and invites him to continue a career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes his advice and heads west. He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come. The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, owner of a chain of restaurants with a frog leg who wants Kermit to be his mascot. As a frog, Kermit is disgusted. He refuses and leaves with Fozzie. On their journey across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who will soon become Kermit's love affair) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, while they are all trying to get to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become the mascot of his chain of restaurants. Kermit is therefore more and more in danger! <br /> <br /> The songs are very appreciated by this film, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the name "Rainbow Connection" Oscar nominated at first, and other good pieces follow, such as the catchy song of Kermit and Fozzie, "Movin 'Right Along", and "I'm going to go back there". One day, "a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo." Never Before, Never Again, "the song Miss Piggy sings when she sees Kermit for the first time, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their story seems very sudden. The Muppets of this movie are usually adorable, just like on TV, and some of them provide a lot of humor, especially Fozzie, who makes his first appearance in the movie trying hopelessly to entertain people in a restaurant with and if you know these famous Muppets well, you need to know what to expect.Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the movie can also be fun, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the agent. and Steve Martin in the role of "insolent waiter." Also, it's not 100% comic. <br /> <br /> See this original Muppet movie this year is the first time I've watched them since I screw "M uppets from Space "(one of Muppet's movies after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw this film, which had never happened before when I watched a movie or TV show featuring popular puppet characters! Not only is this movie not very funny, I also think it's a bit too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I said in my review! However, I can not say the same thing about one of the predecessors of this movie, including this one, released twenty years ago. "The Muppet Movie" seems to be the most popular of the band, and as he has so much to love, not just for kids, that's understandable. I doubt very much remains to be said about the movie "The Muppet Movie", which has not been said at one point in the last thirty years, but today it remains a good family entertainment .
