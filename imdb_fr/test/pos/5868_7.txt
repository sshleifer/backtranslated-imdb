Knowing a long time "The Go-Between" Hartley, both in its original form and in the form of a disappointing adaptation of the film Pinter-Losey, it was interesting. "The Hireling" is sometimes almost a mirror image; located in a period a little less distant for the main part, featuring the British Class System exhibition, and containing a determined sports match (boxing takes the place of cricket) which reveals a lot about. <br /> <br /> This refreshes in its focus to a reduced character. You do not know exactly "to know" Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in the romantic sense, but this distance is played appropriately by telling the body language and the flexion of the actors. Your distance from total sympathy with any of the real characters reflects the dormant "difference" that condemns the central relationship. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully subtle and we see more in their "less"; never once did these acting and show performances. These are Stanislavskian interpretations that give the impression that these characters have a life outside the limits of the film. All the other parts are treated very satisfactorily, although they are much smaller in this film than I suppose in the novel and compared to "The Go-Between", an amazing work on disillusionment. <br /> <br /> Disillusion at the center of this film is sadly and emotionally transmitted in the late scenes in which Shaw kisses Miles and is rejected, and in which a drunken Leadbitter confronts Cantrip and Lady Franklin. It's a real pity that what would have been an incredibly poignant end to wasted and sorry lives on both sides of the screen is "embellished" with a small, decidedly strange coda. We're totally baffled by the jump of tone, while Shaw's Leadbitter races and sings ironically "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" as he crushes his car. The political point is largely overtaken by this ostentatious and rather opaque ending. All the sense of subtlety, so effectively conveyed until now, is lost, because the implicit point is loudly and noisily expressed. Agit-prop surely has no place in this kind of delicate period drama. <br /> <br /> On the whole, however, we can not be too harsh. Although this absurd final element is a major flaw, the rest of the film should be praised as a sensitive and evocative film, filled with sadness and detailed observation of how British society was in the past. The languid but limpid touch of Hartley is very obvious. It's just too bad we did not stop at the shocking conclusion of Shaw's drunk scene. Lady Franklin, Lady Franklin's tragic and disordered figure, is suddenly deprived of her place at the epicenter of the film, while the excellent human drama slips oddly into the realm of political notation. Shaw too - the driest and deepest feeling of actors - is betrayed by the excess out of the character that closes the film. So; a fine triumph on a small scale is sabotaged; but we must remember the many positive points. <br /> <br /> Note: - *** 1/2 / *****
