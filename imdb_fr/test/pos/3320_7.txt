Claire Booth Luce's "Women" shows relationships with men through a woman's point of view in a play (and the 1939 film in which Joan Crawford also plays a bitch: a character who could have been Amanda Farrow 20 years ago), who does not have male characters. Here we see the male characters and what group they are. They use women as toys and throw them away, leaving women suffering. Ironically, the women of "The Women", perhaps because they are all we see, are portrayed in a less favorable light, by turns silly and scheming, with the only "kind", (Norma Shearer) , pushing "claws" of the end. In "The Best of All", we see men for soldiers while women are largely innocent and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about women jumping objects. Diane Baker jumps out of a car (in the perhaps most absurd scene in film history, which is not in the book). Suzy Parker falls from an emergency exit. The women of the film embark on the world of work, in search of success and love at the same time. Women were jumping into the future and giving up this type of drama in the next decade. But they would come back in the '80s and' 90s through the novels of characters like Sidney Sheldon and Judith Krantz (though their trashier works are not as good as that). <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the way it looks. I love the glossy movies of the '50s and' 60s. They look so much better than the hard pixelated home movies we've made since, especially in the mailbox version we're seeing at home. television, and on the DVD, with a picture so clear that you can enter it. The look of the crowd of young beauties is also memorable. This movie probably has more beautiful women than any other. He has a model (Suzy Parker), a beauty queen (Myrna Hansen, who was not Miss America 1954, as Rona Jaffe says in the commentary to the DVD, but rather Miss USA 1953, from IMDb: but then), and a Playboy. playmate, (June Blair, from January 1957). My vote goes to Suzy, one of the amazing beauties of all time. His role here is not as terrible as people claim: they only react, as they did then, to the sight of a mannequin (the first one, actually), trying to act. Nobody seemed to care about his success. Her role, that of an apparently worldly woman who proves to be the most vulnerable, is the most complex of the group and she does not pose a problem. <br /> <br /> The most touching aspect of the film is its age. of the woman leads to the time. Hope Lange was 27 years old when they filmed this movie in the spring of 1959. Diane Baker was 20 years old. Suzy Parker was 26 years old. Hope, who seemed to be Grace Kelly's heiress, never made her really big and ended up being Mrs. Muir on TV. According to the IMDb, she ended up living in a house with "crates for the coffee tables" because she had spent her money on causes she believed in before she died at the age of 72 in 2003. This film was supposed to seem to be a very distant and out of place memory by then. . Baker, still on television in the '60s (especially for Richard Kimble), and still active as an actress and acting coach, has just turned 67. Parker found "the best of everything" with Bradford Dillman for 40 years before dying at the age of 70 the same year, Lange did. But here they are, young, beautiful and ambitious to succeed and love, just like their characters.
