Jackie and Candice are excellent in this movie. They are well suited to their roles and have many chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words "Puerto Rican" is very funny, because she is as kind as she can, but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this film, entitled "Old Acquaintance", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They apparently did not agree, so since the film talks about friendship between women, it could have been a problem. Here, actresses admire and respect each other clearly. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supportive roles and they are both excellent, especially Bochner, who has never had a lot of decent roles in the movies, in my opinion. George Cukor did not make a film after that, so it was a good movie.
