This film was not only exhilarating, but it brought me back into the past with its soundtrack faithful to reality. That's what we were saying and doing ... it was the songs we listened to ... throughout the same period, at the same time, all the way south of Alabama. I may not have been part of the skateboard group, but I was certainly one of the observers, sitting on the sidewalk with the old transistor radio, listening to Neil Young, looking at those who were braver than I had hoped. , Turn on their surfboards on wheels, applying the tricks of Alva and Adams, hoping that, perhaps for a brief moment, they would adopt the Zephyr style. It shows how similar we all were during those wonderful days. ~ KLJ
