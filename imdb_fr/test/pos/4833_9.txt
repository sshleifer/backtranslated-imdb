This film is difficult to describe. Although its description of the events that led to the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993, which began after 9/11, is rather precise, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to call this prophetic film, but it certainly gives the wisdom of the playground the common wisdom of "fooling me once, shame on you, fooling me twice, shame on me "come alive. <br /> <br /> Our government has learned Nothing in the attempted assassination of the World Trade Center in 1993 and in the subsequent readings of the 9/11 report shows only many of the mistakes that led to the Attack of 1993 were repeated. <br /> <br /> Some people have criticized the First and Fourth Amendment of the US constitution as partially responsible for the ability of Islamic terrorists to carry out their evil designs, but that is not at all. <br /> <br /> It is certain that those who argue this argument do not support a ban on freedom of expression, a free press or freedom of religion? I certainly hope they do not support the representatives of our government who are able to enter without authorization or warrant into anyone's home or office. <br /> <br /> The FBI, the INS and even the local police could have obtained warrants on the basis of information in their possession, but they chose not to do for various reasons. Moreover, no matter how disgusting or ignorant it is, it is not illegal to speak ill of America or its leaders. Similarly, it is not illegal to own guns or pray for Mecca. <br /> <br /> Consider this, and until Lee Harvey Oswald actually fired his gun at President John Kennedy, he was not breaking any laws. Living in a free society has its disadvantages. <br /> <br /> However, Path To Paradise is a must-see movie that, I'm afraid, will never be seen by so many people. As far as I know, it's not on DVD and 2007 is its tenth birthday and we do not know any relaunch. <br /> <br /> I'm not really surprised, people do not like to document their failures. and this film shows that the various agencies supposed to protect us did not do their job well and for such insignificant reasons, such as quarrels of competence and a refusal to share information. <br /> <br /> It's a shame. as Path To Paradise is well done and captivating and as many have already said, the final scene where Ramzi Yousef (portrayed by Art Malik), the kamikaze who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt of destruction of the two towers is flying Past the World Trade Center after his capture and extradition, he simply says, "Next time we will make both of them fall", is a cinematographic moment that froze me on the spot during several minutes.
