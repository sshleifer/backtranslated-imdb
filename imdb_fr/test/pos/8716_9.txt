I agree with all the previous commentators - it's just the best of all foamy comedies, with Bardot as sexy as Marilyn Monroe, and with a prettier face (maybe there's less mysticism but look how Marilyn paid for it.) I do not think I've ever seen a woman so succulent on the screen, so perfect that even a homosexual man like me was excited about it - and not just for purely aesthetic reasons ( if evangelical fools really want to make their 'convert-a-queer' number, they will really need to upgrade their standards, because no church mouse needs to apply here ...) His breasts, the rest of her figure, her adorable voice, her hilarious way she trembles while walking in a room ... only to arrive in front of a man, the breasts pointed literally, as if in an exquisite confrontation ... <br /> <br /> I think Boyer is one of the greatest men in the history of the film. Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert, and here Bardot, among many others, have played against more great female stars than him. And he was also in "Fanny" with Leslie Caron, and had small roles in "How to Steal a Million" with A. Hepburn, as well as in Deneuve's film "The April Fools" (but not in front of her. The only thing that I could disagree with in my remarks is that even the loud and unpleasant music of opening credits is appropriate - I mean, Bardot is not supposed to be subtle in addition to all the remains, and his essential sony (I do not want to say his voice) is part of his irresistible and, one could even say, an exemplary charm. <br /> <br /> Vidal is very beautiful, even if sulky Brigitte says at the beginning "I do not know why I'm in love with you, you're not even beautiful. <br /> <br /> Dear dear Bardot, truly one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy that she is always with us, as so many real characters disappear so quickly, in all her eccentric splendor.
