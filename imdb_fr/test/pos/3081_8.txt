Robin Hood; Men in Tights deserves to be watched, I recently watched because I have just become a fan of Cary Elwes and this is one of his main roles. Some moments really made me crack so hard! I did not expect you, you know, it was so funny, even the second time you would always fall out of your chair. The cast is excellent, of course, especially Robin de Locksley, Cary, but Blinkin, Sheriff and Little John (do not let the name fool you, it's really big! Lol) and everyone! <br /> <br /> There were some moments of course, the film tried to make a comic scene but you do not necessarily make it laugh, but .... OK. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Cary Elwes and Patrick Stewart appear in a movie together. They both worked on "Lady Jane" in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, older, awwww. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching, quite hilarious!
