Food is always a good subject in movies, as shown by "Chocolate". "Babette's Day" is the same kind of thing. Babette Harsant (St√©phane Audran) is a French cook who fled her native country after the 1871 crackdown. She settled in a very religious Danish village. The inhabitants of this village simply do not need joy. Until Babette prepares them one of his exquisite dishes. <br /> <br /> This film does not only deal with fun in a place that has never known it. Like other Scandinavian films (and films other than Hollywood in general), it shows that a film can hold your interest without using explosions, car chases, etc. It's a movie you can not afford to miss. <Br /> <br /> One more thing. Do you think the Danish word for "feast" sounds a bit like "tastebud"?
