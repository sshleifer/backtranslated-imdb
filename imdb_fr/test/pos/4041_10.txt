I know the girl who did figure skating for the main girl. She has already attended my brother and she was always very kind! I also live in Cranbrook, BC, about 15 minutes from Fort Steele. Haha, I used to go for excursions when I was in primary school. It was a bit weird to see him in the movie. When filming was in progress, I was also lucky to be an extra, because there was a casting call for them at the mall. Now, I really would like to have some. It was such a great movie that I bought it from Ebay. She never came out here (which is a little odd to see that it's partially filmed here), so I was excited when she arrived. I really loved the story and the poler bear was pretty cute. But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, do not hesitate to ask :)
