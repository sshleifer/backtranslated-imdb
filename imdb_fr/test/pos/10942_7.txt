A fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a messy mess and the game of those who nicknamed the voices is almost always bad, but the premise is engaging, the fight scenes are fast and showy and the movie is often pretty amusing . It's a shame that history is such a wreck. There are a few places where I did not know what had happened, it was almost as if five minutes had been cut short and you are suddenly on the next scene without knowing how you got there. The film is poor in explanations and some things do not make much sense, but the film moves slowly, so that its weaknesses are barely visible. It's not a good movie, but it's really fun.
