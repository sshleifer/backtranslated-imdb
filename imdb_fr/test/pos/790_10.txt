There is a common thread in the comedy film that all major comics are far from the law or go to jail. Think of this man-of-war scam artist, W.C.Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, or the Marx brothers in NIGHT AT OPERA, or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER, from Mae West to ELLE AVIÃ‰. The circumvention of the law is inevitable and, when they find themselves on the side of the law, the results are still hostile between the police and the comic. Think of Lloyd in his first interview, WELCOME DANGER, trying to "assist" the San Francisco police department in a wave of crime and prompt police sergeant Edgar Kennedy to want to kill him. Think of Laurel and Hardy as unfortunate cops in MIDNIGHT PATROL. I find that this type of hostility is so obvious in the comedy of all these giants (and their peers) that even a fake film title treats it. Think of Jerry Seinfeld in an episode of his series creating a short film by Three Stooges, SAPPY PAPPIES, where boys end up being electrocuted for murder. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton frequently calls on his opponents in his comedies. Look at STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., Where he's trying to pull his father out of a calaboose. But he actually had more conflict on the part of the police force in his shorts. In CONVICT 13, he is taken back to prison for being convicted of an escaped convict. In COPS (perfect title - if you see it, you will understand), the police of a big city searches repeatedly Keaton, taken for a terrorist). And in THE GOAT, he can not escape the police during most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton is a tramp who is just looking for food. But he is totally unlucky. When Keaton sees a stranger throw a lucky charm horseshoe (which Keaton had previously ignored) on his shoulder, and then finds a wallet full of money, Keaton tries the same thing and hits a cop in the head. The cop gives chase, and Keaton (as if by chance) clashes with another cop, tries to act normally, but ends up throwing the other cop in the path of the first. Soon, he is pursued by three cops. Shaking them briefly, he walks past a window of the local jail where the local murderer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm St. Clair *) is photographed. Passing the back of the barred windows, Keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight in. The desperado notes it and hides as the picture is taken. When Dead Shot flees the police, Keaton appears on all the wanted posters. (* Saint-Clair will eventually become a good director of sound and old comedies, though his biography a stint at 20th Century Fox where his work with Laurel & Hardy was below average.) <br /> <br /> > Keaton flees to another city by train (by disconnecting the cars containing his pursuers from the locomotive and the tender). This is the movie (about) that contains two famous jokes about Keaton. His arrival on the locomotive is distant, closer and closer, and suddenly the public sees Keaton sitting on the cowcatcher. <br /> <br /> The second famous sequence goes later (and may have somewhat influenced Chaplin at the beginning of CITY LIGHTS). Keaton had accidentally knocked out a man who was arguing too violently with a pretty woman with a dog (Virginia Fox). When he sees that the poster calls him a murderer, he thinks he killed him. He is sued in this city by a suspect police chief (Joe Roberts) and momentarily loses Roberts in the park. A "man of war" statue is under construction and the sculptor unveils a clay model of the horse). Keaton is seen sitting on the clay model, trying to maintain his dignity as the horse's clay legs begin to collapse under his weight. <br /> <br /> Keaton manages to meet the pretty Mrs. Fox, who invites her home for dinner. Only he does not realize that his father is Roberts. The last five minutes of the film's sale sign that Keaton flees and avoids Roberts while he and Fox escape together. <br /> <br /> It's a funny comedy and a wonderful example of Keaton's work at its best.
