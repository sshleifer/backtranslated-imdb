I have always loved Frank Sinatra's music and recently, I wrote an article about his story. I was fascinated by the life and legend of Ol 'Blue Eyes. However, I have never seen any of his films. So I wanted to see if his acting was as good as his singing. Well ... it was! I was blown away by his performance in this movie! He really does a great job as a heroin addict, Frankie Machine, who is trying to rebuild himself and auditioning as a drummer for a local band. <br /> <br /> The management of Otto Preminger is also excellent. I did not see any of his other films. I read his biography on the BDIM. He seems to be one of those administrators who has been deeply misunderstood and people have conflicting ideas about him. Looks like this is the kind of person who most likes fans of sects. I have not seen enough of his films to know if he is really brilliant, but now I am curious. I want to see more of his films, because judging by his attempt with "The Man with the Golden Arm", this guy has talent. I also liked the music of this movie. The score definitely contains the kind of music that I will remember if I ever heard it again. That's when you know you got a good score. <br /> <br /> Secondary depictions are also acceptable, including Darren McGavin as a local drug dealer, Eleanor Parker as Frankie's wife and Kim Novak as a lover. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the filmmakers dealt with the subject of addiction, as opposed to modern attempts in films like "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream". In 1955, the mere mention of the word "drugs" provoked controversy and, if you watch the film, the subject remains very discreet. There is only one scene where Frankie actually received a heroin injection in his arm, and they showed the reaction of his face in close-up rather than showing the needle poking through his veins. But he delivered his message without giving it the impression of being diluted. In a powerful drama like this, with powerful performance and direction like this, you do not need graphical representations of addiction to keep the audience intrigued. <br /> <br /> "The man with the golden arm" is a spectacular gem that all moviegoers should discover. It's really an amazing job! <br /> <br /> My score: 8 (out of 10)
