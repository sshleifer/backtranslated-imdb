Yes, it's a Fast Times wannabe, but it's still a decent entertainment. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the comedy are really funny. The scene where the three guys visit the Spanish lady is hilarious, with some flamenco music in the background. The reaction of her marine husband at home is a riot. The feats of guys in crab processing are funny too when they try to "drown" them and when they visit the pharmacist. <br /> <br /> The abortion scene is also a Fast Times scam, but it captures the terror of the situation. You really feel what Karen is going through, and for Gary in his crazy run of money to pay for abortion and facilitate his healing. <br /> <br /> The end is painful to watch, but refreshing and realistic. Viewers will not be prepared for the first time and it will be a shock. <br /> <br /> There's an eye candy for guys with young girls and spanish MILF, but straight men will probably want to skip the penis measurement competition. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack understated too. Check out early, early, U2 (!), The Cars at its peak and an appropriate James Ingram song for tearing, for the surprise ending. <br /> <br /> Some people will hate it and it's a bit dated, like teen movies or grew up in the early 80's should like it.
