Yeah ... I read David Lee Roth's autobiography, "Crazy From the Heat" (which by the way is an amazing read), and DLR says it was his favorite blacksploitation movie in his childhood. In fact, he says he's always imagined himself as a black guy in Southern Cal. Mr. Roth is quoted as saying, "We have seen all the photos of Blacksploitation, and these films have been a huge influence on me, Trouble Man, Superfly, Foxy Brown, Shaft, Cleopatra Jones, Blacula, Rudy Ray Moore. things ... "<br /> <br /> He goes on: <br /> <br />" Dolemite - Rudy Ray Moore - was one of the originals, a blue comic with a blue humor Like Redd Foxx on the first records of the party, so he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent.His answer was not "Bonds." James Bond. "His answer was" Dolemite, motherf ***** ! "We were waiting for this line in all his films." Get Whitey "would appear in every movie at least once, and we would wait They had cars, shoes, weapons, haircuts, slang, scams, and we all knew that all the nice resolutions at the end of the movie were a white bull. * He's trying to feed hungry children, but he's actually a pimp ... a bull **** that was designed so that our dads and mothers could receive it so we can see the photo . "<br /> Spoken like a real genius, so after reading about Dolemite in Mr. Roth's book, I immediately bought a DVD and I really like it. budget, and yes ... I hate rap ... but as a fan of Tarantino movies, I see a lot of similarities, especially some of the 1970's fusion / funk ala-jaco pastorius music throughout the movie I also love the scene where the two cops screw him up for coca and then one of them sniffs a whole bunch like he did a thousand times before, and says something like, "Wow yeah .. it's the real mccoy! "... and then he continues to talk and still has a little coca on his lips CLASSIC! Some of the violence is a bit exaggerated, but shocking, which I would consider to be a positive quality. Not as predictable as I thought so, will certainly pick up "The Human Tornado" very soon, 10 out of 10.
