This film must be the most stupid I have ever seen and therefore deserves a special prize. OK, so it starts pretty well, logic, humor, then changes quickly to complete and express uh f @ rt, @ ss, f√∂ck a stupidity that makes sense. What's strange is that I barely laughed, although I guess it's supposed to be funny, with a very serious message. After a moment of reflection on why I was not laughing, the answer was pretty clear ... this movie is much more realistic than I would like. It is therefore extremely stupid, and yet very wise, if the goal was to reach people who are not "blessed" with many neurons, synapses and electrolytes (eh, electrolytes?). This film could actually be understood at a certain level by a large audience! <br /> <br /> Although they probably only laugh. <br /> <br /> Okay, good try ... <br /> <br /> I'm editing (and adding) my comment because I read some of the other reviews . I first noticed that some people see racism in this movie. Well, it did not cross my mind when I looked at him. However, I can imagine that if you look from this point of view, you will see. We could of course debate the connection between intelligence and race, but I think that's not the place to do it. I wonder, if we evaluated the Huxtable family here, would you complain about their darkness? I do not think so, but I suppose you could ... (besides that, on the 2 wisest people in the world, half, the woman, does not seem to me totally Caucasian, so what's the problem? ') <br /> <br /> Second, the film gets very mixed ratings. from 1 to 10 and all the rest, but a lot of polarization, which means that the movie does its job very well! It excites people, makes them want to talk about it and judge it. That means it's a good movie, whether you like it or hate it. After 5 minutes, it becomes very predictive and boring, but you keep looking at that total crap. I guess you still hope that's not the case. Or maybe it's our clumsy way of looking at terrible accidents. Well, that's certain.
