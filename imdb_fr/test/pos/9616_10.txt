As a long-time fan of Kung Fu movies, I must say it's one of the best I've ever seen. Of course, the plot is not special, but the man entertains him. As most movies of the genre do. This film is action packed and does not make viewers laugh. It's so much fun to see that I always have a smile on my face. This also has an impact on future movies like Kill Bill. (Many of Kill Bill's sound effects come from this film, for example.) This is an essential viewing for all known Kung Fu viewers. This film is filled with fights that are among the best I've seen in the genre. There are few Kung Fu movies that live up to the magic and entertainment of this movie. So, if you are looking for a movie about Big Kung Fu, check this one for sure.
