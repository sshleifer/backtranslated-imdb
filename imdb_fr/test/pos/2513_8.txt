This is an unusual film because it was directed by Twentieth-Century Fox because it is one of the few associations of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had directed films for many studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) about the time she was filming THIS IS MY AFFAIR, but Taylor was a contract player of the MGM and was only featured in this film because he had been loaned to Fox ... Something the studios did from time to time at that time. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because many real characters play a role in the film, even if it's pure fiction. You will see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I do not remember any movies with McKinley or Dewey as a character, although I remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND THE LION and a few other films. Congratulations on seeing a "little president" in a film as the main character! <br /> <br /> The film begins with McKinley taking a young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) aside and asking him to become a special agent for him - and not telling anyone - not even the secret service . The reason is that the president fears that someone in the agency will warn a gang that commits a long series of robberies - all based on inside information. So it's up to Taylor (who is NOT known for his manly roles - especially at this stage of his career) to pretend to be a thug and find the gang responsible AND the man from within. <br /> <br /> However, there are two serious complications. First, if he is able to find the gang members, one of the gangwomen's half-sisters is Stanwyck. Taylor realizes that he has fallen in love with her, but he must also fulfill his duty and hand it over to the authorities. Secondly, since McKinley is the only other person to know the truth, serious problems develop when McKinley is murdered and Taylor is on death row for crimes committed !!! <br /> <br /> The film managed to create a story and put it back in a historical context. While today most people do not remember McKinley or his assassination, the film happens in this interesting time. The acting is rather decent, as Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy support the stars, although I must admit that Donlevy's role was rather docile and ordinary compared to many of his other roles in the cinema. Overall, it's very interesting, well written and not too serious in the romance department. A good outing for all.
