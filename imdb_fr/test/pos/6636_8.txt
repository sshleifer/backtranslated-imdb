Ingmar Bergman's meditation on the war concerns a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (from which country is not specified). To be unleashed in the distance is a war they know only by the news. The war comes to them and as things go on, the war becomes a struggle for survival, as both parties do not seem to care about them. Dark look at the human cost of war and those who are not easily engaged in the battle but caught in the crossfire nonetheless. It's a film ahead of its time, because 40 years ago, the notion of armies at war, where most of the victims are civilians, has become a reality. It is a dark and disturbing film that is presented from the point of view of the average citizen with the complete feeling of hopelessness and confusion that best expresses itself in the thought that was going through my mind, "what should I do now ? ". As an intellectual exercise, the film is of high quality, it is a film that will make you think. As an emotional film, it is touching but never moves completely. I had never been moved, even though the horror of the situation was rocking my brain. (I must say that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas he brings to the table, but I have never been moved by his films, I'm not a fan, I've always been on the side of Fellini in the argument that was better since he had more emotion for his films). Bookings aside, this requires visualization especially as we live in a world where war, for most of us, is just a problem on a television screen.
