When it comes to these weird and strange little crime movies, genres that revolve around characters who are on the verge of scum and live in such a disgusting environment, and also carry that flickering and dark sensation through a rather ugly cinematography and a very dark comedy. Dead Bodies is the kind of movie that Paul McGuigan would like to see. Alas, the infuriating and sporadic Gangster N Â° 1, as well as the same exercise throughout the store, but an interesting exercise of surrealism mixed with realism, the efforts entitled The Acid House are the only ones we have to do so far. Dead Bodies is a play by Robert Quinn based on the screenplay by Derek Landy, a film straddling psychological horror and neo-black. mixing elements of crime and terror with themes related to morality and obsessive and unnatural disorders. <br /> <br /> McGuigan's crime-based efforts in Britain give this feeling a sense of vagueness and distortion, like witnessing someone's nightmare and sitting in the front row. His films are able to disgust some areas and amuse in others with their extravagant and global approach. They carry a very dreamlike sensitivity although they are anchored in a very realistic world, shot down and dark ?? the real world with as much emphasis on the horror and terror of the situations that his characters engender as anything else. Dead Bodies is a film that addresses both rather painful and character-centered situations, as well as a brief introduction to the study of a delicate psychological state of mind. Only here, the film balances the balance between the eccentricity of its characters; the terror of the scenarios in which they find themselves and the questions of morality that arise much better. <br /> <br /> The dead bodies are efficient and rather simplistic without ever feeling manipulative. Her suggestive and conscious tendency to pound at home what people think and feel does not detract from the experience. From the beginning, we meet Tommy McGann (Scott), a young boy whose girlfriend, Jean (Davis), dominates him, his life and the screen every time she spends for the brief time she is. The point about living in an undesirable home; with a work that stacks shelves and a partner with whom he does not get along at all, is presented in a distinct way. So is the way in which the public receives the distinct authorization not to love John, with the greasy, spoiled and expectant attitudes that she possesses so clearly. Later, the film will, of course, remain on the face of a policeman, as suspicions and tensions rise, which is clearly a simple and inexpensive way to tell the public that our hero is not yet in end of his troubles. <br /> <br /> But compare this to Gangster No. 1, where McGuigan's episodic and mistaken method applies to material; an essential point of the vital plot occurs when a character is seen leaving a building by someone else on a "random player" in a scene defined several months after the previous one. The feeling is not so rooted or fulfilling. The installation of Dead Bodies is dominated by Jean de Kay Davis; a femme fatale in itself who just wanted to fight, but not really able to find one. She led Tommy to jump through the rings; go there, do this and that without Tommy ever really reacting in the way he could, mainly because he's controlled by his sex promises. The beginning creates some tension because of Tommy's underestimated reaction to what is happening and it results in a clear release when the initial incident occurs, and John dies. <br /> <br /> If the configuration is simple enough, then It's one thing, but the project starts with how Tommy decides to get rid of John's hands by burying him without informing anyone of his dead as a best friend. Things tighten when it turns out that there was a second body exactly where Tommy buried John, with suspicions, denials and a general disturbance of the ingredients of the day. It is at this point that the film blurs the boundaries between black and horror; In fact, Tommy lives in a big, sinister, scary and even Gothic house that he shares with an elderly relative who lives in the heights of the house. This evokes memories of Psycho and Bates, Hitchcock's 1960 film, which he set up with his mother and where she is. Nor is it a coincidence that this place of potential horror is the scene of John's unfortunate demise. <br /> <br /> Putting a corpse in the hands of the unfortunate man so that it can act as the initial incident is a classic assembly for any black; from the film Ulmer, Detour, until 1945, to a newer and more contemporary film than the movie Dead Bodies, 2006, titled Big Nothing. This film takes place in a twisted movie. rather unpredictable and rather frightening story of genre hybridity and witty games told under a palette of distinctly drained visuals. The voice-over and the thread that the film makes between the true and the false during most of the film help propel it into a neo-black realm; if we consider that the main role is essentially innocent and that his accusations of murder are unjust, then it is one thing, but his attitude towards John saw him at first act without thinking and his concealment of his death was the antithesis that the murder charges. Dead bodies is taught; entertaining to watch without ever feeling exploitative and provides a consistent tone for the rather nasty physical and psychological content to explore.
