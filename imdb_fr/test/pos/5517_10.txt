I enjoyed the film and the fact that it was aimed rather high in the treatment of sophisticated equipment. I saw the film during the preview screening and it was not spoiled by any silly video box that would ruin the end. The performances were pretty good, especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature role. I also enjoyed the look of the movie that gave it a mysterious and challenging look. I also enjoyed some of the "twists" of the plot, and I do not want to give too much in case the video boxes of other countries would not give everything! The scenario was sometimes a little exaggerated, but I appreciated the fact that filmmakers are not afraid to challenge the public with interesting and disconcerting questions about the role of faith in our world. And, while some might find the end a little too open, I appreciated the fact that the film refuses to tie everything neatly with a bow. That's not how life works.
