Nicole Finn (Madonna) has just been released from prison. Although she was ordered to go by bus to Philadelphia, she wants to stay where she was arrested. This is because she claims to have information that could erase her criminal record. Louden (Griffin Dunne) is responsible for escorting him to the bus by his future father-in-law. Louden will still drive in the city (in Rolls Royce, his future stepmother), picking up the alliance and a rare and fat cat for an eccentric collector. Nicki, however, begins the ensuing chaos as soon as she jumps into the Rolls to take over. Between big cats, taxi drivers, hitters, bridesmaids and a wedding cake with rifles, lawyer Louden knows he is no longer in Kansas. Is there a way out of the madness? This film is a wild journey in the comedy avenue. Madonna and Dunnea fit each other perfectly, making their relationship chaotic, as they play their role as ex-unfaithful and impassive advocate, respectively. The script is commendable in its ability to send the viewer into a crisis of hysteria when an unlikely scene gives way to the next and the next. All that is secondary, actors secondary scenery, through the costumes, is also very nice. If you know someone who needs joy, praise this movie. You will both be cheerio pronto.
