SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo? Yes, it will be Elijah Wood again. <br /> <br /> Since the conclusion of "Lord of the Rings", Elijah Wood as Frodo has more and more difficult to get out of this major role. Playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American, Wood has tried every possible way to escape this typographical spread. Now, with "Everything is illuminated," he might have finally realized that. Playing a role that is not as radical as other efforts, it really touches the soul of his character. Still, it's not like Wood is doing it alone. With the help of Liev Schreiber's magnificent adaptation of director Liev Schreiber, and a wonderful performance by newcomer Eugene Hutz, Wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings. "Everything is illuminated" is a beautiful and moving piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood), a young American Jew, travels to Ukraine in search of the mysterious girl who saved her grandfather from going to America. Upon arriving in the country, Jonathan meets all the men who talk, who dance Alex (Hutz) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). While traveling across the country, the three are gradually learning more and more about the history and relationships that Alex and Jonathan never knew existed. <br /> <br /> It's a strange feeling when the film enters its second chapter (it is actually divided into four in total). The first part, although sometimes a bit funny, is mostly serious and intense. So when we get a brief history of Alex and his family in the second part, it's strange to go from serious to hilarious. It does not quite work, but as the film progresses, he is definitely learning his lesson because this mix of humor and sadness merges as time passes. <br /> <br /> To the ultimate credit of all involved, as the story continues, then we begin to fall for more and more characters. Elijah Wood is beautiful, Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that he raises the question of why Hollywood has never really noticed it. The newcomer, Eugene Hutz, is however remarkable. Playing an intensely troubled character, Hutz is absolutely brilliant. He shows the division between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill, and when his character communicates with Wood, you truly communicate with him on a deeper level. Without Hutz, the story is so strong that the film would always be beautiful, but with it, it goes to the next level. <br /> <br /> As the first work of actor turned director Liev Schreiber, history is also a brilliant piece to start. A work of passion (the grandfather of Schreiber himself immigrated to America), he really manages to embrace the emotion of the content and, presenting us with really beautiful landscapes and beautiful shots, he really manages to return his home. The last half-hour in particular is so beautifully created that it's hard for a tear not to form in the eyes of the viewers. It's a moving story and with Schreiber's help, it gets even more powerful. <br /> <br /> Built with the love of a passionate director, "Everything is Illuminated" is a beautiful piece. A road story with a difference, it is beautifully played and written wonderfully. It's a movie everyone should see, and it's the perfect way for Elijah Wood to finally rest Frodo.
