I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid in the 60s. It took my breath away at a young age. I was stuck to my seat in front of the black and white TV. The casting was one of the best I've seen in my life. The musical was one of the greatest ever written. Please, to the Gershwin and Goldwyn families, publish this document as a video or DVD so that current and future generations can experience what, I am sure, what a lot of we did when we saw this high quality artwork. the work of this great man does not go unnoticed for years. I pray and hope that the hearts of these families will soften and that the whole world will see again this great film.
