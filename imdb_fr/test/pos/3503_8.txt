Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this film is good! Although the film does not reach the quality of the TV show, it is still very entertaining and has really nasty moments! I liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material of the series. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time ... with Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise of this film is that they actually have serious actors (Dance and Gambon). After that, I will respect them even more, to have the good sense to take this risk. I have nothing serious to say about this film, it's very funny. Very young, but good, so what? <br /> <br /> One more thing to mr. G: sequence, please! <br /> <br /> **** / *****
