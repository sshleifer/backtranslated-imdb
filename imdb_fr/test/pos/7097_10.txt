This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. He once again stars Lon Chaney in The Wolfman and Glenn Strange in Frankenstein's Monster. Oh yes, John Carradine's cunt is back under the name of Dracula. I like all the actors of this film. I especially liked Onslow Stevens as Dr. Edelmann. (It's written with 2 n's) I thought it was a good idea to have this heartfelt doctor like Talbot condemned. A scene that, in my opinion, is very good is where Dr. Edelmann is immersed in deep reflection as he changes. Everything that worries him blinks before your eyes. The good doctor says no while his perverse side says yes. That's the only reason I did not want Dracula's character to be completely eliminated from this movie. I thought Dracula had no business at House of Frankenstein. If his character was retired, you would not regret it. In this film, the doctor's blood is contaminated by Dracula's, which gives him his curse Jekyll and Hyde. I hate John Carradine and I do not think he should have played Dracula. The other actors playing the monster Frankenstein after the big Karloff did not bother me because they were all doing a good job. But when they ask another actor to play Dracula, it stops there. John Carradine thought he was so tall and powerful. They offered him the role of the monster Frankenstein once and he refused it because he thought he was over-trained. I could just imagine that Carradine is playing the Monster arguing with the director on the set. John Carradine was not Dracula and he will never be. Sorry John, Bela Lugosi is the one and only Dracula. Thank God, they brought Bela back as Dracula for Abbott and Costello. They met Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie. This will not disappoint you and you will appreciate it as you did the other. It's a great addition to monster movies. If you are a collector, be careful not to leave this one aside. <br /> <br />
