The film is a remake of a 1956 BBC series entitled "My friend Charles", and as such galloping through the film in a relatively short time. I found it moving fast, nice and unpretentious. Did anyone else notice the scenes near the end where John Mills was gassed? - the producers have obviously decided to omit the scenes - perhaps censorship ?, but notice that he is sitting near the window of the apartment, a deep breathing followed closely by similar scenes with the window of the open car. Francis Durbridge's series all seemed to live in the same universe, that of unexplained events, people not being what they seemed and the villain being a person close to the hero / victim. A predictable universe in some respects, but with its own rules and regulations.
