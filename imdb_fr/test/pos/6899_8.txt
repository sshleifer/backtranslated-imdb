I saw it at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival and I enjoyed it a lot. It worked for me like a weird comedy, because I do not like horror, but it only took me a few minutes to close my eyes. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was good, the costumes and sets were not far from the BBC quality, which is fantastic for an independent film. I liked the way the plot turns and even the meanders, it always surprised me. I even warmed up Willy Grimes, who I did not like much at first. It would have been better if the woman had been motivated to be so interested in going to the island: it looked a lot like a plot plot. <br /> <br /> I'm fond of Dominic Monaghan and he did a good job of falling, horror and more thoughtful moments. Beautiful voice in the narration too. <br /> <br /> It would be a funny and unusual rendezvous movie.
