Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> Anna Christie has great roles, amazing performances and yet she should be even better than she is. There is drama. Some scenes are really atmospheric, and if the interior shots around the table are boring, other shots at night and at sea are really very exciting. Then there are the almost historic and bustling scenes taking place at Coney Island (even a short, restless roller coaster ride), and the episode where two women are behind a net in separate beds, and visitors to the center can launch bullets to try to knock them over. above, and the women (hardly dressed) the eggs on which the men are strangely sexually liable. All the while, Garbo (in front of the crowd) is watching. <br /> <br /> Garbo is of course what makes this movie more than another very good beginner. She plays all sides of her character. She is shy and skeptical and in a kind of inner anguish. She laughs and cries, withdraws and pushes outward. In some respects, it is a remarkable and forward-looking film (directed by Clarence Brown, which presents a whole series of significant films from this era of pre-code sound). <br /> <br /> Although based on the success of Eugene O'Neil play, it is the writing that struggles a little while the actors sometimes seem to go through the steps. Marie Dressler is awesome in the exaggerated way she almost made the mark. And then there is Greta Garbo, who really has a natural presence, although it seems to exaggerate, just slightly, sometimes (but then everyone is too). Of course, Garbo is first famous as a dumb actress. It's his first talking movie. The public loved him enough to make a German version of it the following year.
