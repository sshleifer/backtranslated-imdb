My ex-wife and I saw and were intrigued by the movie trailer. We waited for it to come out, but when it was done, it did not last long. Several years later, I bought it on VHS and I transfer it on DVD to keep it. <br /> <br /> I found it very moving. These are real events in a real country. BURMA has such a bad reputation for the political oppression that it has created that it has changed its name. <br /> <br /> I find women with little makeup very sexy. Patricia Arquette is in this movie. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are only here briefly. <br /> <br /> After returning home to find her young son and her husband brutally murdered, Laura (Arquette) is afraid of blood. A bad trait for a doctor. His sister (McDormand) asks him to go on vacation in Burma. There, she attends a peaceful demonstration and has her passport stolen. In a bold (or stupid) gesture, she asks a tour guide to show her something off the beaten path. Her guide is wounded by soldiers and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get herself safe. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at this, it reminds me that in the United States, we forget that to a farmer. Socialism, where at least food is practically guaranteed, looks devilishly good.
