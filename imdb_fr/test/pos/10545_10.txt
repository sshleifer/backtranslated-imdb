Honestly, I can tell you that this movie is the most impressive of all time !!! If you're in the mood for a comedy, I totally recommend this movie! So here is the summary. There is this girl (Nikki) who is fourteen and a half years old and she goes on holiday with her father (Andr√©) whom she has not seen for about two years. She expects the holidays to be totally boring until she meets this boy (Ben), much older than her. So, to try to impress her, she says she's not on vacation with her father, but her lover. It's a hysterical film from start to finish, and I strongly suggest it. So rent it and enjoy it !!!
