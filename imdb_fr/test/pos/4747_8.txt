It's a pretty good movie and you probably will not be disappointed, but it still has Roy Scheider, just after playing "French Connection", playing the role of a cop with the name "Buddy". They also use the same very memorable helmsman of "Bullitt". At first you will think that you have already seen the car go on if you still have its face in your memory. The car chase is excellent, but as in many car movie scenes, it involves some technical and editing mistakes. Check out "Puppet on a Chain" and "French Connection II" for other good, long, and intense pursuits.
