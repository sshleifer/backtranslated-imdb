I observed this, hoping to see the usual British stereotypes on the upper lip and was surprised to find that the dialogue was remarkably natural and tinged with dark humor. It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In which we serve. The scenes of the approach and the attack are remarkably realistic in their description of a battleship and everything that moves within the crew of the ship (at least according to my service in the 1970s ). Some of the disposable lines are very spiritual ("I do not join Band of Hope just to please a fat fish fryer!") My only complaint is that they did not show what happened to the Irish helmsman and his wife, or the tattooed PO and his tattoo "I Love Arabella"!
