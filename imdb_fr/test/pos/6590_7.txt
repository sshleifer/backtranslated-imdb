Until now, Miguel Bardem's career has been one of the most formidable in recent Spanish cinema. He did nothing but rubbish ... until now. "Incautos" was quite surprising: it is a serious, rhythmic film, with excellent distribution and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The art of burglary is what "Incautos" talks about. A movie very similar to David Mamet's "House of the Game" and that kind of thing. A thousand twists in the screenplay and a story where nothing seems to be like that. <br /> <br /> The weak points of Bardem's latest film are perhaps the American language, which gives some characters a rather unnatural aspect (especially Victoria Abril, she is a sacred actress, but in "incautos", she looks a little forced). Ernesto Alterio is not so bad, but he is not as good actor as his father ... And what about Luppi? Well, he is the MAN. <br /> <br /> In short: a good movie. The best that Miguel Bardem has ever done. I hope this is the beginning of a whole new stage in his career. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
