Kramer vs. Kramer tells the story of a marital breakdown and its consequences. They can be devastating for partners, and even more so for a minor child, who in this case is played by Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> What I really liked Kramer against Kramer is his greatest strength as a film This is the way parents, Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, are presented to the public as full-fledged people, with many facets of their nature. Although the film is tilted in the direction of Hoffman and more about his relationship with his son, he is not presented as a saint, nor Streep as a completely black villain. Hoffman is a career-oriented man in the advertising game. He has pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, but it's a shock to him when Streep says love is gone and she wants to go out. She also wants to be no longer a mother, at least for a while. <br /> <br /> Hoffman and Henry are doing their best. The pressure of being both parents makes Hoffman lose his job and he has to accept a lower-paying job in another agency. After a year, Streep decides to ask for custody. <br /> <br /> Both parents present convincing witnesses and present their arguments admirably, but in these situations the bond is always broken in favor of the mother. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep respectively won the first of their two Oscars for this film, him in the Support category. I do not know how these things are decided, Streep spends less time on the screen than Hoffman if that's the determining factor. The film focuses on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his growing awareness that he is responsible for the failure of marriage. As for Meryl, it's Hob's choice for her, as for many women, to balance career and motherhood. The conflict in his psyche is recording on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman may have won this Oscar in part for the same reason that Spencer Tracy took over his first, completing the impossible task of not letting a scene steal a child stealing the film. Children who lack inhibition are natural actors and Henry is great because he comes as a real kid, not a Hollywood kid. I wonder if Hoffman saw the brave captains and saw how Spencer Tracy treated Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done a lot worse than Spencer Tracy in his performance. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs. Kramer also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay. It's an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling in love and trying to manage it as best they can for themselves and their child. Do not miss it if ever aired.
