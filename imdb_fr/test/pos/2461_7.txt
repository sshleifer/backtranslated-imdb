This film easily rivals the emotional strength, dramatic impact and remarkable performance of "12 Angry Men". I rented it on a whim and I was surprised not to have heard about it before. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was the first film of Emilio Estevez, but the rhythm, the interaction and the development of the characters As well as the clever camera work around the character played by Estevez, everything suggests a natural eye. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry that we saw on Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle despair and escape; a variation of his characters in "At the Game in the Fields of the Lord". She is irritating and yet we can sympathize with her at the same time. <br /> <br /> There are times when I feel that the plot slows down and that the moments between Est√©vez and his ex-girlfriend seem almost written for another film, Estevez presents himself as another character all together . But these are just minor complaints. <br /> <br /> This film must be based on a true story or have been written by a person who has lived these experiences. I note 8 on a difficult 10. <br /> <br />
