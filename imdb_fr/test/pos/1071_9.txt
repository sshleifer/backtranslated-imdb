First, I loved the documentary. This represents a new history / school theory in which a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical problems. <br /> <br /> First, I'll start by removing the camera and the dogs. I hate the quality of the Blair Witch camera, but I also understand the benefit of such a casual approach. In fact, I agree with the other reviewer that it gives us unprecedented access. <br /> <br /> Dogs: Be careful, I have a doctorate in literature that I do not use as a profession, so some of my dogs are a nice metaphor for the complex relationship of the great efforts of the man and our need to find work to reach them. Dogs may reflect their owners, as suggested by a reviewer. But they also serve as substitutes for the workers we see in the film. It might allude to the Marxist problem raised by a critic, but it also shows how difficult it is to globalize the problems of work. No Mondovi in ​​Italy may not translate as well elsewhere. (Yuck, I'm a Marxist at heart and I hate to hear my cynical resignation win!) It's a remarkable bait and change. Dogs are a family, workers are a family. But in the end, the dogs are the workers (the last scene with the poor farmer). Although you may disagree with politics, the art of analogy, coupled with the film's more open politics, is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Only Faulkner (I'm from Alabama) had the power of the film beyond the Hollywood market, what interesting stories would have been told.
