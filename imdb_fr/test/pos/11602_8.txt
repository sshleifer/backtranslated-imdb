The Hindi version of the film lasts 121 minutes. Set in Bengal in the early 1900s, the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. An educated and beautiful woman, Binodini becomes a widow in the year following her marriage, but she does not accept the constraints that society imposes on her as a widow. The film looks beautiful, but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is portraying Binodini's strong character with his subtle combination of idealism and slyness. Binodini's idealism can not be seen and the analogy between women and colonization thus remains somewhat buried.
