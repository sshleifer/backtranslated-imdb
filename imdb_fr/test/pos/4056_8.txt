I saw for the first time "Signs of Life" on PBS as a presentation of American Playhouse. It is a wonderfully written ensemble production with remarkable performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast, which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker, gives their characters remarkable clarity and substance. <br /> <br /> The direction is subtle and effective. I have watched this movie many times over the years and highly recommend it. A beautiful piece of cinema.
