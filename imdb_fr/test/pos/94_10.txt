This wonderful short film will appeal to all those who, in their childhood, specifically asked for something because it was cool or trendy. They gave you something that would mark you for life with your peers and that your mother or father (or both) told you. ) that it did not matter, because you have seriously begun to consider enlisting in a witness protection program to avoid ridicule. For US residents who do not have the horror because you do not follow hockey, it's like a fan of the Dallas Cowboys getting a shirt from the Washington Redskins or a Yankees fan getting a jersey Red Sox. It's not pretty For our European friends, imagine two great rival football clubs (imagine yourself) and imagine the fan of one who gets a jersey from the other. Ouch!!! The NFB of C has outdone itself here! <br /> <br /> A tribute from Maurice "Rocket" Richard, thank you, Mr. Richard.
