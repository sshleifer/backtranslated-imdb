Why did I vote on 10/10 for this film which is completely out of guts *? Simply because if you just find yourself funny, you can laugh until you choke. Some people may find that it goes too far, it's certainly not for everyone, but every time I'm down and I just need something really stupid to laugh at, play with Bottom or GHP and I can forget all my problems and be transported to a dark and strange magical world. <br /> <br /> * "Completely out of order" is an Australian expression, it does not have a literal translation.
