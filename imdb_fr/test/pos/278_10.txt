It's a very moving film that takes a new twist on something we've all been: a relationship is coming to an end. Kristen Thomson's performance as Tessa, who desperately tries to keep her connection with Bobby one more day, is extremely convincing and moving and takes you straight into the story. Who was not confronted at the end of a relationship and who wanted to cry at least with tears: "Just one more night!" When he gives her another night, the journey that these two people share makes you think and reflect on the preciousness of any truly intimate relationship, and how each - whether permanent or not - should be treated with respect, rather than simply. discarded.
