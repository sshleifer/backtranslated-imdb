Kramer vs. Kramer is a film to remember too and not to forget. It's not one of the most popular movies of all time and it's certainly one of the best picture films, but that does not mean it's still not important. I thought the movie was well done and you just wanted to watch it more and more. The performances were the most positive for the film and Dustin Hoffman played one of the best roles he has ever played as a solitary workaholic who must take care of his son, his wife separating from him. Billy, Hoffman's son, played another great performance with Meryl Streep, in the role of Billy's depressed mother. Kramer vs. Kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10, but he manages to make sure the film is worth watching and is worth it. Certainly, one of the best movies he has ever made. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Hedeen Prospects: 9/10 *** + A-
