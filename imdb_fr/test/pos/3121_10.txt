This little western of John Ford without "stars" but a set of actors of characters is one of his masterpieces. It looks like a documentary because it recounts the trip west of a group of Mormons and it is perhaps the most authentic film of all Ford movies (it's tied with "The Sun Shines Bright ", which he did years later). <br /> <br /> There is a kind of intrigue (a group of bank robbers join the train of cars at some point), but the highlights of the film are almost accidental. The remarkable performance of the Ford stock company (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr, Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) greatly enhance the authenticity of the film, while the film closest to the star is the Denver's Joanne Dru. Dru was a much more refined actress than she had ever been credited with, just like Bond and Johnson, who at least were finally rewarded with the recognition of an Oscar for her work in The Last Picture Show. As he said himself: "It could not have happened to a better guy". Add the superb Bert Glennon place shots and you get a real piece of Americana that could only be from someone other than Ford. It's a film that really pays tribute to American pioneers and is full of feelings and feelings.
