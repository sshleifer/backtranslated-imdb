I've been a Rachael fan since the beginning of 30MM on Food Network, so I've seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted it would happen because I realized how much Oprah is taking with her, and with good reason: she seems to be very natural and ready to laugh. itself, which is very attractive. . The set is attractive and there are new ideas (I love the lazy Susan on which the audience is sitting). There are just enough segments of celebrities, and it avoids controversy and debate (there is enough on television during the day). The show is a light escape, and she has not left her strength (cooking), which is a very good planning. I know there are people who hate and hate her. it's okay, you can not please everyone. And one way or another, I think Rachael knows it and accepts it. So just turn the channel; I think it would not bother him.
