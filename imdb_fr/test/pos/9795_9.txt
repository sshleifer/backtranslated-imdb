"Radio Flyer" is one of my most beloved American movies. <br /> <br /> The excellent work of two boys, Joe Mazzello and Elija Wood, (despite the terrible performances of T.Hanks at the beginning and the end ...) with the wonderful scenario of DMEvans and the setting in the powerful and moving scene of R.Donner more. H.Zimmer's Absolutely Incredibly Peerless Music Score allowed "Radio Flyer" to win one of the top places in my family's movie charts. It is a shame that this very good movie has been underestimated by some movie critics. <br /> <br /> I can not help but wait to see it on DVD.
