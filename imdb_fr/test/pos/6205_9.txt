It is an extremely engaging series, well made and a sensitive portrait of great splendor. We follow Michael Ealy as an FBI infiltrator, Darwyn, who is about to infiltrate a terrorist cell led by Farik (Oder Fehr). The series is very well written and contains enough twists to let you sit at the edge of your seat, waiting for everything that will happen. <br /> <br /> Michael Ealy is, by definition, one of the best actors ever to portray an undercover agent. It's freezing cold outside, but it's still a good human being doing his best to keep his head afloat in a very moving roller coaster ride in which the FBI took him on board. Oder Fehr, on the other hand, comes from a type that could fit into any social scenario. Big and strong, but able to disappear in the gray mass if necessary. Very authoritarian and extremely cunning. The way the two communicate on the screen is spectacular. <br /> <br /> The way the story unfolds and the level of detail offered by the script make the whole story extremely believable and also very faithful to the reality I would imagine. It is of such magnitude that you feel insecure and do not know what might happen in real life. We read every day about terror, and here we have a glimpse of the underworld that most of us know very little about. <br /> <br /> This is a series that will certainly make you come back longer, sitting at the edge of your seat, waiting for the next episode next week. It's a sure winner in my eyes, and I have no problem saying that this series is on my list of the best of all time.
