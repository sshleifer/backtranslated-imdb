I recorded it on Sundance and I did not know it was a Miike movie. I thought it was just another kung fu movie. <br /> <br /> Then I saw things like the dancing saxophone <br /> <br /> that looked like an Oriental Gato Barbieri, and I knew it had to be Miike. <br /> <br /> I missed the opening credits of the beginning and had to wait until the end of the closing credits to see the Miike credits. <br /> <br /> He has not disappointed me yet. . Hearing, City of Lost Souls, Ichi the Killer, and Katakurie Happiness were all good movies, and now I discovered it was the third in a trilogy. <br /> <br /> Other than Miike and Todd Solendz, nobody makes interesting movies nowadays.
