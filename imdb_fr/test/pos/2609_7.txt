I could not believe the guys from Adult Swim had that character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot, I guess I will stay a few more episodes. Assy is quite funny and the whole team of police characters is present, but Assy is hard to understand and it was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the main character is literally a donkey who walks with nothing but legs that wear socks with garters and feet with traditional wingtips. Assy drinks too much and "plays according to his own rules", as you may have guessed. The only other fun moments are Assy, photographing a lot of people and spending time at home, in the bathroom. It's not funny Squidbillies, but it's worth a look.
