I just got back from Santa Fe. NM. I visited the Loretto Chapel. While browsing this building, acquired by a private owner, I relived the cinematic version of the staircase. It is an overwhelming mystique that occupies this building. This is what can happen if you really have faith. The bookstore has a story on the subject, which is the story of the stairs. I read the story in its entirety. I was absorbed by the atmosphere that surrounds people. It was as if we were totally locked in a time chain, all with the same thoughts and the same fear. When we left, the silence was overwhelming. Everyone should visit the Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe.
