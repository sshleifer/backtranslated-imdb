A talented high school graduate with a bad attitude is obliged to play in the all-star high school student game. When he meets an attractive local girl and falls in love with her, she helps him understand that he has a chance to play hard if he plays well. <br /> <br /> Too often, these dramas fall into the trap of the formula and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teenager. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but beneath the surface is a much more unique character than we usually see in this genre. Matt is at the center of the action and is a realistic teenager, both overconfident and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical in turn. Influenced by Amy, Matt becomes a man of character and heart. He, in turn, forms friendships with his teammates, which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player. <br /> <br /> FULL RIDE has all the elements we like to see in a movie - great acting, admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, poignant drama and love story. Still, if we could see these elements in other films, FULL RIDE is supported by sincere and sometimes moving performances. Perhaps the most impressive thing about FULL RIDE is its sense of reality. Although the author of the previous comment seems to disagree, the director Mark Hoeger places the film in a credible situation and place and does an excellent job. This is clearly an unhappy student who received a bad grade in his film class. to tackle the reality of life in a small town. These characters are real people rooted in realistic situations, often creating the most compelling entertainment. At one level it's a love story, at another it's a character study, and another is a football movie. All of these ideas come together to form a coherent vehicle.
