The main reason for checking this one is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory. <br /> <br /> That's enough reason for me. <br /> <br /> She goes to Africa as a guest of another rich man that seems to be everywhere in these movies. Huge manor house near the jungle. Hunters stay for the holidays when they are not out to hunt zebras. And these parts become drunken orgies. <br /> <br /> All types of high society in Emanuelle's films seem to have uncontrollable fetishes. And Emanuelle has most. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato did not lead this one. He just snatch it and uses the same casting. And did anyone notice the "subliminal" sexual images at the gas station? And why did most men stay dressed during sex scenes? <br /> <br /> Consistency? Almost not. BUT GEMSER GEMSER IS BEAUTIFUL.
