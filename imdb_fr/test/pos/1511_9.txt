"Cat In The Brain" is a series of extremely violent sequences linked by a plot that looks more like an overview, describing the most notorious years of director Lucio Fulci. The film could also be seen as a sort of black comedy, effectively skewing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes further than that, he presents himself as the star, the central figure of the film, thus showing the public who is the man behind all the cinematic gore. "Cat in The Brain" is not about presenting a clear story and following it. Instead, he makes fun of the clich√©s that have surrounded the horror genre for years. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci plays himself as a horror director who struggles to keep his humanity intact. Years of violent shooting have finally begun to reach it. It starts slowly, steaks and meat in general disgust him, his colleagues assure Fulci that he only needs rest. But that does not help, and the grotesque ideas in his movies are soon beginning to overwhelm his daily thoughts. In an attempt to find a cure for his infuriating mental state, Lucio begins to consult a local psychiatrist. Unfortunately, this is more harm than good and Fulci is plunged into an even bigger disaster, while the psychiatrist turns out to be a psychopath, who mimics the murders of Fulci's movies in real life. <br /> <br /> The film retains all the hallmarks of Italian cinema, good or bad, are all here. Thus, any comment on the acting, the technical aspects and the budget constraints does not affect the quality of the film. It's a visual experience, no doubt about it. Fulci adds incredible violence that surpasses just about everything he has made. Amputated by the members of a chainsaw, cannibalism, the murder of a child, decapitation, these are just some of the many grotesque acts of "Cat In The Brain". Some of them are obviously recycled from some less known films of the director, but they do not go out of context and really feel at home here. As I noted earlier, the film is much better as a satire of the genre than as a serious piece. The way some of the violence is presented helps to build that idea. Shortly after their apogee, such sequences are rejected by the reality of the film, as they turn out to be scenes from a film that the character Fulci stages. This type of film-in-film presentation somewhat mitigates the impact of the gore. But that does not make it easy to watch. Oh no, it's way beyond the levels of gore found in traditional horror, and the gorehounds will no doubt be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci was a very polarized character. People hate his work or worship him. "Cat in the Brain" will not convince any of Fulci's detractors, but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really check.
