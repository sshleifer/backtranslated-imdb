I do not remember exactly where I heard about them first, but I listen to a bit of a song and I like it. I went to buy the CD and I finally found the type of music I like. I heard about this video and I knew I had to have it. There are a lot of clips of them playing in concert. Let me tell you that watching this video does not even compare to them in concert. I have seen them twice in concert and I do not want to miss an opportunity to see them again. The other two things there are an interview, and even a video of one of their biggest songs. a few small notes ... I saw them at Ozzfest 2001 and they decided, but seeing them inside a smaller stage was much better (they had some really nice things to do to cut the lights) the other, in case someone asks, votionary means a fervent adept.
