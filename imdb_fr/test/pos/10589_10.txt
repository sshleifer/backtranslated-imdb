This movie kicks ass, without exception. Bam and his creature came out of this movie. Since I have the DVD (4 days ago), I have watched it three times and it improves every time I watch it. I can not wait for Grind to come out in theaters. If it looks like Haggard, it'll be worth the wait. <br /> <br /> Thank you, JTcellphone
