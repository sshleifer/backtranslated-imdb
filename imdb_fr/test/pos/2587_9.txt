Working in a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to look at every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for "Black Snake Moan," I laughed and thought, "Awesome, another Samuel L Jackson movie" Snakes on the Plane. "But of course, I wanted to see him for the laugh factor, and many people judged this film too quickly based on the insinuations of the title, the images of the promotional commercials and the fact that Justin Timberlake was in the film. I loved every second of this movie, it tells the story of an older man and a young woman who are going through difficult times and are able to meet each other ... The story is really touching and sends a great message on life and on our life, of course, I do not recommend it for young audiences because of some graphic elements, but if you are looking for a beautiful story and an authentic interpretation of Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and, yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see 'Blac Moan Snake.
