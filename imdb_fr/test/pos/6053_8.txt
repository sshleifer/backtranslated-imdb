I served as a corps officer at Parris Island in the late 1960s, a little over 10 years after "The D. I." was shot. I was in some of the barracks where they filmed some of the indoor scenes. I knew a lot of exercise instructors and recruits. I think the film is as close as any movie to show the life of a rookie and that of a Drill instructor. Without a doubt, I think it's the best thing Jack Webb has ever done. If you have been in the army, you must see this movie. It was like that. This shows how important it is to recruit a group of raw recruits and turn them into men ready to defend our country. One feature that I find fascinating is that most characters are played by real Marines, not by actors.
