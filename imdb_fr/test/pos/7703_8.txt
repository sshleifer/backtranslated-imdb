One of the most macabre, depressing and revealing documents. I watched for a while. No narration or story is told, there is only one "third eye" camera that follows about two couples of heroin addicts in New York over the seasons. Watch them land on the floors of public toilets, then "clean" their needles in public toilets ... Sometimes it's a bit too much and you have to take a break to take a break. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is currently recovering an alcohol or drug supplement should look at it when she feels like it - it really shows you what you could come back for! After seeing this, it's amazing that everyone can even start by trying this drug. <br /> <br /> The only thing he needed was a follow-up at the end to indicate where these people are today. Judging by what is shown in the document, there is no hope for them. They mention wanting to get better and quit, but it seems that the only end to their habits is to quit when dying. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not suitable for all audiences. I found myself a bit like watching a car accident - after starting to watch it, I just could not turn it off. I had to keep watching with a dark / morbid fascination on the lives of these addicts.
