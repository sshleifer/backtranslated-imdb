It is a beautifully filmed film that questions the future of all indigenous peoples, especially members of nomadic tribes. Focusing on the Tibetan Salt Flats, the film is moving at a pace that may make some Western audiences feel uncomfortable. For some people, life continues to keep pace with thousands of years. This film follows a group of tribe members in their annual quest for two months to get salt. Their tribe lives their life in a traditional way (slowly by modern standards) and always taking into account their many gods. It's a remarkable film that will preserve a piece of what can unfortunately become history. It's worth the time. Do not be in a hurry when you see it.
