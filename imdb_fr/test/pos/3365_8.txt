The second film in Cohen's trilogy on comedies of the Second World War (the others being "until death separates us" and "Adolf Hitler - my part in its downfall") is a cinematic version of the Long situation (very much appreciated) of the BBC comedy. Like most TV shows, this film suffers from a lack of intrigue and is rather a collection of sketches. Some work better than others, for example the scene where a senior army officer floats on a river is a memorable and surreal moment. <br /> <br /> The joy of this film is the representation of a past that probably never existed and an England that is characterized by a picturesque countryside and by the chance it offers to see thieves of veteran scene such as John Le Mesurier in view of their most important roles at the movies. Arthur Lowe is superb as Captain Mainwaring, a bungler, who, when the chips are low, shows great courage and saves the day (the climax is probably the greatest moment of the character). <br /> <br /> Episodes of the TV series are certainly more fun, but as an introduction to a British legend, you will not find anything better.
