I'm on vacation in Hong Kong, and I just saw police at the movies .... what can I say ... it was so cool !! <br /> <br /> All you could wish for was in! Basically ... see it if you can ... I'll ask my friend to send me the vcd when he goes out .... <br /> <br /> The only negative was the American style ladle of talk used by some of the actors hl ... like Edison ... "What's up my man ?!" but it added even more humor to iy ... hhehe <br /> <br /> See it ... especially if you like one of the following genres: HKfilm, action, comedy, science fiction! SEEITMAN !! Edison did a good song for her too ... so download her ... Edison Tse - Heroes
