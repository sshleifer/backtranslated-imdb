The All Risks Class is regularly recommended every time I watch a film by Jean-Pierre Melville and I have to watch it as soon as possible. Since I discovered Melville and apparently work backwards in his filmography, it would be easy for me to confuse this with one of his films, but this one was shot in 1960 by Claude Sautet, before Melville was come and claim his claims. French Neo-Black. <br /> <br /> All Risks Class has two of the best men of the time, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two children, who wants to return to Paris because the police are getting closer to him. After a frenzied opening with a big surprise, Abel ends up with Eric Stark (Belmondo), who wants to enter the criminal world. Stark becomes the driver and the only possible friend of Abel in an underworld that makes him turn after everything he has done and lived. The film shows the duality of the two men, the old Abel at the end of his reign after the tragedy, and the young Eric leaving in the same way as Abel, falling in love with a beautiful woman who remains faithful to his man. the world they belong to. It never ends beautiful for them or their loved ones. It's one thing to see a criminal approaching his disappearance, it's different when he has loved ones he may take with him. <br /> <br /> Just like the Melville film, the seemingly simple story becomes more subtle and complicated going along. As usual, like what I feel with Melville's movies, it left me feeling dizzy and dying to look at her again to find what I had missed the first time . Class All Risks is a definitive guardian.
