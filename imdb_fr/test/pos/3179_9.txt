It was a great series ... I do not remember much but remember to have looked at her and to have loved her. I remember mother and father. I really like Grandma. She was like a grandmother that you really could not appreciate before becoming an adult. She was very knowledgeable and no nonsense. My favorite song on the show was Sardines in the Morning. (This may not be the title) I remember after seeing this show and hearing this song, I went to Cleveland, Ohio, to visit my cousins. My sister and I sang this song so much that singing it too. I too would like to find this on DVD.
