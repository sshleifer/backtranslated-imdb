Love Jones skillfully portrays young African American men and women in a clear, positive and realistic way. I think all the actors and actresses were beautiful and really did a great job of capturing the mood. Nia Long and Larenz Tate have worked well together and I hope to see more work from them. In fact, all the actors / actresses have done such a good job that it would be great to see another romantic comedy from them. This film is comparable to most well-written romantic comedies. If you have not seen this movie before, I highly recommend it, it can certainly give you another perspective of life and love.
