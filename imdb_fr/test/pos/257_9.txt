I watched this film at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Florida Film Festival. What a beautiful movie. A simple and simple tale of morality about a young man without care who must take responsibility for his actions. It was neither pretentious nor brilliant that my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change, I was not bothered by the content or language of the film. A real family film and the best British comedy movie I've seen since Billy Elliot. This film then won, unsurprisingly, the best film and director award at the festival. Ten out of ten.
