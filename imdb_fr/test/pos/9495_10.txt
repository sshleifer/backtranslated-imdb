I loved this film. He manages to make the characters nice (well, most of them) about the problems they encounter in their relationship. <br /> <br /> Gloria Swanson, like Leila, is in a dusty marriage with a husband who barely notices his presence (though he notices his absence). The film shows very well why she is tired of married life and why she is likely to be a crook who speaks softly, without making her selfish or demanding. Leila's reaction photos at the dinner table for her birthday, while her busy husband (late for dinner again) is eating salty scallions and pushing the bride and groom's dolls away from her plate, are perfect. <Br /> <br /> The series is stolen - and stolen effortlessly - by Elliott Dexter in the role of Jim, the careless husband of Leila. After losing Leila by another man, Jim literally purges his gesture, shaves his mustache, strives to lose the age gap and dresses neatly. There are several shots of Jim at home, alone and thinking about Leila, including a powerful scene when he finds one of his old dresses in the closet. The film gives the audience the benefit of watching Jim's transformation with Leila. It is not only outside that is more attractive; we know a lot more about the kind of person Jim really is and we see how completely different he is from Leila's second husband, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter shines like a before-after Jim, who is determined, after discovering Schuyler's true character, to reclaim Leila, if he can. The most moving moment of the film comes when Jim and Leila discover that they are standing under the mistletoe and that Jim is talking about what he has lost. <br /> <br /> It's really worth watching.
