As in a circle, the film brings back to its starting point, the image of the cranes that cross a Moscow sky. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish, in order to aspire to the greatest possible accomplishment. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Veronica and Boris live such a promise of happiness and their eyes follow the path of cranes in the joy of living. It seems that they could live according to their dreams. <br /> <br /> But man is not a bird. Life sets its own rules, which no human being can escape and we can not change - even with a supreme effort. The war breaks out and Boris engages without hesitation on the front to fulfill his patriotic duty. He can not even say goodbye to Veronica because she is late arriving at the assembly point where the soldiers are fired. Surrounded by a jubilant crowd, all his attempts to attract Boris' attention must inevitably fail. <br /> <br /> Boris ends up being killed in the war, without Veronica learning it at the moment. His brother Mark, an energetic musician, who has been exempted from military service by corruption, is eager to take his place. Veronica resists at first, but during a dreadful night of bombing, she finally falls victim to her charms. A wedding takes place, which is never accepted by the family. <br /> <br /> Veronica soon feels guilty and realizes that Boris' return is the one and only thing she longs for. She thus relieves her bad conscience and her despair by her sacrificial work in a field hospital. <br /> <br /> When the war is finally over, a crowd of enthusiastic people gather again to cheer victorious soldiers. Once again, Veronica is among them, forcing her to cross a body wall. In her hand, she carries a bouquet of flowers, until she finally has to give it to complete strangers, because one of the homecomers has just broken his hopes by confirming the sad certainty of the death of Boris. <br /> <br /> Once again, the cranes invade the sky by tracing their capricious lines. But now, Veronica looks at them alone and her look is different. She had to accept the impossibility of living according to pre-conceived plans, to follow the directions of your dreams. Because all human beings are only defenseless puppets clinging to the impenetrable strings of fate. <br /> <br />
