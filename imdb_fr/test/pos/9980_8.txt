Shia LaBeouf has already impressed me with her talent as an actor, but I can honestly say that I am very impatient to see her next efforts ... her performance of 20-year-old Francis Ouimet, who ignores his father's insistence on golf in life and enters the US Open tournament of 1913 in his hometown ... the beginning of the film drags a bit, but it is necessary to set up the outsider sub-plot that Shia works so well ... the entire cast is well chosen and they work very well together in a story that, based on the actual event, has an end that everyone can discover before seeing the film ... but even Knowing that information does not spoil the fun ... Josh Flitter is adorable like Francis's younger brother Eddie Lowery, who holds him to the ground while proving to be an invaluable part of Francis' efforts ... Stephen Delane is remarkable as Harry Vardon, the legendary British golfer Francis idolizes but does not fear. ..and who knows the background Francis comes from like him also had modest beginnings ... Bill Paxton takes a stereotyped film and makes it valid ... congratulations Mr. Paxton, and congratulations to the casting ... of the imagery the story to the people who make it live, it's a movie in which we can have fun, enjoy ... it's good to have movies like this one that we can feel good looking ...
