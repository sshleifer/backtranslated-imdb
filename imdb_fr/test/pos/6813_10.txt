What show! Lorenzo Lamas proves once again his talent as a cop who committed the worst crime a good cop can commit, being a good cop. Again, it shows how sensitive a policeman can be, displaying a range of emotions no other actor can do, except perhaps in criminal justice. <br /> <br /> THE ENORGENT!
