I had the chance to attend a test screening of 'El Padrino' a few months ago in Santa Monica. I was dazzled. You do not see movies like this anymore. In Scosese's mind, Chapa deftly narrated Kilo's tragic story as he maneuvered the paved streets of Los Angeles to rise above the ranks and become a drug lord at the height of Escobarian . The characters are complex and conflicting. The emotions are real. The action is fast and furious. The cascades are expansive. And Tilly is HOT. She has not looked so good since her 'Bound' days. I would recommend this to anyone. It's a fantastic homage to the epic action movies of the late '80s and early' 90s. And to all the naysayers out there? look again you obviously had your eyes closed the first time. Congratulations to everyone involved in the film. I count the days until the rest is published. Does anyone have a date on this?
