I think this film became an important document of the most horrifying aspect of the East German regime, namely the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its anti-fascist protection wall. It is a document of despair and courage not to be missed. I would like to comment on the actual location of this escape. This did not happen in Berlin or the surrounding area as some interviewees suspect and has nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall. The escape balloon flew over the iron curtain that divided not only Germany but also Europe as a whole. The balloon took off from PÃ¶ssneck, 250 km south-west of Berlin, in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), for a distance of 14 km to Naila, in Bavaria, and freedom in Germany to West. The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later in the year. While ballooning has created an entertaining suspense theater, it should remain a monument to those who have lost their lives as they try to flee East Berlin, other parts of the GDR or other states under attack. Soviet control.
