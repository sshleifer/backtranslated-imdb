John Huston has produced many remarkable and memorable films. Those who were most often recalled were published well before his death in 1987. However, that year, it reminded us that Huston was still in top shape, as evidenced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's novel. "The Dead". "<br /> <br /> A long time ago, a very wise man called Doc asked me:" Do not the "Dead" seem to you remarkably more alive and luminous than the other stories of Dubliners? " I tend to think that this is the case.The story and the film contain all the comments and criticisms of the Joyce company, but for the most part, portray a warm and affectionate portrait of an Ireland that Joyce himself has so often criticized and will be leaving soon. <br /> <br /> The behavior of the protagonist Gabriel Conroy by Huston, who realizes that the world as he sees it is an illusion, is simply The fact that the film is lacking in intrigue is a mistake, and as with all Dubliners from Joyce, the plot - even if it is certainly present - is not the center of attention. is a tool to convey the epiphany of the protagonist In addition to an apparent lack of action, Jo's narrative yce on which the director relies is very little dialogue. Huston's ability to translate what Joyce puts into words in pictures is probably the greatest triumph of the film. Feelings, thoughts ... Gabriel's discomfort during the dance ... all these intangible elements come to life and become within the reach of the viewer in the portrait of Huston. <br /> <br /> To assert that Huston has softened society's criticism of society, its author has yet to score. While "The Dead" can be painted with a cheerful hue, the complacency and pretentiousness of the characters in the film are only a commentary on society on a smaller scale: we are the very little aunts; embarrassing drunkenness; tenor with sore throat; the woman with the sad secret, soaked with rain; even the middle-aged man self-deceives. <br /> <br /> But "The Dead" hides its title. It's not a dark story. It's not really that dark. Forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the symbolism that is inherent in it; forget the chaos of a life Gabriel awakens at the end of the film: it is only with the destruction of illusions that Gabriel has of himself and his world that he can really move forward . This is the central point of the film. This is the central point of our lives.
