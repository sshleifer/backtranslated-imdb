The main achievement of this film is that, although racially unipolar, the film still manages to draw a picture of war portraits that leave a lasting identification with the one who can see it and with the one who was present at that time. Although good movies can universalize their subjects, which is often difficult to do; the big films have the capacity to universalize their unipolar subjects, as this film does. <br /> <br /> Instead of creating a context of unity, the film depicts the Japanese in the sick end of the Philippine war front February 1945, making signs of pacifism or war, but rather making signs feelings, death, destruction, victory and the disease of war with the bloody hands of the vanquished. Very different and superior movies like Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, which required a satirical methodology to trivialize and depersonalize US troops, and use all races as a single fight, which is good, but not as big as a movie who uses a race and a vision, which would look fascist if it were created in America, to convey the horror of war and show what it really looks like. <br /> <br /> The only way for the main character to reach this film until the end is by being sick, and therefore inedible; Thus, thanks to this character, his sickness and his saving face, we are witnessing the end of the Second World War in the Philippines in February 1945 and the way Americans, Japanese and Filipinos united in bloody acts of war where you live to die. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously influenced by a neorealist way of cinematic representation, original and beneficial to the viewer, at the time or today, because the neorealistic techniques used reflect in an imaginative way all the horrors of the war. form, be it a showcase of pacifism or "militaristic responsibility". Like Roberto Rossellini's Germania Anno Zero, a story emerges from the environment and the conditions associated with it. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film, with the two-way discussion between the two Japanese soldiers, foreshadow and reproduce the events. Through this opening, we feel that the fight is human against human, and human with human; it shows that they have relied on each other to confront the enemy in past battles, but now, in this opening, or "pivot" of the Japanese experiences in the Philippines, new information is being transmitted to the main character Tamura , giving a presentiment of a cannibal addiction to each other if they wish to survive. <br /> <br /> The jungle is rough, wet and thick, and the sky is often cloudy and sunny. We walk with latecomers in ponds and puddles, as sick as the earth around them. Unnamed corpses are scattered everywhere. From time to time, we can not say whether they are bodies, rocks or corn. Apparently, there is no difference here, everything is dead and sick. Everything is dying. They are content with rare monkeys and corpses of fallen comrades and / or unnamed enemies. <br /> <br /> Often, Tamura meets another dead in action. Though his mind is crushed and his crushed, some offer him their body to eat, but he refuses; as always, Hiroshi Kawaguchi as Nishi in Giants and Toys, will not fall into the death of Japanese dignity and morality; because that's all he really has to support for his survival, a dignity of himself. As a result, when Nagamatsu dissects a soldier for consummation, he fires at him because of it. Tamura may be used to killing, but to the disease of killing and looting, he can not decipher. He is neither a good man nor a bad man. He wants to survive, but will not make an extra effort beyond the mere war slaughter. His self belonged dead on the battlefield, he is not happy here to wade and wipe the weak for his survival. <br /> <br /> The disease that he carries is visible everywhere, in everyone; and unfortunately, he lacks the ethical reason to think either by thinking entirely of others, since he can not abandon his body for them because of his contagious disease, either by thinking entirely of himself, since he sees the disease everyone, while still killing them even if they do not hurt. Saw in his attack on the two Philippians in the hut. He can not see anyone. Nobody can see anyone. The only ones to see an aversion to illness and an adversary for health, the heart of survival instincts. <br /> <br /> Often, an arm appears, pointing to the left of the screen, to what must be hope, because in as far as Thule lies their freedom. Yet, it is blocked by US soldiers, leaving the Japanese stragglers slowly die in this insolent land. Even a steeple appears, reflecting the light of an invisible sun. But on closer inspection, crows fly wildly; religion is also an air of poison. <br /> <br /> Nobi, the Japanese title of the film, gives more evidence to the themes or feelings of the film: servitude to fate, the heaviness of existence under the leadership lives controlled by others. Its English translation is a subject of debate among historians, because non-Koreans translate it as "slave" and "slavery", while many Koreans claim that the nobi was not a slave system, but a servant class system that does not respond to reality. criteria of slavery. A typical way to escape poverty. This enhances the theme of war and the symbolism of the army. <br /> <br /> Is not it important, at the time, to ask what is the purpose of what will become of our earned history? Should we be comfortable letting it unfold without conscious effort for change? Is not that what we are fighting, this old question of history, but why are we fighting? The fires in the plain are with Eiji Funakoshi, Osamu Takizawa and Mickey Curtis; based on a novel by Shohei Ooka. In Japanese with subtitles.
