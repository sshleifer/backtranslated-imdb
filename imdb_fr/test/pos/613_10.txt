Subtle, delicate, touching. <br /> <br /> A young man wearing a summer dress on a bike is an epitome of perfect joy. History of an exit and anatomy of the relationship. <br /> <br /> Gentle and ambiguous gestures, slices of desire and a day as an expression space of innocent miracle. <br /> <br /> Two men, a girl, an afternoon on the beach, a few words and a gift. Religious traces and a pantheistic vision. Circle of light and expression, recesses of an ordinary day and a warm evening. <br /> <br /> A chaste erotic film in which gay identity or first sexual intercourse are only instruments for defining a universe with sensible values. <br /> <br /> Promise of self-discovery, universe of exploration of beauty, sign of the Ozon and even nostalgic look of each creation, "Summer Dress" is a wonderful opportunity to understand the moment as Dream projection, emotionally and childly look at the essence of essence beyond images or people.
