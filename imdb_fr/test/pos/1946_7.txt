Although I was hoping to enjoy a little more, it was still an impressive movie. There was very good performance from all the main actors, and the story, even if it's not what I would call the cold, was always effective and always interested me. For me, the best part of this movie was the look of the picture, as it always looked cold and wet and seemed really good for the movie. I also thought that the small budget was suitable for this movie, because I did not think that a sharp image and a clear sound would have worked as well in such a dark movie. All things considered, it did not meet my expectations, but I am still very happy to have finally taken the opportunity to watch this film.
