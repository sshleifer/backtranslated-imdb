If we neglect the technical problems of this early sound film (1930), such as the quality of the sound and the occasional rigidity of John Wayne, we find that this film is an epic more realistic than almost all films made since. From Missouri, a large caravan of wagons, people and animals from Conestoga heads west. The cars are driven into huge cliffs and cross a flooded river, posing a considerable risk to passengers in the cars. The Indians meet Wayne and allow the train to cross their lands. Later, the Indians gather west of the train to fight them. The wagons form a large circle with horses and cattle in the circle and shoot with their rifles, creating a veil of smoke with the surrounding Indians. <br /> <br /> When the battle ends, the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons leave. This scene is remarkable because the camera remains with the dead at the time of departure of the living. He is unique in the way he connects the viewer to the dead and separates him from the living. The cars encounter a major storm with torrential downpours and mud everywhere. They finally arrive near a redwood or redwood forest in Oregon. The film is made in 70mm widescreen format at a ratio of about 2.0: 1 (in 1930!). <br /> <br /> The plot was not mentioned because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous work. involved in making this film. Film makers will never work so hard to make such a movie or any movie. Given the technical limitations of the sound, the music is sometimes moving, for example when Wayne leaves his daughter to hunt down the killers of his friend and at the end. <br /> <br /> While all critics are moved by The Searchers and Wayne's Psychology, racism, short character, and complex characters, The Big Trail tells a story of simple people facing hardship extraordinary. One of the best westerns I've seen.
