I heard a lot about 'The English Patient' and finally decided to take the CD and find out what this ballyhoo was all about. What I discovered is a cinematographic delight and, I repeat, "should" always be viewed with an open mind. If you are a religious, zealous moral, I fear that it is not a film for you, because you will not see the beauty of this masterpiece film, because you will continue to look for the moral dilemmas that creates this film. If I remember correctly, before watching this movie, I read the review on this site and was completely disgusted by the point of view of this person who, I quote, said "that the protagonists deserved well what they had. As for morality, I agree with him, but that's not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I have rarely seen such a wonderful film. I continue to hear the background soundtrack of my subconscious. First of all, it's a love story, and yes, it's an extramarital affair (the moralists, beware), but do not continue to focus on that. Instead, let's focus on how the story was told. It's a mix of flashbacks and the present. It takes place in the context of the Second World War and tells the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy perfected to perfection by Ralph Fiennes), cared for by an army nurse ( Juliet Binoche) in a war-torn Italy, just before the end (defeat of the Axis powers). The patient seriously injured by healing continued to remember the torrid affair he had with an English girl, Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas), illustrated in flashbacks taking place in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are so intimately intertwined in the story that you are in some way transported into the story and you have the feeling of a first-hand viewer. The places in the desert and in Italy are beautiful, as are the characters. I am romantic and I am not ashamed to say that I had tears after the end. Look at it with someone you really love. The film begins and ends with the same desert plan where sand dunes twist like a woman's body and are breathtaking. The feeling of loss and sorrow has been expressed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why God! Why do we have wars that destroy the beauty and most unforgivable of all, the destruction of Innocence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he deserved to win many Oscars and I will go in search of other works of the director Anthony Minghella.It brings back somehow the romanticism in the kind of David Lean films. He almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia' who was also based in the desert. Happy to watch people.
