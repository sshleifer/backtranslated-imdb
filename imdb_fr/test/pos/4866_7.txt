As I said in previous comments, some programs are meant to be "light entertainment". So I'm a bit frustrated when commentators seem to be expecting a program that reveals the meaning of life. You will not get it from Cleopatra 2525 and it is not presumed to offer it. What you get is a girl who has been frozen and came back to life about 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. It does not settle within 10 minutes, unlike other adventures in time and is not the female equivalent of James Bond, ready to face all opponents.Cleopatra is fascinated by his new environment and scared by some most of us would be. However, this is a light entertainment, the stories have a fast start and end, and they are surprisingly good. The episode where there is a Cleopatra double is particularly moving and Jennifer Sky, in my opinion, gives one of the best performances of a person who has been dying for a long time, and being a fan of cinema and television, I know of what am I talking about? Finally, to prove my sincerity, I bought all but four episodes and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I do not have the full game is because I bought the other episodes before realizing there was only one complete box. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio in a credible way and for light entertainment, Cleopatra 2525 certainly entertained me.
