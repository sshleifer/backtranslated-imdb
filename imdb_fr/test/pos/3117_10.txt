What can you say about a short film filled with secondary actors and without "stars", without any performance, no lines of dialogue misinterpreted, and whose cold violence is counterbalanced by the warm "heart" of the protagonists of the 'history? <br /> <br /> It's a jewel, a diamond, a precious gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the American West. A West that is not populated by great heroes like Hickock, Cody, Masterson or Earp, but the everyday man and woman, farmers and ranchers, merchants and miners and loggers , whores and bistrots and artists of the day for riches, some for peace and quiet, others for religious freedom. <br /> <br /> It may be a very spiritual story, even if it does not promote a particular religion, even the non-Mormon cowboys represented by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. act in a noble and kind way to history, regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs, and doing everything possible to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train arrives at the blocked drug show. And biblically, like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, it is the guardian angels sent to the train that must eventually confront the incarnated clan of Clegg, comparing them to the serpent of the Garden of Eden, and regretting what they must do after. It's a sweet folkloric tale of the West that touches all the targets that John Ford targets. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, I have a western Santa Claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat and whose red cap is replaced by brown Stetson, which wears a jute bag and a reel of rope. To my father Christmas, I added a Winchester rifle with a shoulder strap to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to slip into his belt. When the people in the office ask me why my Santa Claus has to carry weapons, I simply answer: "Snakes!" After all, is not the Christmas spirit the one where everyone should get what they deserve? <br /> <br /> Fifty-five years later, especially after September 11, the philosophies and attributes highlighted by the characters and story of this film are as relevant today as they are today. the time.
