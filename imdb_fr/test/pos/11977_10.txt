This film is without a doubt the best I've seen in my life. The stellar cast of stars is only an added bonus to the amazing special effects, deep story and sublime choreography. The film is about an old love story that blends into the modern world. Two lovers in heaven incur the wrath of a great sage and are cursed. Subsequently, the woman was born again on earth. While in college, she is raped and commits suicide. The rest of the film focuses on stalking people associated with rape, its lover who possesses superhuman strength and command of several languages. Sonu Nigam delivers a very mature and profound performance in this movie, and all the other actors do it almost as well. The action scenes with Akshay Kumar are breathtaking and not to be missed. You just have to watch this movie !!!
