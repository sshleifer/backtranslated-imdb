The beautiful, charming, extremely versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the largest 5 or 6 actresses of American cinema. In over 21 years - as in all her films - she illuminates the screen with a natural and glamorous presence. She is both authentic and human, and a charismatic and inspiring model. This role is the epitome of Irene Dunne, full of pathos, wit and a little mischief. I love all his films, and this film was a fantastic new discovery for me when TCM aired it last night. I hope they will not wait for years before releasing it again. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest character actors in all American cinema. Of course, he often portrays variations on the same theme, but I never tire of looking at his soft-hearted executioners. Here, her character is the perfect support for Irene Dunne, and Coburn describes it perfectly. Their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic. They never miss a beat. In addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband, described by Alexander Knox. <br /> <br /> I do not know much about Knox's work. He was recognizable, but that was about it. However, with Dunne and Coburn, he holds his own. It offers a nice nuanced performance. His character has noble motives that are made accessible by Knox's performance and have never been imputed to us as a holy grail. He is noble, but in conflict and doubtful of his ability to carry out the OCS. His interaction with Dunne is always convincing. Dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and he responds in the same way. Their scenes are very well done. <br /> <br /> The film, in itself, is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and an environment that is not described in other films. I do not immediately remember another film that represents America that is still fighting World War II, but with the end in sight and the emphasis on establishing the post-war world. Not the usual movie of the second world war It's interesting in itself. it is also essential to the plot and message of the film. Unlike other commentators, I thought the final speech was ok, but not great. Knox interpreted the message very well, but it was not written "as closely" as the accumulation waiting for me expected. I've heard better film talk about very similar themes. He served his purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the greatest value of the movie is the description of Dunne and Knox's life, as it reflects the typical OCS experience. The sense of community among the wives living in Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely authentic - just like Palmetto Terrace itself, despite the fact that it was obviously a soundscape. The incredibly brief encounters between women and their OCS husbands. The rigor of the candidates to the OCS, mastering the difficult and complex material that they had to learn. The shabby "basic housing" - obviously hastily built. The tired and worn furniture. Constant and extremely short deadlines - to get back to the base, learn lessons, take the trains for later "posts". Tenants constantly meet their predecessors and successors in basic housing as they move in. Yes, I suspect it was a glimpse of a real WWII experience - dressed in a comedy, but very real at the base. I liked it and I highly recommend it.
