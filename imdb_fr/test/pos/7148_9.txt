It's a wonderful movie ... it's funny, dark, poignant, inspiring, ugly, innocent and generally entertaining. I do not know if I've seen this before ... "The Rapture", or maybe one of Todd Solondz's "comedies" or even the recent film "Teeth" come to mind ... but they are all little bitter and wicked jewels. "Franklins", despite the darkness that reigns on the edges, manages to have a heart purely sincere and pure. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to John Waters' "Low Down Dirty Shame", unlike this film it actually has a story, and something to say too, beyond the juvenile message de Waters "Sex is not dirty (sneer, nudge). A conservative and repressed family undergoes a radical change after a car accident and suddenly is no longer ... In fact, she is finally happy, probably the only people in her city (or maybe the whole world) ) which are. To talk about why this would be the case would be to ruin the film; Quite simply, everyone should see it, even if of course, only those who are already convinced of the optimistic and optimistic philosophy of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is awesome - this side of realism is realistic enough to prevent the debates from becoming too heavy ... Teresa Willis gives a particularly memorable and courageous performance as a stuck mother who emerges as a butterfly when she is released. Robertson Dean and she both deserve to be congratulated for their sincerely unshakable performances (not to mention the frequent and numerous scenes of nudity and sex); they transform what could have been a dirty joke implying a "deviant sexual practice" in a touching, credible and endearing moment. Aviva as a girl is a must-see star, capturing perfectly the attitude, anguish and language habits of a girl her age. Vince Pavia as a "himbo" brother with a secret is beautiful and functional, although his script and the way everyone reacts to it are more rewarding than his acting. Mari Blackwell as Mother Franklin's best-selling conflicting friend is wonderfully cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could have been exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is fantastic, with bright colors and wide. - open places ... it looks like it may have been shot in high definition ... if it is, the line has become very thin, it looks a lot like a movie. There is a lot of discussion and a lot of philosophical things, which gets a little bit preached (plus, I imagine to a spectator who does not agree with the politics of the film), but this movie says a lot of things that If only people would not be afraid to listen and think. The arguments that are made are intelligent and well thought out, refusing to demonize religious or non-religious parties. <br /> <br /> The end is ambiguous, which I found a little disappointment somehow ... I think it would have worked better if the author (like Jay Floyd, since he produced, written and directed) offered a more practical outcome, some sort of solution, but again, there is probably not one to oppose people of different faiths. Nevertheless, it is a moving and memorable final image that stifled me - a success. In the meantime, I am extremely pleased that Mr. Floyd has made this film and hopes to share it with as many people as possible. Check it out.
