<br /> <br /> Very good 1970s movie about crowd operations in New Jersey. When a "nonconformist" gangster does not respect the rules of the neighborhood, it is sooner or later the time of elimination. <br /> <br /> Joe Pesci was true to his character - sweet and funny. It only gets better with age. His face and current fame should not have been used on the DVD cover to sell this category "B" film because it was only the third star on the bill. music is a distraction. Nice to see the big cars of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, the acting is good. <br /> <br /> Anne Johns' nudity was not needed to make this crowd story work. And, it does not appear in the database because each actor in a movie other than this one. Pity; she did a good job! <br /> <br /> Moral of the story: Do not annoy your "Don". <br /> <br /> If you want to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night, then watch this DVD. It was part of a $ 5.88 special DVD sold at the local discount store. <br /> <br />
