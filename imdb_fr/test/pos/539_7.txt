it's a movie to see on television and once .. I mean, it's good, but it's a bit too long and the plot is so well known, it's not very original, but it's not boring. The best thing about the movie is the performances, Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon are excellent actresses and in this movie they did a great job. I give him a 7.
