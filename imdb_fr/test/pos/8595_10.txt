This film is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is also the best film seen using a drama to tell the story, without speculation as with JFK, Nixon or Hoffa. He skilfully describes the claws of Belgium on the Congo. It also allows us to easily understand the European and American forces that were behind the power that is inflicting Congo today. The film was supposed to specifically involve the United States, rightly, in the murder of Lumumba. This film could never be shot in the United States, because this film is rarely criticized by acts of imperialism and murder. (Save Stone's JFK) It also allows us to understand the problems that existed with the internal conflict in the Congo, between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We can see how precarious countries establish new governments when their history is colonization and the colonizers continue to pull the strings of power and strength. The film is very well shot with Eriq Ebouaney, an excellent Lumumba. The cast is great and really plunges you into the climate of Congo during this period. <br /> <br /> Again, it's a must for anyone who loves drama with a good history. See my notes on Quilombo.
