I heard about Begotten for the first time when one of my friends found it in a "cult classics" section of my local video retailer. She knew I loved obscure artistic films, so I rented her and brought her home. He stayed on my TV for a few days, then I put it in the VCR just before going to bed. I thought maybe I would see what it is first and then I'll spend more time on it the next day. What followed was that it really woke me up. I sat through the whole movie and loved it. After browsing the closing credits, I watched it again. Only after seeing the closing credits do you have an idea who is who. After you know you can watch it again with a renewed appreciation. Do not listen to people tearing up this movie. It's not for everyone. If you do not like to read the subtitles, this movie does not suit you (not that there are subtitles, there is no dialogue at all). If you really own Rush Hour 2, this movie does not suit you. <br /> <br /> This film is really original and inspiring. It does what other movies have never done. It looks like nothing else and is more daring than almost everything from 1989 to the present day. You can say that everyone involved in making this movie really loves the art of what they do and understand what can be captured in the form of cinema. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to be "entertained" then the movie is not for you. However, it is a pure escape in extreme form and film form. It's like someone is putting wires to my head and recording one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense if you sit and watch the pictures, dissect the action of the actors and not be passive watching your guitar, but watching and not blinking. <br /> <br /> People compare it to Eraserhead. but Begotten is so much more. I'm not kidding when I say it's my favorite movie. It is an important film, visually stimulating, mechanically inspiring and hypnotic. A criticism I read about this is however very true: "No one will go through Begotten without being marked."
