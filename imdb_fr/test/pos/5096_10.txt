"Chips" is an excellent mix of music, light comedy and drama, with a perfect interpretation of Peter O'Toole and an effortless romantic rendition of Petula Clark. O'Toole is able to show the timid and non-communicative professor who wants to be so loved by his students and can only express his love when he married Katherine (Clark). She brings him the world "What flowers" and is changed forever. He becomes the beloved director of Brookfield after a tragedy, but he knows he could only have achieved his goal through Katherine's love. The songs (with the exception of the Music Hall issue) are all "thought songs" from the character's emotions and thoughts. The more you listen to them, the more beautiful they become: "Travel the world with me" and "You and me". O'Toole's best moment is the last speech he gave to the students (this was the reason for the Oscar nomination). As a teacher, we question what "book" learning never learns - but, as Chips says, we taught them to behave with each other and that's what really matters. Beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by John Williams and one of the most moving films about love and transformation. "Have I filled the world of love?" the boys are singing their school song. In the end, Chips realized that he was able to do it - but only because Catherine was there.
