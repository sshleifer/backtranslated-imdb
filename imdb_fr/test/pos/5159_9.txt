This movie is not supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh. <br /> <br /> It's not meant to be sad, but my heart was heavy through a number of vignettes. <br /> <This is not written as an action adventure, but my pulse has run more than once. <br /> <br /> Just like life, this movie does not manipulate your emotions and does not tell you how to feel. It's simply, and you react. <br /> <br /> If you do not find it funny, not sad or moving, I guess it says more about you than the movie. <br /> <br /> It's amazing and refreshing to see a director celebrate so sincerely that we are all human and embrace that we are all trapped here to make this "life" over and over again, as long as we need. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow is another day.
