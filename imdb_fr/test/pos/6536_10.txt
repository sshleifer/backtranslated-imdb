Wow is all I could say, I really liked the movie and one thing I could say to Aaron Carter is that I really think you should be in a lot more movies because you're rock. love Aaron Carter so much he's hot thank you so much for making this movie awesome. I really wish he could do a lot more movies because he's an excellent dancer, actor and singer. So I wish I could sing as well as I could. and I have always been a fan of him and I will never stop loving him. I rented the film and I have it for two days and I have literally watched it like a dozen times. laugh loudly, you could call me crazy, but that proves that I loved it. if you want to talk, you can hit me at dvlbab300@aol.com, so write me if you want. I love you AARON CARTER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
