"The China Syndrome" has launched a series of films about the potentially devastating effects of misused nuclear energy, a black cloud of paranoia that would weigh on America for much of the Reagan period. It is a well-done and effective drama, reinforced by its high-powered stars, including Jack Lemmon, who plays the role of a senior manager of the nuclear power plant in crisis of conscience. But we can not help but think that it was the accident of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, which occurred only a few weeks after the release of this film, which earned it its lasting appeal as a classic of the 70s. As watchable as it is, it is certainly not a classic. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda, redhead in the role of journalist, and Michael Douglas, bearded, as a cameraman (and the producer of the film for that matter). <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
