I really liked this movie. If other people want to give it an average of about 5.0 / 10, that's their choice. I would give it 10/10. Sutherland's performance as a private eye is totally impressive. The story is incredible, human, exciting, intelligent. The dialogue is good. The story may not be perfect, but anyway, the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for that. Plus, the end is incredibly cool and their puzzle really comes together. So anyways I liked it. I also thought that the main actress had played very well. I'm not a big fan of crime movies, but this one was really good, too, because he does not really care about the supernatural conventions.
