I saw the original raw screen 4 times in Gencon a few years ago. I was delighted to have done it, my daughter is in the movie. <br /> <br /> I stood at the back of the room with her, watching the much younger fans sit at the edge of their seats, voiceless, without envy. miss a line. After the standing ovation that followed, it was as if we were watching the fans when the United States hockey team beat the Russians at the Olympic Games in Montreal. <br /> <br /> I like the great gags of comedy and sight. Taxi, Barney Miller, Cheers, Frasier and Married with Chilren are my favorite comedy shows of all time. Smaller shows that I will not even watch. <br /> <br /> This movie will do for the players what Animal House did during the college days, which Dodge Ball did for strange sports. Forget the lack of mega-budget to support production. It's pure art, it's good too. <br /> <br /> I can not be happier for the entire cast and the production company.
