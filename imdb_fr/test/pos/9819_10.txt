It's one of the few movies I've been recommended as absolutely great, it really is. If you give a low note to this movie, you really missed the point. You can describe Fosca as a manipulator, but if it's really bad, she gets sick when you do not answer the love she's sure of. But what would you do when you are sure that the other loves you and that he is "only" rejected by the fact that you are ugly? Would not you want to fight for that? At least I think it's better to fight for that which dies in bitterness. And it reminds me of how, as a man, I at first respond completely to the physical ugliness of Fosca and look no further than the person she is or could be. This film asks me very solemn questions about respect, trust, the feeling of being manipulated, etc. How can I now if someone manipulates me or just tries everything to make contact? What I think is the most remarkable feature of this film is that Ettore Scola has made it absolutely believable that Giorgio falls in love with Fosca.
