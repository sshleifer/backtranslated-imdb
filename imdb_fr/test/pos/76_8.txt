I guess I like this film as well as everyone I know; it is not perfect, but under the title "The Americanization of Lily", this memorable and charming satire satire could have been more appreciated and appreciated by all those who recognized the spirit of sweetness, intelligent, produced by Blake Edwards humor and solid story. The story, improbable but delicious, follows Lili Smith, a spy of marginal type for the Germans in a much simpler and less black and white war; Lili Schmidt, who passes for Smith, helps his uncle patriot too, for Germany, but neither cruel nor political, but opportunistic. Lili's target is William Larrabee, a charismatic American squadron leader who can provide him with valuable information. The plot is complicated when Lili falls in love with Larrabee, has her eyes open on the consequences of her spy, and sees the effects of the fight on the wounded of a hospital and realizes what it could mean for her men that she has met and loved. She is jealous of a rival for Larrabee's affections, then realizes that she can no longer do what she did and abandons the spying trade. The film's logical end comes when, after the terrible First World War, she sings the theme of the film "Wishing" in a dark theater, one after the other, the members of Larrabee's squadron appear, including her lover forgave her and their old adversaries; and even Uncle Kurt enthusiastically joins the song "It's a long to tipperraree" to indicate that all is well with the world again. This is a bold and sometimes brilliant story idea, written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of Fame "John Goldfarb"; and it's a delicious tale. Squadron Larrabee, including a drunkard who keeps crushing and other adorable types populate this animated film; and the sensation of this elegant and dazzling film is almost epic, both in its scope and its realization. We must thank Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume designs, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for the sets, Fernando Carrere for another great project, Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score, and Russell Harlan for his brilliant cinematography. The main actors are Julie Andrews as Lili, Rock Hudson as Larrabee, Keremy Kemp as Uncle Kurt in Lili, Michael Witney, Lance Percival as drunk pilot, the magnificent Gloria Paul in the role of Lili's rival as a striptease, and many others in small parts. It is difficult to say enough good things about the rhythm or the intelligence of the comedy just-that-side-of-broad; Edwards introduces this element to lift the horrors of the present war, for example the almost comic-opera approach with which men have brought war back to an era of more innocent human civilization. This comedy also helps to prepare Lili's conversion. the uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to accept the reality of what it does and potentially what it may be causing. It's a rare film about Lili's "sense of life" about "Americanization", about his self-assertion in the real world and, among other things, before the tragedy can happen. I find it haunting and beautiful in many ways. I consider it to be Blake Edwards' masterpiece; and under the title "The Americanization of Lili", I believe that hardly changes, it could have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film, it is in all respects that I know.
