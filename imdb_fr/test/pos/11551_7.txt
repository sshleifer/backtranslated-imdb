Leos Carax directed 3 big films: Boys Meet Girls, Bad Blood, The Lovers of Pont Neuf. In fact, these films were not so great, but they have the violence of youth, the beauty of the juvenile wilderness. Carax in these three films was well aware of what cinema was, but he tried to create his own vision of art, without thinking of everything he saw, but using and casting it in his time. Pola X is a very different film because Carax realized The Lovers of Pont Neuf, a monstrosity of 20 million dollars, a film that destroyed everything. After such a film, you can not do another one from the same point of view. So, Leos Carax has to change, and he did it. The film is not as beautiful as the first, it's more reasonable, more studio, more Paris dreamed, Carax has finally entered the reality. It is no longer clean, they are not poetic characters. Carax has become a romantic in the German sense of the word.
