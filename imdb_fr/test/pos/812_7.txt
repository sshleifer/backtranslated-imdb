... and I am so disappointed because I can not buy the DVD or VHS anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's a mix of Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald. fabulous as the spoiled teen. This was done when Molly was still brown, just before hitting a big hit with Pretty In Pink. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a good family comedy, with a benefit! <br /> <br /> If someone has a copy or knows where I can get one ... leave me a message, it will be very appreciated.
