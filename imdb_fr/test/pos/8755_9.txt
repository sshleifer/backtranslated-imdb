I remember seeing him in the early 90s on British television and I was hooked. The international reach of production is breathtaking and it is wonderful to see how the characters evolve during the five hours they run. The scenes taking place in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest and, as a spectator, you have a real idea of ​​the culture and atmosphere of these countries during the latter stages of the Cold War. The characters of Fazal and Helen develop very well throughout the series and compete with modern series such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under. In the UK, the VHS costs around £ 6 and the DVD around £ 10 - a good deal. I thought that Soderbergh's version was also excellent - but obviously owes this masterpiece a huge debt.
