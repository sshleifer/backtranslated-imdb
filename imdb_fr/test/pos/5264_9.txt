This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson shine in this romantic comedy. One of them is a business executive who reassesses his life expecting his death in the year. The other is a playboy who is tired of young women looking for gold and looking for a relationship with a mature and vital woman. If you have money in your hair and / or love in your heart, pass the popcorn in the microwave, wrap up with your honey and get ready for a treat.
