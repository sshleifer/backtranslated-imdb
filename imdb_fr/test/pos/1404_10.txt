Was struck at the way even the act was all along. William Haines had a great lineup of actors for the silent movie. Not on the edge. There are times when the work of the camera is excellent and combined with the story, as when waiting for the superintendent, it is very well done. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br />
