The Child's Play series is not one of my favorites, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an acceptable movie. This time we have two Chucky dolls and his old girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together, they go on a journey to find an object. There are some interesting scenes through the movie, like the guy who was hit by the truck and literally exploded, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the end that allows another sequel to unfold. It was not really a direct horror, she mixed a lot of comedy and was a kind of parody of the horror genre. This made the film better than comedy does with a lot of horror movies. Even if you're not a fan of child's play, try this one.
