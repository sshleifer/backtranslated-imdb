I've seen a lot of Dustin Hoffman's films like Straw Dogs or Rain Man and I liked them, but his characters are often too quiet or even shy. I was expecting him to be in this film like Straw Dogs, but I saw a totally different person. He was much more energetic in this film and reminded me a bit of Al Pacino in Serpico. The movie was very interesting from beginning to end. I liked how the character of Dustin Hoffman was willing to do anything to stay with his son. This film is also revealing. Personally, I think this shows that people should learn to find a compromise without involving others.
