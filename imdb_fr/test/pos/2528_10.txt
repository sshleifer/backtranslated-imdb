I'm from Brazil ... What's sad about this film is the exploitation that was inflicted on this boy. They told the story of his life and he never had a "centavo" (Brazilian cent) of this movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to live this lifestyle in Brazil. Sad ... but it's the world we live in. It's about making money, not saving lives. The question is: Where is Fernando today? Most likely ... dead. We tend to want to live in this "Disney-filled fantasy-filled life". When someone approaches the plate to help ... comes the higher power and says, "What am I getting from this? Where is my break?" - I wish people's conscience speaks!
