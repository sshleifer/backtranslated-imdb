Before, I had already seen some episodes of Leauge Of Gentleman that I found hilarious. When I brought the film, I did not know if I knew enough about the series to get it, I was wrong. It's one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen and it's the ingenious interpretation of Leauge's role. It has a very good and funny plot, as well as the use of a few characters at a time, it helps because it does not make too confusing what would have destroyed the film. Even if you've never seen The Leauge Of Gentleman get this movie, it will make you laugh and it's a movie that can be watched more than once and that's a great movie to watch with your friends. He really deserves it to review 10 out of 10.
