1st viewed 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): Spectacular rendering of the famous Lindbergh flight by James Stewart in the role of Lindbergh and director Billy Wilder. There are not really many backgrounds in this story, but it's okay because Wilder makes the event really remarkable because it comes directly from Lindbergh's point of view since he used his book as the basis for movie. This first film on the flight must also be one of the best of the act itself. Stewart talking and thinking about himself during the flight gives you a clear idea of ​​what Lindbergh went through during this 33-hour solo flight across the Atlantic. And he did all the flight without sleeping the night before - which is amazing !! There is a bit of background on how he bought the plane and got the funding, and some memories of his life during the flight, but the film is mostly about theft. The story is also beautifully done and photographed and is a joy to watch despite his age. I appreciate the fact that they did not throw a lot of down and let the story tell itself. Congratulations to everybody. It's a classic film that should be seen by everyone.
