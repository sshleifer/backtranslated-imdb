It starts a little slowly but give it a chance. In the spirit of "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and "Pink Sub", this film is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to thwart everyone. Rob Schneider is invaluable as an LT who takes himself too seriously, resulting in a failed mutiny attempt and a "pirate" crew that makes him walk. On the other hand, Kelsey Grammar (similar to Cary Grant) does not take anything seriously except work. This film is more about the lines than the plot. From the fisherman "moored" in Charleston harbor to the "whale" lure, their antics caught me by surprise and I burst out laughing.
