I'm sorry to see that SURFACE was not recovered for the 2006-2007 NBC season. I guess the market demand for crazy games and reality shows on television, a reflection on our sense of culture, has a great history. I hope and pray that some networks will accept it so that it continues like STARGATE and its repercussions. <br /> <br /> I also hope that producers will find a place to produce the desired post-production level in a TV Guide interview. At the moment, reruns of science fiction and marathons will have to be solved. For my part, I would love to know where the story goes after the tsunami that ended episode 15. I would like to know the spirit of this effective effort to scramble the real identity of creatures. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
