First of all, I'm from Munich, where this film takes place, and believe it or not, there are guys like Erkan and Stefan, including the silly dialect! I know their comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was that the movie is just the assembly of their jokes already known, but that's not the case! The jokes evolve over the course of history and take, in their own way, a particular meaning. But if you absolutely do not like Erkan and Stefan, the hands of this movie. Everyone - it's worth a look!
