Everything about "Choose Connor" was top notch, especially the screenplay and the very effective work of director, writer and producer Luke Eberl, 21 years old. . . a talented young man from whom to expect great things. All the actors were credible, the dialogue was smart, the theme was important. Loved it !!! <br /> <br /> I saw him at the Woodstock Film Festival 2007, where he was screened twice and immensely seduced the audience. It's more than just an adult movie - this kid is learning a hard and heartbreaking lesson about trust, politics and the "system" - how things really work to fit the personal agendas of those who occupy strong positions. <br /> <I would recommend this movie to anyone with a functioning brain.
