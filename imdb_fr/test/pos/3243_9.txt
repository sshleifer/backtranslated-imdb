Heath Ledgers in this movie really bothers me, but overall, it's an excellent watch. Bryan Brown is excellent when I do not normally like him, but everyone in his gang is a great job. Jimmy is an unlucky malefactor who does not seem to be able to do what's right (SPOILERS: loses money from pandos, a car and rolls almost like a bank robbery) but still wins. <br /> <br /> I did not know what the two children were initially for, but they do connect some intrigues. <br /> <br /> all in all, it's a hell of a lot of Australian cinema 9/10
