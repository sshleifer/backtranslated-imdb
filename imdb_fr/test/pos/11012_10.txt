When I saw this film for the first time, I was very impressed by the kind of atmosphere created by the director. It is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in 1974. If you see the movie, you will see a lot of scenes and customs that are called freaky and modern again. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film deals with the old question "What is real and what is illusion?" If you see "The Matrix" you will find a lot of similarities. But the two films are not comparable at all because "Welt am Draht" is an art and "The Matrix" an entertainment. If you prefer the first one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I lost my video copy. <br /> <br />
