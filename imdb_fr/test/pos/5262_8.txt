A fantastic dramatic comedy about the powers of friendship. Although it is a remake of a film of the same title dating from 1939, it would probably be compared to Sex And The City. I would not compare totally to that. The story begins with Mary (Meg Ryan) who seems to life most women would envy her, she is happily married, has a good girl, good friends and a beautiful house. But Mary's perfect life is not what she seems to be when she discovers that her husband is cheating on her with Zach's Crystal (Eve Mendes). Mary is perplexed and does not know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith) are trying to be there for her in every possible way. I really do not want to give anymore. But I found it nice and I am a man. Meg Ryan is great, it's good to see her on screen after a series of flops. And the rest of the cast is also awesome, including Eve Mendes in the role of Crystal. Just a nice light comedy.
