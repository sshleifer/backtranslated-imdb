The aftermath of the Second World War almost resulted in the death of the Soviet cinema. By the early 1950s, film production was virtually at a standstill (only nine feature films were released in 1951), and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored and often censored. After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their images, although many still hesitate to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propagandist position in the war that prevailed in previous years. It was only in 1957 that the director Mikhail Kalatozov and the writer Viktor Rozov had the audacity to produce what is widely considered the first post-Stalinist Soviet masterpiece, "Letyat zhuravli / The cranes fly, "one of the most beautiful representations of war" I have seen from any country or period. Not only was the film hailed for its artistic talent in the Soviet Union, but international recognition soon followed, and Kalatozov's film was honored with the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival in 1958. <br /> <br /> > 'The Cranes are Flying' is both an invigorating visual feast and a daring and humanistic representation of the war. Unlike many Soviet films on the theme of the war of the day, he was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional hero of war and more concerned about uselessness, brutality and, indeed, inevitability. conflict. Love, as a cinematographic concept, is too often idealized as a notion that triumphs over all and endures endless trials, yet the reality is far less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), separated by the advent of the Second World War (widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945), commit to getting married after the war. but tragedy denies the couple their wish. Wanting to betray the incessant torment and uncertainty of waiting, Veronika agrees to marry Boris' cousin, Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), a handsome but unworthy young man. The film may end with the proud victory of the Soviets and a patriotic parade, but the optimism of this sequence is crushed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young protagonist, who wanders without soul among the crowds who celebrate. > <br /> The most remarkable feature of "Cranes Fly" is Sergei Urusevsky's inspired and dynamic portable cinematography, which realistically and vertiginously captures the chaos and confusion of war, not necessarily under blows. fire and shouting. dying comrades {in fact, only one of the film sequences joins Boris on the eastern front}, but from the point of view of family and friends left behind. In a particularly impressive and often quoted long shot, the camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches Boris among a crowd of fugitive recruits and their families. The handheld camera gently follows the girl aboard a bus, crosses the crowd by her side - capturing momentary snatches of relatives saying goodbye to their sons and husbands - before sneaking unexpectedly to above the crowd when Veronika disappears into the dust of a squadron passing army tanks, a breathtaking motion that provides scope and urgency for the dramatic episode. Urusevsky first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war and he obviously fell in love with the narrative possibilities of hand-held photography: "The camera," he said, "can express this that the actor is unable to describe: his inner sensations.The cameraman must act with the actors.
