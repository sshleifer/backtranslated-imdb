Why is it better? Because it's faithful to the dark vision of the comic. Because imagery is inventive and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos in it. The first one had too much Jack Nicholson shtick, too much Prince music and a clumsy "romance". Here, instead of a bad guy, there are three. No Robert Wuhl, and the main woman is more than a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the # 1 attraction of this movie. Its transformation is what drives the theme of running, the edge of mental health and madness, good and bad. She's getting really scary. The costumes and makeup are excellent. Danny DeVito's penguin is inspired and anguished, not just a nut. His circus band is the only element of comic relief (apart from this giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I would have softened. Walken is rather a ruthless businessman. Danny Elfman's score fits perfectly, as usual, and Siouxie and Banshees' "Face to Face" song is without a doubt the best of all the songs in one of the movies, a perfect musical artist match and movie music. The craziest movies are macabre, do not bother and require second and third views like a carousel. Congratulations Tim Burton and casting!
