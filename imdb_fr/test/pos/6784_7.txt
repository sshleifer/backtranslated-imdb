Regardless of whether "National Velvet (1944)" is a bit ridiculous and sometimes unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is a captivating and very likeable story with a good moral. After winning a modest success with her appearance in "Lassie Come Home (1943)", the 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor landed her first lead role in Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolgirl obsessed with horses. Although filmed in California, the story - adapted from an Enid Bagnold novel - takes place in a small town in the English countryside, and Technicolor's photographs are fully exploited to present the beautiful, vibrant blue sky and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney is at the forefront in the role of Mi Taylor, a devious ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young Velvet awakens his sense of dignity and opens a new optimistic chapter in his life. Although he is obviously overflowing in a sequence, when he has to admit the traumatic experience that led him to fear horses, Rooney is nice as a surly but passionate young man who has to prove his worth. <br /> Maybe it's a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had these captivating purple eyes, as her acting abilities at this young age were rather limited. Her more emotional sequences, in which she shows courage and integrity in the face of adversity, make her quite hollow, and the touching and naive notion that "believing" does everything, is a reality that has since been repeated ad nauseam virtually every unforgettable inspiring sports movie ever made. Nevertheless, Taylor has bright eyes and enthusiasm, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a star. Anne Revere plays a very important role as the mother of Velvet, once a famous athlete, who not only swam in the English Channel, but was lovingly coached by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I liked the fact that Mi was only informed until the last seconds of the film. Mrs. Brown had then correctly decided that the young man should first develop his own sense of decency, rather than exploit the memory of his late father for financial purposes. he would surely have done it at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The film reaches its peak at the Grand Concours National, where Velvet decided, at the last moment, to ride his own horse, the Pi, in the world-renowned competition. Under the guise of a Latvian man, she continues, as expected, to win the race, but is subsequently disqualified - either because she is a girl or because she fell off the horse before she be allowed to go down (what a stupid rule!). ). This long race sequence is extremely well prepared, effectively capturing the nervous tension of these stressful seconds of nerves before the race, and the confusion of the event puts us in the same position as the Rooney character, trapped behind great spectators and anxiously waiting for someone to provide an accurate update. It does not matter if we know it's a double that's a big part of the tough riding - in many scenes we can clearly see a scary man wearing a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I bet that 'National Velvet' has nurtured the imagination of millions of girls over the last sixty years and that its power of inspiration has diminished little over time.
