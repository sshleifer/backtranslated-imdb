The show itself essentially reflects the typical nature of the average youth; Partying and picking up chicks is the common goal of the weekend in the clubs. People disapprove of the series because of its "perverse" idea of ​​picking up girls using technique and strategic characterization, but to tell the truth, virtually all young boys do it at the club. Overall, the show is very popular with the younger population, because we want to see the result of the performance of a "player" at the club, because the show offers a comic approach made possible by the jury. <br /> <br /> 10/10; a cool, fun and exciting series that allows the audience to really interact. Good Job Boys.
