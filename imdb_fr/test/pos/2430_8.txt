There is no doubt that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance (Anderson's eyes are visibly larger, the lips are thicker, the nose is bigger and more raised at the end, etc.), Anderson was unable to speak Russian, but that was ridiculous ... That's why I hate Anna Anderson and her colleagues so much. Few scammers have the audacity and stamina to steal for more than 60 years with such an unworkable ploy. <br /> <br /> However, to a certain extent, I have sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life had to be tough for a young Polish peasant. And imitating another woman for more than 60 years is a daunting task for everyone. She had to hold her fleshy lips all the time to mimic Anastasia's thin lips and sometimes had to go crazy to make people believe that all her memory was chaotic just as a result of a mental problem. <br /> <br /> Anna Anderson was a brilliant woman on a bad path. If she had used her looks, elegance, stamina, acting skills, she could have become a first-rate actress. <br /> <br /> Side note: Some of the main characters in this two-part character seem to be loosely based on real numbers. Prince Erich could be a mix of Gleb Botkin (the brain as possible behind the scheme), Duke George and Dmitri of Leuchtenberg, and several other characters. And Darya Romanoff seems to be based on the superb Princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But unlike the real Confederates, Prince Erich was unmotivated in this show and supported Anna for her love and sincere belief in her, which is touching. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great show. A bit fictitious but always faithful to reality. The power of Amy Irving lies in the fact that she successfully represents Anderson's self-confidence, the blending of personification of others and being intriguing herself. Just like Princess Xenia said about Anderson: "She was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of playing a role." Highly recommended.
