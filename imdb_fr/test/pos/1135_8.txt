I really like the show !! As a member of Greek Life, I can say that some things are exaggerated, but overall, it's still pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Rusty is a nice main character, his roommate is HILARE and the entire cast is awesome. entertaining in their own rights. I like the fact that he focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relationships with organizations. <br /> <br /> This show covers everything, and they do it without a curse or anything else (how else could it be for ABC Family?). <br /> <br /> My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and just about all Kappa Tau. This show is an excellent launching pad for them and I can not wait to see what doors it opens. <br /> <br /> Renew this show next summer, ABC Family. Like I said, love love LOVE !!
