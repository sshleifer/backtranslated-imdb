Once the slow start begins, the movie starts and becomes really fun a lot of unexpected ways. The overall cast is really good, with Heather Graham perhaps the weakest of them. Casey Affleck as his brother is really good and extremely friendly, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend the movie if you just want to have a good time. Teens should really enjoy this movie - it says a lot about relationships.
