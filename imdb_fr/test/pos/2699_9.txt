When this show aired for the first time, I saw it once or twice and I thought it was another show of "skinny, skinny guy" who seemed to be populating the networks at that time. It was just "ok" at the first visit and I did not look at it anymore; However, once the syndication came in, I took several episodes (just because it was twice a night), and I tell you, the more you watch this show, the more funny it is. Once you see how all the great characters are related, this show makes you laugh out loud. Every new episode I watch is more creative than the one before: people who only watch it a few times will not notice it. The writing and the story are much more sophisticated than they seem at the beginning (it's far from being "according to Jim"). First of all, Kevin James is hysterical, incredibly charming and a talented comic actor, just like cast. Leah Remini has excellent timing and Spence by Patton Oswalt is one of the most entertaining characters in the series. And of course, Jerry Stiller is brilliant like Arthur. I was shocked to read that it was the worst part of the series. It largely explains why this series is so great. His presentation of these ridiculous schemes (which complete the character of the crazy father) is unimaginable. And the cry - the best episode is when they show it as a screaming kid "Lemon Icee !!". This episode, in which Carrie takes her to a therapist in hopes of treating him (so Doug is less stressed), guest star William Hurt decides that Arthur screams because he has never been validated. The last part of the episode where Doug is beating his childhood during a therapy session is more than funny, it's one of the most creative scenes I've ever seen on a sitcom. I feel the strange need to defend this show because it is seriously underestimated - while "Friends" was sometimes fun, and that "Raymond" had great episodes and characters, they both lacked the creative touch of "King of Queens". At a time when most sitcoms keep jokes en bloc and are mediocre, "King of Queens" continues to push the boundaries of the sitcom and show a true comic genius. Critics of this show obviously do not understand - or have not watched it enough to give it a chance, because anyone with a real comic and creative sensibility must laugh out loud while watching. It's certainly on par with my other two favorites, "Seinfeld" and "The Office" in its ridiculous tone. It's the Arthurs, Kramers and Michael Scotts on television watching and laughing.
