This psychological / psychological thriller is, I think, one of the best I've ever seen. All the actors give a magnificent performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who goes from the nervous star at the beginning to the strange events of which she is part to become a cool star. You learn a lot about the real inner emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie craft itself. The film in the film situations at the beginning and through the game that is played with it by the "interim coach" is fascinating. Plus, Mark Snow's music is probably the best score I've ever heard. You will not forget this movie!
