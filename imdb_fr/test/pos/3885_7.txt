Has the proliferation of relatively high-quality programming on proliferating television networks enabled people to produce, perform, finance and / or play in their own films that would not otherwise have been in the air? able to do it? Is this a good thing? <br /> <br /> This movie does not answer the last question anyway, but it seems that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to convince I want someone to eat cheese with it. <br /> <br /> Like most new producers / filmmakers, Jeff Garlin's independent play sighs much more sensitively than the vehicle he's primarily known for (Curb). And yet, is it a sensitive film? He is not really a sensitive guy. Nice, of course. Relatable, indeed. <br /> <br /> It's a bit difficult to say about this movie. I can only tell what I drew. <br /> <br /> I rented the movie because of the trailers, especially the scene of a counselor portrayed by Amy Sedaris informing James Aaron (Garlin) that a woman is interested in him mainly because that she is a "chubby pursuer". "I almost fell from my seat, based on this single scene, I rushed to my computer to write a note to praise this film.The reason - I thought the school counselor (Sedaris) was talking about Beth, described by Sarah Silverman I was imagining a romantic and legendary comedy between the foxy Silverman and the fat Garlin I did not think the story would be anything original, but that the dialogue would be lively and that the scenes would take place at a In short, I thought it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> It was intriguing to see that the movie started like this, but then took a much more realistic turn when Beth gave a shot to whip James because "I've never really been with a big boy before." This is the brutality with which we live, and it was completely realistic.I applaud the decision.This simply meant that Beth had hand leaving the building and with it the only person catchy film. <br /> <br /> James's relationship with his mother was also interesting. This part made me wonder if the whole concept was not initially a play. There was this complex feeling. (The whole movie "Marty" in a movie was completely lost for me, because I have never seen this movie.) <br /> <br /> There were, however, serious doubts about the character of James Aaron. Is it really possible that at age 39 he has not had a serious relationship? And is he an actor? It did not really coincide with me. For me, his personality was less actress and more corporate. I could not really buy his banality either. He was probably extremely disappointed that things with Beth did not work. We felt that. But then, did he really care? <br /> <br /> Another thing: how can the world and its mother afford to move at the same time? Has not he just lost his job? The last one he had? That was one of the reasons he did not seem ordinary to me. Where do the funds come from for his life? <br /> <br /> And yet, I've read reviews that deal with the realistic portrayal of urban loneliness, so that's it. Yes, it's very realistic, the way we must be satisfied with what we have is all we have. The way we disappear from each other and from each other in interactions (James and Stella), a kind of self-effacement that happens just to pass to the next moment. This contrasts with the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments, our thoughts like those of James with Beth, it's really overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Very good.
