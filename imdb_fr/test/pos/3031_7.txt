'The Cell' is a journey in the mind of a serial killer and I literally think so. The film talks about the trip, the world it shows during this trip, the destination does not matter. In my opinion, this journey in the mind gives such beautiful images that other things do not matter as long as they do not disturb. In fact, the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the spirit of a catatonic boy. The way it works does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientists, including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe this method could work. Catherine enters the boy's mind and speaks with him in a world created entirely by the boy. She hopes to let him do things that ultimately will yield results. <br /> <br /> The real story at that time. Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio), a serial killer, has just thrown the body of one of his victims. FBI agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are on the case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that time, after medico-legal research on the submerged body, Carl can be found and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl has just gone into a coma; he has been sick for a long time. 2. His house and that of his last kidnapped victim are not in the same place. In a sense, this part of the story is pretty classic. <br /> <br /> Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine must enter Carl's mind. It's dangerous for a lot of reasons. In short: Carl is an unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine begins to believe that Carl's mind is the real world, then her mind can convince her body. she could die in Carl's mind. A tape about how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, ensures that Catherine will try to get Carl out of the brain of his mind. <br /> <br /> It is the path traveled by this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, who has already made some music videos, comes back to these music videos. Each piece of the imaginative world is another short film composed of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me, the visual style was completely new, in the manner of "Three Kings" a new visual style a year earlier. If something like that makes you like a movie, "The Cell" will not disappoint you. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can still love this movie. The story itself, without the fantastic fantasy world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open minded, of course, events are not (yet) possible in our real world. It's still a very fun movie with great ideas that look great.
