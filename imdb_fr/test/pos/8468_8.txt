It's a pretty interesting experience to watch. This is the first ever attempt to unite the view with sound. It features two men dancing in front of a violinist (perhaps William KL Dickson himself), standing next to an Edison recording cylinder, capturing the sound. <br /> <br /> The sound and images were not linked, one more. And it is only recently that the sound and the image have been added technically. This is probably why people are reluctant to call this film the very first sound image. <br /> <br /> The film was shot by William K. L. Dickson, an assistant to Thomas Edison himself, who ordered him to find a way to bring the images and sound together. The answer he provided was the kinetophone, a video recorder (basically a large wooden box containing a peephole so that people could watch the moving images) with a cylinder phonograph inside, for the sound. This is the first time we have surviving film experiences using this technique. All subsequent films using this same technique were shot as silent movies and the sound effects were recorded later and separately. Thus, Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images but rather an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. In some cases, people could even choose from three sound rolls, with three different orchestral performances to accompany the images. Only 45 tape recorders have been made, which makes the success of your Kinephone difficult. After this experience, we also focused on other cinema techniques, mainly with regard to cinema projectors. <br /> <br /> The experience itself was obviously not successful because it took more than 30 years before the first films. with his were made and commercially released. They simply could not sync technically and put the sound and images together at that time, and even if they could, and if the techniques had been available, it would have been a very expensive job to do that. For this reason, this is not really the most influential or important film in film history, but it is very interesting to see how we are constantly trying to improve the quality and the techniques of cinema and filmmaking. of movies. <br /> <br /> 8/10
