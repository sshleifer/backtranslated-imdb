Not only did I think it was the best movie of 1987, but it's probably part of my own amorphous list as one of the top 10 to 20 movies I've ever seen. For some reason, I really connected to this movie, and this is one of the most personal movies I've seen at this point in my life (I was 26). For better or for worse, I strongly identified with the character of Holly Hunter (and I'm a guy!). She plays an extremely bright, loyal and intense woman who could not understand romantic relationships. There were so many things she said in this movie that I would say or tell others in similar circumstances. And the end of the film seems very, very sad. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this role was the big break for Holly Hunter. Clearly, I was not the only one to think of it that way.
