I saw this film in 1954 with a double bill with "Valley of the Kings". These films have helped to spark long-standing interest in Egyptology. (In 1975, I visited Egypt!) Seen today, "The Egyptian" suffers from a flat dialogue and a few left touches, but it's a glorious movie to watch - the kind of thing that Hollywood , alas, does not do anymore - - And the story has a beautiful story ... not just the usual business meets a girl or a revenge is a matter. Too bad that 20th does not reissue the restored copies of this image to see them on the big screen.
