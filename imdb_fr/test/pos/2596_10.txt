Chuck Jones' Rabbit Seasoning, the second in the beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered the best of the three. Although I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, I must admit that "Rabbit Seasoning" is the most elaborate scenario. Here, the focus is on language, while Bugs and Daffy go through a series of complex dialogues in the great tradition of Abb√© and Costello's "Who's Next" routine. As a longtime fan of Daffy, I have always been thrilled with the trilogy of hunting, because it's always Daffy who gets all the best replicas (the famous "Problem Pronoun" being one of the classics of all times) and doing most of the work. Bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while Elmer is, as always, the dupe confused. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so amusing is that Daffy and Elmer represent such a minimal threat to Bugs that he just takes a step back and has a few easy laughs. Elmer falls into all the traps that are stretched out to him but it's poor old Daffy who gets off most badly, being shot in the face again and again, his beak finding himself in more and more positions ridiculous. Everything is built on the inevitable final declaration "You are despicable". As a complex example of the impeccable timing of Chuck Jones you will encounter, "Rabbit Seasoning" is a classic.
