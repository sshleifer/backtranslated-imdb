It is said that this film is or has been banned in the United States since its release. Since there is no information on IMDb, I have to trust my other sources and believe it. If this is really true, the movie is even more hurtful and scary and it is anyway. <br /> <br /> The film is a so-called fake document, although I think the subject is too serious, call it that. This creates a scenario where America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are stopped immediately without proof. After a compulsory court, they must decide whether they will go to jail for a few years or choose the punishment park. For this, they must cross the desert for three days to reach an American flag, 50 km away, followed by the police and the army. <br /> <br /> The film itself claims to be a documentary about these incidents and follows both the courts and the hunting across the desert, filmed by European film crews. All the facts are explained, the interviewers ask questions and film everything. People are looking directly at the camera, shouting at them. It seems very very real. To speak of realism is nonsense. This film does not deal with making a realistic film, but about its appearance, if it were real. And that would certainly look like this. If it would be filmed anyway. In a "utopian" state like this, a European film crew would not be allowed to film these things. <br /> <br /> There are many things that scare us. The accused are people of all social classes. Political leaders, musicians, writers, philosophers, unemployed, etc. They seem hopeless, rebellious or frightened. They are not heroes. They talk a lot in court, knowing that it does not lead to anything, saying all the things they said in speeches, books and songs. It is said that he is not afraid to die. Is it true? Well, he does not have to cross the desert chased by the cops. The accused have no chance, or at least their only chance, the decision between prison and punishment center, is no chance. The way they decide at the end and end of the film clearly shows that this kind of heroism is suicide. <br /> <br /> These courts remind us of many courts of the Third Reich. Public servants use the same kind of idealistic speech, ignoring all the arguments of the defendants, starting to shout at them and telling them they should be silent. They warn the accused to "monitor their language" and insult them much more. They ask them questions, the defendants can not answer them, but that is never their intention. These scenes are a statement of what we call justice. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the desert are at a different level. When we see the prisoners for the first time, we realize they realize they have no chance. Seeing the desert and mountains, feeling the sun and thirst, they have no idea how they should live these free days. The film crew follows them and talks to them as they try to escape this madness. They argue, should they play the game, or escape, or revolt? Everything leads to the same thing and no one is surprised. Some will wonder if such parks would actually exist in such a state? Why not? This empties the prisons and allows the government to punish the revolutionaries as they wish. It is not a gas chamber, but the Nazis killed Jews before the construction of the concentration camps. The comparison is fair because they do not really make a difference. <br /> <br /> The film is scary and depressing. The problems we talk about seem too familiar to be ignored. It's not science fiction. Talking about poverty, unemployment and crime is not a utopia. The film shows us that government and democracy as presented to us are not only useless, but dangerous. It also shows us that revolution is not really the answer. The accused seem confused because they do not really know how to fight against it. They do things, but for nothing. Even if that does not give us any solution, it remains a statement. <br /> <br /> For me, the scariest is the fact that this film was banned. We have here a film that accuses the loss of freedom, morality and peace. He accuses the government, a fictitious government nonetheless, of being dangerous and inhumane. And such a film is forbidden. Think about it when you see the American flag next time.
