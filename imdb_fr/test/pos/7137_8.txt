Based on a true story. . . <br /> <br /> The purpose of this film is to illustrate that, through relatively normal events, it is possible for an apparently "decent" mother to be drawn into a heroin addiction. <br /> <br /> *** semi spoiler *** Some scenes are pretty imprecise - others almost make you want to find the solution to your problem. <br /> <br /> A computer technician / graphic artist who has a good relationship with her young teen addiction after work colleague, who is a "shredder" (someone who can take + enjoy time in time -) Then turns into an addiction that eventually leads him to scratch street vendors after losing contact with his regular salesman. <The scenes that show her falling and falling "sick" are often VERY real - especially the first real "night sweat" Before all these events, she started a relationship with a guy who had just lost his wife by the bottle, and insists that he has an internal radar to not become addicted to such women. Some radar! However, after a few late twists and strange behavior, the boyfriend challenges her to explain what is happening. His radar is starting to get more and more and asks him to empty his bag. she falls on the roof and breaks loose. <br /> <br /> Because of the excellent and open relationship she had developed before this tragedy, he is the first to "find" real evidence in his bag; he then looks around the garden hose for his "hiding place" - apparently, his sensibility comes from the school lessons on addiction - and when he discovers a big hiding place in the bathroom, he pulls it! She is not a happy woman when she takes her next bath and she "disappears". <br /> <br /> The child holds one and places it on the meal table. She denies more and more, recognizes it and says no. worse than drugs. <br /> <br /> The girl does all that is good, calls her friends and usually puts her in a position where she must be "clean" - if you want to forgive the pun. <br /> <br /> The film takes the viewer into quite painful situations where the danger is not so far away. <br /> <br /> Eventually, she gets help from a professional organization and is cold - you'll have to watch the film to see what happens next. . . .
