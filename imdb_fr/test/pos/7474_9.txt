I saw this film by accident while I was in Paris. I went to the wrong theater by accident and when I realized it was not a taste or a short film, I became hooked. <br /> <br /> Paulina does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting. I can not say how impressed I was with her portrait of this real femme fatale. The rest of the cast behaves very well too. Do not get me wrong, this is not the best movie of all time, but as I did not know it, I ended up with a lasting and very positive impression. <br /> <br /> Finally, DO NOT speak French in France has paid off for once! I did not stop talking about this movie for 3 weeks after seeing it.
