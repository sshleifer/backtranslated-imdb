I saw Jimmy Stewart in all the usual roles, but "Spirit of St. Louis" would be one of his favorites. Poor actor at the box office at its release, this film has been largely forgotten nowadays. Recounting the well-known story of Lindberg's famous flight in 1927, Stewart seems to have been misinterpreted at first, and his well-known voice never lets you forget who you're watching. it's like George Baily. But obviously, Stewart worked hard on the role and he does everything right, so soon you do not care anymore about knowing that Stewart was 20 years older than the man he represents. The Lindberg of Stewart is so crazy, all American, apple pie that you are trapped in history, and you realize that Stewart intended to portray Lindberg with all he could muster, know it to make Yankees. up. Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the United States, and Stewart seems determined to maintain his appearance. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks are skillfully used to advance a rather boring story, and I was struck by the subtle references to faith scattered throughout the film; Lindberg trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly, only to be confronted with his convictions, or Lindberg refusing to wear a St. Christopher medal offered to gain weight on the plane, only to find the medal hidden in his lunch bag after crossing the Atlantic. For me, it is not a film about the epic journey of a man into the unknown, but about his realization that this life is much greater than what we can see and feel.
