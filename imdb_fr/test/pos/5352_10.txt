Having just returned home after my third viewing of The Curse of the Were-Bunny, I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought about it. I noticed that a lot of Britons loved it, while those in America just did not understand. It does not really shock us, because America does not understand what "English" is. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are very English. Middle-class English, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity, sets the tone. The film is very much like our two heroes; simple and unpretentious. There is a beautiful and sweet plot so that children do not get lost, but there is enough beef to entertain adults too. There are some slight allusions (which seems to have offended the evangelical - oh no, drama!), But nothing is more rude than a background for a brief moment. When people feel offended by a plasticine anus, you know the world is messed up ... <br /> <br /> A quick note for those (all Americans I've seen so far) ) who think that Chicken Run is a better movie: Chicken Run has been designed to please your sense of humor, and I think it has suffered. The curse of the rabbit was witty, English and intelligent. Thomas The Tank Engine's movie was ruined because it was made to please Americans and I'm glad Nick Park did not let that happen to another great British institution. <br /> <br /> In Summary: You Can Keep Your Chicken Runs, Your Shreks, Your Madagasga - This kind of coarse, crass and stupid comedy simply does not compare to the spirit and grace of Wallace and Gromit in Rabbit-Rabbit Curse. English at the base, and that Wallace and Gromit stay so long.
