At first glance, this mini-movie ... I was a little disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston did not return to the cast. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey have done a remarkable job in replacing some of the most important characters in the legendary epic Western saga. <br /> <br /> Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played an excellent villain, and Louis Gossett Jr. was, as always, true to form with his excellent acting skills. <br /> <br /> seemed to be true to life in many scenes, including one of the best, where the valiant shootout ended with the assassination of Private Ranger Walker, made me feel I was in the movie. Return to Lonesome Dove was for me almost up to the quality of the first of the series. The next two follow-ups with James Garner as the Caller just did not do it for me. And that Lorena marries Pea Eye? How on earth did this go into theirs? It was a total shift of characters. The first two in the series are the story of Epic, the next two are by no means of the same quality. <br /> <br /> Now, if the first two could be remastered into Dolby Digital and anamorphic presentation, the movies could be where they should have been like today's movies.
