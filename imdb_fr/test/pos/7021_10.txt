Dirty Dancing one of my favorite movies. I only watched it twice on ABC because I did not have the opportunity to buy it or rent it from Blockbuster. I did not know that Jennifer Gray was 27 years old at the time of the shoot, because she was very convincing as a teenager. Compared to some Hollywood women, she has a very flat chest, which is why I got so easily by her age. So physically and emotionally, Gray is very good at playing a teenager. I also liked dancing - who would not want to? Whenever I watched Dirty Dancing, I still want to look for dance classes. I also like the soundtrack and I recognize some of the songs of my eight or nine years. I would love to see this in my drama class, and I will ask my teacher at some point if there is a part of the film that he can use for educational purposes. It's a lot better than what he showed us last year. And the end was absolutely fantastic. This is one of the best moments of the film. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I'm looking forward to going back to school the first day because of Dirty Dancing! Who could ask for a better influence of a movie with this kind of title?
