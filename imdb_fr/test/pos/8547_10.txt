I saw this film years ago and I have never forgotten it. The theme is very timely. It was on the MTC this morning and I wonder why this wonderful movie is not on VHS or DVD. I have long searched for this film but I can not find it. I think if enough people ask for it, the movie will eventually be put on DVD. It surprises me that such an amazing performance by Quinn and such a powerful plot are not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must for teachers and students. This film is a great educational tool from the past but in many respects as contemporary as "Crash". Previous comments show that this movie deeply impressed everyone. Again, pity it is not available for sale.
