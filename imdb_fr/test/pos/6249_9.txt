One of the strangest, most astonishingly frightening and scary horror films of the '70s, "Tourist Trap", even by its flamboyant style, defying conventions, "everything that happens" is considered a nightmare . Still, it's very strange in the picture - a strangely magically mounted atmosphere of a generously whimsical supernatural fright that, from the start, presents itself as a potent goosebumps and becomes more and more opaque and scary as the film moves forward, offering significant shocks amidst scattered moments of dreamlike elegance of unreal beauty and ending in a cruelly ironic and bitterly nihilistic note with a mesmerizing final image difficult to shake - making it a unique and singularly annoying experience . <br /> Teens traveling by car in the desolate desert of California are desperately lost. They come across "Slausen's Lost Oasis", a shabby, roadside dive, consisting of a gas station, a dilapidated wax museum in three parts, and all the dismal and disturbing parts. Slausen, the seemingly friendless and harmless owner of Chuck Conners, turns out to be a deranged psychic killer with deadly telekinetic powers. Slausen gives life to his bizarre assortment of mannequins resembling uncomfortable humans and chooses children one by one so he can add them to his growing collection of casualties. <br /> <br /> Director David ("Puppermaster", "The Arrival") Schmoeller skilfully writes all the latest tensions that he can extract from the pleasantly ambiguous and open scenario of which he is the co-author with J. Larry Carroll. (The stubborn refusal of the scenario to provide a rational excuse for all the strange things that occur throughout the film, often mistakenly criticized as one of the film's major weaknesses, is actually the film's main asset, giving the scary photo, everything and everything.The quality of a real nightmare can happen in a horrible way, which would never have been possible if a credible explanation had been given to what was happening.) The score beautifully scary and unobtrusive by Pino Donaggio, Nicholas von Sternberg's obscure cinematography and Robert A. Burns' dilapidated and cramped production design add immensely to the film's deeply troubling mood. Excellent performance is another significant benefit, with the pretty and happy Jocelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner in "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase") particularly fine and likeable as the most resistant and friendly teenager in danger. Even Tanya Roberts is doing well like an unlucky little girl who has a levitating knife in her head. Shifted and unusual, "Tourist Trap" is worth the detour.
