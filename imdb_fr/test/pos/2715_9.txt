comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than what you did about this film and its end. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate him. But this time, I looked at him alone and I noticed that it touched me a lot. Although the film is long, I was bound to the story and surprised by the end. At first, I thought it was weird to see how it had disappeared, but at some level, it makes sense. <br /> <br /> But as Comeundone says so well, this film has no sense of reality. Instead, he challenges him and the viewer to think seriously about the meaning of the word "normal". It also gives you the impression of personally thinking about what the end means, I can say I liked how it happened and I'm happy for Mithi.
