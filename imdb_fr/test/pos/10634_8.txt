During the first twenty minutes, we are overwhelmed by several powerful emotions: a suffocating and authoritarian mother has a violent argument with her 40-year-old daughter, who was living at the time; the love of a piano teacher (and music teacher) for his students expressed by unfailing criticism; the joy that music can inspire both the listener and the performer. In this short span of time, our senses have been assailed convincingly with real characters. We are also swept by powerful music and demonstrate the difference between excellent and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuances. This kind of material would have been the basis of an exceptional film of general appeal. But the trend in French cinema is what it is, it goes further by exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and its subsequent rupture in a context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle real abuse. We are drawn to her suffering and, at least at first, we wonder how much suffering can be linked to the achievement of genius, especially among the composers she admires. The piano teacher contains graphic dialogues and representations of sex and brutality in scenes that some people prefer not to watch. The scenes are essential to the dilemmas that the film seeks to raise and can hardly be described as free. It may be a good movie, but it is not.
