I do not remember the series. I think it may have been "American Masters", but it was broadcast on PBS around 1980. Most people know a little about the development of the A-bomb, and those who have little, if any no, probably thinks it's a pretty dry topic. Anyone who has watched this 7-part series does not feel like that. You get to know the excitement in Oppenhemiers' mind and how this development has changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure he has become and why. With 7 episodes, you'll get to know the main actors, plot and stabbing. I contacted PBS about the chances of getting a video or DVD, but I never received a response. Too bad, I'd like to see him again.
