SUPER FILM! Chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffany) makes this movie even better! Long before Chucky's death, he and Tiffany were together. But like ten years later, Tiffany recovers Chucky (as a doll) and brings him back to life. It was a good movie! Scary and really funny (only because Chucky!) 10/10
