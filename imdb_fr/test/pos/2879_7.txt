This, ladies and gentlemen, is really a modern fiction film. The dialogue is elevated and delivered with a stiffness in wood, the premise is predictable (there are some decent twists) and the characters remain 2D for the most part. And yet, there is a certain ... charm. WWE wrestler Kane brings to life the twisted and sick monster of a man with a lot of pathos (although he looks like his character he's been playing for about 10 years) so I'll find it very entertaining when people will say it's not a big deal for him, "but Glen Jacobs is, it seems, pretty nice, so in fact, he's perfectly portrayed as an imposing brute and the number of deaths is excessive (Jason would be proud of it), but I've heard at least four applause breaks for four different killing scenes ... Frankly, go into this movie thinking you'll have fun and a gorefest, oh it's really the gorefest, the R-rating is well deserved and I got a little nauseous during some of the most graphical periods, in any case, a very, very funny but bad movie.
