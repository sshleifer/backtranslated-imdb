This film failed miserably in the UK and he did not deserve it. The trailer for this film is slightly misleading, and I imagine it misleads critics and the public into believing it was "Atonement: Part 2". While the film was commercialized this way to capitalize on the previous success of Joe Wright's BAFTA award-winning film, his tone is very different. He focuses on a kind of imagination of the life of the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas during the Second World War as a writer of propaganda films for the war effort, then his return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan's (Matthew Ryhs) childhood friend Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. She was Dylan's first love in their country, but now is the time, and the singer Vera only wants it as a beautiful memory. Where does she go? Unexpectedly, Vera creates a close bond with the other woman in Dylan's life, "Queen of Ireland, love of my life, mother of my child" Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). The three men form a kind of war-torn London housekeeping, but Vera falls in love with a brave soldier, William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They get married quickly, Killick leaves for the war. A frightened Vera convinces the Thomas to return with her to Wales, but the three are confronted with the realism of the birth of Vera's child, William's jealousy and the shock of his shell after returning home. . <br /> <br /> Filmed on a small budget, it's more of a room than anything else. It works best by recognizing that certain memories and feelings must be preserved, but not renewed. Sienna Miller's performance is particularly exquisite (unfortunately, the nonsense of the paparazzi is detrimental to the fact that she is quite talented), and Knightley and Murphy are once again very good. Rhys incarnates Dylan, who, although the Welsh poet himself does not have a bed of roses, lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in Dylan. The writing is very hectic, some beautiful moments interspersed with negligence. This is definitely worth watching, though.
