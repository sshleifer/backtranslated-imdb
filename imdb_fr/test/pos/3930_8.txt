I did not expect much from this movie when I went to the theater, but I had been waiting for it for many years. In short, it was damn good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he would be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good but the best performance went to Brian Van Holt. He played the bad guy too well, I mean he was sick, sadistic and very cruel. The story between the two brothers was good, and I liked the fact that no murder took place before the beginning of the film about 40 minutes. This gave you time to choose the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was very good as the best CMM hangman. I liked how Chad cried when he found him dead. It was better than telling him, "Anyway, my boyfriend is dead, we do not care." It showed how much he really cared about him. So all in all, it was a god god slasher with great effects. Bravo!
