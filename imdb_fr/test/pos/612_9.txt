Sadness and nostalgia permeate Late Chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by Japanese author Mikio Naruse, currently on a retrospective of his long unavailable films, courtesy of James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and the Japan Foundation. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi, the latest issue of Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired, now middle-aged geishas, ​​whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret. The performances are consistently outstanding, especially that of Haruko Sugimura, who has notably starred in films by Late Spring, Floating Weeds and Oz Story by Ozu. Sugimura plays Kin, an old Geisha who has no children and only lives with her young girl who can not speak. <br /> <br /> She became cynical towards men and turned to money, especially real estate speculation. and lending money to his friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), all former geishas. Kin's friends live in lean conditions and complain about how Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends a lot of time trying to make ends meet. Tomi and Tamae are losing their children. Tamae's son goes to work in the Hokkaido coal mines and Tomi's daughter decides to accept an older man's marriage proposal. Both resist change of circumstances but inevitably accept it. <br /> <br /> Two male friends visit Kin, Seki, a former lover with whom she had contemplated double suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover whom she is eager to see again after many years. Her mood is optimistic, but she feels quickly when she discovers that the two men only want to borrow money. Naruse cuts perfectly between two extended sequences while Kin confronts Tabe. Tomi and Tamae are consoled by the loss of their children. The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are strong women who, if their future does not look bright, refuse to see each other. simply as victims. Late chrysanthemums have the simplicity, humor, and stoic acceptance of life that are prominent in Ozu's films. They gently recall the slow time and comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way.
