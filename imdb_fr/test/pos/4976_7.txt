It is always interesting to find in a film a prophetic line for the future of an actor. In this case, I was intrigued by Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck - "I promised you the Valley" as he discusses the failure of his attempt to control all of Logasa's lands . Ten years later, Stanwyck would play the role of matriarch of the Barkley family in "The Big Valley". One way or another, I thought it might have looked older in the previous photo. I guess all these bright dresses and these sophisticated cycling outfits have a way to bring out its juvenile side. <br /> <br /> As for my summary line above, this is Lee Wilkison's appreciation of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of those Tasks mentioned earlier, not long after that Parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to eliminate a number of Wilkison's hands after raiding his ranch and flaming. I liked the way the movie explored his character, starting with the way he treated foreman Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in a calculated confrontation. The setting up of the ambush was also a skilful maneuver, diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing headlong into the wicked, with both sides fighting over the last man standing. For that, Parrish also had something to say - "Never meet the enemy on his terms". <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" is a good title for this film and was probably at the head of his class. in the mid-1950s, although by today's standards it is not close to blood, it will be found in a "Tombstone" or "Open Range" where bullets require fierce savagery. But it is shaped by the good performances of the directors, with a secondary plot exploring the infidelity that seemed almost ironic since it was the character of Stanwyck who was cheating.
