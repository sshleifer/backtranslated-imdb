This thing works on all levels - intense as a thriller, full of tribute from Lars von Trier, but also a lot to her own film - and she has a message: happiness comes from within, better personified by the wounded soldier who practically (and, believe it or not, humorously) disintegrates member by member throughout the film, while apologizing to others for imposing on them. You make fun of him, but you will envy him too. The main character is a well-meaning but clumsy writer who spends the entire film helping his friends on a train from Stockholm to Berlin right after the Second World War. It connects the parallel stories together and makes people go crazy in the process. To say that things go wrong is a euphemism - and structurally, the characters are in perfect opposition to each other. It's as if each of them had an opposite - just so tight, like watching antimatter collide. You will not believe the sick thing that you end up laughing. Saying more would be considered a spoiler - all I can say is that it's a shame that this movie did not come out in the US, not even on DVD. Some fools probably told them that the Americans would not get it - which is shitty, because not only do we "get" but produce things like South Park ... If this film is commercialized in the United States, it should to be sold as a movie noir comedy, because that's what it is. Over-the-top, sick and crooked, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyyy!
