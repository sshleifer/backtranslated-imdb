Do not criticize the director's second feature film too much. <br /> <br /> I really like Madiba's camera work. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of seeing things. <br /> <br /> However, how can a 14 year old boy take such beautiful pictures? Remember that he has received no education of any kind. I do not think English is the common language in the ghettos of Cape Town. Even worse, Madiba seems even smaller than her supposed age of 14. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you overcome the above mentioned features, you can watch the movie and enjoy it again because of the neat work.
