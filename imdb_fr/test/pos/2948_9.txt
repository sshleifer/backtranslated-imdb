This film is remarkable how remarkable it is. It is the true story of a woman and a man and their quest for happiness in the midst of the sad and chaotic life of the housewife and the "man of the house". It can be any couple, any family, in any city ... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches us one way or another and reminds us of someone we know and love, or ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I could not help but think about it ... and what more to ask for a movie, really? Especially a documentary. This is an excellent film that I highly recommend to anyone who loves documentaries, family stories like yours, love, life, parenting, loss, expectations, questioning, nostalgia , wandering through life and finding one's way. .
