It's a great movie in many ways. Most importantly, it may be to present to the Western audience the remarkable and tragic story of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fight for freedom and democracy. Wonderful acting, beautiful cinematography, breathtaking action and suspense: "Beyond Rangoon" has it all. I have seen this film many times over the past ten years and each time it is more to me. Not everyone will like it (hence the relatively low rating given to IMDb), but that's because it's not the standard Hollywood audience; it rather challenges the viewer on several levels. I never looked at her without crying at the end and promising to lead a more meaningful life.
