I went to see this film with my family, who was expecting a perfectly conclusive story like "mr. & Mrs.iyer" and they went home very disappointed. So, this is a warning to all "in love with the conclusive story" Park Avenue does not try to answer questions or offer moral solutions on how to treat mentally deficient people. Her intention is rather strong and clear. She questions every human being, whether it is healthy or not, a sense of reality. In fact for safety, servitude, the satisfaction that I find in my present, is it really that I am or does it really create an illusion that we are all desperately and sometimes ignorantly? to hold on just to falsely console the neglected 'meethi' that exists in all of us in one way or another? so why is Anjali so obsessed with showing off her strength of mind when she feels really torn by the realization that she's becoming a monster? Are not we all who think we are "normal", really monstrous? and helpless about it deep down inside him? Is it not better to be happy, even insane, than to create an impression of "normality" while suppressing its fragility? meethi bravely, foolishly, sincerely, and society calls her "schizophrenic". The end confused me at first, but you realized that meethi's courage and sincere conviction took her where she wanted to go. She found what she was looking for, regardless of what society had to say about her research. and they are apparently "real" people - anjali, the psychiatrist and jojo - who never reach anywhere. My family thinks I am also schizophrenic to try to make sense of a film that is largely "crazy" for the rest of the world. world.anyone someone who wants to believe in my sense of reality ...........?
