It's the best movie of all time, but that's my opinion. Some say it's corny, but I think it's really a beautiful movie. The chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is unlike any other I've ever seen, and that's what makes the film so perfect. I always wonder what would have been this film if these two actors had never existed, because not one had done it for me, they had it both. If you have never seen this movie, you will understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing seems to have been done with the heart and it seems so real for some reason, like magic - and the LOVE IT soundtrack. In addition to the two main actors, the soundtrack makes the film the beauty it is. As you can see, this film fascinates me and I know you too.
