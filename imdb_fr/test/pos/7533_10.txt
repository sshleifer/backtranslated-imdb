"Nagisa no Shindobaddo" or "Like Grains of Sand" is an incredibly beautiful story about teen boys and girls facing becoming one with who they are. This film does not deal with homosexuality, but with sexuality. <br /> <br /> Aihara, an isolated girl, will certainly make viewers reflect on the identity of the IS behind the isolated girl. Does she like Yoshida? Or does she like Ito? Or did she turn into a lesbian because of "the incident"? (I doubt). <br /> <br /> And what about Yoshida? Does he realize he loves Ito in the end? Well, we all know that he loves her as a friend. But you'll never know once you see this movie ... haha ​​:) In the end, Aihara (with Ito) delivers an outstanding message to the audience: the fact that it does not matter if you like a boy or a girl girl . And I have to tell you that I am so dense that I did not understand it at first. ^^ ;; This is because of all the scenes without conversation ... You must try to understand what the characters think and say through their actions and NOT by what they say (especially the final part ... ouf, My boy, it was confusing!) It's a puzzling story, but it's still beautiful. :) This movie is certainly one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen a lot).
