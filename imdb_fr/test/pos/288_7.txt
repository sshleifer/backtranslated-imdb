Watching this movie, I realized that it was fun and exciting for the actors and the team; I could feel that they were facing the budget constraint with enthusiasm and dedication because they apparently liked the people involved. <br /> <br /> I tend to like B films that are original and have heart, and I think this is one of those works. The actors seem to me to put their heart more than usual, perhaps thanks to the good advice of the main actress / director, and they were obviously sufficiently clear in their parts of the story to create a coherent work of art to watch. . <br /> <br /> The critics of this movie who say more or less "Why not rent a hardcore movie" explain why they did not like the movie. Going to this movie hoping for a lot of T & A without patience for the material of the plot is the reason why it is so nice for them. One could say that the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie, even though I suppose the star did its share of soft porn. I think she graduated. <br /> <br /> As for writing, dialogue is not an important part of the film, as in a Tarentino movie, but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun. In particular, the end is not a disappointment but a pleasure, the heroine and the heroine and the main man learning from their complex network of feelings. <br /> <br /> I understand that the producer has signed a contract with 3 films. Hat for having proven tens of thousands of dollars can go far enough if you have artistic sensibility and pride. <br /> <br /> Gabriella and the other girls with nudity scenes were friendly and warm, not just aerial bimbos, so like an erotic science fiction play with gorgeous naked art, even with the limits from B-movie earth, not disappointing.
