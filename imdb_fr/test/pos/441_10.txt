"French Cancan" is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's an excellent movie. There is color, there is humor, there is music. It is a very good portrait of the Belle Epoque, although Jean Renoir's priorities have always been to show a creation, a fantasy. So, the film is not a historical film. The final sequences in which the girls dance cancan are unforgettable images. It's a film not to be missed.
