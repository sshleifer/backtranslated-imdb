Excellent introspective / interpersonal article that really had courage without feeling desperate or worse, manipulative and artificially rewarding. This could be a good double trait with American Beauty as well. The best performance so far I've seen from Anita Mui, and every actor in this movie seems to be a powerhouse. Hat to Ann Hui for direction and Ivy Ho for Shiny Scenario. Seriously, one of the best dramas I've seen in a long time, especially if you have a taste of the classic literature of ALA poetry. Once again, excellent.
