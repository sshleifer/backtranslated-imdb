This 60-minute film shows how filming can be fun. Everything is fun because it is a real comical assault on the Star Trek genre. In "Hick Trek - The Moovie", a group of good boys are on a mission to prevent a group of renegade cats from destroying the entire Redneck Federation. <br /> <br /> Can Captain Jerk stop the ugly Fluffy with the power of Bovine Feed and it's Cow Ray ?? She can have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! This cult classic (previously only seen in scifi conventions) is one of the favorites of the party. Many funny moments!
