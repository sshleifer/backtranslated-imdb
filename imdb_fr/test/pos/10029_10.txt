I first saw "They died with their boots", around 1970 and although it has been many years since, this film and its impression remain. The cast was good to excellent and the main role was really heroic. When I first saw this film I knew that the wisest and only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a source of lively entertainment, then a little more lively. It seemed to me that the Silver Screen does not, as such, really represent the life of George Armstrong Custer, but the director Raoul Walsh had to contribute to the real value represented in this film when I watched a half-documentary with other great directors like Vincent Mennelli, in which these central personalities talked about their achievements. with valuable comments giving a glimpse of the Hollywood spirit. That's what I thought was interesting and that became terribly interesting and very enjoyable. Even oblasts with the big screen and its sense of narration that says some of the enjoyment has been lost and you will see -being that this is also true here.Custer ranked in the 34th ... 34. Custer was much made from Custer's final class rankings, but out of the 68 cadets who entered the Military Academy with him in 1857, half of them had already ousted or resigned on the day of graduation on June 24, 1861.It is suggested in the film that the various instructors determine if a soldier is fit for command and then they fall on the name of George Armstrong Custer and there must be a definite exchange between the two camps. It is here that the sergeant on duty says almost in a whisper even to suggest that if it happened by accident "his squadron would follow him to the devil", your wise attentive, reprimands Tape.If I am not mistaken, when Flynn present on an initial battlefield, he acknowledges that Custer does not see the action right now and that he actually works as a reliable attache for not only Sheridan, but also the Hancocks forces who only end up for a time in the Potomac Army of General George McClellan. The audacity attributed to the heroes of the Custers battlefield is true, as was illustrated in a counterattack, "the young Custer pushed his horse to his head and plunged boldly among the stunned Confederates. as a rebel-stricken union soldier, Custers' audacity shone, he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers, including a rebel captain, and he personally captured the first Confederate battle flag taken by the Potomac Army. This remarkable act of courage marked him as an officer with a great promise on the battlefield. "Robert L.Bateman-General Chair. There is a problem here and this is the story of the story and the truth about George Armstrong Custer, the story is a good entertainment in Hollywood maybe even a great entertainment, but for some reason, everything that could be said was a change For reasons of entertainment, I think it might be good to know that Tom Custer was going to lose his life at "Little Big Horn", located only a few meters from where George Custer was going to die too. Tom Custer still holds an honorable distinction today among a very small group that may have received only three other medals of honor during his military career. The list of engagements that the film shows indicates that Custers was indeed a young active officer. He was not part of the Union forces, neither Chancellorsville nor Fredericksburg, but he accompanied them to the battle of Antietam. At that time, he was promoted captain by General McClellan, but that did not last. McClellan was soon to be replaced because of the historical fact that the Potomac Army could afford it, and the information (finding surrounding cigars was General Lee's intention to divide his forces) It could be assumed that the war could be over at that time, but it happened, but when McClellan did not act, President Lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost. Custers' biggest win may come in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. His forces which occupied an area called the cemetery crest on the Gettysburg field in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a Jeb Stuart-led cavalry of some 6,000 rebels with a force of 2,300. I think the exploits in Gettysburg of Custer deserve to be discussed. It says in the film that the appointment of Custers was a blunder, well, you'd better guess again because Custer had men in his corner but he had launched a petition present to the governor of the state of Michigan that By the way, was relatively new in the cause of the Union and was preparing to form cavalry regiments. However, Custer was severely reprimanded for this kind of shenanigan when he appeared in all that Gold Braid did. was not The truth was told. Custers 'defense in Gettysburg prevented Jeb Stuart from having lunch in the Unions' shops and was vitally protected from this flank. This passing action occurred and coincided with Picketts Charge to maximize the chances of success. It was a decisive victory and Custer was at his best and most courageous. His men followed him to hell and lived to talk about it.
