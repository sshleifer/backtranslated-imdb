It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, and one of his most underrated. I think it certainly goes beyond a "Psycho" or "The Birds" for his talent and technical art. It's a macabre, tense and humorous product that will leave you speechless for a long time. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as hate Most of Hitchcock's mummies?) Bruno. It is a disturbing and astonishing performance that illuminates the entire film. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at these deliberately effeminate links and hear how he is described as "European"), strangely charming and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger certainly knows, he is entangled in the sordid web of Bruno after they meet on a train. Bruno, knowing some basic information about Guy's business, proposes the two "swap" murders in everyone's interest. Walker will kill Granger's conniving and grumpy wife who is preventing her marriage to the beautiful Anne, while Granger will murder Bruno's father, whom he hates so intensely. Everyone is happy, right? A win-win, as Bruno says? False. Granger forgets the indecent proposal, but not the obsessed Walker. He commits his murder and is determined to hunt down Granger until he completes his side of the market too. 'Strangers' becomes a captivating and moving game of cat and mouse in the expert hands of Hitch. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock was absolutely incredible in creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes. We have the whore Miriam, the woman separated from Granger, pregnant with another man. She sucks lasciviously a phallic ice cream by openly eating Bruno's eyes. Barbara Morton, Anne's sister, is a mischievous, clever but cunning girl with the rawest comments you'll hear from a 1950s girl in glasses. Senator Morton is the authoritative and is absorbed by himself. It's one of the most daring films ever made by Hitchcock, and it's typical of a Hitch movie, it's subtly sexual. <br /> <br /> This falls into the category of black films focusing on murder, lying and deception and dark cinematography. The pest of Walker belongs to all ages and Granger is a protagonist hard to convince. Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two and I never believed his relationship with Granger. Nevertheless, the very many positive points erase the slight negative points and we can say without fear that it is one of the BEST American films ever made. <br /> <br /> Just look at what Hitch is doing here: his originality, his technical skills. We see Miriam's murder reflected in her broken glasses. A tennis game turns into one of the most exciting and intense scenes you can see. An innocent fairground is transformed into a place of murder and serious occurrences. Walker blows up a young boy's ball with irreproachable toughness (Hitch obviously likes what he saw in "The Third Man!"). The children's pleasure in riding on the carousel turns into a screaming and rhythmic terror. Hitch subverts normal daily events like no other. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is among the best ever seen in a Hitchcock film, and the premise is to die. It's smooth, oozes sophistication and diabolical charm. The cross between the characters of Walker and Granger is beautiful. The Granger Tennis or Death Match is just as vital as the wicked Walker's rescue of incriminating evidence lost by force. Hitch again makes his villain a villain, repulsive, friendly and strangely charming (another finds him strangely attractive, more than Granger?), We are as tense as Walker in the hope that he can get the lighter coming out of the drain. We need him, anyway. He holds the key to the story. <br /> <br /> You will never see the same approach of a stranger after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Incredible. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
