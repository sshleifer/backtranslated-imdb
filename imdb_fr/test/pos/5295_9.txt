It has been widely accepted that Hayao Miyazaki is an expert in his artistic field when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful narrative lines and equally imaginative characters. His films, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL'S MOVING castle are all not only beautifully rendered in terms of art, but also in terms of filmmaking. Can not this man be wrong? Not really, but it's impossible to expect all his films to be five-star wonders. His latest film, PONYO, is unquestionably the story of a "goldfish out of the water", as luxurious as possible, and animated with interesting characters, as you would expect ... and yet, it is is his first film "lesser" territory. Do not get me wrong, PONYO is by no means a bad movie. As mentioned, it's a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story does not stay afloat to satisfy anyone who wants to live another captivating and detailed plot. <br /> <br /> For its opening time, PONYO is the story of Miyazaki at its best, in which a too expensive young goldfish (who will later be called Ponyo) makes a forbidden trip in the human world where it is then adopted by a boy of his age named Sosuke (modeled, in an interesting way, according to the director's own son). That does not please the father of Ponyo, a mysterious wizard by the name of Fujimoto, who is very angry with humans for their destruction of the sea (this environmentalist theme is not very different from other Miyazaki films) ... a problem that he really intends to correct. by creating jellyfish from the bow of his submarine. He separates the couple and tries to convince Ponyo to stay underwater with him. However, the goldfish has already tasted Sosuke's blood (scarring a finger cut) AND some of the human food (ham, which she becomes inexplicably addicted to), and of course steals her father's forbidden potions, turning into a girl hyperactivity (which is the spitting image of Mei from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami that threatens to engulf the whole world with water. Conspiring with his wife, Gran Mamare, a diaphanous sea goddess who alternately switches from a giant titan to a human size, Fujimoto decides to test the love of two young children. To do this, they raise the sea at the house of Sosuke, which encourages the youngest to settle in their world infested with ocean in a huge toy boat (made possible by the magical powers of Ponyo). <br /> <That's when PONYO starts to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute, they slow down the film. Unfortunately, the film takes water at its peak, it is at the moment when Sosuke has to prove his love for Ponyo, presented in a strangely anticlimactic and hasty way, thus putting an end to a charming story which stopped abruptly . This will probably surprise viewers who are expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered much more interesting finals for many of his other films. Do you remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsuki's search for little Mei? The rescue of Tombo by Kiki? Porco Rosso's fight with Curtis? The rescue of the head of the spirit of the forest? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All these resolutions were much more satisfactory and seemed more complete than this one. <br /> <br /> On a technical level, PONYO can not be blamed. The animation is absolutely beautiful to watch, entirely produced without a single imaginary computer generated image, and of course Joe Hisaishi provides us with another breathtaking musical score; the best moments are the catchy sequences underwater, accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice. And the sets are painted and detailed with the same care as all other Ghibli films. <br /> <br /> After having proven their ability to translate and double previous Ghibli movies in English with high quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar again provide a double with a cast of mostly capable actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good like Sosuke, sounds very natural and believable. Noah Cyrus as a Ponyo, for his part, sometimes goes too far shouting his lines before finally calm down towards the end. Apart from this, the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson in the role of Fujimoto (who manages himself unsurprisingly in the character), overprotective, and Cate Blanchett in the role of Gran Mamare (in an ubiquitous tone that is not very different from his Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS). , Matt Damon, Koichi (Sosuke's father, sea enthusiast), and Tina Fey, Lisa. Among them, Fey is the best voice in the cast, giving the character the right amount of wit and personality. His scenes with Sosuke show a real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was spectacular as a Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, is sadly lost as one of three older disabled women (she barely has ALL the lines!), Which are also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Among them, only the character of Tomlin, a senseless woman named Toki, shows all his personality, but if I realized the film, I replace Tomlin by Leachman. Probably the only really shocking disadvantage of dub is an awesome techno remix of the catchy (but ridiculously repetitive) title song of the movie, which fortunately does not happen before the closing credits. <br /> <br /> As a whole, PONYO is a good movie. a beautiful animated work that will be perfect for young people and the family audience. Due to the loss of speed towards the end, however, it is far from the classic status. Given that Miyazaki is even better than most other animated films, I will be generous and give PONYO a full-fledged recommendation, as each element of his film still deserves to be watched, especially on the big screen. (Make sure you catch it in the theaters while you can.)
