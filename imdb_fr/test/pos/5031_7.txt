Although this film does not stand out particularly from the audience, it is still a very good movie to watch and look up! There may be one or two mistakes you notice, and the cinematic is a little neglected, the film itself is very nice and gives off a wonderful atmosphere. The music contributes a lot to the atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting game is no less impressive (especially the dog he has!), John Travolta taking the lead of Michael. Other characters feel really sincere and play very well in the film. <br /> <br /> After a long day of work, stick "Michael" in the evening with ice cream and enjoy a movie of very high quality own right :)
