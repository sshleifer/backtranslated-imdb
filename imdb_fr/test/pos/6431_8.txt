It must be so difficult to tell a story where not much happens while keeping the viewer's attention. I think this short film achieves it with effortless quality. Rutger has an amazing voice, soothing, wise and paternal (I'm not gay). This is reminiscent of Robert Redford's narration skills. The end is very sad but beautiful. One wonders how much time is left to Harry. Will he be alone and can he say goodbye? In addition, Mr. Hauer is upset at not having participated in other work of this caliber. Hope he continues to do a good job in Holland and he stays away from Hollywood. <br /> <br />
