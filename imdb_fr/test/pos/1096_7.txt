I loved the wooden film camera. I think it's a bit influenced by the Brazilian movie "City of God", but maybe this parallelism between the two possible tracks to follow (crime and art) in the social neighborhood is a reality. <br /> <br /> I think the films made by Madiba are really beautiful. I do not think it's unreal to shoot such good movies, because many artists have no education and can be really great. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the soundtrack. It is suitable for images. <br /> <br /> See the movie ... it's good to show how a life in a social neighborhood can exist.
