See Gary Busey in a G rated movie was a first and a beautiful. I do not know much about the director, but he obviously knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of it. Where does Jillian Clare come from? My children love it! The only thing I can remember is Christopher Atkins, it's Blue Lagoon. Disney needs to see this movie and put it to work. The woman thinks he is very cute. I liked what he did with his character. He seemed so real. What we liked most is the message that this film sends. Greed sucks and faith, love and family wins! This is the first low-budget DVD we have purchased that contains so much. The producers did this one for the kids and the kids loved it. They liked the music and all the extras of the DVD. The director will probably not be content with family films, but I hope so. Because he really knows how to make the most of kids, animals and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was great and seeing Gary Busey behave like a dog was even more funny. There was not much we did not like about this one. It was hard to find a family film without rude humor and Quigley was a delightful surprise.
