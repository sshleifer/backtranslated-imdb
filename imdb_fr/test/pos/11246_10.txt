The fact that critics feel extremely negative about the show is quite interesting. If you do not like it, do not look at it. <br /> <br /> Some critics say you must be silly, silly, or old-fashioned to be able to enjoy this show. On the contrary, my friends. I do not pretend that all candidates are smart. There are some clever and stupid ones. But I would say that they probably have a higher average IQ than the average reviewer on this site. That's right, I said it. There is much to be said about the science of seduction of girls. Sorry, but remove all the sticks from your asses and realize that you hate these guys because they threaten you. <br /> <br /> Those who forget the social sciences and, more specifically, the science behind the couplings will clearly miss the boat completely. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: clubs are not the only places to meet girls. Personally, I think that women who are worthy do not even go to clubs, not to fall prey to men like the ones we see in the series. But what are men like these ???? Apart from those whose games stinks, they are the quintessence of men. They are men who meet women in the most difficult situations. They are men who appropriate their own sexuality. These men do not beg their girlfriends not to break up with them, and these men do not say "OK" to the phrase "Let's just be friends". <br /> <br /> That sounds familiar to you ???? In fact, these are the guys you're scared of when you bring your special long-term girlfriend to the club. We are all. These guys know what women like. (again, only those who have the "game") <br /> <br /> And even those who are bad ... it's worth laughing! <br /> <br /> If you went to a club and really interacted with those around you, this show should entertain you. <br /> <br /> Listen, I do not understand why there is so much hate for this show. My best guess is that it aggravates the insecurity of men who have had bad experiences in clubs or who threaten men who believe that women are beautiful creatures without self who just want a good guy to buy their attention. <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this show. It's pure entertainment, and the best of all is REAL. It is a very perceptive view of the state of most recent sexual psychology. The roles of sex have never been so different before, and this show gives a very concrete idea. <br /> <br /> I think it takes a lot of intelligence to get something positive out of this show. <br /> <br /> This show attracts a certain target market. If you are outside of this, you should not be listening to the show. The same could be said of all the other shows. <br /> <br /> Growing up, <br /> <br /> ApolloHelios
