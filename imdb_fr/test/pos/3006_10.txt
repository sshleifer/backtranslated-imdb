I loved this show. I was waiting for him to come out on DVD ... it never was. Does anyone know how to get the show available on DVD? I contacted Lifetime TV and a few others and nothing. Please let me know if there is a way that we can have this series on DVD. I would be the first to buy it. I really became addicted to this show. I do not understand how many other TV shows are available on DVD but not in any day. I'm sure many of us would like to have this series on DVD or even on VHS. I thought about contacting the production company. Has anyone else tried to contact someone to get this information?
