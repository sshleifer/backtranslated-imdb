I have never read Sarah Water's book. Although I have not read the book, the 3 hour movie is very interesting. It starts with an interesting scenario with a twisted end. I must say that these 2 actresses are incredible. Sally Hawkins is beautiful, successfully portrays the lover's love character and betrayed by his love. Their story blossoms slowly as they spend more and more time together. The scene of love is very tender and emotional, well played. The end is quite intriguing and these 2 ended together after all they went through, which is a blessing. Overall, it's a great movie to watch, a very interesting plot with great performances.
