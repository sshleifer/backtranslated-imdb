A sage from India once said, "They will make fun of us first, and then they will hate us, and they will fear us." Be aware that yes, the budget of this film was a little reduced, but even with his story continues to interest us several years later, regardless of its appearance. But know that soon, "Masten Thrust" will appear again on the big screen. Then, with the new redesigned T-Rex, you'll be more than shocked. This will scare many for centuries to come !! This movie is in pre-production and will look nothing like what you've seen before! <br /> <br /> It will be beyond the THX format ..... directly in 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Be afraid, be VERY scared!"
