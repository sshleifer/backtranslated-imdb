I read the comments on this film before watching it and I did not expect much, but as a movie B, it's a curiosity. I guess you have to be some type of person to appreciate this kind of thing, but I seriously thought it was great. People should just watch it for the experience because it's totally unique. Do not expect much. The acting is mediocre, the transitions have obviously been done on a PC, etc. It's definitely a movie B, but it's worth checking out. Very funny. Sweet gore, and some questionable themes, so probably not something to show your Gran, but for the more adventurous viewer, I'd say it's a must.
