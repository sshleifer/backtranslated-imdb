From the director of Oldboy comes this smooth vampire movie. Kang-ho Song plays the role of a priest accidentally transformed into a vampire and cured of a deadly and mysterious virus. His vampirism and priesthood are quite in conflict, but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who might not care about the siphoned blood. Because of his supposedly miraculous survival, he enters the life of Ha-Kyun Shin's family. Shin has cancer and his mother believes Song can cure him. Unfortunately, Song's vampirism raises his lusts to a height where he can not help but fall in love with Shin's young wife OK-vin Kim. Kim is very interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lovers. The movie from there goes in strange directions that I think we should experiment by themselves. What you really need to mention is the mastery of the cinema medium by Chan-wook Park. My God, I have rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the height of his powers. The major flaw of the film is that it is a bit incoherent, especially at the beginning. Park is interested in telling his stories mainly in the visuals, which can sometimes be difficult to follow. But when it works, man, it flies. The film is also perversely hilarious. The final sequence, easily one of the best of the decade, is both heartbreaking and deliciously ridiculous. OK-wine Kim should become a global star after this movie. It gives one of the best performances of the year.
