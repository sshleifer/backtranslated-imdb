Sports are taken seriously in small high school cities in America (and elsewhere, I guess) and I have a picture of those competitive students opening their hearts to a less fortunate man, at least for me. <br /> <br /> The coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and the radio, but came softly to the decision himself under the loving and open ways of Radio. Very well done to all. 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Debra Winger, we need more of you in pictures!
