Personally, I loved the movie TRIS! My best friend told me about it so I rented it and watched it. It's incredible! The music, the acting, the story highlight the emotion, everything ...... except a minor fact. Absolutely no loyalty to books at all. I saw this movie before Interview with the Vampire and even before I knew the books existed, so I was shocked to see how many people actually hated the movie. I quickly realized that the fans of the book were not at all satisfied with the infidelity, not wanting to be hypocritical (I hate the Harry Potter films because of the lack of fidelity to the book), I remained silent. Finally, I picked up "The Vampire Lestat" and immediately understood why everyone hated him. It's completely different (The film Queen of the Damned is a combination of "The Vampire Lestat" and "The Queen of the Damned"). But I always liked the movie when I saw it before reading one of the books. So, if you have not seen this movie or read the book, watch the movie first or you hate it. If you have read the book, you have every right to hate this movie.
