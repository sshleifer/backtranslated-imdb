When I was in grade 7 (in 1977), I was asked to read the novel on which he was based as part of my English class studies. I remember being very touched and excited by the release of a televised version a year later. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol was a popular television actress when this movie was produced and was already playing a girl in a dysfunctional family. in the hit TV series "Family". It was clear that she had the reach and the ability to remove that part. I remember she was sometimes a bit "stiff", but she does a good job overall. She wears the film well. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle is fantastic as a servant who seems to be the only one in the family to seem to really like her. Barbara Barrie as a slightly frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good, as is the young Robin Lively (who would eventually become the black widow Lana Milford in "Twin Peaks") as a sweet little sister who seems to be the center of interest of parents affection. Bruce Davidson is also attractive as a German title soldier. <br /> <br /> The best performance, however, belongs to Michael Constantine. He is really powerful and deserves more recognition than he had at the time. The bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult, but makes it much easier to understand the silent despair of the rejected girl. Constantine gives everyone the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations. <br /> <br /> The film differs from the book only by a few things. It's wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope it will be released again on video or on DVD. <br /> <br />
