I was trying to understand why I enjoyed this movie ?? It's not because of the money spent on it for sure !! Did I see a water gun painted inside? Maybe they do not have the same kind of visual effects houses in Scotland? Or maybe they just did not have money? The making of clearly shows a group of very brave guys who make a film against all odds. Impressive! But what really pleased me was the courage of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead roles as 2 normal guys. No Hollywood histrion here. <br /> <br /> OK, the effects are not very effective. Spaceships are just not as beautiful as they should be in today's FX world and I've seen much better free content on youtube. But the film holds up very well once they arrive on the planet. Was it shot in Scotland or just by a Scottish team? Or is it just better effects? Did they publish the water? In the end, I liked this movie a bit and was disappointed when they were all dead.
