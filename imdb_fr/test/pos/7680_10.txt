When I was a child, my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I admired Dorothy Dandridge so much and wanted to be like her. I fell in love with Sidney Poitier. Pearl Bailey made me laugh. And Sammy Davis Jr. was so great as Sportin Life. The music was breathtaking. When I had my first son and the film came on television, I let him see it and, to this day, he has never forgotten this film. He loved her. I will always remember Porgy and Bess. It occupies a special place in my heart at the time and at the present time. I really want them to restore this movie because it is one of the greatest movies ever made with a "Black Cast" actor.
