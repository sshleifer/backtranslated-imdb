The royal rumor of this year was not really bad, but last year was definitely better. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH- SHAWN MICHAELS VS. EDGE Even though this match took a little too much time, everything was fine. Edge wins after using the ropes to pin Shawn Michaels. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATCH - UNDERTAKER VS. HEIDENREICH IN A GAME MATCH Now, I do not really like Casket matches. This match was boring and sloppy, but in the end he took his pace when Undertaker nailed the gravestone before rolling Heidenreich into the box for the win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH - JBL VS. KURT ANGLE VS. GREAT SHOW IN TRIPLE THREAT FOR WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP It's not a bad match in triple threat. Too bad that JBL wins again to retain his title after winning a Clothesline From Hell on Angle victory. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH MATCH - RANDY ORTON VS. TRIPLE H FOR THE WORLD TENNES CHAMPIONSHIP A great match between the two men, the match was a little sloppy, but he was still good and he started well towards the end. Even though Orton lost, the match was fast and awesome towards the end. HHH nails the pedigree on Orton to retain his world title. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH GAME - ROYAL RUMBLE It was a cool Royal Rumble {Every Royal Rumble is good}. After the 30 men entered, the last four remaining superstars of the Rumble were Cena, Edge, Mysterio and Batista. Edge managed to hunt Mysterio, later Batista & Cena pointed Edge together. Cena and Batista were now responsible. After overthrowing an F-U, Batista opted for the Batista bomb, but the two men suddenly collapsed outside at the same time. After a controversial decision and Mr. McMahon going to the ring to settle the matter. Batista & Cena resumed the match, but Batista got the better of Cena, took the battle and sent Cena to win the 2005 Royal Rumble and go to Wrestlemania 21 to face the champion in the main event. It was a very good Royal Rumble, but last year we would still have the best of all the Royal Rumbles in history. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'll give him 8/10 and B +
