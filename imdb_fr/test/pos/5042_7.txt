The title of the film seems quite appropriate given the personality of the main character, Fanda. He is an older man who lives in the late autumn of his life. Yet he has become a jubilant schoolboy who has just entered a meadow in the spring. The weaknesses of old age and the warning signs of death are only illusions. His wife supports this idea when she observes, "Fanda laughs at funerals and death." In other words, death is not something that Fanda takes too seriously. he has more important things to do than worry about what is already inevitable. Life, however, and the pursuit of life fully, is the philosophy that governs the existence of Fanda. He is not the type to simply exist, but must live every day and every moment that passes, because tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The film seems to make a strong comment about life as if there is no tomorrow, let alone death. Too many people take life far too seriously and therefore do not take advantage of real life. Fanda's wife for example; she is so worried about getting ready for death, not in a religiously connotative way, but in a way that is too practical, even lifeless, for her to forget how to smile, laugh and have a good time. His humanity seems to have turned into a zombie autopilot mode. Fanda, on the contrary, is perhaps too cheerful and distracted for his good. He needs a person like his wife, Emilie, to balance him. <br /> <br /> It's as if Fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child, like a child trapped in the body of an older man. He is presented as the adventurous type; he pretends to be people he is not about to win, he's wasting money, mentally lying and always ready to laugh. In his heart, however, he is an old man with a kind and kind heart who wishes to submit to his too pragmatic wife. The two are pretty well compensated, though none of them really appreciate the binary quality of their relationship until they have a metaphorical chance after death: the meaning, their divorce. It is during this scene that Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love. His wife fondly remembers all his faults, but is fondly attracted to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. At this moment she forgives him, Fanda realizes his selfish behavior against his wife and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. <br /> <br /> Ironically, after making that commitment, he becomes what his wife later calls "a living corpse". The blood of his life dissipates as he looks more like a zombie running through everyday movements. He does not seem to live anymore, but exists. For example, he gives up his wacky jokes, does not waste money, quits smoking because of his wife (not his health) and, overall, agrees to anything she wants from him. In short, he changes because he wants to make her happy. Thus, the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly disappear. Realizing that her husband is no longer what he was, there is a part of Emilie missing from old Fanda. The loneliness of her husband and the fights he was used to miss, because it was in those moments that they really lived, and not only existed. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers were trying to convey a specific message here; that true love relationships will not always be easy or convenient, but often it will take sacrifices and stamina to get through seemingly difficult times. The possibility of death at any time is what reminds people to live at every moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when it is threatened with death, whether literal or figurative, people come out of their ungrateful sleep and are excited to start living fully. It's like they're scared to never live again, so it's best to make the most of it while they have it. Fanda and Emilie had been married for 44 years with fights along the way, but only when both were threatened with the possibility of a death-like separation did they begin to show their true colors. As the old saying goes: "Love does not know its own depth before the time of separation". They both begin to see what matters most in life and the people they meet along the way. More importantly, the intimate relationships they establish with their loved ones.
