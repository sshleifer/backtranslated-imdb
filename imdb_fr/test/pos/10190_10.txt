When I was a child, this program lasted a short while. I remember seeing him while eating fish and chips. <br /> <br /> On the back of Tron's hype, this series looked a lot like a streethawk. manimal and the like, except for more calculation. There was a geek kid who is somehow the automan created computer. He was walking around solving crimes and the lot. <br /> <br /> All I really remember was her luxury car and the little sparkling cursor object that was used to draw and help her in general. <br /> When I talk to anyone, they can not remember it too much. Was it real or maybe a dream?
