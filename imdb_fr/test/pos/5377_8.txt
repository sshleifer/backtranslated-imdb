I would probably say it was on a par with films like "Devil's Rain" and that kind of movie, although it's probably a little better done. I love the horror of the 70s and most of the elements that make up the other films I love are very easy to appreciate. A family on vacation falls in a small town where people seem to be in the grip of some kind of hysteria. It looks like the kids are gone. After a first attempt to escape from this place, the family is stopped on the outskirts of the city and finds the way back, but not before finding a house where the children are gone and where mom and dad are dead. Looks like we have a different kind of twist on a seniors community center in this city, they're all Satan worshipers and they need kids to renew their lives so they can continue to serve, I suppose. Not that anyone seems too inclined to give up their kids for this business. It's pretty classy since it's scary and scary without a hint of gore or the loud and startling events that are trying to blow up people in the movies today, which seem to have replaced real fears. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) of "Green Acres" as Tobey, a sheriff's deputy who reads UFO magazines, and LQ Jones as sheriff and a very familiar character actor as father of the family. And Strother Martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing a double duty without the knowledge of his fellow citizens. It's pretty good, but sometimes a bit confusing, but overall, it works pretty well and is recommended to fans of the horror of the 70's. 8 out of 10.
