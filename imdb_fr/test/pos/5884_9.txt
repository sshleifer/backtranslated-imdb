So many great talents have been used in "The best years of our lives", the result must be somewhat miraculous. Think of what his manager, William Wyler, had to face. as a result of a military victory over state powers that had committed heinous crimes and engulfed the world in battle, he was shooting a film in which he claimed that American leaders were themselves deeply anti-individual-they had "spoiled the best years of life for those who were enlisted or misled in the war - who, having ignored the rights of individuals, was of no avail except for discussions about degree of slavery to which men must belong. "There are magnificent Julia Heron's sets, Gregg Toland's cinematography and a script by Robert E. Sherwood, author of" The Road to Rome ", as well as other means of defense of individuals against tyrannical ideas. This ironic title has been used to attract talented actors such as Frederic March, Myrna Loy, Teresa Wright, Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell and Hoagy Carmichael in a large-scale but thematic drama. The clever plot was the experience of three "couples" after the soldiers (three of whom were brought to light) tried to return home in a "culture of victory". Their bitter experiences and the awareness of their need to fight again against what was happening on the home front represents a strong and disappointing counterpoint to the conventional notion that "everything was going well for America". and his wife have a hard time adjusting and drinking, O'Donnell's young man, Harold Russell, has hooks instead of hands and wonders if life is worth living, and the worst of all is that Andrew's wife drops him for a guy who has dough and has lost years, forcing employers to ignore or deny his rights to a job. even having what he had before being torn out of his life and thrown into the arena of risk - for nothing, and the loss of everything he had ever had.The highlight of the film comes when all three must face the n we have to fight again, everyone for his own good and all three manage to find the courage to continue fighting - each for his own happiness, which is now threatened by a curiously anti-self, anti-reality and indifferent United States. The direction of Wyler, especially from the scene where Andrews is sitting in the cockpit of an extinct B-17, alone and Russell's wedding scene is truly magnificent. It is a most powerful and excellent film on its own terms, men and women can get along for once. The music of Hugo Friedhofer and the costumes of Irene Sharaff add to its luster. One of the best and most unexpected of all time, in N / B.
