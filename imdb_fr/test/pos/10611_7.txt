I saw Marigold during a preview a few days ago and found it to be an exciting and enjoyable movie. The film is about an American actress who does not have so much success and who goes to India to play in a low-budget film, but finds herself stuck when she sees on her arrival that the financing of the film has disappeared, as well as producers and investors. A chance encounter with an Indian film shot nearby led her to be hired for a small role as a dancer. Since Indian films include a large amount of songs and dances, this is a problem for Marigold, who has two left feet, not to mention a personality so coiled and thorny that she can barely hear the music, without even feeling it, as the choreographer of the film Prem suggests. <br /> <br /> But "prem" - the word, not the person - means "love", and Prem - the person, not the Word - seems to embody this emotion in the way he treats all around him, whether it's his assistant production friends who introduced Marigold to the shoot, the narcissistic and arrogant roles of the film, or the boring and tense woman. Soon, under his expert tutelage and endearing treatment, Marigold finds his feet - literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> I have to say a word for those who are not familiar with the use of singing and dancing in Indian films. Unlike American musicals, the story progresses through these dance numbers as the intrigue unfolds and character transformations occur alongside the dance. It should also be noted that Indian dance is more than just a movement. An essential part of it is the staging of the feelings and emotions of the dancer while telling the story of the dance. This is the main goal of the dance and the dancer. <br /> <br /> That Marigold reaches this stage of realization is an impressive number of dancers midway through, when Marigold performs the dance she is required to do. for the film in the film, also expresses his love for Prem. This is an incredible performance by Ali Larter, especially when you consider that she is not used to dancing in her films or transmitting the feelings of her character through dance. This shows her acting talent and the hard work she put into that role. <br /> <br /> Of course, no romantic film can work without a credible Prince Charming. Salman Khan, who plays the role of Prem, corresponds to the role of T. Even if he turns out to be a less charming prince, he does not lose the sympathy of the public. Salman has been directing Hindi cinema (sometimes called Bollywood) for many years now, and it should be remembered that his first lead role was also that of Prem. He is completely charming, sweet, adorable, sexy and vulnerable. For those who have never met on screen before, get ready to receive very high doses of magnetism! Ali Larter and he are a great couple. They act as well in their game as in their appearance. <br /> <br /> Will they be able to solve their problems? It does not seem possible when we hear the last song of the film, a charming mix of facts and fantasies, reality and metaphor. The end certainly took some of the audience with which I saw it, but they remained satisfied. The songs are used very intelligently. They are in Hindi, without subtitling, for film sequences in the film and in English for other occasions. But their meaning is always clear from context and choreography. <br /> <br /> Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy - yes, there is also a lot of humor. The Indian places and costumes give it a fairy tale quality, making it a story that can be compared to a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are or have been curious about Indian cinema, but have hesitated to try it, this is an excellent introduction. It captures the color and dynamism of Indian films, not only in costumes and jewelry (which are quite impressive), but also in catchy dances and world music. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ali Larter, you should watch him for his excellent acting in the portrait of a selfish, demanding, "demanding" woman, who nonetheless possesses an inner attraction which inspires the love of two men. If you are a girl, you will enjoy admiring Ali's beautiful costumes and watching as a prominent man. If you're a guy, you can not only admire Ali in his sexy costumes, but also learn from Salman Khan what it takes to bring out the loving heart of someone as nervous as Marigold.
