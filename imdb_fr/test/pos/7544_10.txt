Alistair Simms is a marvel in this regard. He is such a good director. The role given here to George Cole was designed for him. Therefore, the casting work on this film was perfect. I think it was one of the few occasions when everything clicked. the script was good, the comic dialogues a scream and the older prefects a delight !! Every character you are attached to, even the bad guys. Why can not we make such films anymore? Basically, it's a very English comedy with a lot of movement and fluidity.
