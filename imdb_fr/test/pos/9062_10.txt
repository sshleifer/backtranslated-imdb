Bizarre, vulnerable, raw, honest and a treat to watch. I am not here to give a summary or a synopsis of the film. I just want to congratulate this little film with GREAT BIG HEART. I take my hat off to the filmmaker and it's a great cast. If you want to know what's going on in the movie, go see it. Michael Parness, scriptwriter / director, has treated a very sensitive and emotional subject, Suicide, with a lot of compassion, comedy and empathy. I see a good career for Mr. Parness. This film works. From the scandalous opening sequence to the tender, honest moments between David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. As with all movies, we must suspend some disbelief. However, with MAX AND GRACE, I was easily transported and completely convinced by his "surreal moments". I just wish they pushed some of those moments even further. Mr. Parness has "pulled" some wonderful performances from this already talented casting. For example, Guillermo DÃ­az's performances as a patient at the asylum were both hysterical and moving. Colossus Ralf Moeller, former Mr. Olympiade, as a terrified patient ... perfect. I can go on and on and on ... This independent feature has the power of a big-budget Hollywood movie, but you forget the onscreen STARS over this wonderfully written story. The real star here is the brilliant scenario. I'm looking forward to seeing more screenwriter / director Michael Parness.
