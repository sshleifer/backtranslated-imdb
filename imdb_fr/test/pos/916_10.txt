"Red" is part of a trilogy, but is very autonomous. This is not a sequel of any kind. The very end, which I will not divulge, links the three films, but not seeing the other two does not make it too confusing. <br /> <br /> This film surprises me with its simplicity, subtlety and simplicity, but it is as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big budget show or any melodrama. Kieslowski studies here the phenomena of chance and destiny. The two themes are inseparable in the story. The movie is really a puzzle, but the message is pretty simple: it's all happening for a reason. Love is in all our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it. The title "Red" refers to the French flag, where red represents "fraternity" or fraternity. The color dominates the visuals of the film. I tend to think that this represents the love, the passion or the blood of life. It's great when a movie allows the freedom to do it;)
