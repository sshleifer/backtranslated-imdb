The Emperor and the Assassin (with English subtitles): 161 minutes is a long time, but the weather is loaded with a story that does not fit. Golden-hued palace scenes and yellow and dusty landscapes of Chinese landscapes illustrate the true story of the unifying king of China, circa 300 BC. A complex plot with a myriad of twists is played with excellent representations by the cast. The simple desire of King Qin to create a unified empire for his people is fulfilled, but not without treachery, intrigue, counter-intrigue and, yes, without corpses. Many bodies. This epic story about the beginnings of China is a great way for Westerners to glimpse a little-known Asian history. Emperor Qin's legacy includes thousands of life-size terracotta figurines that are still being excavated today. As a historical figure, this film clearly shows that Emperor Qin should be considered with George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar, to name only some of the greatest conquerors / men of State of the world. I highly recommend seeing The Emperor and the Assassin, especially on the big screen.
