This is not the nasty video Night of the Demon because there are many. In fact, there is only one, but it multiplies. <br /> <br /> After living in Suzanne (screaming queen Linnea Quigley), she passes it on to the Gothic Angela (Amelia Kinkade) with a long kiss. <Br/> <br /> Then we see Linnea show us her clothes in the bathroom. She's showing a lot more than Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks he's going to have fun. <br /> <br /> Soon, everything is literally going to hell, bodies falling one by one and being possessed. Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two to want to escape. Max does not help much, leaving Judy to find a way out. <br /> <br /> The makeup was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that kept it from getting better was the very long action. <br /> <br /> The old man (Harold Ayer) who appears at the beginning will be back and get his right desserts. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley may be the Queen Scream, but Cathy Podewell definitely showed the biggest lungs of this movie.
