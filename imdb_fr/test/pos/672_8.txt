A formidable B-feature. A virtual bimanuel on a day (you can see its origins on stage and even its radio operation), and although its duration is only 77 minutes, it has been presented in the form of time sequences. Robert Ryan is the psychopath who keeps Ida Lupino locked up at home. Both are superb, especially the underrated Lupino whose initial independence and self-control soon collapse in front of Ryan's unbalanced intruder. Today, of course, it would be cruel but the restraint shown by director Harry Horner (better known as artistic director) only adds to the suspense that is sometimes worthy of Hitchcock.
