Jamie Foxx poses as famous blues / soul / country singer Ray Charles. To the merit of the film, it shows both the good and the bad about Charles's character and the choices he has made, both personally and professionally. <br /> <br /> It's a smooth film that gives you a rich sense of the times in which the story unfolds. Not only does it look good, it sounds good. I only wish there is more music here. When it is inserted, it's fabulous but there is not enough. <br /> <br /> Assuming, at least for review purposes, that the story is true, I was impressed and disappointed by Charles, which means that history has left memorable impressions as I I wrote this 16 months after watching it. The main impressions are: <br /> <br /> GOOD - Renew Ray's immense talent and his foresight to go out and take musical risks, such as going "to the country" for a while. The man had supreme confidence in himself but did not seem arrogant about it. It was also memorable to show him fighting her heroin addiction - without help! It's incredible. <br /> <br /> BAD - Through this movie, I also remember the ease with which Ray was hooked and disappointed at being so unfaithful to his wife. One really sad comment was that his wife was more angry at him for missing his little girl's league matches than for all the deception he was doing to her, even by breeding a child with a member of his group of singing. <br /> <The only negative thing I had with the filmmakers was that we insisted too much on the fact that his problems were blamed on an early childhood event, the accidental death of his brother. This tragedy has been used to escape all the wrongdoings of Ray as an adult, which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions. <br /> <br /> Note: there is an extended version with the DVD but the word says it is so badly edited that it is not worth watching, so stay with the "theatrical version".
