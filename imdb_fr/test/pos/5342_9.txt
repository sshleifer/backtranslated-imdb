Wallace & Gromit has been around for a while, but it was their first foray into the big screen. Fans of the British TV series, like me, were eager to see them and the film had gone pretty well in theaters. A big part of the reason is that the movie is fun and quite original. In a world of synthetic films like SHREK and TOY STORY, this stop-motion film is an interesting alternative to the trend of children's films, while being totally different from the cartoon. Moreover, compared to the much older stop-motion films (such as KING KONG and Ray Harryhausen's films such as SINBAD), the quality and movement of the characters are better at light-years: they look like very fluid, natural and more alive. > <br /> Besides the quality of the animation, this film also deserves congratulations at all levels. First, voice actors do a great job. Second, the script is very simple, but also very cute and enjoyable - with some two-way phrases that should probably do a lot more than the kids' heads. Thirdly, they manage to make this film not only a film for children, but also people of all ages, because the film is neither saccharine nor only intended for the younger crowd. In particular, the movie was incredibly cute, and especially the adorable rabbits. I particularly liked them in the end credits - which made me very happy to watch the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The result is that if you do not get stuck in the mud, you will enjoy this movie. It's fresh, funny and incredibly smart. I hope we'll see a sequel - and that's saying something, because I usually hate sequels.
