This film is a gift - an unexpected nighttime offer - so different from other critics, I had no preconceived idea. I found myself stuck to my seat as the film slowly dictated its own pace, its own unfolding. I was attracted to recognizing my deep love and humanity as I wanted "good" to prevail - but also to be ironic that I was sometimes on the side of the "bad guys". The film is quite beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to mind, and this more than because the film begins and ends in an elegy. Far from being depressing or confronting, the film recognizes deep suffering - then, by its cyclical nature - with births, rebirths and deaths, the film celebrates the fact that, to quote an Australian poet, is "sometimes joy" . Oh, gods, I feel like I just wrote a love letter to this movie - but here it is. Hola!
