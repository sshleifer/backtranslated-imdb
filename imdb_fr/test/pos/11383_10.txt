Sometimes the Academy does not recognize the potential of certain films or name them because they are controversial or powerful. Sometimes they are named, but do not earn anything (I hope this will not happen this year with "American Beauty"). This is exactly what happened with "Boogie Nights", which was the best film of 1997. The Academy preferred to give the best image to "Titanic", a purely commercial and hollow film, as well as others rewards to the overrated "Good Will Hunting" and the irritating "Full Monty". The other nominated films in the main category were "LA Confidential" and "As Good as It It Gets", excellent films, but "Boogie Nights" is even better and should have been selected in other categories. <br /> <br /> This amazing movie tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, in an astonishing performance), a 17-year-old bartender who catches the attention of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, Redeeming Actor), director of pornographic films. Eddie has a special "gift", which helps him to enter the world of porn movies. He changes his name for Dirk Diggler and begins to enjoy a resounding success. But glory ... does not last forever. Other characters also have their parallel stories - Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, Perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who agrees to do anything, but she has to wear your shoes on wheels. <br /> <br /> What could have been a trivial and trivial film turns into a perfect and memorable film in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes "Boogie Nights" such a good film is its performance, added to a well-written script, an excellent soundtrack, and so on. Each character is very well developed and each has its importance in context. Every feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, making it a masterpiece of modern American cinema. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" is a strong and powerful image that should be seen by anyone who really loves cinema. Under a plot that seems trivial at first glance, there is a wonderful story of ups and downs, things we face in our lives. It's an amazing portrait of the late '70s and early' 80s, a time of ups and downs. That's what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
