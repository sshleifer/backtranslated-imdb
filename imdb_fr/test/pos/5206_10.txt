Simply the best and most realistic film about World War II that I have ever seen. Not only because German soldiers speak German and Russian soldiers speak Russian (no English in a German or Russian dialect), but also because of the realistic setting in which the film was shot. The acting is exceptional. No Hollywood feeling, no love story ... Stalingrad was supposed to be one of the most horrible battles of the war and in such a context there is no room for feeling or romantic scenes. What you get is a film that will make you vibrate deep in the bones and have one of the best unfortunate ends a movie can have.
