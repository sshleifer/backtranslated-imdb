Farscape reigns totally! In my opinion, it is very close to Babylon five, although there are only 7 main characters in the series (spaceship included). The humor is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show captivating although everything is happening on the boat. <br /> <br /> What I really like and appreciate about Farscpae is that they do not use CGI for extraterrestrials. characters or if they do, it's imperceptible. They use these adorable rubber animatronic puppets that look a lot like those used in the original version of Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Farscape is something you really want to study, if you have not already done so.
