I must admit that when I saw the overview of "Inglorious Basterds", I set myself high expectations. This film did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Rarely, when I watch a movie with such high expectations, are these expectations met or exceeded? this movie did that and more. Even more rarely, I'm typing at the end of a movie, that's what I and everyone in the theater did. <br /> <br /> I must say that I am a bit biased towards Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction". . "I watched it when I was 12 and it's still my favorite and most influential movie. <br /> <br /> However, since then, Quentin has not really lived up to his bill, his style was becoming a bit predictable instead of being familiar, the quality was not honestly there (I never looked at Jackie Brown, and then there is Grindhouse.) It's up to "Inglorious Basterds What Quentin did was exactly what he needed for the war genre, a spaghetti western print that could only be made by Tarantino or Sergio Leone, but seeing how Leone died, Tarantino is the type to whom he is intended on this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So let's look at the movie I will not reveal.The writing was perfect, a nice transition between using not one but four different languages ​​in this movie. Not to mention this movie was set up in the classic Tarantino mold, large scenes of rich dialogues are rich and a sudden shocking action. <br /> <br /> The acting game was superb !! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar. I do not say that often, but honestly, the man should get one for this film, he spoke all the languages ​​of the film and was delivered with such a touch and such ease. He stole the show in a movie where everyone was incredibly impressive. <br /> <br /> I have no problem editing this film, because this film is the best film I've seen all year and probably next year. . Honestly, the more I think about it, this movie might crack my best movies ever and is Quentin's best film since "Pulp Fiction". Take it to me, watch this movie. I loved the fact that he does not do justice to this film. <br /> <br /> I watched it yesterday and I'm still blown away. Thank you Quentin from the bottom of my heart for the film you made. You're back on top buddy. I can not say enough for "Inglorious Basterds!"
