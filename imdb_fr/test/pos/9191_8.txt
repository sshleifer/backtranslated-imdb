This existential thriller, in Portuguese with English subtitles, is a modern version of American movies from the 1940s, with a surprise twist at the end. It's fascinating from start to finish. My only criticism concerns its low production values. The film seems to be made cheaply, and probably, so the black and white cinematography is significantly lower than that of Godard in Vivre Sa Vie, to quote another film noir more than 30 years . The most annoying of all, subtitles are often hard to read. When will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles to read on a white background? I would give a total of 8, although with better production values, it could have been higher.
