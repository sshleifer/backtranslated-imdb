Well, I saw that yesterday and it was much better than the other shoot of VH1, a pity that it is a little outdated, but you must see all the staff who makes South Park, very interesting things. <br /> <It's as fun as this documentary portrays Trey and Matt as creators of selfish greedy snobs who do not work and do not spend all their time having fun or relaxing (which is a little ironic) because they work hard enough on the series). <br /> <br /> It also shows all the animation process to make an episode of South Park, an interview with the actors who bring the voice of the character and many other things. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of South Park, I recommend it.
