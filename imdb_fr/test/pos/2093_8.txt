Finally! Third lucky time. This film has always been in my thoughts, but during my first viewing, I had forgotten and I had only taken the second half of the film. Then, a few months later, I had my second chance to watch it so I decided to record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and I still missed the first half of the movie. I was not going to allow this to happen again. So when he came back on television, I thought I should wait for it to continue, and then I will record it. And it was a good choice. I would have just watched the movie, but they still organize evenings of the week around midnight. <br /> <br /> After discovering a hole in their overcrowded cell, nine prisoners escape from their place of detention to find the key to the universe hidden by another prisoner, known as the Forbidden King. They think this key could be an opening for a hidden treasure of counterfeit notes. During this trip, they naturally see this as an opportunity to resume their life before being put in prison. Although things are not going as planned, most criminals make plans that go astray. <br /> <br /> "9 souls" is a spiritual journey of the Japanese director Toshiaki Toyada, who threw his audience in a film of two totally different halves. The first half of the story is more like a psychic comedy with the links of the criminals and the situations in which they find themselves as a selling point, but all this gives way to a second part full of moralistic and dramatic dramas, where the real problem begins with some rather nasty and bloody moments replace the blundering tone with which he started. While the first half is quite amusing with her on the road ballads, her doodles and offbeat jokes. But it's really the last half that really haunts with its particular twist that hits you so hard with some surprising touches that make you really nice for these very human characters. Even if they are not really innocent of their crimes, you have just taken root in the first half of these thorny characters who, when you see them spiraling out, you know it's an effective drama when you're shocked change. All nine characters have enough time on the screen to really understand their personal story and the weaknesses that could eventually make them fall. The plot works so that Michiru and Torakichi are the main characters and we see it mostly from their point of view. The escape narrative is an unquestionably compelling study that is clear in its purpose and asks you many questions about the society and the path you choose to take to escape life and free yourself from these constraints. <br /> <br /> While the symbolic story is full of clarity and vividly told. The visual element does not go unnoticed, because there is just a dream and trance atmosphere that is channeled into a unique atmosphere. What REALLY contributed to this factor and gave a boost to the film is the drastic and sluggish musical soundtrack of the instrument. The soft atmospheric gel he was able to create in many scenes left me quite out of breath with the eternal emotions he was able to provoke. Simply beautiful and downright powerful control on this front. The pace for such a long movie (2 hours) seems to be good and editing is done quickly, because we are so excited about all this. The hypnotic photography is clear in the details. While the actors performed by a strange cast are of high quality, each offering enough personality and features to separate. <br /> <br /> I found "9 souls" a pleasant and quite surprising surreal film that stirs up emotions and makes you feel as if nothing is wrong when it changes direction. Highly recommended.
