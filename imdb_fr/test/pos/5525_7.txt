The title does not refer to a questionable poker hand, but to six comic players. They come as a couple: Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland in a couple traveling to California for a second honeymoon, George Burns and Gracie Allen as an additional couple sharing the costs, and WC Fields and Alison Skipworth as sheriff and owner of hotel in a small Nevada town. No attempt is made to develop a coherent narrative - it is a collection of comic strips. All the first couple wants to do is spend time together, but the Burns and Allen characters are not married, so men go to bed like women. There's a bit of a plot: a nasty $ 50,000 plant in the suitcase that Pinky (Ruggles) leaves town, but because the expedition is guided by Gracie, the booty is nowhere to be found. The villain arrives in Nevada and Fields accidentally captures him. A lot of nice things, Ruggles' confused expression, Gracie's punchy speech, and the game of corkscrew with a corkscrew. words. And trying to remember the name "Gracie," he says to Skipworth, "Hmm, start with a K ... McGonigle." She answers, "Oh no, no, no, no ..." "Mmmm Wangahanky!" "No, no, no, no no, Oh, Gracie." "Yes, it's true."
