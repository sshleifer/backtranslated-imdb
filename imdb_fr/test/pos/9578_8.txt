I admit that I have never seen "Waiting for Guffman", a critically acclaimed 1997 comedy documentary about a small town staging a show. When the Best in Show ad had the motto "Of the team watching you waiting for Guffman", many critics have suggested in their critics that only those who are familiar with the film, its filmmakers and its good cast moment to see this movie. For shame, criticism, for shame twice! Any criticism that involves something like that with any movie probably does not want to share the film's richness with the rest of the world, but it's a film I hope people will know, now that its video / dvd. "Best in Show" is, without a doubt, the best comedy of 2000. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a dummy style, presenting the main competitors (not to mention the balls) of the annual festival "Best In "Mayflower Show" competition, where dogs of all races come to battle to find out who is the most successful dog. Harry Pepper (Guest) with his bloodhound, the simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O'Hara) and their terrible yuppies Hamilton and Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), the homosexual dogs Scott Dolan and Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean), as well as millionaire Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) and coach Christy Cummings (Lynch). They all have in mind a simple object: the blue ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. And ... should I tell you the rest? <br /> <br /> The humor of the director / writer / star Guest gives me the assurance that there are comedies that deserve to be criticized and that The idiocy of movies like "American Pie" or other useless "teen movies" will not invade the world after all. His idea is simple: make your comedy not only funny, but SMART funny. But instead of following the brilliant tracks of movies like "Zero Effect" and "High Fidelity", he used a rather unusual approach (and as I understand it, he also used this approach for "Guffman"). Whether you notice it or not, improvisation is a very big part of the movie. In other words, what the actors say and do was probably not written in the script, maybe not even dreamed by Guest and co-writer / star Levy. But with a soft hand from Guest, he and the actors make a hilarious theatrical feat that would probably have failed if manipulated by other less skilled actors. That's smart! <br /> <br /> The casting is, of course, what makes improvisation work the most. All are a marvel (comic) to see, especially Guest as Pepper. But the real star must be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the distraught advertiser of the contest who can tell the most scandalously amusing stories and comments that no announcer would have even dreamed ... funny. Williard can switch from the dog talk to the question of how hard he can hit the bench. There is even a part where he gives the idea of ​​a new marketing strategy: ask sexy women to put tight shirts and shorts with dogs and to suggest something like "having a doggie like a dog ". It is invaluable, as is his performance. <br /> <br /> I hope people will participate in this "dogumentary" of 90 minutes. The film deserves so much recognition. He was nominated for the best film-comedy at the Golden Globes, but did not win. I do not see why. I mean, in the comedy department, it's the best show. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A
