This film travels further on 8 shots, 2 kisses and 100 shots that it should be possible. Yet it still works. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> As I was going home from the theater, I was trying to figure out how he was coping with film clips like the pages of a novel manuscript blowing on a beach or the impossible series of fortuitous fortuitous fortuitous encounters. without the whole audience rising and shouting, "I've seen it millions of times already! And you've crossed the threshold of credibility!" But the actors were so enchanting and the screen filled with credible supplements that I forgot to worry about it. A friend who saw her with me said it had transported him to Paris with such perfection that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized that we were still in Indiana. <br /> <br /> All in all, a romantic-comedy thriller with subtlety, wit and elan.
