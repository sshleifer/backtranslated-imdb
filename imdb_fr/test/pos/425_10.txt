I've had enough of the shows with young and unskilled people, talking about their "problems" all the time, egocentric, boring and absolutely boring (Popular, Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills, etc.). "Hack" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, believable people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very, very good stories. I just love it!! I hope "Hack" will last a long time, because it's an excellent TV series for adults to change.
