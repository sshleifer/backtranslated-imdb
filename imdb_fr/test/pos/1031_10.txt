'Oppenheimer' with Sam Waterston in the lead and David Suchet in Evard Teller is an example of the docudrama at its best. Well written, well played by actors who look like their historical characters, very informative and very entertaining. The sets and costumes capture the atmosphere of the United States during the Second World War. In addition, the plot and the dialogue give the viewer the feeling of being really present in Los Alamos and being carried away by the excitement of the Manhattan project. The only drawback is that it is a British production and that some actors lack the skills to influence a convincing American accent. (The current talent of Australian and Irish actors in the use of non-native dialects is incredible.) The scenario is entirely consistent with Richard Rhodes' definitive history of atomic bomb development. Unfortunately, the mini-series was shown only a few times on PBS in the early 80s and then apparently disappeared into oblivion. <br /> <br /> "Oppenheimer" compares favorably with the recent "Fat Man & Little" Boy's feature film with Paul Newman in the role of Leslie Groves (the chronic overweight general and rather simple would be completely flattered) and Dwight Schultz (former TV series A student) as Oppenheimer. As a mini-series, 'Oppenheimer' is about 4 times longer than Newman, but uses all the extra time to his advantage.
