A western through and through. As the main character described by Glenn Ford says, "No, I do not want to fight, but I will do it if it forces me." This film is about being smart, strong and fighting for your beliefs. With courage, never stop looking for what you think is right. Great action and especially fast. It's nice to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward G. Robinson as an older Western old man. Glenn Ford lives up to his Western image. A really nice movie includes a non-military strategic war. Of course, it's violent, as the title suggests, but not too graphic, as in the computer-generated era movies. These are mainly violent clashes of the personality.
