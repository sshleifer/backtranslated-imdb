This film must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with a film both bizarre and sinister on four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The one with the newly renovated hotel with the inadequate wooden figure of a former finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, strange love story or career. I would love to see the four films as a separate film. They can be much more extensive. <br /> <br /> The single break in the middle is something I had never seen before. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the series (if they make one) or the DVD extension. Apparently, they had a lot of work to do in 3.5 hours.
