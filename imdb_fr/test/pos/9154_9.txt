Superb silent version of the story of Fran√ßois Villon. Although remodeled in the 1930s as SI JUS OPIS 1939, with Frank Lloyd at the making, the scripts of Preston Sturges and Ronald Colman in the lead role, this version is even better. Barrymore, with a cohort of comedians, plays the silly comic and the depressed Villon with a verve that Colman could not match. The photography is striking of beauty and innovation and the main actors, especially Conrad Veidt in his American premiere, the incredible beauty of Marceline Day, and the secondary comics, Slim Summerville and Hank Mann, steal all the scenes where they lie. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Barrymore has done so few first class comedies. Among his sound films, only his main role in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can be compared to these, and these are only expressed through his beautiful voice. In this silent film, Barrymore has to tell his story without words, and he does it, alternately hilarious unrecognizable as king of the fools and tenderly in love for Villon. He even manages to jump into the Fairbanks style, with conviction. He also leaves his share of glory to the distribution, chaining this group like any talented comic of the time. <br /> <br /> Finally, a short word on Alan Crosland, director known nowadays only for having directed the movie The first feature-length film, THE JAZZ SINGER, the same year, is out. Crosland was a cautious, innovative and delightfully original director, and it's a pity that more of his works are not known. Perhaps this film, much more interesting as a film than his best-known work, will be your introduction to his other talents. If so, you could do a lot worse.
