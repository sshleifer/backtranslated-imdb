Although I'm not crazy about musicals, COVER GIRL is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The film may be dated by today's standards and the story and the songs may not be anything special, but the musical numbers are beautifully staged and the casting is fantastic. Plus, the movie is a great introduction for Rita Hayworth fans ... it's simply breathtaking in glorious Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Despite Jerome Kern's collaboration with the film, his music is far from being as special and memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936), yet the songs serve the film well. The dance is just great, especially the solo number of Gene Kelly and my favorite musical number, "Alter-Ego Dance". Funny Phil Silvers almost steals the film as Kelly's partner. Otto Kruger, Eve Arden and Edward Brophy perform well in their dramatic side roles. And Rita plays a charming and charming girl here; a role far removed from that of his femme fatale in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941). <br /> <br /> In short, this is a charming movie that is worth watching even if you are not a music buff. . Still, the film's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite songwriters, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter, had written the songs for this movie. However, it is the glorious Technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dance that are the true treats of the film's production. <br /> <br /> As I watched Rita Hayworth doing her job, I do not think I've ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in the head of by Michael Powell, THE RED SHOES (1948). Just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.
