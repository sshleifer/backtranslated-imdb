Originally, I posted the first comment of this movie on the user, claiming it was shit and that it made no sense. I did not make sense. Campfire Tales is an exciting movie (now that I'm 2 years older and watched it last night). The actors were famous but not too famous. The game itself was more than acceptable, it was pretty good. I will note the film by segment of films. <br /> <br /> 1) The scene in black and white (AKA- "The hook") This was rather useless, it looked good, but I did not have much grip, the only one disappointing, I do not think it was even included as a segment. Here is the scare-o-meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Poor) <br /> <br /> 2) The RV Story (honeymooners wedged in the woods) Perhaps the most entertaining of all the tales, the acting game was good in this one too, disappointing sex scenes typical of the caravan. Yet it was intriguing, you think "who knocked on that door". There was suspense, and not too much gore.Like this one <br /> <br /> -------------- ------------ ( Very good) <br /> <br /> 3) Internet conversation story (little girl meets psycho) It was a smart addition, Gore left to a minimum, frightened left to EXTREME.Although that is sometimes boring, the last minutes were very fun, but make no mistake, it was still fun to watch. Very scary, and it could happen to everyone, so look at who you talk to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (Very good) <br /> <4) Ghost Tale (L man kisses ghost) ?? Not the best, it was not too atmospheric for a ghost tale. This one was strange, the looks were pretty good, playing music and screaming, but everything was too real to be dreadful, even if it was good, it was silent and bloody, and it could have been better with this idea. <br /> <br /> ------------- (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) The end (the 4 lost teenagers) These are the two pretty girls and the girls guys who tell the stories throughout the movie. The best thing about the movie is definitely the end, it made a good impression, the end was totally unexpected. Look, it was so well done, the realism was spectacular. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (TOP NOTCH) > <br /> 6) THE GLOBAL FILM The Campfire stories were more than what I used to take, I love it so much, now I buy it on video, because it's a movie of really entertaining horror, forget the trash you see these days, like a lot, I'm disappointed that it does not really go anywhere, it was directly to the video, for me it was better than all the hype "ho" you see these days. Together for campfire tales <br /> <br /> ----------------------------- (Very good) < br /> <8 out of 10
