This film is a fascinating drama on the set of the film. The actor and the actress really can not bear each other, but we are building a scene in which they are going to have sex - she for the first time, by scenario. The actress shows little emotion on or off camera in the plot, except that she freezes in the first scenes on a beach. The actor is absorbed by himself and challenges more and more the direction of the director, Jeanne. I could not help but be drawn into the drama of "How are these two going to work their way through a sex scene? This drama itself becomes more exciting than the nudity and preliminaries played in front of the cameras. Not that Roxane Mesquida is not beautiful and deserves the naked detour! However, there is a young and pretty stage hand doing some extra scenes. I think it's on the far left of one of the images (2 of 9) here in IMDb. I do not even know if this girl is credited, but when she goes (dressed of course) in a confident indifference with her short blond hair - SHE is sexy! WHO IS THIS GIRL???
