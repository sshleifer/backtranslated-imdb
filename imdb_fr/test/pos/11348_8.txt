Founded in 1962 in Hong Kong (at a time troubled, we are told), this extremely intimate story of a failed love relationship between two married people, attached to their traditions, remembers the essence of old Hollywood, scene after scene in lush colors, evocative still a restricted sensuality (as opposed to the sexuality required and occasional nude scenes become part of the norm of the novel), and the use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication. It's not difficult to see the influence of Marguerite Duras here, as she is known for her minimalism in storytelling as well as for describing a powerful drama using the art of verbal and nonverbal conversation between two closely related characters. . -Activate scenes that could possibly unfold in the lives of both characters. From Hiroshima MY LOVE to MODERATO CANTABILE, his pen is clearly visible from the moment we enter the narrow rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Ms. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) until the last scenes that explain the intensity of regret that he feels by remembering the lost opportunity by reaffirming this relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot even looks like something that Duras could have written: Mr. Chow and Ms. Su Li-zhen, neighbors in one. Although they are both quite successful professionals, they start to discover in the most mundane way that their spouse deceives them, and they discover quite naturally that it is between them. The question is whether they should act according to how they feel for each other or not as their partners. Each scene plays with the idea that they will give themselves at any time, and it is suggested that at some point they make it as intrusive as the camera explains their encounters (which seem to happen every day, as shown by the frequent changes of Cheung's dresses), we never see him. And just as not seeing one of their husbands enhance their own love affair, not seeing them pursue their attraction makes the final separation even more bitter, because every moment we want something to happen - a catalyst - and the only one This is what happens when Leung reveals to him that he loves her, followed by his discreet and brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which implies that he either. It also gives us insight into what culture and timing can do: from a Western perspective, it would have been possible to turn their love story into a stronger and more sustainable affair, especially in the 1960s, but as it is Hong Kong, the cultural values ​​are clearly different. <br /> <br /> The performances here are first-rate: it's very easy to play a torrid love story, but to play continuously a pent-up and platonic relationship that overflows with barely suggested desire is difficult and makes all sensuality more cerebral than palpable or visual. Cheung and Leung convent and their burned chemistry persists long after the credits.
