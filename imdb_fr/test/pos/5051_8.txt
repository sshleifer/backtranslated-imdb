The famous Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský, who is best known in North America for his lead role in Jacob the Liar's original production (Jakob, der Lügner, 1974), gives us one last brilliant performance as an 80-year-old jester who refuses to admit that he is about to die. <br /> <br /> The scenario of Jirí Hubac is exquisite. Funny, moving and well developed. It explores both the subject of advanced old age and the motivations of characters who are preciously strong and fragile, happy and unstable. <br /> <br /> Frantisek (Vlastimil Brodský) and his best friend Eda (Stanislav Zindulka) are at the party of all types of shenanigans and make sure to make the most of their last days. Meanwhile, Frantisek's wife prepares for their death, saves for funeral money and scolds Frantisek for her endless childhood and irresponsible attitude. Their son is about to take their apartment and put them in a retirement home, but Frantisek does not want to hear about that. He wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh. He wants to help and love and give ... but at what cost? <br /> <br /> A must-have for adults of all ages, this beautiful film by talented director Vladimír Michálek is both touching and entertaining. It makes you think about how we live and why we live our lives. It highlights the simple story of a charming and stubborn old man and allows us to reflect and feel what life is. <br /> <br /> After an active career of more than 40 years, it is a bit dark to know that Vlastimil Brodsk died in April 2002, when he was no longer suffering from terminal cancer. However, it is encouraging to think that he was fortunate to be part of such a moving scenario and to be the catalyst for this ode to a happy old age that has not even begun to make the waves that it is. about to create in the North American repertoire. cinema. <br /> <br /> After the international success of Jan Hrebejk's "Divided We Fall (2000)", it is becoming clear that Czech cinema really has something to offer the world. This film at least is a must see.
