Do not be fooled by the nostalgic atmosphere surrounding "My Uncle Antoine" because, like the best of Canadian films, darkness hides beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> Located in rural Quebec in the 1940s, the story explores Beno√Æt's growing consciousness as he learns to manage sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance is astonishing, particularly since a large portion of the criticism of Canadian cinema by the general public relates to aesthetics. Beyond this, the modest Benoit is an attractive figure for the public, looking at his corrupt community with a fresh and innocent eye. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading Jim Leach's critical essay on the film, entitled Best Film in Canada, to anyone looking to put the film back into historical context while dissecting the film's form. . Certainly check this one.
