They were an alternative before there was another, The Residents is a group like no other, and I love them for that. This has all their classics, from "Hello Skinny", "Third Reich and Roll" to their tribute to the great James Brown with an interpretation of "This Man's Man's Man's World". But this is only the beginning. As a bonus, he even has Renaldo & the Loafs, a beautiful song, titled "Songs for Swinging Larvae", and even features the cover of The Residents. It goes without saying that I strongly recommend the purchase of this DVD. I would also recommend buying their last album, 'Demons Dance Alone', it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Uncle Willie Eyeball Buddy # 502
