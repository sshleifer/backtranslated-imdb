I watched the movie about 13 years ago while living at Airlie Beach Qld in Australia. I found it in the shelves of a small store in the back that most do not have to go through. <br /> <br /> For my greatest pleasure, I found it and I looked with the intention of owning it in my collection. I still do not have it, but I will do it one day. <br /> <br /> I like the concept with poetry and fantasy. The semi-deserted street scenes with a lively and bustling city in the distant background have added to the visual effect. <br /> <br /> I often mentioned this film to people who like this kind of music, without praise. It remains etched in my memory and will remain so for a long time. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film, but only to those who are of the genre. <br /> <br /> This commentary and that of Los Angeles, California, can help you choose to watch this movie. Comments may be negative, but I find them positive if you look beyond the pejorative connotation.
