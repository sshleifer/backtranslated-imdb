I'm not going to talk about that, but I'm just going to be brief. basically for those who do not know how prue is actually dead ........... the first time the demonic murderer comes to hit the piper and prue with a ball of energy, they fly everywhere in the blood . phoebe the third sister goes down the stairs, says the spell that returns but not defeated. (NEED THREE POWER) leo just heals them both and so on. they are exposed along the line and the only way to save it is that a demon named tempus restore time. the only way to do that is that phoebe stays in the underworld. she accepts, tempus makes the time go up. now around 7 o'clock in the morning. the demon comes knocking the piper and fired with energy ball they cross the wall again. but this time, phoebe is not there to say the spell to repel the demon. the demon kills the doctor. doctor flies through the window. he is dead. The demon goes in a kind of whirlwind and the glass on the doors breaks, which is a tremendous effect in passing and there is an airy sound. that's where it ends. NOW .......... what the whole world does not know if they have not paid attention to the next episode. although what I'm about to say is not aware of what's going on, trust me ................ because this time there is no had no phoebe to call Leo this time, he arrives later. Piper survives because his injuries were not as fatal as Prue's. Leo heals her first before Prue. At that moment, Prue is already dead. he solves mystery. ps call prue with a spell should have worked !!! and she should have made a surprise appearance in the last episode. OK I walked around
