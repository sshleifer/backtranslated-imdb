First of all, to rent or watch this movie, you are expecting something in the B-horror range. What the film delivers to astute fans of this genre is a hilarious adventure with a Nordic flavor. Sometimes it reminds me of the humor of Jackson's Dead Alive and other Stuart Gordon movies. This little find should make you laugh longer. <br /> <br /> The f / x reach some really spooky highs (the first time Ed meets his nemesis), but usually have the feeling that this movie was directed by the af / x team who decided all the accessories at their disposal of the other films ... gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc. have a very good effect and work through the use of hallucinations. <br /> <br /> The jewel of the film is humor. The gore works most of the time but more for the laughs. Basically, it's a travesty and a fun to it.
