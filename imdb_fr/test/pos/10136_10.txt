It's one of the best movies I've ever seen! How can anyone hit this movie puzzles me! First of all, the performances of Gooding and Harris were simply spectacular, especially Gooding. This is the only way for me to describe acting: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play such a character and remove it. then you see Gooding, and his performance was magical. As for the plot, since it was based on a real person, it goes where the characters' life goes. For all action buffs, it may be a bit slow, but it's not an action movie. I definitely give a 10 to this movie. He deserves nothing less!
