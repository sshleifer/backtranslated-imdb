A few days ago, I saw the incredible "House of Sand and Fog" and was impressed by the incredible performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. I decided to see "Ray", trying to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Oscar for Best Leading Actor. After watching Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: he really deserves to be rewarded. I love Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but the resemblance of Jamie Foxx with him is amazing. The film is entirely supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates in most filming, and his stage movements resemble a reincarnation of Ray Charles. Regarding the story, I saw the extended version on DVD, too long but also very nice, with many beautiful songs and scenes mainly showing a drug addict Ray Charles. My biggest surprise was that Ray Charles was addicted to heroin and how he treated his own family. The presentation of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ray"
