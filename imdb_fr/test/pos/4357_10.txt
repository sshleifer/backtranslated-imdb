In documentary films, the question of realism always arises. What part of the film is real and how much is manipulated by the filmmaker? Herzog is too much absorbed by the story of a man who tells his own story before even addressing the issue of realism versus formalism. From the beginning, Herzog's role as a storyteller is obvious. Fortunately, he is a master storyteller. LITTLE DIETER is the finest and most engaging documentary I have ever seen. Dieter's story is fascinating and Herzog's efforts to rebuild himself, making Dieter live the dream of reliving his story during filming, are very effective. The story told by Dieter is real, but Herzog is omnipresent and snatches absurd comments to realism. This film is a must for all documentary film students and / or Werner Herzog.
