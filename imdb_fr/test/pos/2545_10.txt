The majesty of Ramin Bahrani's second feature film is that, like a poet, he represents the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen. Beyond most other independent films, CHOP SHOP is wise, exuding the best of the great cinema of all time; we can look back at the works of Bresson and Pasolini and compare Bahrani's work to theirs, and yet CHOP SHOP is fresh and urgent for modern society. We can see how a master works here ?? a certain sense of beauty, style and content merge into a film that reminds us of what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on the New York side that we see so often, we live and breathe with our young hero, Alejandro, in the miserable Willits Point ?? a fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture ?? and yet it is a very very real place. Trying to stay afloat, Alejandro has to provide for himself and his older sister. Watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that Bahrani is leading us to? all with a deep and concise realism.
