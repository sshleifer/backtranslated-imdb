I have seen and enjoyed all of Chameleon's films and I must say that they are getting better and better with each of them. Bobbie Phillips is fantastic and my granddaughter wants to be like her. I'm glad they brought a "Brother" character for Bobbie (Kam). So we can expect to see more exciting shows. Bobbie is beautiful, sexy and sweet, and independent at the same time, and all that a woman can desire to be!
