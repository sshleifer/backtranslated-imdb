It's actually the first film I saw in a theater where people did not leave at the very beginning of the end credits. Instead, they sat for a few minutes, gaping, their mouths open, looking at the infinite, trying to understand what they had just seen. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say: try to go watch movie with as little knowledge as possible (and me too)! I gave him a 10
