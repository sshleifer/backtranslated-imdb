It seemed to me to be a dull film that betrayed a small budget with a mediocre cinematography and editing work not very difficult. This may be of interest to those who know a little about submarines during the Second World War, but I recommend to all others to pay attention. Many scenes in this movie were flat and some actors were a little weak. The story of men recalled to work for a short holiday seems quite realistic, but there is no real tension or tension in the story. I also had a hard time understanding what the actors were saying, partly because of strong English accents and perhaps partly because of poor sound recording work. I give this a 55/100. Most people will want to "lead" clearly.
