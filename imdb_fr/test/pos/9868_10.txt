Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel to all Halloween movies. Jamie, the niece of serial murderer Michael Myers, carries a baby who is then taken away by Man In Black after the conclusion of Halloween 5. A caring nurse helps Jamie escape, but Myers quickly finds her and kills her. Jamie's baby is found and saved by Tommy Doyle, one of the babysitting children Jamie Lee in the original movie. Myers arrives at Haddonfield and begins to slaughter the Strode clan who lives in his old house. The film ends with scenes revealing clues about Michael's evil, the identity of the man in black and a scenario close to the story of Dr. Loomis / Michael Myers. I highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers is rated R for his strong graphic violence, his extreme gore, his brief sexuality, his language and his brief nudity.
