This movie was better than I expected. I do not think it deserves a R rating, though. I have seen PG-13 movies with worse language and violence. I found this film entertaining and I enjoyed it. If you are a person who dissects everything, you may find that there is something wrong, but if you take it for its face value, I think you will find it entertaining.
