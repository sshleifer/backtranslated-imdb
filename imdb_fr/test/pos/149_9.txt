Chan-wook Park, you have to give it to the guy. In my eyes, he is not only a brilliant director, but also a brilliant director who knows how to evolve in all genres and often offers something refreshing while being satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Thirst is essentially a vampire tale, but plays fast with some of the "rules" of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays father Sang-hyeon, a man who generously abandons himself to a research program, then non-selfishly catches the disease they are trying to heal, dies and returns. All thanks to the blood with which he was transfused. Being the only one to survive on five cents, he becomes a celebrity for those who know him and all he wants is to return to normal. Normally, however, now involves being able to cross great distances without hurting oneself, wanting to drink blood and become extremely hot under the collar when the sun's rays come to the skin. He soon lives with a rather dysfunctional family unit that knew him as a child and, while he hides his new strange lifestyle, he finds himself caught in a complex love triangle, becoming more acceptable for darker thoughts and slipping on a slippery slope. could lead him from man to beast in monster. <br /> <br /> Skilfully blending a number of genres, Park's film felt much cooler and more original than Let The Right One In (to use a recent example) and really impressed me with his approach. material that could easily have felt as worn and reshaped as many other vampire movies we've seen over the years. It is a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy and meditative ideas such as the strength of faith, power over life and death, the inconveniences of immortality, etc., etc. <br /> Some people have complained about this. The mixture-based approach weakens the film, but I personally found it to be a lively, entertaining and always enjoyable film, aided by Song's superb central performance as a tortured priest and fantastic shootings of a secondary casting without weak links. Many characters go through a whole range of emotions and do so with skill and credibility, especially the young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the object of love, lust and affection of the priest. <br /> <br /> Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular) as well as those of Poe's "The Tell-tale Heart" should be around, it's still a movie elegant on the part of a man who seems to take everything away. and still manages to create nothing less than solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> See if you like: Cronos, Near Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore, AKA Man Cemetery.
