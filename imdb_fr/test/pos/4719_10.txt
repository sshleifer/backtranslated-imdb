"Beyond Rangoon" is just wonderful. From the traumatic opening to the inspiring end, you will be amazed at the quality of this film. Patricia Arquette amazingly describes Laura Bowman, whom we meet as a young physician who is discouraged and dismantled, unable to cope with grief after the loss of her husband and son. Throughout the film, as she is trapped in Burma, witnesses the democratic surprise and massacres perpetrated in the capital Rangoon, escapes to save her life and saves the life of her tour guide (U Aung Ko ), she resumed her living arrangements. This can be seen as artificial or heavy: it is not. John Boorman, master of spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film in broad strokes and often uses symbolism to account for Laura's emotional state and physical difficulties. Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincing and credible performance as Laura is emotionally wounded. Whatever role she plays, Arquette gives us a window on the heart of her character without words. Each time the film approaches her, the audience discovers her character. She does not need to speak to convey emotions, nor to be exaggerated. Some critics criticized Arquette's performance in the film when it opened on August 25, 1995, saying it was "flat" or "dull" in the role. I found his description perfectly stopped, far from the melodramatic that is usually part of the performance of an actor during a personal tragedy. She is shocked and reserved about her feelings: it's as normal as screaming and attacking those around you. I hope Warner Brothers will release this title on DVD very soon. With NBC's "Medium" film, Arquette, which is a huge success and gives it the status of family name, not forgetting an Emmy win and its nomination in 2007, it would be in the studio's interest to do so. . Let's hope there will be extras, with the alternative ending. Do not go through this movie. This is the one you will not forget after seeing.
