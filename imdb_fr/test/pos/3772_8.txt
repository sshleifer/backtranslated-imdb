So, this is not a laureate, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a movie that was just silly? "The bad guy" and this one could be at the top of the list. My husband says that "Jekyll and Hyde together again" is one of those movies that, if "you've been there and you've done that", you'll think this parody of cocaine 80s culture is a riot. I think the whole movie is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes ... You have to watch to appreciate. To say that the film does not follow the book would be true, but many very good films also take liberties with the word published. I recommend this movie to all the old "stoners" among us. We may be smarter now, but we will continue to recognize and laugh at people we knew (ourselves?) At the time.
