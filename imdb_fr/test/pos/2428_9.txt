I would not be so sure to accept DNA testing as irrefutable evidence against Anna Anderson. First, read Peter Kurth's book on which this movie is based. Anna Anderson knew things that only the real Grand Duchess Anastasia could have known (medico-legal evidence for Anna aside). Second, compare the images of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Everyone can see that it is one and the same person. Third, visit the Peter Kurth website (URL below) where you can read detailed information about DNA testing, as well as why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person (click on the link below) "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRANZISKA SCHANZKOWSKA"). Even Schanzkowska's parents thought that their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person. <br /> <br /> For my part, I will always think that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were the same person; I will never be convinced on the contrary. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
