It was noted that Stan Laurel first became known by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s. He certainly proves to be an excellent actor and comedian here in "Mud and Sand" (a parody of Rudolph Valntino's "Blood and Sand"), but I think a movie like this really does not work because Laurel was a great satirist but because it allows the public to embark on a comedy already familiar with the situation and the scenes. Laurel can then let herself go with her inspired gags without having to create context or to do without it. I watched it the next day after watching "Blood and Sand" itself; He certainly improved the experience of knowing what was parodied and where. <br /> <br /> The scene where the character of Laurel (Rhubarb Vaseline if you believe the title cards, or Rhubarb Vaselino if you believe how his name is written on the chalk board) puts his mother out of money with a turn two for you, two for me, it's funny in itself because it's a gag, but it's very funny if the viewer knows how much it takes on the air of the extravagant and melodramatic promises of Valentino to give her mother all the luxury she desires. <br /> <br /> This is Stan Laurel's best solo work I've seen. It's just funny - even more so if you had the opportunity to see the source document.
