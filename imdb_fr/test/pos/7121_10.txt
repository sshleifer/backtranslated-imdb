Gamers: DR is not a fantasy movie, it's more of an amateur video. Magical effect horrible, real fireball, keep, castle, village ...... sword, ax, shield, dress, plate ..... okok ... everything. You will need about 10 minutes to adjust your visual expectations, then you will get 105 minutes of fun. <br /> <br /> I am Hong Kong and it is very difficult to find RPers, none of my friends play RPG and I always want to be part of the characters of the world of D & D. Watch the players : DR, just show me what it would be like to be a player. You see rules books, dice, game, etc etc etc; You hear terms such as "fighter", "wizard", "target", "level", "character", "fiery hand", "chaotic evil". <br /> <br /> allow you to do anything you want, not bound by the RPG software. Gamers: DR provides the same element, you will not know what will happen next and it will probably make you laugh at the dead. The film tells the real life of both players as well as in the world of D & D. You will hear the player roll the dice when the character in game will take action, which will give you the impression of actually participating in the game. <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin anything, but in short, the players: DR is a must-see movie for RPG fans. For people who never play role plays, I'm sure you'll still enjoy it.
