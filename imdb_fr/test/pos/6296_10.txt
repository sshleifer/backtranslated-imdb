Conrad Phillips plays in the series of action adventures of the 1950s - William Tell. Settled in the 14th century during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland, William Tell is a reluctant freedom fighter who fights heroically against the tyranny and oppression of the invading forces. William Tell is the Swiss version of Robin Hood. Conrad Phillips plays the protagonist in a fantastic way. It is possible that Pascal Bugnion was more successful in the role, but he was not available at the time of shooting. The classic show is composed of 39 series. The episodes are in black and white, but that does not detract from the entertainment.
