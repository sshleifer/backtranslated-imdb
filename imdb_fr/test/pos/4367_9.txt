Transforming Isherwood's somewhat dark and quite brilliant novel into a light comedy comedy could easily have been a recipe for disaster, but some might be otherwise. The story is moving at a fast pace and the black and white images are beautiful, as are Harvey and Harris as they make their way through a weird Berlin Weimar. Fun!
