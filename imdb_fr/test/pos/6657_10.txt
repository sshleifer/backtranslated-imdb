I just saw the DVD and I liked it. In particular, I thought the director, Jude and Nicole had done an amazing job with the kiss between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I have ever seen in a movie. I thought it was crucial to set the tone for the rest of the movie. this led to the belief that Inman and Ada would walk / wait, respectively, all this time without really having a relationship. I thought the film handled this crucial point of the plot better than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will name other movie kisses, but this one is for me! Jude and Nicole had shown incredible chemistry in the small number of scenes they had together.
