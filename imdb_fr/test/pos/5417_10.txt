This short film was nominated for an Academy Award, lost to Anna and Bella. Since the nuclear war against Dr. Strangelove, nuclear war has been so hilarious! Condie takes a situation and puts it on her ear and then rotates it for good measure. Visual gags abound in Condie's work and I always see something I missed before every time I look at it. The best animation in the world is worth seeing for this film and many other short films. Recommended.
