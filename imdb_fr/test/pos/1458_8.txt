We went well beyond this temporary incursion into a forbidden zone - drug addiction - for the 1950s. As such, the film may seem dated. The Man with the Golden Arm performed his function is peeling a layer from the bottom of the company, a revelation for a boy from the South Country in 1955, when I first saw this film at the theater. After much thought about my being too young, I was allowed to go. He was powerful and moving at the time and still retains some painful and painful moments of the stripped soul. As a film describing loneliness in the heart of being, he succeeds. <br /> <br /> Filled with anguish, Frank Sinatra, in his best role, creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. He translates his impotence and inefficiency into a beautifully restrained performance. As a common sense voice in the dead-end urban jungle, Kim Novak as Molly is very good. She is compassionate and yet she is strong. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a gooey character and does it very well. Eleanor Parker is superbly irritating and painfully uncertain in her role as pathetic Zosch, the crippled woman of Sinatra. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of the street. Considered pitiful and despicable, his character Sparrow offers moments of acidic comedy. <br /> <br /> The music is almost the star of this dark film, frenetic, sullen, poignant. Elmer Bernstein's note perfectly highlights the tensions of Frankie Machine's spiritual weakness and her physical need for heroin. Molly's theme is bittersweet and captures what the film visually describes. I do not know of any other soundtracks that effectively supplement tension and defeat in a man as effectively as this one.
