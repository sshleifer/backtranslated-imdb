I do not play video games at all, but my children. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with it all. Would like to see more of this type of movie. "very cool" as my youngest would say. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters and the whole story was interesting. As I said, I do not play video games, but I think it would please my kids. It was not full of bad language and it's a nice change. This visual concept was different which caught my eye. In addition, the soundtrack was pretty good. I could even try some of the games that my sons play to see because of this movie. Who knows maybe I'll be a player someday.
