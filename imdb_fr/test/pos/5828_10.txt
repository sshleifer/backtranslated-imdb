Yes, this show had a lot of male nudity and yes, over the years, the plot became extreme, melodramatic and very unrealistic, but it did not matter, because the show is great. You really get involved in the characters and each character, whether minor or major, is perfectly interpreted. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine anyone else besides JK Simmons playing the leader of the neo-Nazi racist rapist, nor anyone who plays Tobias Beecher except Lee Tergesen. The transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is incredible. However, the character of MADE Oz OZ was CHRIS KELLER (played by Christopher Meloni). He had no relations with any other person in prison except Beecher (well, with the exception of Ronnie Barlog, but it was only for Ronnie to stop playing with Keller's loving boy, Beecher). Their relationship transcends the sexes and Tom Fontana has actually made us concerned and we wish them together. <br /> <br /> I loved the faint for Vern for his children and the way Fontana created friendly characters. those odious criminals we grew to worship, even Simon Adebesi. <br /> <br /> However, some intrigues were totally unbelievable and unrealistic: * A guy builds a bomb in oz * Guys standing in the spotlight in their windows in their pods, watching other men tracing something in their mind - also on the top. * Drugs that have become rare * All members of the rehabilitation group have used or sold drugs and Sister Pete has never helped anyone in six years. * People are killed in the gym, in the supply cupboard and in the kitchen. * Nobody hurts Ryan's mother * Nobody fights Cyril outside the ring (except Vern of course) * Two detainees with tools are left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them dies without investigation . * Karl Metzger (guard) is killed and nobody investigates. * The governor holds all his press conferences at the prison. * All that an inmate has to do is say "I want to see Glenn" or "I want to see mcmanus" and we do not ask them without asking him questions. * People are dying every week in Oz * Outside, people kill someone and get 20 years of freedom, but they end up on death row almost immediately * There is no paid staff on place the kitchen or the mail room - the inmates lead the two departments without asking questions * Aging drugs that inmates replace as time goes on them * Ryan has no friends or associates but he does not never get hurt, kill, maim, rape or beat. * Guys NEVER pull the toilet when they go to the toilet or vomit. * An NBA scout goes to prison to recruit an NBA player (yes, right) <br /> <br /> However, with all these flaws, this show is still great. It's horrible, brutal, sexy, pissed off, raw and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, JK Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Luiz Guzman, Adele (the guy who played Simon Adebisi), Eammon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, Mums, Alexander, LL Cool J, etc., etc. etc. All are great and have earned the show to watch. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend renting this on DVD. Season six is ​​released on 9/06 (next month). The first five seasons are on DVD - watch them, then watch them again with an audio commentary. I loved the director's commentary with Chazz Palmentari. The sequence with Andy Schillinger running down the tables of the cafeteria and then falling into the hole was a great shot, great !!!! Glory! And Kathy Bates, director of Family Business and the famous fight scene between Beecher and Keller - just amazing! Brilliant !!! It should have been so weird for Meloni to touch the private part of Tergesen in front of an icon like Kathy Bates in this scene! Wow! Arrived marvelously, word game wanted! <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Oz: The Next Generation !!!! (as with Star Trek, etc.) C'Mon !!! Start !!!!
