Another black comedy that won the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Starring George C Scott, this redefines the phrase "rip a new hole in $$". In this case, the target is the American Medicare and Grand Hospital system. Throughout the hospital, patients and doctors are dying because their names and prescriptions have been changed. Scott roars, screams, and drives out his workers and his bosses, who are failing more and more. His comment on Dachau to one of his many bosses will not fail to provoke laughter. He even beats and rapes a hippie 3 times. It is this one that must be seen AND heard since monologues and monologues are the key points of the film.
