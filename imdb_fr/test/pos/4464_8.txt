DO NOT TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's first films (and honestly, in terms of script, better ...) - and although it's not the typical "bloodbath" for which Fulci is known, it's still a unique movie and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in a small town where a series of child murders occur. Among the colorful characters involved in the investigations - as suspects or those who "help" the investigation (or in some cases both), are the police forces of the city, a small journalist, a beautiful and rich ex- drug addict, a young priest and his mother, an old man practicing witchcraft and his protege, a city dweller with a mental disability and a deaf / dumb girl. All these people are involved in the plot to create several twists, until the killer itself is revealed ... <br /> <br /> DO NOT TORTURE DUCKLING is not a classic "giallo" "nor a typical Fulci movie gore. Although it contains elements of both, it is more of a mystery of old-fashioned murder, with a darker subject and some scenes of graphic violence (though nothing is as strong as some of the later works of Fulci). It's a well written film with lots of twists that left me guessing until the end. Recommended for fans of giallo / mysterious murders, or for those looking to uncover some of Fulci's movies without splashing - but do not despair, DONT TORTURE always has more than his share of violence and sleaze. Some may be discouraged by the subject of child killings, and one of the main female characters has the strange habit of preying on very young boys, which is also disconcerting - but if this type of material does not bother you, so definitely. look at this one. 8.5 / 10
