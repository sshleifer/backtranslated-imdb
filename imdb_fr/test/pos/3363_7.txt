Overall, the Dad's Army movie is a lot of fun, although the humor is not as catchy and brilliant as in the TV and radio series. So where does this leave us, the viewers? If you've never seen Daddy's army, the movie is a good way to familiarize yourself with the crazy world and get used to the crazy world of Walmington o / s. The downside is that you might not "understand "because, as I said, the humor in the movie is a little stubborn. <br /> <br /> For fans of Dad's Army, the film is nothing new as the story It's more or less a cut of the TV series, but it's a unique chance to see your favorites in "high definition" compared to the crappy quality of video recordings of the BBC. <br /> <br /> must be the worst sequence of restraint in the history of the universe. I can not decide whether it's positive or negative, though.
