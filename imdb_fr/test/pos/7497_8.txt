As I said earlier this year, in my review of Swordfish (which was scripted by this writer / director / film producer, Skip Woods), it's a good movie. He is high on my list of crime films among Lock Stock & Two Smoking Smoking, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Basically, I think this film is for me what Reservoir Dogs has been for many people - a cult classic - although I prefer to compare it to Pulp Fiction. I mean, I never really liked Tarantino's first effort, but I certainly liked this one as much as Pulp Fiction because it contains everything a classic needs. A beautiful story and good actors. OK, the budget may not be as important as in Godzilla, The Avengers of Mission to Mars, but it is certain that it is these movies (and many more) that are making the mess. <br /> <br /> The story of This film is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane), who settled with his wife in Houston. Unexpectedly, an old friend comes to disrupt his life, reveal his secrets and make his day hell (and the bloody too). <br /> <br /> The film is very original and quite bloody / sexually tinged. . So, based on this first and last quality, I can assure you that if you like this movie, you'll also like Swordfish, which of course has a much larger budget and more famous faces than this one, but that's all. as bloody and not so sexually tinted). I saw this movie for the second time last night and I really enjoyed it (again). I mean all the characters and actors are good, although I have to give a very great credit to Thomas Jane and Paulina Porizkova, who were the best actors (and had the best characters) of the film. I would also like to thank Skip Woods for his imagination and originality. Brutal, sexual, offensive ??? Maybe, but certainly as pleasant and exciting to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
