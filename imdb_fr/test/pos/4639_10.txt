As many other comments I read have noted, I fell in love with this movie as a child. My sister and I had a copy of the movie on Beta (before VHS) that we had exhausted. Of course, that did not help when our parents sold BetaMax at a garage sale. Since then we have been trying to find a copy. Like another commentator, I finally found a rental copy in a local video store. The owner did not want to part with the copy after a number of attempts to beg, bribe and cry as if I owned the band. GOOD NEWS! I bought a brand new VHS copy of Midnight Madness recently published for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com two days ago !!!! Finally, Disney woke up. Now, if they only want to reissue Song of the South ... If you like the movie, take it. If you have not seen the movie, it's worth checking out - a totally stupid but fun humor (Stephen Furst is hilarious).
