All reviewers make a big mistake. This movie was not meant to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It was designed for children and teenagers in the late 80's or early 90's. So it's really a movie of its time. If you have a horror of this period or if you like the first film so much that you can not even make a joke of it, then it's hogwash, but only because it was not meant for you. The low budget here and the failure of Beastmaster 1 at the box office (less than four million euros with a budget of nine million euros) were obviously the reasons why the seriousness of the original had been abandoned and put Nowadays. You can complain about history, dialogue or logic, but again, it was done to run, not to win races. If the film had tried to take itself seriously, it would be a total failure, but it does not do it for a second (in "our" world, Dar sees a movie theater announcing The Beastmaster 2, enough said). To paraphrase Clint Eastwood from Dirty Harry's films: This movie knows it's limited. It's more a comedy / parody than the usual adventure. The soundtrack (for the weather) was also excellent. The actors do not take themselves too seriously and even the usually irritating role of the "rich kid spoiled" (played here very well by the young Kari Wuhrer) proves to be good. <br /> <br /> So if you're nostalgic about the 80s / 90s cheese culture, or if you liked the first part, and you do not mind going out on a cheese leg, you will have a crazy pleasure this attempt to revive Dar in the 90s (literally). It's not really following the first one, and do not look at it if that's what you want. It's more a spooky continuation. <br /> <br /> Regarding the question "why a different dimension and not just a different time": bone (from the end of part 1)? By the way, the movie ends at the zoo because of a cheap big final attempt (for the money). It's supposed to be the best place for Dar to show all her movements (being the animal manipulator).
