But I tell you something: even the beautiful scene of Homenage performed by Brian Di Palma with the excellent music of Ennio Morricone in The Untochables (filmed in slow motion) can not match the effect of the original masterpiece of the crowd descending the ladders. We do not only see the stroller, but I remember the hand of a baby in a military boot, a person without foot escaping at the last minute, a person wearing glasses (then a cut edition) and then the same glasses broken by a bullet through .... mini stories in one scene.
