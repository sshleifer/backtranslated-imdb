It may be the best film of 1999. No, I'm not kidding. This documentary directed by Chris Smith captures the very spirit of the artistic constraint. Smith does the intelligent thing that any documentary filmmaker should do: he remains invisible and refuses to judge his subject. <br /> <br /> While the viewer watches Mark and his efforts, agile as they are, it can be aggressive to finish his films. He refuses to compromise and suffers on several occasions. But remember, remember Speilberg, Scorsese and others started with the same humility. <br /> <br /> And what a great subject he chooses. Mark, his family, and his friends are all fascinating characters, far more than any character created in fictional cinematic products from last year. , despite talent problems, to get by and do something. <br /> <br /> The film is about non-conformist artists and their passions. It is also families, regardless of their co-dependence and dysfunction, and the beauty and uniqueness of this body. In the film, Mark proves that he is totally dedicated to his dreams, but also to his family - and to themselves. <br /> <br /> The reason this film was not nominated for the documentary of the year is beyond me and is criminal (this assumes it was eligible last year). This film is to search and cherish.
