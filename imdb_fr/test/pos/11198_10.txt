The only complaint I heard about this movie was that it was slow. Although, maybe that's the point. The two characters clash ruthlessly and the slow rise of tension that unites them is a source of anxiety. Subtle and complex gestures and minimal dialogue bring tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument shocks the audience. Istanbul and its surroundings are dreamy, captivating landscapes, and the intrigue is thrilling - not in this "look, the hero is blowing up another car and he's flying now with his bike". I had chills in the back as the characters came in and out of each other and watched the fog invade Istanbul.
