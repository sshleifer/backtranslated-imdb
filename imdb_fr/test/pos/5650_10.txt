Fires in the Plain (1959) **** <br /> <br /> You do not see such films anymore. "Fires on the Plain" is an incredible representation of the lives of Japanese Imperial Army soldiers. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows Tamura, a TB soldier who wanders the Filipino landscape in the last year of the war. He is sent back to the hospital by his superior officer to be denied treatment. He is therefore sent back. His commander tells him to come back and if they refuse him again, his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. He is denied again, but meets a group of squatters sitting outside the hospital. The next day, they are bombed by US troops and Tamura fled, choosing not to commit suicide. From there, he walks from place to place to try to reach Palompon. He discovers that some men eat human flesh to survive, while others exchange as much tobacco as they can in exchange for what they can recover. <br /> <br /> desolation, with a hint of madness. Everybody we see is a skin and bones, covered with dust, ripped and ripped rags. Ichikawa uses his camera to take great pictures of the destroyed landscape and the Japanese soldiers who run through it. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for doing many comedies and satires, and there are moments in Fires on the Plain that are biting. Take for example a photo of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a puddle; a soldier walks but wonders aloud if that's how they will all meet, to which the man raises his head out of the water and answers "What was it?" and then drops his face even deeper into the puddle than before. Another hilarious sequence is for a man to find a pair of boots along the trail. He takes the boots and replaces them with his old ones. Another man passes by and sees this pair of boots and swaps his old boots. The scene continues until finally Tamura finds the place of exchange and examines the shoes left without almost any sole. He looks closely at his own and those of the ground and, deciding that they are both kaput, he removes his and walks barefoot. The film is filled with incredible scenes, one after the other. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa used his camera to paint beautiful and breathtaking images. There are many striking shots of men in arid, empty plains, surrounded by smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on broken ground. There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers try to cross a street guarded by Yanks in the middle of the night, all crawling on all fours when the cameraman looks from above. <br /> <br /> The film takes its name from the smoke columns born from the fires in the plains throughout the film. They represent for the soldiers the life a little more ordinary; the life of Japanese farmers at home burning corn husks. However, their marks of hope for normal life are in hostile hands. <br /> <br /> The film was a sensation in its time with its graphic content. The focus is on the horror of war, not just with the enemy but in your ranks and yourself. Ichikawa's Fires on the Plains is an incredibly authentic, moving and somewhat disturbing portrait of the horror of the men who make up the lower ranks of the imperial army. Clint Eastwood's Iwo Jima Letters, although a very good film, are far from realizing the horror of the war described in Fires on the Plain. (Eastwood was undoubtedly influenced by the film, claiming to be a big fan of Japanese cinema.) Many war movies show that the war is hell in the eyes of the winners. In Fires on the Plain, we are shown that the war is even more infernal when we are losers <br /> <br /> 4/4
