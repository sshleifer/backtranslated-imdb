This is one of my favorite series, all categories, of all time. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to have the whole series on VHS a few years ago. I liked it when I saw it again in -91 -92, at about 12 years old. I love him as much, if not more, today, which is remarkable considering my (I hope) improved my appreciation and criticism of the film. Most of the films I loved at the time do not please me much today, except for the nostalgia factor. This factor is also present here, but Sherwood's Robin is much more than nostalgia. <br /> <br /> There are only a few negatives about this series. First, the quality of the image and sound is good, at least in the first two episodes. Fortunately, it's better. Secondly, you might have wanted a little more blood and realism in the fight scenes, although I knew it was not an option in this case. <br /> <br /> Then let's move on to good things! And there are many. First of all, Michael Praed is Robin Hood. I do not think I've seen him play a single role since then, which only reinforces that fact for me. He delivers a performance as credible as Robin. Jason Connery had an impossible task to replace. The fact that Michael Praed did not become a bigger name as an actor is incredible. Or maybe it was his destiny, to play this role perfectly, then to disappear. <br /> <br /> I love Nickolas Graces Sheriff of Nottingham. He's really not a complex character, but totally rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburne is just hilarious. In fact, just looking at Rainault sitting on his throne, bored, looking at me, makes me laugh before he even said anything. Ray Winstone (Will Scarlet) is another actor who deserves additional praise. You can really feel the sadness inside of him as well as his hatred for the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor who finally got his well-deserved breakthrough in Hollywood (in the movies The Departed and Beowulf). There are many other great actors here too. <br /> <br /> I like the portrayal of the Robin gang. They have fun, play, laugh, we really feel the camaraderie that separates them, the closeness that comes from such a close-knit group. These closeness scenes are so important. <br /> <br /> I think being produced in the UK with British actors has really improved it, compared to the -92 version of the feature film with Kevin Costner, for example, that really feels wrong . , false. (Christian Slater like Will Scarlet, come on ..) The casting being able to speak English with a British accent, this is more credible, and I have the impression that the actors, as well as the director and the writers, can behind the series. much more in the skin of the Robin Hood gang than an American crew could have. The music is wonderful, Clannad is perfect for the feel of the show. Music is another of those things that they just nailed. <br /> <br /> The fantasy and the magic spices added to it are also interesting. This is not exaggerated, but credible and makes everything better and more interesting. I also like how much the mix of comedy, adventure and drama is well mixed. <br /> <br /> These are some of the things that make this series so vivid and authentic. It's by far the best version of Robin Hood I've ever seen. I will not finish with the quote "Nothing is forgotten". But one thing that will never be forgotten for me is this fantastic Robin Hood story. To see him
