"The Dresser" is perhaps the most refined film behind the scenes. The film is brimming with spirit and wit, ensured largely by the "energetic" character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly homosexual and he certainly has an attraction for the main performer (Albert Finney) he attends, the film never lingers on it or makes it more than it is. <br /> <br /> The brutal style of Peter Yates, who worked so well in "Bullitt", is again presented and gives the film a sense of realism and consistency. This is very much appreciated in a story that could have become so boring. In the end, "The Dresser" will annoy many people, but it will be a treat for those who love British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
