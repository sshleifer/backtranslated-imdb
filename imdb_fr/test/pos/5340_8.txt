This scene shows how Wallace's experience using his invention of manipulating the brain turns terribly badly by creating the "Rabbit was". His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society for the better and so has created a machine to "manipulate the brains". He risked his life to help solve the problem of Tottington rabbits and, above all, to overcome the overpopulation of rabbits collected and stored in his basement. Even though he thought his experience was working well, it had resulted in putting more pressure on him and Gromit to find a solution before the annual Vegetable Contest would risk his life again. Gromit, who is a faithful silent dog and a faithful assistant, is constantly thinking of innovative ways to save his master, his dreadfully crazy inventions that go horribly wrong. What's interesting in this film is trying to identify who is the most entrepreneurial, Wallace or Gromit?
