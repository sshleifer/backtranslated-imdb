I would just like to say that the film was good and touching. The film explains the real meaning of being saved or born again and is very well presented. The acting was pretty good but could be improved. The story is catchy and when my church celebrated youth service and we watched it, 8 people gave life to Christ. I would just like to say to anyone who reads this, give your life to Christ and repent of your sin.
