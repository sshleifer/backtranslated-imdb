This is a case where the script plays with the audience in a way that only serves to extend this 90-minute story. The story begins in 1969 when a young girl, Faith (Cameron Diaz), goes to Europe with her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Eccleston), but dies under mysterious circumstances. Then, in 1976, Faith's sister, Phoebe (Jordana Brewster), also decides to go to Europe to try to find out what happened to her sister. In France, she raises her head to Wolf who stayed there and she wants him to help him trace the steps taken by his sister and answer a few questions. He hesitates but decides to travel with her. Along the way, he bridged the gaps and told Phoebe that Faith had joined the Red Army, an extremist group involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf engage in a love affair and it complicates the trip to Portugal where Faith died. There are several problems with this movie and all this is related to the scenario. First, the romance between Wolf and Phoebe is completely false and does nothing for history. It sounds completely wrong and seems forced. It seems odd that Wolf has engaged in a romantic relationship with his dead little sister. Secondly, Wolf knows exactly what happened to Faith, but only lets out small amounts of information every 15 minutes or so. Wolf will watch Phoebe every 15 minutes and say, "There is something I did not tell you"! Thank you very much Wolf! If Wolf had been frank during his first conversation with Phoebe, the movie would have been finished in about 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me is that I do not think this movie recreates the 1960s at all. Diaz wears hippie clothes, but the period does not ring true. I enjoyed some things like the authentic places where the film was shot. It is a very beautiful film and the landscape is beautiful. The performances are all good, especially by Brewster and Diaz. In addition to "The Fast and the Furious", I had never really seen Brewster. But after seeing his performance in this movie, I am very impressed. She is very good here and I hope that better roles will come to her. The scenario is very artificial and the film never seems credible.
