It's ridiculous how this film is underestimated. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It never delays, it never slows down, it's a film that has a wonderful flow to the plot. This, with the brilliant writing, makes this movie a great movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are fun in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti deliver an excellent comedy of villains, but Viju Khote and the Ajit-wannabe are the best with their abominable intentions as villains. If you want to laugh and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. Most Indian movies get me tired in the end because they last 3 hours. This film is also long, but I would like there to be more when it ends, because it is an incredible film.
