Cheezy? Yes. Badly filmed? You betcha. Zero budget? They claim it proudly on their posters. Bright anyway (or because of that)? Of course. <br /> <br /> This film celebrates (and makes fun of) all that was classic in the genre of horror movies for teens of the 80s: characters without any depth, part of a stereotypical roll, they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a massacre committed by a mysterious force that they disturbed by doing something bad teenager; nudity completely free; impossible amount of blood coming out of the victims; zombies moving slowly; super one-liners ... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! <br /> <br /> This is not a parody in the manner of Scary Movie, but rather a film tribute to the lost innocence of horror movies of the 80s ... the fact of being scared and disgusted could also be fun, silly, sexy and goofy good time!
