I went to see this film because Joaquim de Almeida was inside. Joaquim had a rather small role, so it was nice that I loved the movie alone. In fact, I liked it! <br /> <br /> The film is centered on two characters, Albert and Louie. Albert is a shy and retired man, and Louie ... well, Louie is not. The story revolves around Louie's request to Albert to let him come home for a while. Louie just got out of jail. <br /> <br /> Albert and Louie have known each other since childhood, and of course, when they do something together, there is a problem and Albert always falls in the fall. <br /> <br /> The action of the film is based on the adventures arising from Louie's visit. On The Run is a chronicle of wacky, crazy situations. However, Bruno de Almeida and screenwriter Joseph Minion (After Hours) do not always take you where you expect. There are twists and turns that add depth to this film. Of course, there is a lot of pure comedy, but there is also a lot of subtle humor. <br /> <br /> There is also very good performance. Albert is deliciously played by Michael Imperioli. He is more and more known these days in the HBO series, The Sopranos. <br /> <br /> Louie is played by John Ventimiglia, who gives his character an adorable and childlike quality. (No matter what he does, you have to love Louie!) <br /> <br /> These two actors are excellent in their individual characters. With Imperioli, you'll want to hug him and take him home. Ventimiglia, you will not know if you should slap him or bring him home (and NOT to mom!). <P> <br /> <br /> There are also other remarkable performances. Rita's character is played by Drena DeNiro (yes, Robert's daughter). The public adored him. In talking to the other people who saw the film, it was amusing to wonder if it was Albert or Louie who was their favorite. But everyone loved Rita! <br /> <br /> Is this film perfect? No, I can not say that it is. On many occasions, I would have liked the director to have a larger budget. Some scenes have called for more budget freedom. (Give this guy a decent budget to work with and I think you'll see a movie that will make you stand up and notice.) <br /> <br /> The final sequence was a little budget victim. Still, budget or no budget, the final screenshot has, in my opinion, brought together the talent of actor and director in a memorable and emotionally effective scene. <br /> <br />
