Hitchcock did at least 11 movies about the ordinary man, wrongly accused, fleeing (sometimes really running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control, the first being "The 39 Steps", which really popular in Britain. It's really his signature theme. <br /> <br /> Others include "Young and Innocent", "Saboteur", "Spellbound", "Stage Fright", "Strangers on a Train", "I Confess", "To Catch a Thief" , "The Wrong Man", "North by Northwest" and finally "Frenzy". "Saboteur" begins Robert Cummings in the role of Barry Kane, a worker in an aircraft manufacturing plant during the war, accused of murdering his colleague and best friend during a sabotage of the factory . He meets the model Patricia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane, during her race against the law, and later, of course, by various Nazi / fascist sympathizers on her way. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is mainly like "The 39 Steps", including even similar plots like handcuffs, the blonde who does not trust the main character at the beginning, a race across the country ( in one case, from London to Scotland, and from California to York) and meet the "colorful" inhabitants along the way. And so, just like "The man who knew too much," I think it's an American remake of one of Hitchcock's early works. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he seems to be a very ordinary person. American, a kind of "person" with whom the public can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in "The 39 Steps" and Ruth Roman in "Strangers on a Train". As mentioned elsewhere, Otto Kruger steals the show as a villain. I also liked Vaughan Glaser's performance as a blind eye; his lines are great. There are a few fun little touches along the way, such as road signs depicting Priscilla Lane's character, circus performers, and truck driver Murray Alper. Unlike other opinions, few characters immediately believe in the innocence of Barry Kane. <br /> <br /> There are slow moments, especially when the action moves for the first time in New York, but it quickly resumes the last act scheduled by the fifth columnists begins. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite Hitchcock movies (I put it in my top 5), especially in this time of new war on terror. I think that strikes the house. <br /> <br /> It makes you think, "Can my colleague be involved in something bad?" In fact, one of the posters in the movie "Saboteur" proclaimed "Beware of the man behind your back!" Imagine how it played in the minds of adults during the Second World War.
