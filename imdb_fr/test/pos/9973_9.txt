Michael Radford did a great job putting this difficult piece on the screen. He played a play with a reputation for anti-Semitism and showed us that Shakespeare was very familiar with the humanity of the Jews. After the screening, Radford said, and I agree, that Shylock was his first tragic hero, the first of his characters to be defeated by a compelling need for revenge. He also rightly points out that an anti-Semitic man could not have written Shylock's speech: "If you sting me, do not I bleed?" Radford himself is of Jewish descent and he has selected the good and the bad of all the characters with delicacy and honesty. no character is free from defects; no character is bad. Radford placed the piece in the 16th century, giving a lush background of Venetian politics and decadence on which to project Shakespeare's words. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to hear Radford talk about the film, I recommend taking it, because it gives details of life in Venice in the sixteenth century, which illuminate many choices and give depth additional viewing. I hope the DVD will come out with many comments. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons beautifully describes Antonio, a man who resigns himself to bear the burden of past misdeeds. Lynn Collins, a relative unknown, entrusts to Portia a work absolutely flawless, breathtaking and detailed. Mrs. Collins is not only beautiful, but she also gives Portia layers of intelligence and humor before the experimental stage that I have never seen in a production of this play. the rest of the cast also does a fantastic job, with a remarkable performance by Kris Marshall as Gratiano and a beautifully subtle work by Allan Corduner as Tubal, starring Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino draws his habitual (strong and strong) habitual performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says nothing, but you can see all the emotions and follies that go through it. as he perceives it. his fortune changes. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage movies, I can not recommend this film to you.
