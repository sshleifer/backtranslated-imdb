The first time I saw this movie was a flight between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was really fun and the trip was less embarrassing than the normal 10 hour flight. I tried to locate a copy without success until I discovered a copy for sale on eBay. After watching it twice, I recommend it as a good entertainment. My only criticism is that the choice of English translation words for subtitles is mediocre, even by the usual standards. In addition, subtitling is little by little, blends too often in the film and often travels too fast to be well read.
