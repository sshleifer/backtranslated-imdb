I am surprised by the relatively low rating of this movie. It's a comedy and romance roulette film put together by someone other than Billy Wilder, but it does a very good job and has even won an Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is Ingrid Bergman's first film in the United States since the 1950s and even though she's no longer the young bomb she was in her first films, she's playing a difficult role with a lot of cheerfulness. This film proves that she had multiple talents beyond her beauty. <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn, who won an Oscar in her first feature film, is a very good actress. , love them and leave them Walter Mathaw. Goldie delighted all the senses in this role which, with a big distribution, propelled it like a slam dunk for this reward of beginning of career. <br /> <br /> This film is not really deep, but is a jewel that has stood the test of time very well. I do not know why it's average, it's so low that I give it a solid 8.
