The Venice merchant is a fantastic film. It's very faithful to the original Shakespeare play. If you saw Jeremy Irons at Casanova and loved his performance, it's a movie for you! If you saw Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare in Love and enjoyed his performance, this is a movie for you! If you have seen Al Pacino at Donnie Brasco and you like his performance, this is a movie for you! It's a very nice film and if you study Shakespeare like me, it's a great movie to see !! The only problem with this film is that you can not let the little ones see it because it contains a bit of nudity. But other than that, it's a very good movie !!
