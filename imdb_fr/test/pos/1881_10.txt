Normally, I do not review online, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room, a rainy day with nothing to do except watching sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I do not can not curse me 'Joxer the Mighty' song out of my head, he's been there for about ten years, just pops up at random when someone (me) does something silly). If you have any complaints about this movie and actually post it on the Internet, do you have any idea of ​​how foolish you look? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than from what he publishes (in the most literal sense of the term), why, in the holy name of God, do you watch his films? Nobody watches a Bruce Campbell movie when he wants to see something awesome and intelligible. We watch them to feel better about ourselves (like those who watch Jerry Springer and eat Chunky Monkey), and to be easily entertained by psychological gibberish. Personally, I like Bruce Campbell's films. In fact, I'm not an idiot, I see myself as an intellectual and a scholar (haha, shut up, Ally). His films reflect foolish, random, quirky and ridiculous ideals that anyone who has an angry brain, who screams or not, can take advantage of it. That, and he was pretty sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess, even with facial hair. I rate this movie a great 10, just because I can. If you can not take simplistic plots (if any), hot girls in a sci-fi splendor (leather, spandex), and familiar, if not exhausted, views of madness, do not let yourself go to crying, do not watch the movie (or any other mention of the name Bruce Campbell). Oh yes, Ted Raimi was great in this movie! Bravo Ted! You did the best with what you had. ; |
