It's a very entertaining drama with excellent distribution. Garfield is doing well as a boxer hiding from the police with this motley crew of Dead End Kids. The most notable of them is the beautiful Billy Halop who has very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who died very young in a house fire, is strong and very attractive as Halop's sister, and in the early scenes, Ann Sheridan, on the threshold of fame, is a knockout. May Robson is very funny as a crusty old granny, but Claude Rains proves here that even a great actor can collapse if he is misinterpreted (who would want to call him a New York policeman?). <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley proves here that he was an excellent director with or without music numbers. The film moves at a great pace and the sequence of the water tower is very suspensive and well photographed. The end is artificial and the plot is not surprising or original, but I still found the experience very enjoyable.
