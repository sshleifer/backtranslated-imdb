I heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then discover that Paris Hilton was there also did not give me the best impression of the film ... so being dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sitting there waiting for a bunch of pants, I was shocked to find that I was scared all along the movie ... it was predictable, but the accumulation of the dead and the atmosphere of the movie made it REALLY scary for me ... I watched my fingers all the way through. So, I advise you to watch and decide for yourself and if the fact that it is a scary movie does not convince you to go watch it, then there is also Chad Michael Murray, which can not be bad to watch for a few hours. eh?
