Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texas congressman who is partying and does not have a legislative history. In 1980, he became increasingly interested in the plight of Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a war with the USSR. Under the auspices of her former flame, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), a very conservative Texas socialist in Texas, he travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation and is stunned by what he sees. He returns to the United States, determined to help Afghans, but finds his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation - and is himself under investigation for allegations of drug use. Undeterred, Wilson recruits Herring and CIA off-duty agent Gust Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to begin a complicated deal involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and a US Congress almost unknown. Ultimately, the Afghans defeat the Soviets, but as the United States celebrates their victory, Wilson and Avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war Afghanistan that falls on the ear of deaf ears. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is a brain candy, a really neat movie for the most intellectual viewer and a fun entertainment for the average viewer. The film brings together an impressive number of talents, both in front of and behind the camera, and keeps its promise of being a hell of a good time. The film has only one flaw, to which we will arrive later. It is fascinating to examine the unlikely way in which the greatest secret war of the twentieth century was conducted - and perhaps also the manner in which the CIA and other intelligence agencies have performed its task - is fascinating. <br /> <br /> interesting on many levels. The story told in the film - with all its scandalous double dealings, its sneaky secret operations and, perhaps most importantly, its success - would be so outrageous as a fictional work, that it could easily be described as satire. But things really went on like this, at least within reasonable limits. The film describes our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without hiding their flaws. Wilson as a person who is not excused for his vices (even kissing them) - but eager to embrace a just cause. Herring is sort of elitist and her newly born attitude of justice is off-putting - yet she is deeply committed to the cause of the Afghan people. Avrakotos is an outsider of the CIA who has a problem of attitude and who is despised because of his "street" past - yet his love of the country and his hatred of communism are unshakeable. The fact that this strange trio can play a major role in the fall of the USSR proves not only that anyone can make a difference, but also that the truth is stranger than fiction. It is also very interesting to note that all of this is played as a comedy - which is not surprising, given that our writer is Aaron Sorkin, but it is an interesting way to approach this story. <br /> <br /> The film does have a disadvantage, which is a little surprising. The film seems to shamelessly celebrate the achievements of Wilson & Co. It's good - nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union, is it? - until the Taliban and eventually al-Qaeda emerged from the ashes of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan. Whatever the level of responsibility of the United States, this has happened, and the description of Wilson's success by the film is almost irreproachable. To be fair, the film addresses this issue towards the end, with Wilson's rather current speech about the US's inability to clean up, but it's done in such a tertiary manner that the average viewer will probably not take not much . The general impression will be that these three personalities helped the Afghans to defeat the Soviets. Note that this is not a fatal inconvenience, but that it is a disturbing aspect of an otherwise brilliant film. <br /> <br /> The talent of the film is remarkable. The legendary Mike Nichols produces a smooth and beautiful production. the material is perfectly suited to his sober and ironic director style. Sorkin offers yet another brilliant scenario. the film contains dozens of quoted replicas and classic Sorkin exchanges (the best being the discussion of "the Scottish bottle" between Wilson and Avrakotos), and retains a political and historical perspective. The cast of the movie is a marvel: Tom Hanks gives a great performance as a friendly thief defending a cause, Julia Roberts is in turn charming and disgusting as Joanne, naive but committed, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene (as of habit) like Gus. The always-charming Amy Adams takes a step further on the path of fame as Wilson's long-serving assistant, Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott beef up the support cast. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is a smart and fun movie, a wonderful entertainment a bit more than light. The fact that he decides not to be more than that should not be held against him; it's brilliant what he does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
