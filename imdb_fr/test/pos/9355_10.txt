Crossfire is a fantastic black film, both product of the era and timeless classic. This film achieves this by addressing issues that were not brought to the screen before its release in 1947 and being a high-quality film that stands to this day with a good script, a superb look and fantastic performance. the part of its actors. The first American film to have tackled resolutely the issue of anti-Semitism, Crossfire has become a classic. After the end of the Second World War, the story unfolds after the discovery of a murdered Jewish man. <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic, its anti-hate theme is wrapped in a dark thriller policeman with multiple characters, Moreover, the angle of anti-Semitism is surrounded by major themes and dialogues of after war. Unlike other mystery thrillers, the public is almost immediately informed of the identity of the author. However, the film's story is always captivating because of the struggle of all the great characters involved to try to make sense of the situation. Apart from the big story and the big themes, the entire story is simply intelligent, with meaningful messages and extremely clear exchanges. <br /> <br /> The captivating story of the film is played wonderfully by the quality of its casting. Robert Young is fantastic as Captain Finlay, the lead investigator in the murder case. Finlay is my favorite character in the movie, he's just a cool character - dry as a bone and hard as a two-by-four and stopping at nothing to bring the murderer to justice. Robert Mitchum is also excellent in the film, very keen in his character as a sergeant with a soft voice because of his superb on-screen presence. Gloria Grahame gives a memorable performance in her small Oscar-nominated role; George Cooper is also doing a good job as Corporal Mitchell, sick and in distress; Paul Kelly gives a strange portrait of a strange character; and Steve Brodie, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White and William Phipps also offer strong support performances. Robert Ryan is the most discussed performer of the film, a frightening performance as a Montgomery and an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Crossfire has a fantastic look. Director Edward Dmytryk does an amazing job with the film's execution, and cinematographer J. Roy Hunt does a masterful job with his black-and-white image. Crossfire's painting is as dark as its themes, covered with shadow with a touch almost brilliant, but also very rough in places. Ironically, the beauty of the film is not the result of hard work or even intention. Dmytryk wanted to spend more time and money on actors than on lighting - that's what he did. Less light, less preparation (about 6 hours of work a day), which gave a fantastic movie. Crossfire is not only a well-made cinematographic work of art, but also an excellent example of a cheap film that leads to a rich classic.
