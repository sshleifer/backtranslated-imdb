This special Bravo show is one of the most entertaining things I've ever seen on TV. Unlike Me First & The Gimme Gimmes (the largest band in the world, Punk-Supergroup / Cover-Band), you really need the Dan Band to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> On paper, the Dan Band is Joke Act-guy singing girly songs and inserts a gratuitous profanation in his lyrics. If you listen to their Dan Band Live CD, that's all you'll get and it'll age quickly. (I only bought it because some of the songs were not on the special show.) But what made Dan Finnerty a cult hero in Hollywood is his incredible stage presence. This guy has his audience every second on the stage. And substitute singers also play an important role in the visual typing line. As for the current group, they remain largely out of sight, but are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical back office group. Hopefully a DVD version will be released soon. Some songs have been cut and although heavy censorship adds a bit of unintentional humor, it also suppresses INTENTIONAL humor. <br /> <br /> If it makes sense Around the world, Vegas casino owners will soon be arguing about who can build their own showroom faster. <br /> <br /> "Re ------- member my name ... FAME!"
