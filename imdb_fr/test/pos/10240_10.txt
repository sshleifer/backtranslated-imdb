It's interesting to see what people think of this movie because it's actually quite unique (although it carries some of Clive Barker's trademark writing). While it may sound a bit cynical to say it, the movie is just complicated enough to distract those who need standard Hollywood hooks, and layered, so that if you expect to be fed, you'll see a normal monster movie with a lot of monsters and a rambling plot. <br /> <br /> Those who need a linear, specific and undetected plot will hate this movie, because the story rests, as in the new, partially between the lines, or in this case, partially off-screen , in comments and imagination. <br /> <br /> Another possible hanging is the end, which I can say, without spoiling it, that it is not quite good and quite bad. In fact, it's actually not very defined at all, which, I know, arouses lively emotions in some people who did not know what had happened, but for me, and for many others, I am sure, add another. dimension of the story - the dimension of speculation and, in addition, the fact that a large disturbance tends to cause ripples that extend far enough. <br /> <br /> There is a moral here, but a lot more than the standard Hollywood display at the end of the film. To sum up this morality is simple, even if it is not so simply posted; prejudices and the human tendency to hate the different. <br /> <br /> I like this film, even though, as many critics have noted, the actors' expressions (with the exception of David Cronenberg, who looks great) are rather sticky. I am not sure that they are entirely to blame for their wobbly appearance and lack of depth, however, as these are common problems when converting literature into a scenario. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie, as long as you do not think it's a standard horror movie.
