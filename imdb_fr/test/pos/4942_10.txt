This game is one of the main reasons I got a PS2. I remember playing Soul Edge (sometimes called Soul Blade) and I was hooked on it. <br /> <br /> I played the original Soul Calibur but I never had the chance to play it for a huge amount of time. However, I bought the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur II and that's what really made me addicted to the series and I was delighted when I heard about Soul Calibur III. This game still gives us classic characters such as Mitsurugi, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. However, he also adds several new characters such as Zasalamel, Tira and the unimaginable Night Terror. (The true boss of Tales of Souls) The strategy based on the mode "Chronicles of the sword" is a new feature that I like very much, it can be quite difficult in the last chronicles but it is a good addition to the series. <br /> <br /> Soul Arena mode has several missions in which you must fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances. (The exception is "Final Battle" in which you simply have to defeat Night Terror). It's an extra touch that makes the game even more fun. <br /> <br /> In some scenes of Tales of If you will have to press some buttons to get a different result, it may be to dodge / block an attack or to get a better ending. (Each character has two purposes) In short, it's an excellent game and I would recommend it if you are a fan of fighting games.
