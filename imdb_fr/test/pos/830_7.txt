I liked that. Here, I repeat. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it many times. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer movies like this one to garbage like Die Hard 4, which resists box office and gets rave reviews simply because you have an old man who saves America. Van Damme moves well for a guy his age (47 years I think), offering kicks reminiscent of Kickboxer. If you like old-fashioned action and explosions, this is the movie to watch. This is one of Van Damme's best works. <br /> <br /> The films of Van Damme and Steven Seagal are theatrically released in my hometown, which allows me to never miss an opportunity to watch our old school stars on the big screen.
