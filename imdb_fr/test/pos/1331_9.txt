The film can certainly be a narrative medium, but it is by no means the ideal medium. Literature is better intriguing because the reader can provide the necessary imagination to complete the structure. The film is best appreciated when seen for what it is: a series of images grouped together. In Ocean's Twelve, Soderbergh combines flawless film-making technique with the fluid form of 1970s American films. Looking at the recently published commentary, most people have been waiting for a standard scrap movie, at the trap; it seems that the glitzy clichés of romance disguised as tensions between the protagonists and ridiculous twists designed to prevent the public from staying awake are lacking clichés. Soderbergh's prowess as a director is only reason to see this film, but the close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones at forty feet on the screen do not hurt either. A real treat for those who love the flickering lights on the big screen and a disappointment for those who are trying to make the movie something that it is not.
