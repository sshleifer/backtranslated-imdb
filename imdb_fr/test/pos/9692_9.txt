First, I want to say that most people who give a bad review do not like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and are not afraid to laugh at stupid things . <Br /> <br /> This film is shot as a TV show with a lot of short clips compiled into a long movie. Some scenes do not even have dialogue, someone will just go out and do something unexpected and it's funny !! The only negative thing I had was that I felt like I was wasting money on my Popcorn and Icee; Honestly, I was nervous about drinking an Icee and seeing something that made me laugh and film it everywhere. <br /> <br /> If you are not afraid of male nudity and you like to enjoy the Jackass movie, then the TV show and live the bam, then for YOUR SACRED, see this movie. <br /> <br /> And if you do not like the first movie, or the TV show. Do not see it, and if you see it, do not post a bad review about it. Hardcore Christians who see this and criticize it do not seem right to me.
