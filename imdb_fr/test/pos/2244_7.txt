Age of Steel follows the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects, but not in others. RotC had some positive elements, the most important being the excellent portrait of the Doctor by Tennant. In fact, his kind of stupid vertigo carries, for this writer, the shadow of Dr. Tom Baker, with his subconscious side (as when ticking periods of time when Mickey holds the button pressed into the Tardis), but leaves his own distant face. the superiority of McCoy's doctor by letting the events unfold around him. Some critics and fans whose texts I have read seem a little appalled to see such a young actor portray someone who must now be over 1000 years old, but I disagree. Tennant's doctor "actually supports the weight of the world on his shoulders", as he points out in this episode, and we can see it in his almost blissful characterization, as when he finally faces Lumic / The Cybercontroller at its peak. His weary-world attitude and suspicious in the eyes "another manic attitude" is refreshing, especially after the excellent pseudo-worker interpretation, bada ** of Eccleston's character, plus the man of action that pseudo Tennant's fresh-faced doofus. Perhaps Tennant's best moment is after the end when he restores the Tardis with Baker's big clumsy smile as the Tardis restarts. Here we begin to get an idea of ​​this new doctor, a character who is little more than the different facets of the personality of the average person, divided into 13 different people; some are contradictory, some more sympathetic than others, but all part of a whole. Apart from that, both episodes were passable, but weak. The concept of Cybermen revival is very well received, and they look fantastic, but the plot involving a parallel Earth where this action takes place does not seem to work properly. It is true that the claim that humans use technology and their need to serve it, as the Doctor points out, is remarkable, but it could easily have been placed on or around the contemporary Earth. As others have already pointed out, some other weak points are the ease with which the doctor and society manage to cope, namely. the ray of death of the Tardis component, the seemingly infinite number of uses of the sonic screwdriver (my wife laughed when they used it to engrave through the rope ladder at the end; she barely looked at Who, j So I had to explain it was traditionally used as a means of intrigue to extract the characters from situations in which there is no other loophole (used here sadly) .Some actors were missing, especially Mickey, who really needed his due, as well as some actors.Lumic was scary, as he needed it, his voice resonated even like Cyberman-esquire.The score was awful, however, the volume of music often flooding the stage. I found Rise of the Cyberman more entertaining, even though the second half was passable The buildup of what we knew to be inevitable is playing well, but the resolution has been disappointing. bables, no distribution support development, and not enough Tennant in my opinion. This new show is exceptional and Davies takes it in the right direction, but the dialogue (beyond the doctor) must be strengthened, as illustrated by Mickey's farewells, which were pure ham.
