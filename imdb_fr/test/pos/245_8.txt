Rita Hayworth is exactly where she should be - as a "cover girl" in this 1944 Technicolor film starring Gene Kelly, Phil Silvers, Eve Arden, Lee Bowman and Otto Kruger. Rita plays a beautiful show girl, Rusty, working in a small club owned by the man she loves, Danny (Kelly). Every Friday, they go out for oysters with Genius (Silvers), the comedian of the club. They hate all oysters, but they look for a pearl. When they find one, they will all be lucky, they believe. <br /> <br /> Rusty auditioned and won the role of cover-girl for a magazine - she started in front of the other candidates because the magazine's owner (Kruger) sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved , who turns out to be Rusty's grandmother. Once she becomes the cover girl, the world opens and she realizes her dream of making an appearance on Broadway. Danny wants her to be successful, but realizes at the same time that he has lost her. <br /> <br /> "Cover Girl" features exuberant dance acts and songs by Jerome Kern, with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears. Rita is at her best playing with both Rusty in the present and with her grandmother in the past. For a woman so sexy, desirable and beautiful, she was apparently very unsure of herself and always remained under the thumb of domineering men. None of this was ever shown on the screen, nor the fact that she did not want to be a movie star. She is one of the true goddesses and gave life to everything she did. Gene Kelly plays a serious role here, but has many opportunities to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very kind and funny as a comic and best friend of the house. <br /> <br /> It's a very good film without any dull spots. The only problem I had was the idea that Rusty had to choose between a successful career and the man she loves. When the model Jinx Falkenberg, who plays herself in the film, talks about getting married, her boss tells her not to do it, she is too necessary for modeling. We're not told if Rusty is pursuing her career or returning to work at Danny's - but all indications are that the Brooklyn Club has been created. Why could not she have both? Nevertheless, you can not beat Cover Girl for her exceptional entertainment, gorgeous colors, charming music, high energy, outstanding performance and her most fabulous asset, the glorious Rita Hayworth.
