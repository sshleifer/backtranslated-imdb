It's a bizarre quirk, made by the guy who edited "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Chuck Conners gives an hilarious performance out of the ordinary as the owner of a roadside wax museum near which our failing teenagers fall. The wax figures look "so real," says one of the teenagers. Heh, heh, heh ... It's not so much a slasher film as a strange mixture of psychological horror and old-fashioned terror "House of Wax". I can think of many, many horror movies that are worse than this one.
