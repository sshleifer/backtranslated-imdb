Brilliant thriller, deserving much more glory, Mitchum and Ryan are brilliant in their main roles, as well as all the actors. A truly striking black film, with wonderful images and a wonderful dialogue. At the heart of all this is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel about homophobia, this film tackles the post-war anti-emitism and all intolerance and hate with considerable power. Although some parts may seem a little bland to the modern audience, they still have the power to shock and work very well as a thriller in their own right. A credit to everyone involved.
