To say that I did not expect much to attend "The Couch Trip" is a euphemism. I had no idea what it was. I thought it would be a sex trip when I heard Chevy Chase play the condom man and the title of the movie was referring to the word "trip sofa", wink, wink 'eye *. Then I realized that it had something to do with a psychiatric institute and a fugitive patient. My expectations dropped even lower. <br /> <br /> I was literally expecting a grumpy movie - the kind where you smile once and go out with a sense of fraud. And in a way, it's an inexpensive comedy - it does not have the biggest gags, the plot is ridiculous, but you know what? I had a big silly smile all the time I was watching. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient in a mental hospital who may or may not be mental. He gives the psychiatrist Lawrence Baird (David Clennon) a lot of grief and misery, which leads us to believe that he is a sensible man after all. <br /> <br /> After a small riot in the psychiatric institute In the cafeteria, Burns is waiting for Baird's answer in his office when the phone rings. Burns detects it, pretends to be Baird and discovers that the caller on the other line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the real Dr. Baird to replace a pseudonym radio named George Maitlin (Charles Grodin), takes vacation with his wife, Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels is so keen on Baird that he has even booked a plane ticket. <br /> <br /> Burns escapes from the institute with the help of a receptionist and goes to O'Hare. He gets Dr. Baird's ticket, gets on the plane and ends up posing in the air as Dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. "People love it!" One of the men says, and the other responds: "It's because he cares about them." <br /> <br /> Donald Becker (the late great Walter Matthau) is a former mentally ill patient who recognizes Burns' clothes. be pants and containment shirts. To keep it quiet, Burns promises Becker a percentage of his income. The secret is kept secret. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Maitlin and his wife argue. He goes home to end his vacation and realizes that the man on his talk show is not Dr. Baird, after all, but nobody believes him. He has the real Dr. Baird, but unfortunately, he lost his ID, so the police take them for bullshit and do not listen to their story. <br /> <br /> Let me quote some of the holes in the plot I noticed while watching this movie: Burns masquerades as Dr. Baird, but he's never asked for his ID, even when he claims his plane ticket (he was stolen, he says, but they would still make sure he's Baird). If Burns gets so famous, how come true Dr. Baird from Chicago has never heard of him? Word trip. And finally, why would the police ever stop Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird) without following up on their stories? <br /> <br /> To be honest, I do not care. I entered this film with a closed mind and it surprised me - I really liked it. It amused me. His ideas are essentially ridiculous and not at all realistic, but Dan Aykroyd gives a really spirited show like a half-dive that makes "The Couch Trip" a worthwhile trip. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
