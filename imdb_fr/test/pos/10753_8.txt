This film took me by surprise. For years, I avoided many of Harold Lloyd's (and Keaton's) sound images because they generally have a well-deserved reputation for being mediocre compared to silent movies because the basic formula has been lost. However, when I saw this film, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really loved it ... once I accepted, it was really not a film of "Harold Lloyd" (despite his presence in this film). Indeed, although it does not look anything like the style of his previous films, it's very original and Lloyd is not bad to play a type of totally different character. <br /> <br /> As I said above, the formula of old movies are almost completely missing here. Lloyd does not do the usual work of cascade, the romance is quite different from that of his first novels on the screen and the plot is just weird! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time since childhood. For this reason, although he looks like an American (with the exception of his white suit and his explorer's helmet), he thinks and acts a lot like a Chinese. In many ways, he is very naive about America and looks like an innocent among wolves. Early on, he meets a man who turns out to be a local party leader. This boss ALWAYS produces a misplaced candidate for the mayoral race - because he is bought and paid by the corrupt mayor to produce a "symbolic" candidate who has NO CHANCE to win. Well, the old man they traditionally run for the job just died and he decides to lead the naive Lloyd - he has not the slightest prayer to win! Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins !!! This, and Lloyd's decision to clean up the city drastically upset the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy the honest Lloyd. Just when it seems that Lloyd is about to be imprisoned for corruption, he creates a 100% impossible and very illegal ploy to obtain confessions signed by crooks. However, despite this, it's incredibly funny and an excellent ending. So, my advice is at the end, just suspend disbelief and enjoy. <br /> <br /> An important remark: this film is certainly NOT politically correct. The word "Chink" is used repeatedly. I found it offensive but given the weather, I did not know it as you should too. If, however, you are someone who CAN NOT and you like being angry, I suggest you never watch any movies anyway because you may feel offended again and again.
