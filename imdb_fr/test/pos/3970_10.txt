Accepted is one of the best teen comedies I've seen in a long time. It has an original storyline, a talented cast and offers an hour and a half of pure flawless entertainment. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby "B" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in all the collages he asked for, so he creates a fictional collage for avoid the disappointment of his parents. In order to completely deceive his parents, he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school. Everything is going well until many other "accepted" students come to his door. Now, he and his friend must understand this type of collage, not only for themselves, but for others as well. <br /> <br /> Justin Long, as the main man, is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as possible and the accompaniment numbers are remarkable - Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Columbus as hands, Maria Thayer like Rory, Adam Herschman as Glen and Lewis Black as an uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> The humor is fresh and simple and, more importantly funny, from the beginning to the end of the credits. The plot develops so easily that by the time you stop laughing at the latest joke, you start snickering. In addition to all the entertainment, the film draws our attention to a very common subject, namely collage education. While film students are generally united against the government of the school, they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learn. <br /> <br /> Yet the film does not mark all the other schools as fake, it just shows that there is another way. You say what they say "If there is a will, there is a way, and sometimes children may know better what they need than their parents." <br /> <br /> This movie is a little story not to be missed about the great opportunities life in the best format possible.
