The problem with the movie is simply this: Conrad's prose is powerfully verbose and can not be adapted to a movie. Marlow's narration in the news captivates you from the first sentence and you "see" only what Conrad writes. In the film, it's different, you see the visual, but the description and reflection that really make the novel are missing terribly. But to the extent that an unsuitable book has been adapted, it is of good quality. There are exactly the same scenes, which are spotted with enough genius, but they never have the same effect as in the novel. The plot in the movie has been improved and it works very well to make it more interesting. References to ancient Egypt have been judiciously inserted. My advice, read the book and keep it up, there are better movies.
