This film has everything! He has a good script, good acting, great landscapes, adventure and brilliant gags! Chris Farley plays the role of Tommy Callaghanhe in the successful company "Callaghan Auto Parts" must take the road to prevent the company from sinking after the death of Big Tom. The problem is that Tommy knows nothing of the bumpers and needs the help of Richard (David Spade), a worker at Callaghan Auto Parts. From the moment the two dorks hit the road, the movie is so much fun. If you like awesome movies with a nice plot, you'll love that, because the gags continue to thicken and the film will just make you laugh! Farley's untimely death in 1997 was so sad, but the merit of his genius is "Tommy Boy". Get it, relax and enjoy this brilliant burger!
