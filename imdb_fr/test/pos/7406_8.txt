This film was my first encounter with the talents of Chris Cooper. I was deeply impressed by the character he played. When I saw the movie, I knew that this talented actor had to bring great things. He plays the role of a Union captain who, with some men, is looking for food in eastern Kentucky. They occur on the farm of a "Sesech" woman whose husband has chosen to leave for Confederation. <br /> <br /> The portrait of Eastern Kentucky and his deeply divided feelings during the war are very precise. If you are looking for a war movie with a lot of blood and guts, that would not be it. If you're looking for a drama that explores the psychology of war-torn peoples, in fact and philosophically, it's the best study of how divided loyalties affected people's interactions in border states during the American civil war.
