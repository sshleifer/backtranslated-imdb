An astronaut loses himself in the depths of space and finds himself crossing an unknown territory aboard a living spaceship accompanied by a group of extraterrestrial outlaws. This incredible and enjoyable TV program is presented as a positive birth fantasy. The individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, must learn to get along with each other and evolve to form a powerful group. Most of the action takes place in the womb of Moia, the vital spaceship (which even falls pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). While sci-fi stories are generally interested in negative birth fantasies (watch the "Alien" movies for example, especially the fourth part "Resurrection"), this is a surprise. The absence of a military hierarchy aboard the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human (and foreign) body are equally pleasing. One of the female characters that is actually a plant experiences "photogas" while being exposed to the sun. The crew must even go to the toilet. Would not that be impossible in 'Star Trek'?
