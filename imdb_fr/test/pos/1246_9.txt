I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, there was a lack of respect throughout the film, but Bruce Willis learned from The Kid that it was more helpful to respect others and that his life of disrespect would change. This film was a refreshing change from the basket that Hollywood tries to push us to the throat. There are some very good lessons to learn in this movie. I really believe it was one of Disney's best records, although some things could have been left out. I was impressed by the lack of swear words and the lack of sexual inuendos. It's not perfect, but much better than most other products.
