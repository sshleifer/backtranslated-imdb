It's a good movie. I read the short synopsis and was impressed, but looking at it (mainly for Caroline Dhavernas), it grew. <br /> <br /> It's a nice change to see a movie where girls / young women are not punished for their sexuality. Girls get a full license to explore and even the possibility of making mistakes without silly repercussions. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are absolutely hilarious - and many of them are supposed to be erotic - without being exaggerated. or unpleasant. The male characters in the movie were brilliant - David Boreanaz was awesome as a fickle piece - and what's great is that the movie does not make us hate it too much. The other two younger male characters were good too, without being domineering. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best films I've seen that has made girls grow up and lets them see how they realize their mistakes. but end up living and continuing their lives rather than dragging their mistakes with them.
