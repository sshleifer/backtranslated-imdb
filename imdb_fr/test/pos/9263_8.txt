In truth, it's not really a "film", but an extended final episode; I mean, if you did NOT follow the TV show (Homicide: Life On The Street), I suspect you would have a hard time keeping up with that movie made for television. That said, "Homicide: The Movie" is still an excellent watch. I think that says a lot about a TV production in which EVERY single actor would return, several years after years of absence, to represent his characters again and put an end to an incredible show. The film brings out this sense of "family", not only among the characters, but also among the actors. It is very bitter and sweet to know that this will be the last time we will see them together again under the title of HOMICIDE. In terms of history, I found this film a little missing. The candidacy for Giardello mayor seems particularly artificial, and I thought that his shooting could have been settled in the parameters of his usual post, as Leiutenant. Also, Det. Bayliss's extreme scenario, left unresolved at the end of the series, is finally resolved, but I have NEVER felt it necessary to do so; I liked to stay with a mystery (remember that the first case of the first episode also remained unsolved for the whole series!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series, I can love this movie and the fact that it was even made after H: LOTS was canceled, but I would not recommend it to anyone who did not have any exposure to Series. Now, if they released it on DVD ...
