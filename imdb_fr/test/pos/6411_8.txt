In the middle of the hole, I sent an email to a friend of mine to summarize. Not sure that the film breaks down into a series of submissive gestures, I felt a little hard to recommend, but then I saw the end. It's perfect. It's been six months since I live in Korea, and this film could just as easily summarize the strange boredom and frustration of any Asian metropolis as it is here. He uses the myth of Hong Kong musicals in the same way that Godard or Hartley uses Western musicals, but in the extreme, it is a rocky world and, on occasion, a kafka-esquire logic makes everything it's even better. I really feel like the closest comparison to The Hole, it's Hal Hartley's Surviving Desire, but I'm a little dark in the face of what are hopefully metaphorically hopeful movies. In any case, that's what I wrote to Esther. I hope you like the hole too. <br /> <br /> Hey, <br /> <br /> watch a movement called the hole. I think the Taiwanese seems a bit strange to China unless it's Hong Kong. it's worth seeing so far. this is a guy and a girl in an apartment complex. the guy's ceiling collapses and the girl starts to get angry and it's a strange metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure, degradation and pain of a rather intense crush. there is also some kind of zombie-virus sub-intrigue too and a lot of little strange scenes where the girl responds to her desires through rather innocent and rather amusing doo-wop sequences from the 50's. worth a look .
