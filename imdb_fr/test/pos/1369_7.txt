My friends and I spent the majority of Saturday afternoons watching a selection of "bad" movies. Of the films we watched, the strongest competitor (for the premium movie price) was easily Jack-O. It is ridiculous that such films as "Gigli", "Glitter" and "You Got Served" appear in the bottom 100 of IMDB. If they are definitely bad movies, they do not belong to the bottom 100. They steal "Jack -O", and "the guardian of time", etc., from the poor quality of film they deserve so richly. <br /> <br /> What makes Jack-O so great (in terms of bad film)? To begin with, Steve Latshaw, the director, decided to play his son, Ryan Latshaw, in the role of Sean Kelly. Unfortunately for Steve, Ryan Latshaw was dangerously about to be overtaken by a block of wood. The kid, seriously, has no ability to move. The end result: involuntary comic gold. The kid might be listening to a joke or just a few moments to get his head smashed, and his expression is a "ruthless impassivity". <br /> <br /> The other aspect of the film that we found awesome was the large number of "double dream" sequences. What is a double dream? Well, it's when a character awakens from a nightmare and then there's an equally nightmarish event, and then he wakes up again. Basically: they wake up after dreaming of waking up from a nightmare. Smart device, no? I believe that the character of Sean Kelly has lived no less than 3 sequences of double dreams. <br /> <br /> Let's see ... what else? Oh yes! This film has a real distribution of thousands. It's really amazing to see how many speaking roles are introduced during the film. Best of all: almost none of the characters have anything to do with history. They are either killed by Jack-O or they are useless. <br /> <br /> Jack-O himself was kind of nice. Like most other B-movie monsters, Jack-O has the incredible ability to teleport over long distances. It invariably hangs somewhere in the background whenever you are dealing with a major character. What is amazing, however, is that when he chases someone, he moves at a bewildering speed and manages to keep pace with the riders. <br /> <br /> That's all for the moment. Closing remarks: If you are looking for a bad movie that is unintentionally hilarious, you can not go wrong with praising this beast. <br /> <br /> Bad movie score: 7/10 Good movie: 3.5 / 10
