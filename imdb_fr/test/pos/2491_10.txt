To think that this film was made the year of my birth. To think that constitutional rights have always been removed from people, in the name of "internal security". To think that this film was intentionally banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK solves the political cleavage in the United States better than any movie I have ever seen. If it had been seen more widely, would it have changed something? A film like this is so polarizing that it has the potential to provoke riots. It shakes you and forces you to take sides. You are faced with the problem: are you for the right to dissent from the people in time of war or for the constitution that is compromised in the name of "national security"? The government forces the protagonists to fight for the American flag in a game that undermines the very ideals of the flag. The acting is totally convincing. So much so that I do not see any play here. If it's a scripted documentary, it's more convincing than any reality TV show on television today. PUNISHMENT PARK is perhaps the most important film ever made. It really makes you think.
