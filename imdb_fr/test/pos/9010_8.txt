It's so funny and cool.Kuzco is such a hilarious and interesting character, I love him.It's what makes this show what it is, even though Kronk and Yzma are also funny and charming.All this topic show is great for me because it always manages to make me laugh, no matter if only once an episode. It's so funny shit on the Disney channel. Try this show the next time it's turned on, if you've seen the movie and even if you have not seen it, you'll find it very enjoyable, so go ahead.
