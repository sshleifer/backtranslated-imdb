Quick summary of the book: Billy Tepper, a boy of about 12, is the main troublemaker at the school. If he gets fired from one more school, he will be sent to boarding school. His upscale boy school in Switzerland (or elsewhere) is supported by Arab terrorists, so I'm not really sure about that. Billy has no friends and likes to use his laptop to hack his school's database. With the help of two teachers, he thwarts the plans of the terrorists and saves the whole school. The book was not bad, but was so clich√©. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie; they replaced the Arab terrorists with Cuban terrorists and passed Billy about 17 years old and the leader of his group of friends. They like to get in trouble, but normal stuff for teenagers. This film was credible. Maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. You can watch Billy, Joey and the rest of the guys and see real kids behave the way they did (or at least want to). <br /> <br /> Beautiful action scenes. Everything is not going as planned on both sides. Reversing the terrorists was complicated, and the good guys were hurt. I will not say who, but it's heartbreaking (I know, I use that word a lot). Sean Astin is excellent. As a teenager, he usually played dopey's best friend. This film proved once again that he could play the main role, child, whatever. Wil Wheaton played the only son of a man in the New Jersey Mafia. He hated his father and all he was defending. (A bit far from Wesley Crusher) Usually, this kind of movie is the one I watch with the purpose of making fun of; but not Toy Soldiers. The frame is flowing, the dialogue is generally credible. I can not think of a single moment when I found myself screaming on TV "Oh, that would not happen that way" This is an excellent movie that should be in everyone's collection.
