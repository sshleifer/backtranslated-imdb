Lucio Fulci's Cat in the Brain is an inventive and somewhat selfish narrative of the decent director in madness. The director in question is Fulci himself, who plays the lead role in the film. Around the world, Fulci is known as the "godfather of gore" for a good reason because he has provided us with some of the most wicked and horrible movies that have ever been on the screen; from eye violence in films like "Zombi 2" to a man beaten to death with chains in "The Beyond" to the "gore" festival called "The New York Ripper"; if you want gore (and let's face it, who does not have it), Fulci is your man. However, all of these gorehound attractions like you and me have had a bad effect on Fulci's mental state, which has quickly sank into madness because of what he's filming. Fulci's problems do not stop at his mental state either, because his psychiatrist he consulted to solve his problem decided to assume the murder as a hobby, using Fulci's films as models for murders! <br /> <br /> I must say that playing in this film is absolutely atrocious. There is one scene in particular that involves a prostitute, and it's just worthy of laughter, both for acting and for stupidity. Fulci takes the main role of the film (obviously). He's not an actor, and it shows, but his performance is actually the best of the film. It is even safe to say that, overall, the acting is bad for an Italian horror film. Of course, nobody enters an Italian horror that expects to play well, so it's a little forgivable, but I think Fulci could have hired better. A bad copy does not help either. However, the fact that the terrible acting game is counterbalanced by a lot of gore is something that helps, and this is to say the least extreme! People get their heads cut off, a woman is killed in the shower (and unlike Psycho, we REALLY see her), people are chopped, fed on pigs and there is plenty of the best melee weapon in the cinema - the Chainsaw exposed, which delighted me endlessly. The amount of blood is often excessive, which gives the film a "parody" feel, but Cat in the Brain is obviously a language in the film of the cheek. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to make a film about yourself and not feel like you have a big head, and Fulci actually appears like a big head in this movie. His name is often mentioned and he spends almost all the time on the screen. it's not much different from "New Nightmare" in the ego, but obviously he had a good time doing it, and I had fun watching it, so we could forgive him a little egotism. The end of the film drops - I saw it coming one kilometer, but I did not really think that the film would take that path, but I was wrong. he did it, unfortunately. The end has left me cold, and the movie is a better watch if you turn it off just before the last two minutes. However, despite its end and its appalling game, Cat in the Brain is very fun and will delight fans of Fulci. It is therefore recommended.
