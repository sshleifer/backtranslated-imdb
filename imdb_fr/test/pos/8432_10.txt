A very politically charged drama that, although biased, is extremely well-managed and one of the most intelligent films ever made. It contains almost no preaching, but rather follows a naive television reporter who gradually realizes the threat posed by nuclear power plants, not because of an inherent danger, but because the suppliers are more interested in the end result only by the security of these. affected. <br /> <br /> Many hated the film because they saw it as a political tract created by ultra-liberals like Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if you consider it simply a drama, it is captivating, exciting, full of well-developed distinctive characters and, ultimately, a thrilling contemporary thriller that strikes near home. <br /> <br /> Historical Note: For some, especially those in the energy sector and the residents of the Harrisburg subway, PA The area may have been affected a little too close to home, less One week after the release of this film, the devastating explosion at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility occurred. <br /> <br /> Update, 04/08/2007: In almost a decade since I wrote this review, I've heard a lot of comments about the movie. One thing that, in my opinion, deserves to be underlined is that this film is not the "ultra-liberal" anti-nuclear tirade that it is often labeled. <br /> <br /> While the producers and stars are (or were) notable Liberals of the "Hollywood group", this film does not attack the very idea of ​​nuclear energy, but rather the idea of human greed, corruption and fallibility, which calls into question the potential dangers of something that nature has already made dangerous. <br /> <br /> A person who does not accept reality can not claim that the exposure of human beings to nuclear radiation is at least likely to be fatal. Close friends, who had been working at a nuclear power plant for several years, even told me about their employer's official policy regarding the maximum "safe" exposure levels their employees could handle. <br /> <br /> You do not have to believe. that businesses are inherently bad in order to accept that individuals, in search of wealth and power, are greedy and often corrupt. And even if you refute this claim, you can not deny that all humans are prone to making mistakes. When it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation, we can not afford any mistakes, and that's the argument this film is trying to make. <br /> <br /> Condemn it if necessary, but try to get some perspective. We are currently engaged in a war whose current results are very different from those originally intended, an extremely costly and endless war in sight. And whether or not you think war was needed to fight global terrorism, you can not dispute the fact that the length, the financial cost and, above all, the loss of life have far exceeded the levels that In 2003, therefore, even if nobody is greedy or corrupt, "mistakes were made", as well as errors of a rather large scale, moreover. The same type of serious errors, if allowed in the nuclear industry, could make much of the Earth's surface uninhabitable.
