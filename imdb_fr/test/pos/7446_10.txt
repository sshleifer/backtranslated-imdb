Square has really landed this one. They have not tried to please everyone and have focused exclusively on the fans of Final Fantasy 7. And then, will these fans be happy when they see this movie! The story may not be very interesting or credible, but it is perfectly related to the story of the game and includes several fun moments worthy of honor to God! A total surprise and a welcome too. <br /> <br /> There are also a lot of cameos and fun references to the game. And most important of all: battle scenes are so hard to cut through the diamond! They are really total awesomeness and would have been worth the movie even if everything else was nil I mean, they are part of the best times ever created. <br /> <br /> See this movie. Goodbye. <br /> <br /> PS: I know that my criticism resembles the madness of a teenager. It was, exactly, what I wanted.
