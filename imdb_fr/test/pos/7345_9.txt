This film addresses the topics of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a smart, clever, sensitive and visually stunning way that I have been completely transported. It is a rare gem of a film in that it honors beauty and women. You will have to see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully describes the subtleties of a remarkable personality, even a little broken, in a way that every woman will understand. I found that the honesty of the emotional interactions between the characters was very refreshing and deeply engaging. Nothing in this film told me "low budget" in terms of quality. Nothing. The fact that it is a low-budget film is a tribute to the creators of the film. The final sequence of the credits will also make you lose your mind. It's a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and inspiring.
