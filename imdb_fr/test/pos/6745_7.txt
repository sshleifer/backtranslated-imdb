(Some spoilers) A killer who does not kill with a weapon or knife, but only with his, or touch or breath, settles in New York in a first class railway car. A killer as old or even older than the man himself. This killer has a name known around the world as being smallpox. <br /> <br /> Arrived in New York on a cold November afternoon, the killer hidden inside Sheila Bennet, Evelyn Keyes, and, like a Trojan, awaits the opportunity presents itself. Then, like a time bomb with its fuse, it explodes throughout the breath and breathing of the city. <br /> <br /> Sheila knows she is being followed by a US Customs officer who is on the line since returning to the United States from the Cuban island nation. After smuggling $ 50,000 worth of uncut illegal diamonds, she had to make sure to send them to her husband Matt, Charles Korvin, to be cut and sold to unsuspecting jewelers in the city. <br /> <br /> Sending diamonds in advance, Sheila knows she will not find them if caught. What she does not know is that Matt is about to have an affair with her younger sister Francie, Lola Albrght. Worse still, he plans to leave the city with the diamonds that leave him and Francie who holds the bag. <br /> <br /> Although we know from the beginning of Sheila's death, she does not really get to the top The first half of "The killer who harassed New York" is a suspense / criminal drama with US customs and New York police looking for stolen diamonds. As Sheila begins to get sick and begins to infect everyone she comes in contact with, the film reaches the stage of a massive panic in the street horror film. <br /> <br /> Police and customs officers, as well as members of the municipal police, race against time to find Sheila before she infects the entire city of New York with the deadly smallpox infection she carries. Sheila discovers by Matt's president, Willie Dennis, Jim Backus, that he quit his job as a disco pianist and that he had an affair with Francie shocked her to realize how bad it is. <br /> <br /> In confronting Francie in his apartment, it turns out that Matt not only stiffened Shelia, but also his sister. Which will later lead Francie, guilty of guilt, to commit suicide. Fleeing and not knowing that she is infected with smallpox, Sheila goes to her brother Sid (With Bissell), who runs a flop house on the Bowery, to find housing. It's only too late that Sheila and Sid discover that stolen diamonds are the last of her problems. Knowing she is dying, Sheila goes to the jeweler Arnold Moss's office, Art Smith, knowing that Matt's husband, who ended up beating the old man Moss in a bloody pulp, will be on the verge of revenge. <br /> <br /> A "true history" drama based on a true story, with a striking black-and-white photograph on the spot, makes this film a film about the horrors of the invisible and deadly smallpox raging on an unsuspecting audience that deserves to be watched.
