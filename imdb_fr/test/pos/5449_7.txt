I remember this movie which was very criticized by critics when it was new. Letterman and Leno themselves had objections. Letterman called it (paraphrasing) the biggest waste of film he had ever seen, and Leno opposed the mere representation of himself. But Letterman had John Michael Higgins as a guest on his show, so he seems to have taken nothing too personally. A DVD reissue, containing the opinions of the people involved, could be interesting, although I suspect that the days when the late-night wars left the captivated nations disappear and would not come back soon. <br /> <br /> I preferred the Letterman impersonation to Leno, but could never buy one or the other. They never went above caricature and I never accepted them as actors. By way of comparison: Paul Sorvino as Kissinger in Oliver Stone's "Nixon" comes to mind as an impersonation that might seem laughable in the first moments, but that seemed at least plausible after the first few moments. moments of distraction. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the series for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams' speech to Letterman was not as big as the entry of Alec Baldwin (and his quick exit) like Blake in Glengerry Glen Ross. <br /> <br /> They could have done more with Johnny's role in all this. I know he was mostly uninvolved in the events described in this movie, and most audiences will know his reputation, so Johnny Carson does not need to be introduced. But more context on why Dave and Jay and all comedians revere Johnny would have given this film the background it lacks to be a gossip movie. <br /> <br /> Assume I should read the book ... <br /> <Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson is unfortunately nothing more than Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I'll tell you what I saw either the Letterman show or the Leno show, all I want to do is open my Johnny DVDs Carson and see the real thing.
