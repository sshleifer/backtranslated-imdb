It must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. The kind of title that ruins a film because it evokes neither the plot nor the characters. Such a title flopped, even the French title is hardly better. Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve had to be enough to sell it. <br /> <br /> It's a long film that is well worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental history about a personal wife and her wealthy husband, a flight, a change of identity and an obsessive love. The plot here is actually very good and takes us on an unexpected journey. <br /> <br /> What works for and against the film is the focus on the relationship. This is an interesting study of how these plot developments unfold in a "real relationship" with these two people. Unfortunately, that's what ruins the film and ultimately makes it unsatisfactory. We like movies to have a real purpose, and that's missing here. <br /> <br /> In many of his films, Deneuve has become a canvas on which filmmakers can play their fantasies and this time it does not work as well. Messy, the fact that the director clearly wants Deneuve to be elected several times. Deneuve is an actress who always seems very thoughtful and thoughtful, so these attempts to make her seem like a spontaneous fall. <br /> <br /> Basically, the scenario had to be better elaborated before the shooting started, to make this film narrower, shorter and easier to achieve. But Truffaut did not crack, did he? So, it wanders a bit, but it's still interesting.
