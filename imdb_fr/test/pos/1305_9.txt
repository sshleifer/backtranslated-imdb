I saw this film in a branch of the Duane Reed pharmacy in New York on vacation, and it seemed a bit ridiculous. And of course, the principle is ridiculous beyond words, but it turned out to be a most enjoyable action movie for kids, as well as for their parents. <br /> <br /> Ricky Bernard (Jordan Garrett), 10 years old. has his head in the clouds most of the time, to the chagrin of his father (Larry Miller). As a member of his school's band, Ricky and his comrades go to a concert. Once again, Ricky "takes off" and suspects a criminal conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Assisted reluctantly by best friend Sashi, who is a fan of spicy sauce (what a strange device was the plot) and others that they are trying to solve to solve the mystery. Oh yes, and Ricky's skills: 1,000 hours of flight simulator experience is useful when he's called to save the day from the climax of the movie! It was good to see Eric Roberts and Mark Dacoscos play a role in a family film. And watching the interviews on DVD seems to have been a lot of fun for everyone. <br /> <br /> I really liked Junior Pilot; charming performances and good mood, funny plot and a real; feeling of joy and foolishness. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an entertaining family movie, you could do worse than buy this one.
