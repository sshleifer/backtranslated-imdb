I saw this movie yesterday and I can not stop thinking about it. I moved to Norway four months ago and I have been trying since to find the origin of the strange emptiness I felt. When I saw this film, I was struck by the brilliant snapshot of this company. Yes, all this is true !!! Me too, I found a good job with a good salary and I live with my Norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment in the city center. But until now, all the people I've met have left me that insipid, empty feeling I've never had before - that's the subject of this movie. Dinners where nothing to say, except comments without emotion, long silences, no stress, a frightening calm and smiles icy and pleasant. This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly made to Den Brysomme Mannen. See this movie !!!
