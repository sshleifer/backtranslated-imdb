If you get a little fun with the music of Pink Floyd, you'll love this movie. the score is completely pink Floyd and of course the drug element plays a major role in this film giving you doubts about life in the weakest moments. this film also touches the heart with the story of love and the people around you ... there is also a huge connection with the world around you with the environment of a personal island. This thing tells me that I need ten lines to summarize the movie but I'm done, that's all you get, that's why this movie is a 6.1 version, which is very annoying for any film with a score like this. take a look at requiem for a dream and the fountain ... scores just as good for our generation but overestimated
