This movie was really funny. People who expected to see an Oscar-worthy comedy should recover on their own. It was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, lines of intrigue, quotes of dialogues and slogans. A film is worth 10 if I bought the DVD or, in this case, the videotape, and that I saw it several times, and in this case, I laugh again. I have about 12 films in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half have nothing to do with the Oscars. Again, it was just a fun and light movie. I hope it comes out on DVD. I strongly suggest watching this movie if you're in the mood for a crazy comedy.
