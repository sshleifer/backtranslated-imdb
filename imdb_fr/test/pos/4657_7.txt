I had completely forgotten "Midnight Madness" until I found it while surfing on the BDMI. Now everything comes back to me ... <br /> <br /> It was one of Naughton's (and Fox's) first movies, and keen-eyed connoisseurs will also choose Kaplan (Henry from the TV channel). television "Alice"), Fiedler (he makes the voice of Piglet in the cartoons of "Winnie the Pooh") and Blocker (the son of Dan "Hoss" Blocker of "Bonanza" of television). <br /> <br /> But the two that stand out in my mind, there's Furst (from "Animal House") and the superdude himself - Eddie Deezen. Furst plays a villain this time and has one of the best scenes when he asks his father, "Why can not you accept me for who I am?" His father looks over his obese and neglected body and gives a simple answer in one word - "Yuck!" <br /> <br /> And Deezen ... well, it's a show in itself. In recent days, Jerry Lewis stumbles across the mini-golf pools, puts melon halves on his ears and eventually drops Maggie Roswell. My hero. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, it's a stupidity typical of the early 80's, with college students standing up after curfew and embarking on a city-wide scavenger hunt to prove which division of students is best on campus: jocks, nerds, rich kids, feminists or a group of just a few of each. <br /> <br /> Who wins? Regardless, you'll have a lot of fun watching the first Disney Pictures foray into the PG territory before creating Touchstone Pictures. <br /> <br /> Seven stars. Catch "Midnight Madness" as you can! <br /> <br /> Long live Leon!
