In 15 years of life, I've seen a lot of B-movies, and I have to say it was one of the best. Personally, I enjoyed real estate and intrigue, but it suffered from amateur play (although Adrienne Barbeau had a decent performance as Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms could not hold his role well enough to be considered good. The other performance that really suits the film is that of Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It starts with an enthusiastic real estate agent who takes an Asian couple through a house, only to find a dead girl in the show house shower. He progresses with detective speculation and introduces the main characters with reasonable grace. I think that for anyone who is laughing at the excessive tragedy offered by real estate agencies to the victims during the excessive bloody scenes, it's really a jewel ... XD Who am I kidding? It's not terrible, but it's worth watching if you're bored.
