Rather than go on the scene and make a realistic film about drug addiction in Windy City, contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go in the opposite direction and make his film look as artificial as possible, thus going against the fashion chosen by men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who made their photos around the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the film is based, said he despised him. One wonders what Preminger did and why did he make the film this way? <br /> <br /> The sets in the film are minimal enough to suggest a cartoon by Mr. Magoo. Louie, the drug salesman, is dressed to look like the kind of gangster that Mad magazine artists used to draw. Arnold Stang, a wonderful comedian, seems out of place in such a serious film, and his very appearance, topped with an exaggerated and oversized baseball cap, creates a laugh. Robert Strauss, another actor known for his humorous roles, is also out of place, his broad and strongly pudgy face, and his distribution of Runyonesque lines seem more appropriate for a Jerry Lewis film. In the face of all this, stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to prevent the audience from giggling. Sinatra is still nervous and manic, suggesting a man uncomfortable with himself, so quite appropriate for the role of an addict. Miss Novak, a plant and a sublime impasse, is friendly and seems to be the product of the cleverly dark shantytowns she honors in the film. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hardworking like Zosch crippled and cunning. It's never convincing, but the movie is not convincing either. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to anyone interested in a realistic description of the lives of drug addicts in America. Caligari sets alone make it incredible. Preminger was perhaps looking for a dream effect, because the cardboard backgrounds gave the procedure the surreal feeling of a nightmarish operetta, perhaps reminiscent of Preminger's debut in Vienna.
