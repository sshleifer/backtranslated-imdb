One of the most enjoyable aspects of watching a movie is getting lost in a movie. So that it is completely washed on you, so that you absorb it as it is and that you experiment it to the maximum. Whenever I see it, "The Egyptian" is such a movie. Over the years, this is an image that critics love to hate. Many have thrown darts on his vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the tone that the film brings, rather than its most obvious features. It is at the same time forbidding, distant, possibly dangerous; beware of what's in it! The haunting chords of music, seen on the 20th-Fox logo, introduce us to turquoise lettering titles from another world. <br /> <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It is as if we are descending into a vault of antiquity, in which could be found great treasures, mixed with uncertain uncertainties. (You could imagine Darryl Zanuck commanding: "Make it old!") Then, what dark and dramatic story unfolds, all on the same tone given at the beginning. <br /> <br /> From the Egyptian trilogy of the mid 50s to Hollywood ',' The Ten Commandments' described the severity of civilization, the phenomenal 'country of the Pharaohs', while' The Egyptian 'shows everything from mirage to tragedy that we can marvel. <br /> <No need to say more about the players here, but I think that with time, Bella Darvi is redeemed. What a perfect face for the role, straight out of a Symbolist painting. If her game does not please some, it could be argued that in her role of "courtesan" she is obviously better off in bed than yawning at a helpless helpless admirer. I think that Curtiz has captured with verve the penchant of his sadomasochistic relationship with the character of Edmund Purdom, censorship being what it was at the time. Sir Peter Ustinov, in his memoirs, was rather nice to "The Egyptian", writing that it was "as if we were getting lost in a huge set for" Aida. "I always adopted after his pronunciation of the word" beer (One of the film's historically accurate references: Egyptian beer is invented beer!) Henry Daniell, egads, what a perfect performance Gene Tierney, what a screen treasure Blessed DFZ for entrusting him with this "late" role Go Guys, do not be so hard on Victor Mature! He's a cheese-maker! Who has risen to be Pharaoh! It sounds like a particularly American opportunity. One of the best moments: John Carradine's existential observations on sands of time, and Purdom's comments about staying out of the sunset, if not the Grade A epic, what is it? <br /> <br /> Of course, with all the rest, the music is sublime and it is often noted that Alfred Newman t Bernard Herrmann have created one of the most fascinating scores of the screen, perfectly harmonious, but each theme is well developed, with a life of its own. Newman, pressed by time by the DFZ, called Herrmann, whom he could trust, to shoulder half the burden. <br /> <br /> Benny, not the easiest guy with which to work, obviously enough respected Newman inspirational music. They alternated the signals, an ingenious approach. Nothing prevents us from knowing who did what here, but Benny brings him an advantage, mysterious and impressive sounds. Alfred brings fullness, nostalgia, poignantness. Both are perfectly epic. Even seen on a tight TV draw, seeing the names of the two composers side by side in the main credits, what the ultra-wide anamorphic screen could comfortably accommodate, is a feeling of panic. <br /> <br /> Leon Shamroy, the Dean of CinemaScope, did not let us down here. The dark greens and gloomy shadows (probably distortions in all the dreaded TV draws I have seen over the years) perfectly accompany the multidimensional scenario (of the great Philip Dunne and WB veterinarian, Casey Robinson, whom Curtiz had to take away with him to 20). As it is remarkable that Shamroy, who was as much a film institution at Fox as Newman at the music, would film Cleopatra a few years later, but in the clearer and sharper images of Todd AO of the 60s. These old studio guys are really my heroes. <br /> <br /> For me, who wants to fear all the imperfections and opportunities of criticism in a photo like this one? I prefer to surrender entirely to its charm and dive into its ocean of sumptuousness to emerge after the inspiring culmination of "The End" refreshed, moved and hungry more. <br /> <br /> And yes, we should scream at 20th-Fox for a DVD release worthy of DFZ's legacy.
