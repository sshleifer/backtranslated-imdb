Chuck Jones' "Beep Beep" (so-called Road Runner "Meep Meep") is the second in Road Runner's exceptionally popular series and is a significant step forward from its predecessor, the Fast and Furry-ou . Although it has several predictable gags, "Beep Beep" also extends this first drawing with more ambitious and longer sequences. The leader among these is a fantastic, prolonged hunt in an old mine in which we see the Coyote and Road Runner represented by two small lights. There is also a longer gag and very fun with roller skates. 'Beep Beep' also sees a big improvement in the representation of Wile E. Coyote. Not only does he look nicer than his sullen prototype in "Fast and Furry-ou", but he also draws the audience into the cartoon with more glances at the camera to indicate the brilliance of his idea or his fear from impending pain. Even if the start is a little slow (too many long shots slow down the pace of the first gags), once 'Beep Beep' arrives at the sequence of the mine shaft, it is clear that Jones was beginning to master all that. characters and the greatest possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better caricatures of Road Runner than 'Beep Beep', but this caricature is a real triumph, as if it were the confirmation that there was a series to be drawn from this scenario.
