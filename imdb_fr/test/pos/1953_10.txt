Apparently, this movie was based on a true story. I am not sure of its accuracy. But it really reminded me how, when I see that someone was murdered on the news, it's amazing how much it does not affect me. Of course, I think it's terrible, but honestly, I do not care. I pass. It seems that murder is trivial now. That's what River's Edge shows. Nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the murderer. So, what is it for? <br /> <br /> The killer in this story is John, and for the vast amount of the film he hides with another killer named Feck, played by Dennis Hopper. Feck is older and you can see the generational gap. He says he loved the girl he killed. When he asks John if he likes the girl he killed, he simply says, "She was fine." The film seems to offer only one solution: life is more important than death. The life of a character is spared, people have a second chance and a desperate case is killed. <br /> <br /> The acting game is really good. After watching this film, I could only conclude that Crispin Glover was either a brilliant actor or a terrible actor. I still have no idea. It was however my main reason for seeing this movie. But the best performance is clearly given by Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> Even if the fashion is that of the 1980s and the characters sometimes evoke current issues, I still think that River's Edge is as relevant as ever. > <br /> My rating: 10/10
