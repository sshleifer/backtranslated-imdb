I love this film, first and foremost because Mark Wahlberg is there and then because the end justifies the means. There is something in this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all the emotions felt by the characters. Jen Aniston is great as a girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers have experienced in the day (maybe they have become a little smarter). It crosses a rainbow of emotions and has many subtle facets to let the light through. Like a diamond, this film shines. You will not lose your popcorn on this one. Half-chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too. There are also some bursts of laughter.
