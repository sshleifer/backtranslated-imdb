Red Skelton (in her first role) is played by Wally Benton, who plays The Fox on a radio show. He writes the mysteries of the murder and as "The Fox" solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) tries to find a way to commit the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Gray). He asks Benton to write the perfect murder ... or his girlfriends get it ... <br /> <br /> A very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and a perfect cast express all that. Skelton is very good in his first role - very funny, fast, handsome and smart. Veidt is excellent like the evil Jones. Rutherford and Gray are very entertaining as Skelton's girlfriends. All three are playing perfectly against each other - their verbal fight is the highlight of this photo. Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role. <br /> <br /> It's really worth it.
