I watch this film without great expectations, I think everyone should do it. This is an excellent TV series and of course we can not compare it to Gone With the Wind, but it's still nice to watch. It's also weird to see a different Scarlett. Joanne Whalley does not play Scarlett with passion or fire like Vivien Leigh, but I think Scarlett changed when she became older. Do not expect to look at it too much, but do not look like: I think it would be horrible.
