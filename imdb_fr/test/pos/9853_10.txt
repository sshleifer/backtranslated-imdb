In Sudan, the Arabs reign and are constantly at war with the Christians and animists who live in the southern part of this East African country. This film follows a group of Dinka boys, a tribe of shepherds, orphaned by the destruction of their village and the murder of their families in a brutal attack by the Arab forces. Most of these boys are now teenagers and have been dubbed "The Lost Boys". <br /> <br /> The filmmaker follows a group of "Lost Boys" throughout their journey, since they have been accepted as refugees in the United States. , where they will land in Houston. Those who have been accepted as refugees get celebrity status because they feel (from what they have heard) that America is incredible. Taking a trip from Sudan to America is like "taking a trip to paradise," says the only young man. A huge party is organized for their departure and they are told to do well Sudan and, once they have been educated, to return to Sudan to contribute to the Dinka society. They are also warned not to look like "those who wear baggy pants", which are responsible for the negative stereotype of black men and, whatever happens, not to forget the Dinka culture. <br /> <br /> Watch as the boys come from a third world country in America and how they are trying to integrate into American society, while they have moved from a place with virtually nothing to this abundant world where everything is massively overproduced and overconsumed. They learn about cleanliness and how to use all the public services we take for granted every day. It's sometimes funny, humiliating with others. <br /> <br /> Listening to their comments on Black Americans and American society / culture is very interesting. As the film progresses, you see how American culture begins to corrupt their humble way of thinking. <br /> <br /> One of the boys, Peter, does not just work and earn just enough to survive; moves from Houston to Kansas City so he can continue his education. When the other boys visit him, they explain that they can not enter any school. The main reason they came to America was their education and the media say the boys were taken from Sudan to be educated. This is because boys have had arbitrary ages, making them older than they really are, preventing them from enrolling in high school. <br /> <br /> The film juxtaposes images from Houston to Kansas. We see Peter enroll in school, where he befriends a group of Christian conservative children, and while Santiago is trying to drive a school (even if he drives without a driver's license anyway) and works at Walmart. We see Peter struggling with the school as he strives to train his basketball team and Santiago struggles to keep up with his work, his rent, ease the tension in Sudan and, most importantly, face to solitude. <Br /> <br /> The time has come when boys want to return to Sudan and tell them that everything they learn about America, there are lies. "You have to do it alone here, do it all alone," said one of the boys. A message overwhelming to a liberal capitalist lifestyle, showing how it leads people to become radical individualists (a trend that has led to the creation of neo-conservative and radical Islamist movements). Their biggest ox with America is that there is no time; time is money and we do not lose a second! In spite of all this, boys never lose their sense of Dinka culture. They celebrate South Sudan's Day of Liberation, marking the day the SPLA began fighting in Sudan, a fight that continues today. They also meet other "lost boys" on the anniversary of their arrival in America, where they discuss their experience in America regarding their return to Sudan. When asked, a boy said that if he could make a living, he would rather live in Sudan. He is far too lonely in America, he adds. They never lose their sense of community, which has conditioned them as part of their culture! <br /> <br /> This film makes us question our way of living, questions us about the artificial happiness that the materialism and the nature of our societies have created in us. It will also change the way I view refugees. I will never again take for granted the hard work they have to do and what immigrants represent for a country like mine, Canada. It's a beautiful movie. I laughed, I cried ... a very moving journey and a documentary very well done. 10 of 10.
