Watching this film provoked a rather emotional reaction. That's what documentaries are today. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen today and are incredibly well exposed here. It is a thin line of demarcation between personal truth and exploitation. This film works with great care and with great success. <br /> <br /> One might think that learning how an apparently normal couple does not meet the expectations of society would give rise to pessimism ... but that is not the case. On the contrary, it made me feel good. I think I know more about marriage now ... about women. <br /> <br /> Definitely, take a look, it will make you think - what exactly is a good documentary.
