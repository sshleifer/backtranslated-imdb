Sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells a story so much that it becomes almost difficult. This film tells so many stories simultaneously that it was the first time that I could not watch the movie until its end. It was too real ... and the characters so strong that watching it became a personal struggle. Seeing these three men and their families cope with their difficulties, one in particular, often hits me too hard. Now I have watched in full without interruption several times, and I realize what I have always suspected. This film is a masterpiece. The writing, the acting, the assembly of several stories without being in the least agitated, everything in this film is exceptional. Seven Oscars? No wonder he must have deserved them.
