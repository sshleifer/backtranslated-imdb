I saw this theater show when it aired on PBS in 1983. At the time, I was involved in a local theater and I had seen pretty incredible images on Dell Arte drives, but Bill Irwin let me down. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed by how a man of his size (big enough and strong) could fold into a small box without even pausing to adjust and move through the scene at full speed, without even a whisper. of his feet if he chooses not to make noise. <br /> <br /> What is most amazing to me is that during this performance, he stood up in this way when taking mat / piece puppet. Those who saw this show will remember that when he came out of the box and collapsed on the ground with his soft body and Akimbo limbs, he "tightened" by the top of his head like a string and does not have its feet, but at a point of complete ballet - and did it in a fluid movement, seemingly without effort. Just think of the strength, the grace, the balance and the concentration of such a series of movements to be able to accomplish them as he did! Add to his physical prowess his strong and credible characterization abilities, and here is an accomplished actor / performer. My jaw dropped to the point of movement and my heart broke in the face of a puppet who was determined to be more than a lifeless thing in a box. <br /> <br /> As for the unfortunate (yes ?? "tragic" would be a better word) the unavailability of this piece in the form of domestic media, I noticed that many works of PBS are not not available on cassette or DVD. Sometimes PBS issues can be bought directly from them for a limited time immediately after a broadcast, but they rarely stay on the market for long. Of course, there are exceptions, but these are mainly documentaries on science and history; it is rare for works of art to remain printed for long, assuming that they were first converted to VHS / DVD. I do not know why that should be so; While PBS could use home-based media marketing revenues from their programs, they do not benefit much. It's a shame. There are a lot of things I've watched on PBS that I want to own, but songs like "The Look of Flight" are, I'm afraid, a unique treat, unique in a lifetime, never be repeated on PBS again and never be available for home media buying. It's really bad. I'm lucky to have caught him when I did it. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, our local library received a copy of "The Regard of Flight". And yes, it was stolen.
