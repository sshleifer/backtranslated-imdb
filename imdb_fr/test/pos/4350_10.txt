Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another remarkable element of Werner Herzog's film work that is unparalleled. After having recently revisited it on DVD, almost ten years after its release in the United States in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and we can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as that of Herzog, recently recent, from Griogly Man and Errol Morris, The Fog Of War. Like the previous one, he describes, in his 74 minutes too short, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter, he gives a glimpse of the war that few people see. Yes, we see violence and heroism, but while The Fog Of War brought us into the mind of one of the greatest warmongers of the last century, this film allows us to take a look at the life of a grogner captured by the enemy, tortured, and finally triumphs. Except in any way, form or form, the film is as simplistic or optimistic as my brief description of it. Dieter Dengler, the titleholder of Little Dieter, and the German immigrant who survived the Nazi depredations (we learn for example that in his hometown, Wildburg, in the Black Forest, his grandfather was the only one to vote for Hitler, and suffered brutally for this position) after the Second World War in Germany and his own incarceration at the hands of the Vietcong, when his air force plane was shot down over Laos on 1 February 1966 ??. While the title of the film and the idea of ​​Dengler's passion for the profession of pilot, aroused by the impression that allied fighter jets did him when they razed his city, child, make believe that Dengler is the central subject of the film. it's not true. The subject is Dengler's survival, or more precisely his human will, all human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are also Hollywood and seemed to interest Herzog. Nor is it the fact that he won a Purple Heart, a Medal of Honor, a D.F.C. and a Navy Cross. This thing that drove Dengler to survive so much and to remain a relatively optimistic man (although there are glimpses of darker sides), is what is at the center of this film, and all of Herzog's canons. Dieter Dengler's "distant barbarian dream" of his past is fully matured in the Herzog country, and the use of a Malagasy song, Oay Lahy E, during many jungle scenes, among other excellent touches in the score, shows that Herzog is, perhaps with Martin Scorsese, the best manipulator of images and music in the cinema. Long live the merger!
