Third and last film entitled Female Prisoner Scorpion directed by Shunya Ito. The star of the series, Meiko Kaji, would complete the series of the fourth installment, Grudge Song, directed by the talented Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The Prisoner of Origin # 701: Scorpion is one of my favorites of all time. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is almost as good. It is generally considered the best of the series, and I agree perhaps that if the DVD came out better (the original, by Image, is very mediocre). Beast Stable, in my opinion, is almost as good as FP701. It is much slower, much more contemplative. It has its share of violence and malice, but we focus more on the story and the characters. Sasori (Kaji) escapes the detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed to a person and cuts off her arm - and escapes with her by dragging, which must be seen to be believed!) And connects with an independent prostitute , Yuki. Yuki is harassed by a local prostitution ring, which includes a clumsy looking madam with a cage full of crows of domestic animals. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. Yuki's story, which is never solved, is heartbreaking. The images are amazing and the direction of Ito is masterful. Too bad he never went anywhere after leaving the FP701 series. It's a nice film.
