Thirty years after the 1939 classic film awarded Robert Donat an Oscar and made Greer Garson a star, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" overcame a myriad of problems before falling on the screen in this musical version . Original stars Rex Harrison and Samantha Eggar were replaced by Richard Burton and Lee Remick, who were in turn honored for - thankfully - Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. Andr√© Previn's score was rejected and the one that was finally used was composed - unfortunately - by Leslie Bricusse. The director for the first time, Herbert Ross, has been entrusted with the monumental task of transforming a simple love story - that of a man for his wife and students - into a big-budget extravagance. The fact that it succeeds as well despite the many obstacles that hinder it says a lot about its two stars. <br /> <br /> Arthur Chipping is a Latin teacher at Brookfield, a boys' school in the suburbs of England, where he himself was educated. Introverted and socially incompetent, he devotes himself to his students but is unable to inspire them. Before the summer holidays, a former student takes her to a music hall in London to attend a show starring Katharine Bridges, the young woman he hopes to marry. The meeting after the performance is delicate for everyone and Chips, as its name suggests, is preparing to explore some of the ancient ruins of Italy. Unexpectedly, he meets Katharine, who has booked a cruise in the Mediterranean to give her time to cry a story of love missed and wonder about the direction of his career. In the time they spend together, she discovers a kind and gentle man under his confused exterior and, upon his return to London, pursues him seriously. When fall starts, Chips returns to Brookfield with his young wife and the two settle into a quiet domestic life. Complications arise when aspects of Katharine's past surface, and again when World War II enters their lives, but Chips is reinforced by his wife's support and his newfound confidence makes him a favorite of students. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few musical interludes - the delightful production number of the music hall "London is London" and Katharine's declaration of love, "You and I" - most of Bricusse's songs , some interpreted in voiceover while the characters explore their emotions, are easily forgettable and do not improve the film. Eliminate the entire score and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" works pretty much like a drama. Terrence Rattigan's script retains elements of the original while developing and updating it for a few decades. He created several scenes between Chips and Katharine that nicely illustrate their mutual devotion and inspired some of them with comedic relief from comedian actress and friend of Katharine, Ursula Mossbank (delightfully portrayed by Sian Phillips, O'Toole's wife of real life at the time). It also captures life in a British public school - the equivalent of a private academy here in the United States - with infallible perfection. <br /> <br /> Ross did well as a director for the first time, generously sprinkling the film with breathtaking photographs. moments - the sequence of opening credits, during which the school anthem sounds in the school's vast stone corridors, sets the tone perfectly for the film. The costumes and sets are faithful to the period. The students, represented by non-professionals enrolled at Brookfield School, are good at managing their various minor roles. <br /> <br /> The most commendable praises are reserved for Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark in the lead roles. . O'Toole had long been a first-class drama actor. His Oscar-nominated show is not surprising. Clark, a veteran of two dozen UK B-movies and the previous year's "Finian's Rainbow", is quite bright as the maid's music-hall who abandons a theatrical career in favor of the female dancer. 'a teacher. Her golden voice enriches her songs and almost neglects how tasteless most of them are, and she does more than match O'Toole in their dramatic scenes. The chemistry between the two is palpable and leaves no doubt that this couple is very in love. <br /> <br /> This version of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is not a classic like its predecessor, but hardly the disaster described by many critics when it was published. Ignore the score, focus on performance and enjoy the atmosphere that Ross has put on the screen. It's a nice way to spend a rainy afternoon with someone you love.
