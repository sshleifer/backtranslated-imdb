Brigitte Lahaie, a French porn star, is a French porn star "Night of the Hunted". In fact, most of the actors in this slow production were porn actors at the time of his frenzied shooting. This film is certainly different from the usual Lesbian vampire Rollin films, but it's not as memorable as, for example, "Lips of Blood" or "Fascination" .Lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who no longer knows who she is where does it come from? Most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex, where Lahaie is owned by some sort of medical group that treats a number of people with a similar condition. Anyway, she escapes from the monolithic tower where the affected people are. On a highway outside the city, she meets a young man, "Night of the Hunted" offers a lot of nudity, unfortunately the pace is extremely slow.The atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another inmate Asylum, Dominique Journet, is well developed.Still "Night of the Hunted e" is too monotonous to be completely enjoyable. Take a look only if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's works. 7 out of 10 and that's nice.
