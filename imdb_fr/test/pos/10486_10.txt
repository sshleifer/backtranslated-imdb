For me, Babette's feast is to heal: to repair the schism between spirit and body in orthodox Christianity. This puritanical community of distant Denmark lacks an adequate appreciation of all God's gifts in creation. They pushed the dualism of St. Paul to the extreme and insisted on the life of the "spirit" and not on the life of the "flesh". The two older sisters, in their youth, were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their own village. They and their parishioners cling to the narrow Biblical interpretation of their former leader and father of the sisters. The aging congregation has become irritable and quarrelsome and the sisters do not know what to do. Enter Babette, a French foreigner and someone they can be kind to. They have no way of knowing that they will finally give them their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry and dusty theology. Babette will give all she has and, in the process, teach the sisters and their flocks grace, sacrifice, how the sensual experience (as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist) can change lives and explain why true art moves us so deeply. When they can forgive each other and themselves, they can focus on the love of God that is revealed to them concretely in the present. As a minister and artist, I can not recommend a film more strongly. True art and true grace !!
