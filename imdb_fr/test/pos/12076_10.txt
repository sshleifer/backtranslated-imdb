I saw it originally when it premiered in the UK. I was hypnotized by her, and she cried me throughout her life. I recorded it on the TV to keep it, but over the years, it is exhausted. And the television never seems to show it. So it was a joy to discover that True Movies owned the copyright and showed it on their channels. This time, I recorded it on a DVD so that I could enjoy it again and again. <br /> <br /> Lucile Fray (magnificently interpreted by Ann-Margret) discovers that she has cancer and that she is terminally ill. Her husband has arthritis and although he is affectionate, he is an alcoholic and unable to care for his children after he leaves. As a result, she must find new homes for each of her children before she dies. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent, the music is beautiful, and it has stood the test of time wonderfully (it still makes me cry)!) If you had the opportunity, you would be stupid to miss that. It's a beautiful movie! A must for everyone !!!
