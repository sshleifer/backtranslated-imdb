In "Hoot", a new kid arrives in Florida from Montana. He must first deal with the usual problems of confusion and management of the local bully. Soon, however, he becomes aware of a bigger problem: a chain of franchised restaurants is trying to build a site in the city, where many terrier owls live. This film looks like a family film, but it is quite radical, it shows with sympathy that Roy and a couple of friends do not hesitate to break the law chain of restaurants) in the name of environmentalism ( to save the owls, not less). Now, we can agree or disagree with these actions, but at least the film has the courage not to run away from its convictions. A good solid film, in short.
