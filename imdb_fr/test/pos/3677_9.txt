I quote below the words of my favorite author, Paulo Coelho, in the commentary of this film. <br /> <br /> "When you really want something, the whole universe conspires to help you achieve it" <br /> It's too easy to forget who we really are and what we want to do in life. Because there are always too many comments and advice around us to talk about security. I had almost forgotten how passion felt. Despite the adventure that will take me out of the safe zone, I really believe that fear is just the price I have to pay for the new journey in life. <br /> <br /> Thank you for having inspired me with this beautiful story. It's a blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is. It is the most precious love of the light of the soul.
