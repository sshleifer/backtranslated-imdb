I can not believe how many great actors can be on a show. It's the realism and the acting of the actors that make it look real. It must be the best comedy ever created and I love Seinfeld and Everyone Loves Ramond. It's just fabulous and it seems like everyone in my family agrees. This is not my isolated opinion. The whole world seems to be talking about different incidents and trying to reproduce them. My hat to the crew. Some shows have an actor who does all the show. This comedy of the plot has one (8). That's what makes it so incredible. Some people pray for health, wealth or fame. I pray that the show never ends. Sicerely John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
