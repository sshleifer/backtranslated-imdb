Great horror comedy by Michael Davis.I laughed so much that I almost pee! Eric Jungman is a good actor who saves the day and a great performance of Jack Black-Esquire like Justin Urich. He was just divine in this movie. This guy deserves to be a big star. In addition, Aimee Brooks was good in the film as well as the girl in danger with the guys of a killer who recalls Jeepers Creepers. The gore to was given in abundant quantities and I loved it. I only hope that they will publish an unrated version. Great horror comedy at a low budget. The dead cat in the sex scene of the hotel is just ridiculous! ***** out of *****
