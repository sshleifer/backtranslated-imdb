When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought it was sweet - a family film. For the rest of the night and over the next two days, however, smart moments and funny replicas kept coming back to me in my thoughts and conversation ... There's a lot going on, classic stuffing, good stuff character game and Wendie. Malick's story is simply hysterical. To call it a "film of well-being" disguises spirit and pleasure - it's smarter than it sounds, just like "it's a wonderful life".
