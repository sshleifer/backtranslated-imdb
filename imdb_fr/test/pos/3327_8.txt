"Side Show" is one of the strangest horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very bloody in some places, but not as shocking as the trailer shows (the trailer of this movie shows all the bloody parts). In addition, scenic and visual effects are well made. I would recommend this movie to horror fans around the world. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this one should visit the main Away Camp page and other Full Moon Pictures movies.
