Apparently, Hans's isolation and desperation are caused by a stereotypical, cold, bourgeois mother, a snarling woman and the rejection of a lover. And despite the complex representation - Hans himself does not make these statements precisely - the foregoing must also be an integral part of Fassbinder's thinking (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer may not look beyond Hans' sex and sexism to locate the true cause of his crushed mind. <br /> <br /> First, it is highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love led him to register abroad. Legion. It was much more likely, and this is partly indicated, that it was a quest for adventure, male camaraderie (escaping the female world of mother and sister) and male identity itself, that the Legion and the war offered. <Br/> <br /> Secondly, Hans loses his police job, which is successful because of his sexism. Falling in love with prostitutes at work, he not only describes prostitution as an oppressive institution, but also shows that he can not even control his sexuality in the professional arena - and is even ready to jeopardize a desirable career. . <br /> <Thirdly, he commits serious verbal aggression against his wife in front of her sheep pals, making no distinction between her absence and - when she comes to him - his presence. In fact, he is more brutal in his presence. <br /> <br /> A few hours later, in a violent and drunk state, he beats his wife in front of their daughter, who intervenes on behalf of his mother. The terror he instills in her and her daughter are palpable. But he and the audience go there with a groan of conscience or protest. Why? Because his wife is cruelly characterized as being both snarling and sexually promiscuous (yes, this may be Fassbinder's view of what capitalism does to women - detained, insecure, and commodified - but that does not absolve the brutality of Hans, nor the exploitation of Fassbinder On the stage of the battery). <br /> <br /> And then there is this male role pressure, which Hans could choose to reject and protest, but instead accepts. He is too small for a man and too unheroic to achieve the global success recommended by the male role. But how can they be causes of despair when he not only acquires his lost mistress's love, but marries a tall woman, considerably more seductive than himself. Finally, Hans lets Harry, his war comrade, stay, despite his wife's convictions. contrary plea, in their house. By this decision, he not only clearly indicates that he is more connected to Harry than to his wife, but that the male bonds outweigh his love of women. And finally replaces his own life, as it is Harry's superior skill and spirit around the house that makes Hans's star fall. Hans, the merchant, may be, to a certain extent, a victim of capitalism, but more specifically, he is the victim of his own allegiance to his own masculine identity. His inability to let him do so is the ultimate cause of his isolation and despair. <br /> <br /> It's something that is lost, I think, not only on Fassbinder, but also on Han's sister, Anna - though, only to a degree lost. For Anna (and Fassbinder), the support of her brother, compared to his mother, does not go very far. She insists that he is the only one who can save himself, that his support and love can not put an end to his horror. Unfortunately, she offers none of this support or love to his wife, who must be much more embittered than Hans, but who, in the end, is able to recover the coins, to save himself and his daughter, and to present a marked contrast. at the fall of Han.
