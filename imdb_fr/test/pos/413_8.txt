Conrad Radzoff (beautifully played with a nasty sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A group of drama school students stole Radzoff's corpse from his crypt and took him to a dilapidated mansion so they could party with him. Radzoff comes back to life and scolds the rude young people for desecrating his grave. Screenwriter / director Norman Thaddeus Vane concocts a fresh, original and even stylish version of the usual body counting principle, offers a neat evocation of Hollywood's glitzy milieu and does a stubborn job of maintaining a pleasant and energetic ooga-booga atmosphere. The death coins deliver the macabre goods, with a blazing fire, a juicy decapitation (the cut head rolls down the stairs and on the lawn so that a crow can peck at it!), And another poor being crushed with a rating of coffin levitating like horrible highlights. Congratulations are also offered to the stellar cast of known B faces: Mayne has a deliciously spectacular balloon gliding through her eyes with her flashy role. medium, Mrs. Rohmer, Luca Bercovici plays the role of theater leader, she is Jennifer Starrett, the sweet Meg, Jeffrey Combs, the geek Stu, and Scott Thomson, the awesome Bobo. Chuck "Porky" Mitchell as a detective, Patrick Wright in one of his usual policeman roles and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse are very present. The polished cinematography of Joel King gives the film a brilliant and attractive appearance. The dark score of Jerry Mosely also hits the quivering place. A funny little horror movie.
