considering the Chan movies that would follow, it's not bad. Many stereotypes started with the black man at the beginning and when the captain of the police ordered that "all the Hindus of the city" were rounded. A parade of stereotypical characters enters the scene, including Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to be moving quickly in the city from Sutton Pl. To W. Village in a flash. The end is stupid. An obvious toy plane is used when it climbs into the sky, then nose. Ed Wood could not have done better. The final scene is absurd because the murderer will obviously incriminate himself in his attempt to silence the person who knows his identity. Overall, it is worth looking at.
