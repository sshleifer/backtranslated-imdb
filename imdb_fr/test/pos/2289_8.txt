Many think this film is a baseball film. These people are disappointed because this is a baseball player, but the film does not talk about baseball. <br /> <br /> Some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because their relationship is not really developed. This film is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This film is about culture. An arrogant American Major Leaguer and a director of Japanese traditional baseball can not succeed because they can not, in fact, understand each other. It is after having managed to overcome the cultural barrier that they succeed. The baseball player becomes more Japanese in his team mentality and the more American manager allowing individual achievement, and they meet in the middle. <br /> <br /> Baseball and romance are subordinated to this critique of both cultures. Many people who do not understand the Japanese mentality miss this and think it is a film about baseball or romance and see the shock of cultures as a slight comic relief. It's not - the clash of cultures is the cornerstone of the film. Based on my own experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I think this film has done very well in that it has not really romanticized Japanese culture or exaggerated its representation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this is a nice and relaxing film if you understand what it really is.
