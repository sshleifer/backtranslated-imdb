While this is not John Sayles' best film (Brother From Another Planet), it is not totally unforgettable either, if for no other reason than his message. Like Batman, Wild Thing's parents were murdered in front of him, letting him fend for himself in "The Zone", a corrupt neighborhood of an unnamed city where greed and violence reign supreme. Instead of falling in with Chopper (Robert Davi), Wild Thing fights for justice, using his tai chi powers and impressive cat prints, sometimes glowing with fire. He becomes an urban legend, a Robin of modern times and a hero of all time. 1987 at its best, WILD THING LIVES
