This is a jewel of a movie, unfortunately classified as "just for kids". The plot revolves around a young man, Roy Eberhardt, who has just arrived in southwestern Florida from the Montana Mountains. By trying to integrate with the other kids at his college, Roy discovers a brother-sister team trying to protect owls from endangered burrows on an illegal construction site. Look for Carl Hiassen, the author of the book on which this film is based, as secretary of the evil leader of the head office. Screenwriter / director Wil Shriner is also the secretary of the Public Records Office, where the intrepid teen detective discovers that the incriminating report on environmental impact is missing. Luke Wilson steals almost all the crucial scenes from the charming teen actors who own most of the best scripts. Wilson is the ruined police officer in his three-wheeled electric police cart with a blue light and a funky siren. As an officer Dave, he strives to succeed, but usually ends up falling into the mud, literally! Several times! Jimmy Buffet is quite discreet as a tacitly favorable science teacher. But the young actors Logan Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrice the Bear) and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers) are superb as teenagers who finally put the agent Dave on the right track, following the trace left by the mean business leader. I hope you will feel as good as me after this movie. Simply fun! A little complaint, though. I hope all non-Floridians realize that not all Florida residents are as bad as the newcomers, as this movie describes. We are really a friendly group! Just ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet !!
