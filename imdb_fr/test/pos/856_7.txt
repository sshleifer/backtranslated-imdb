Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked! Now, his book "Breaking Dawn" will not be the first with this title. Sorry, Twilight fans. <br /> <br /> Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is a medical student, Eve, in charge of interviewing Don, psychotic, (James Haven - brother of Angelina Jolie). I suspected it and when she found out that they had both grown up in the same town, I was sure of it. <br /> <br /> She was going deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared illusion going on. Sometimes she even acted like she had PTSD. I really thought she was losing it. <br /> <br /> She did not lose it and when the end came, I was floored. All my suspicions proved wrong. The turn was even more incredible than I thought. <br /> <br /> Overton was fantastic and the story is so much better than Stephanie Meyer would suggest. A must see.
