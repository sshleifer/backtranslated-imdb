In the line of fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this fascinating movie. Malkovich says he will kill the president, he voluntarily calls Eastwood and presses his buttons. He questions Eastwood's ability to protect someone. Malkovich brings to his character a cold, but very intelligent state of mind. Whatever he does, he does it for a reason and he does not fear killing. Eastwood must overcome the suspicions of his superiors to catch Malkovich, but nobody wants to listen to him. The result is a sparkling film of suspense that turns into a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure hotel. Wolfgang Peterson raises the tension and we feel every corner.
