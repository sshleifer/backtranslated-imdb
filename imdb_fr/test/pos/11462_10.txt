any movie that has a line of dialogue that goes something like this ... "Judy is getting ready for her date, Butthole!" must be good! I found this on unranked, unmounted DVD and I was pleasantly surprised, a lot of work was done to make this film. In fact, I enjoyed this movie more than many 80s movies I've seen. Excellent addition to my movie collection. <br /> <br /> The accumulation was excellent, it staged the fears for the rest of the film. I loved the GORE and the T & A. I never thought that the eyeballs would look like a rash, the splash color was disgusting! I can not stop thinking that "Rog" looked like Tiger Woods, but blacker, does anyone agree?
