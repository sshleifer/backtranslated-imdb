D.I. (4 stars out of 5 stars) Wow, I certainly did not expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I had never heard of it before I saw it sitting in the cheap video bin one day. I imagined that Jack Webb would play with a military instructor might be good for laughing, but I thought the drama would pale with the recent D.I.s movie described in "Full Metal Jacket" or "An Officer and a Gentleman". Boy, I was wrong. This is probably the best job that Webb has ever done ... far better than his performances at a "Dragnet" rating. The presentation of his hard-to-bake dialogue is just awesome ... done in his patented patented claw monotone and yet you * know * that the guy says it all. The story may seem a little hokey compared to the more bitter military movies that followed, but I still found the film fascinating and compelling. Even a totally unnecessary musical interlude in an army nightclub had caught me. Does anyone know where I can get a copy of that great Ray Coniff song "If'n You Do not, Someone Will Else Will"? Webb plays the toughest percussion instructor ... and he's under pressure to expel the dead soldier, Private Owen, but, damn it, he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he's going to drag her out in screaming! Great thing!
