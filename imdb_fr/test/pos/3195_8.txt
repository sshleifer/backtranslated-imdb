I remembered watching this show as a young Australian boy in the 60's and I enjoyed it on DVD again as a 50 year old father of young children. Although the villains are mostly superficial characters and there is an element of violence, I am very happy to see that watched by my children of 6 and 8 years because the central characters are deep, kind and honorable, the Japanese culture transpires violence is not bloody, no one glorifies it, and the program is beautiful to watch. This does not promote nightmares, but rather shows much of the culture that was to have primarily influenced the design of the Jedi Knights in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The quality of DVDs leaves something to be desired. The perfectionists of the video will not like this one. It strongly reminds something that is retained on a 16mm film and projected on the wall in a basement ... which may well be the case. The soundtrack also lacks the quality we expected from home theater. However, my children only noticed that it was not in color, and I guess they only noticed it because we had talked recently about how old things are often like that. The beauty of Mount Fuji is evident even in black and white. Something about the 17th century setting makes quality a part of the atmosphere, as if you were looking in the past through a window of time. <br /> <br /> Overall, this program is better than most live shows and better advertising for Japanese TV than Pokemon, but you can think of it as having marginal value if you did not get it. experience of the review in the 60s. My score of 8/10 takes into account his age.
