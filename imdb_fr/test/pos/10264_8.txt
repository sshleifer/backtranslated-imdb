If you need this instant buzz that only European sex movies in the late '60s or early' 70s can give, then look no further, you've just fallen on the mother's vein! TV director Schivazappa's exercise in psychedelic porn (of the soft core variety) may not be considered a classic of the genre, but it defeats many more well-known titles, such as Tinto Brass, Jess Franco and Joe D'Amato. . Radley Metzger was convinced of this trend before anyone else when he recovered this wonderfully twisted little figure for distribution in the United States through his Audubon company. A beautiful cinematography (privileging symmetrical compositions) can arouse shouts of "pretension" on the part of those who swear by the poor quality skin films shot in someone's garden. Hey, as far as I'm concerned, it's their loss for a sensational movie tour with twists, so, well, twisted, you may not even believe them after seeing them on screen! Dagmar Lassander (immortalized as mistress of Lucio Fulci's house near the cemetery) has never seemed as exquisite as it is here, subtly describing the innocent (?) Seeker taken hostage by the mad doctor Philippe Leroy (with all the house of art of his name, you wonder if he has the good mood to mention it on his cv) while their "relationship" initially violent turns to a love story imprint of sensuality. Nothing is what it seems however in this sick and imaginative jewel of a film with several really erotic moments made with a surprisingly minimal nudity. For my part, I am completely disconcerted and delighted by the way Schivazappa chose to suggest oral sex during a scene (I let you discover that for yourself ...) and the boogie dressed in Lassander gauze on a melody incredibly groovy of the 60s should have become iconic in the manner of the image of Sylvia Kristel, lying on this wicker chair of his time in EMMANUELLE. You may not know this movie yet, but believe me, once you've seen it, you'll never forget it!
