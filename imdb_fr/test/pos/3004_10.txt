I would give this TV show a 10 plus if I could. The writers were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus for the show. These characters were so real. The two leading actresses, Ms. Toussaint and Ms. Potts, were able to say that their relationship with and against the camera was genuine. She did not stop when you heard those familiar words "Cut" at the end of a "Take". The show gave me a lot of thought about life, for example. Historical struggles, tragedies and triumphs, relationships, everyday situations, every home has the same situations, no matter who the members are, it's really about showing that the family is wonderful. sofa couch and say, "Now, what did I learn from this episode"? <br /> <br /> I have to say that I recorded most of the episodes and I find myself watching them again and again. <br /> <br /> Now you know why I gave him a 10+ !!
