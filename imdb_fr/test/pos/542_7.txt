Anywhere But Here is not new, but the excellent performances of the two main actresses have been worth watching. Sarandon and Portman are a mother and a daughter who left the Wisconsin countryside to settle in the sunny city of Beverly Hills, California, in search of a better life. The main conflict is that Natalie would have preferred to stay in Wisconsin with all her friends and family, and she felt compelled to travel to California with her domineering mother. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) While the movie as a whole is not predictable, Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman perform so well that they almost give the impression of renewing the film. equipment. Anywhere But Here does not cover any new terrain, but it has the rare ability to pick up an overused topic and make it interesting enough again. Also seen in this film, the most heart-wrenching facial expression seen for years is visible on Natalie Portman's face when her mother drops her on the side of the road and watches the car fade away. Of particular note is the ironic subplot where Natalie's mother pushes her to become an actress, as well as Shawn Hatosy's highly convincing performance as a close cousin of Natalie, from her home country. His death is a tragic clich√© almost always seen in movies like this one, but the rest of the film offsets many weaknesses like this one. Not great, but everywhere but here is definitely worth a look.
