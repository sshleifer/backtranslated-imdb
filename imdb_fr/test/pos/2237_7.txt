I caught this movie late in the evening on TV and was expecting a low-budget campy "masterpiece", I was surprised by a pretty decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting abilities (or should I say her absence?) Make her perfect as an Android, and the other actors, although terribly average, are not that bad at the least. <br /> <br /> There is a plot; a rather complex plot to this, involving conspiracies and the lengths of a couple (a human, an android) will continue to pursue their illegal romance, with a "big brother" type figure and an android killer thrown into the mix. The production and sets were also much better than I expected. I have not seen the original Cyborg, so I can not compare it to many other things. This film is not Blade Runner, but as a futuristic guilty pleasure late at night, it's worth watching.
