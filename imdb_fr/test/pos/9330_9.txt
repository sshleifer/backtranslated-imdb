Before it was broadcast on MTV or VH1, it was in my local theater that was playing just before the main movie. I remember this short film more than the film I saw that day. It was the first time I had a musical movie like this, but I'll tell you that seeing a 35mm print on a big screen in a dark theater has a much better impact than seeing a version panoramic and digitized on Halloween VH1.
