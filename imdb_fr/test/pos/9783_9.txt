This movie was great and I had been waiting for a long time. When it finally came out, I was really happy and I was looking forward to a 10 out of 10. It was great and I had all my potential. The performances were excellent from adults and most children. The only bad performance was Milo himself. There was a problem I encountered with this movie (and others like that). All the characters I wanted to live were killed. Overall, I give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10. Maybe we should pick better people to kill next time, okay?
