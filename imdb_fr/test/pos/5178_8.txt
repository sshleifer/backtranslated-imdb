My whole family enjoyed this movie, including 2 little kids. Great values ​​without sex, without violence, without drugs, without nudity or profanation. In addition, no special effect of a million dollars was added to try to mislead viewers from a poorly written scenario. A simple little movie fun family. We particularly like the songs of the movie. But we could only hear part of the songs ... Mainly during the end credits ... I would like to buy a sound track of this movie. This is my 4th Bill Hillman movie and they all have the same guidelines as those mentioned above. With all the movies you do not want your kids to watch, this guy Hillman has no risk risk. We love his films.
