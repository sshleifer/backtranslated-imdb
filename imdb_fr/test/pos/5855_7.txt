Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is an extremely serious police detective. As an ex-boyfriend who tried to kill her and who badly hurt her, she is determined to bring to justice those who harm others. In addition, following her near-death experience, Cassie prefers one night nights and does not trust anyone. One day, a woman is found dead in the woods near the community of Cassie. She was murdered odiously, beaten severely and left to die alone. Naturally, Cassie will stop at nothing to find the murderers. Another officer, Sam (Ben Chaplin), is in charge of helping him. He soon discovers Cassie's relentless attitude and devouring instinct when she asks him to take a sample of vomit that was left on the scene for analysis, among other actions. The track soon leads to two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Could these teenagers really be responsible for the planning and execution of the perfect "joy of killing"? It's an intriguing film, but viewers must be warned that the subject is really dark. Killing for his "sport" is rarely the subject of films that are of the "all softness and light" variety and this one is no different. That said, the casting is great. Bullock, without any trace of his talent for comedy, is great as a policeman whose own past forces him to lock up the demons of the world. Chaplin is also very kind as a detective who is both attracted and repelled by the Cassie force. As for Gosling, he gives a most memorable performance as a brilliant spirit with a satanic soul. The production values ​​for the film are also good, with appropriate costumes, sets and photographs. If you are a fan of Bullock looking for a laugh, this is not the one for you. But if you love the mysteries, even those who have the most infamous plot, you will find this story captivating.
