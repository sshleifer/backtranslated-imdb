I first saw this film in a video store and, as a fan of Bam Margera, I had to rent it to see what it was. As I have a huge and stupid sense of humor (notice the word stupid), I found this movie absolutely hilarious. Some parts are useless and random, but that's what makes them so fun. You will need to think that things like slapping your face and banging your head with a watermelon are fun to enjoy this movie. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by the acting. These people did a good job. Nothing worthy of Oscars, but enough to exceed the amateur level. Teens and young adults would probably find it more entertaining because of the slang and modern situations used. I would not advise to watch this with your parents and vice versa. <br /> <br /> In all, the acting was great, the story was hilarious and the story is really something you can understand.
