First of all, I am a teenager. OK, and I must say that this movie was pretty good. I think all kids 10 and under will like that, but people my age may have a little, uh, well, we would describe the movie as LAME! But I liked it. Maybe I still behave like a child or visit a farm every weekend, but this movie was cute. I liked the way the actors looked like children, not small blond cutesy pies, wearing three layers of clothing, a trendy hat and about a thousand associations (like most shows today, for name a few, Lizzie Mc Guire, and well any kid show.) And the setting was perfect, but there was a flaw. The family was in debt, right? Why in the world did their internal house look like something from a "western" verse shop? It was a defect. <br /> <br /> The cameos are superb, there are about 500, and the only one that can be explained is that Julia Roberts is the principal aunt of the little girl. How in the world did they have everyone? This movie seemed to be on a tight budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, it was fun to watch, and I thought some parts were far-fetched (like a cow selling $ 750,000?) Ha! my butt a cow is getting sell for that!) But otherwise it was good, I liked it, and I could watch it again. But I would never buy it, there are not even special features on the DVD! What's up with that? But rent it, especially if you have young children running around the house.
