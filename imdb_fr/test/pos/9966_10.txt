Seriously, where is Al Pacino's Oscar nomination for this one? Do we take it for granted at this point in his career? Pacino is here extraordinary. It gives a complex and heartbreaking performance like Shylock, the Jewish money lender .. the movie as a whole was rather fantastic, with great shots of Venice to watch and a perfect score to listen to .. the other actors also make a good job, but the real reason to see him is Pacino. I saw all the Oscar nominated performances of 2004, and I must say that Pacino was snubbed. with the piece, the studio's lack of campaign, the late release date without major impulse, or most likely, all of the above. In my mind, the best performances of the year belong to Jamie Foxx in Ray, Don Cheadle. at the Hotel Rwanda, and Al Pacino at the Venice Merchant ..
