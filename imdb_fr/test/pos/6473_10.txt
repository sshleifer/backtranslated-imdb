Some time ago, we saw the results of a survey conducted by some sports newspaper journalists. The questions asked were only two and were brief and straight to the point. <br /> <br /> Question # 1 asked the respondent to tell who his most beloved university football team was. Question number 2 asked the fan to name his most hated university football team. The answer to both questions was simply Notre-Dame! ND is at the top of both lists! Yeah, like them or hate them, but you will certainly not ignore them. <br /> <br /> The roots of this unique position at this Indepent * college football center are found in the life and career of one Knute Rockne, a Chicago-born Norwegian immigrant boy from Chicago. Knute Rockne. <br /> <br /> As a biographical production, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American (1940), was relatively close to the death of coach Rockne in a 1930 plane crash. years after the release of the film. This would mean that preliminary work on the project began about 8 years after the great loss of Mr. Rockne by our nation. <br /> <br /> His resemblance and his voice were well known in newspapers, radio and newsreels. Bonnie Skiles Rockne, of Knute's Widow, and the University of Notre Dame have the right to approve the choice of the actor to play the lead role and agree to the script. We think they could not have done the job better. Pat O'Brien really looks good and has been a footballer at the university. Ronald Reagan plays the pivotal role of George Gipp **, a free-spirited student traveling to Notre Dame with a baseball scholarship! He was a football player "on foot". <br /> <br /> The cast is filled with talented players. Donald Crisp, a veteran of Griffith, is p. Callaghan, C.S.C, Notre Dame President. Albert Basserman is the p. Newland, the chemistry teacher and Rockne's mentor. Gail Page appears as Mrs. Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis, Jr. is the Rockne cohort, Gus Dorais (the passer of this historic ND vs ARMY match at West Point.) <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall and William Byrne The riders Howard Jones, "Pop" Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg, the coaches of Big Time College in real life, appear as unpublished scenes from the US Congress and add an authentic touch. <br /> <br /> Regarding the biopic, KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American !, we can only say that it's a hit, and that it has not slowed down from beginning to end. There is no time lost either. All screen time is used to advance the story. <br /> <br /> Using the Notre-Dame choir, the campus itself and all the brass band music to brew, gives the feeling of being really there. *** <br /> <br /> * To That day, even though their basketball team and other sports teams are participating in the Big East conference, Notre Dame remains independent in NCAA football. It actually means that the fighting Irish play according to a national calendar. <br /> <br /> ** There are no such agreements with George Gipp's family. A few years ago, a lawsuit was filed against the young man, Mr. Gipp, as part of the famous "Win Onr's speech for The Gipper". The televised copies of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were without the speech pronounced in the scene of the death bed. <br /> <br /> *** Other films on the theme of Our Lady have been made over the years. THE SPIRIT OF OUR LADY (Universal 1931) introduced J. Farrell McDonald as a Rockne coach. He also starred Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton, as well as members of the real teams of the Notre Dame Championship with the real Four Horsemen. Then, of course, we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993) with Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton, among others, in a beautiful cast. There was also talk of an unauthorized film, GOLDEN GLORY, a critic of Notre Dame, but nothing came to fruition, did it? The brothers have always had good music in their opening and casual themes. In this Rockne movie, they incorporated THE NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG into the score. At his side were STEP NOTRE DAME and THE NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, the first of which took place at Funeral Rockne in 1930 at Notre-Dame Basilica.
