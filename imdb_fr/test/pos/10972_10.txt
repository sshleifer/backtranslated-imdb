MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a great movie, both predictable and unpredictable. You know that the characters after discovering that the so-called "Gift of God" was actually a loan, would repay the money and that everyone would be happy at the end, but the way they do it is not as obvious. The scenes are often funny and sometimes touching when the characters evaluate their life and their course. The troupe of veteran actors is more than a nostalgic journey. Frank Gorshin, Shirley Jones and Cloris Leachman prove that they are capable of playing more than Riddler, Mother Partridge or Phyllis, Mary's friend, while Jill Eikenberry and Wendie Malick play characters different from those of their television series. The portrait of the nun by Ursula Burton is both touching and amusing, without making fun of the nuns or the church. If you're looking for a movie with a fantastic cast, good music (including an interpretation of "The Way You Look Tonight" by Shirley Jones), and an uplifting end, try this one. I do not think you will be disappointed.
