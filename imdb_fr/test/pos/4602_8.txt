There is no other word for that ... Fox rejected that, without marketing of any kind. No one in the country, apart from those who have been eagerly awaiting this film, knows nothing about it. All the red flags flew. It must be a mess, it can not be anywhere as good as a workspace, right? False. Although this is not the case, this film has biting and satirical spirit. It is a failure at some levels, but who is to blame is left to the mystery. <br /> <br /> From what we currently see in theaters, I can say that IDIOCRACY is a good movie. It's funny, sometimes funny to laugh. It's effective, sometimes ingenious. What is not as far as I can tell, is over. We'll see something new from this movie, whether it's a long edit or a cover. Alone, it can be hilarious. It is sometimes delicate. <br /> <br /> Leaving the theater, looking around the mall, I was surrounded by commercials and billboards, commercialism and stupidity. Dystopia is not as prejudicial as in 1984, but this film portrays a dark future for our culture. And it seems that no one can do much about it. Anyway, go see that if you can and try to find out what happened if it was buried so specifically.
