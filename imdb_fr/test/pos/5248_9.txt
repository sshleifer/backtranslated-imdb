With the recent release of Carlos Saura's "Fados" in the United States (albiet, a limited version of the artist's house), it is high time to reissue this excellent documentary on Amalia Rodrigues. This film is a treasure of vintage clips of Amalia's films on Portuguese and American television, as well as many other clips, including that of his mother that could easily make the most macho man to tears. I saw this documentary for the first time a few years ago, when it received the wrongful release of "art house" (it deserved much better). Fortunately, there are various recordings of Amalia's best recordings on various "budget line" records (usually available in places such as K-Mart or Best Buy). If you do a little research, you can rely on the original versions. either on E-Bay, or any of these specialty distribution services specializing in expensive imported European CDs. There are at least two versions of this documentary in circulation (the original Portuguese version, without English subtitles, and the American version in Portuguese with English subtitles, with the exception of the European version, which can not be read on most USDVD drives, due to PAL color line system). Not rated by the MPAA, but contains nothing to offend.
