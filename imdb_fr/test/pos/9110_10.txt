This film is rocking ... so hard ... <br /> <br /> Cameos ... drugs refers to ... sharing ... love ... ROCKING !!! When Jack and Kyle met for the first time in Tim Robbins 'Actors' Gang Theater, a few years ago, knew that such a legacy of great and hilarious music would follow? All this door to rock door has borne fruit ... <br /> <br /> Although all fans of classic rock will have a crush on this film, I would certainly recommend renting the 6 original episodes of HBO in your local video store before going to see the movie at the cinema. They are on the Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, available in almost every video store. There are jokes inside the movie that refer to those previous episodes that will add something more enjoyable to the overall visual experience ...
