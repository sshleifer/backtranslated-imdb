I have just seen Baby Blue Marine after 30 years. I always find a nice and romantic movie that tells a lost time forever. The innocence and purity of a bygone era are captured in this little movie. The acting is above average and the brief appearance of Richard Gere as Raider Marine's war hero, shocked by the shells, arouses a keen interest for any film buff or fan of Gere. Jan-Micheal Vincent is in his early youth and looks like the "American" boy. The late Bruno Kirby (nicknamed B.Kirby, Jr.) has a fleshy role as "Pop", a pacifist, Marine Corp rejects, dreaming of finding his wife. If you're looking for sex, drugs or rock and roll, this movie is not for you. If you are looking for action and adventure, the same applies. However, if you want to find a time of innocence, honor, romance and love in America, then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.
