During the day, I was one of the emergency nurses, these skaters sometimes arrived. They were not well treated and some had been provoked by their asocial personalities, but we all knew they were a talented group. of "wonders" even then. They deserved better care than the ones they received, I'm afraid. They had "attitude" to shovel. <br /> <br /> I'm delighted to have seen this documentary on IFC tonight. It will be operational again at 1 am and I will look again! <br /> Little attention has been paid to them until the dying rich child is able to convince his parents to empty the pool - and the film really points out that the take-off point .. .. it was an amazing time, and deserved to be recorded. Stacy Peralta deserves all the praise, and these Z-Boys enjoy their memories and their contribution to the true sport of skateboarding. With regard to the few critics of "sour grapes" contained in this document, there have always been and there will always be "aspirants" and hangers that never do more than dream ... the Z-boys lived, breathed, if it was. <br /> It's a pleasure to see the vintage films and even the lonely girl "Peggy" who has been so much presented as the only woman to have earned their respect. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the IFC, I really get to take the drug-free, occasional epic of my youth and relive the throbbing heart again.
