"Meatballs" is an ode to the summer camp. Those of us who have gone to camp will see many scenes of how we will remember or wish we could be. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray plays councilor Tripper Harrison, one of the oldest boys, who actually runs the camp. It reminds us of the cool and funny staff member that everyone loves. Young campers are attracted to him and if he speaks to you, you feel like a family. This is one of Murray's best roles. He directs the film with his liners and ad-libs. <br /> <br /> Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, the lone camper who is taken under Tripper's wing and comes out of his shell. <br /> <br /> The rest of the campers and film staff were also excellent. <br /> <br /> The general theme of the film is that the oppressed overcomes obstacles to finally win. From Rudy to Spaz to the camp and even Tripper, the film's underdogs are the stars. The film has heart. <br /> <br /> The film is fun and fun without being cruel or excessive as some teen movies are currently. Actors look and act like real people. <br /> <br /> The comedy and the heart lead you to the end, as to the camp, you are sad to leave. <br /> <br /> During my summer camp, we had underwear, mysterious treats, we tried to take a look in the girls' cabin, crazy stories with hooks around campfire and get people out of their cabs and put them elsewhere. But we also had a dedicated camp staff who guided us to be the best we could be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the CIT overnight, as they paddle on the lake singing a crazy song. The line that makes me crack every time is when Tripper announces the day before the parents' day the day before the parents' day and ends with "Tomorrow is the parents' day and you must have the air rested, otherwise Morty will be sent to the penitentiary of the state.
