I do not understand why he is so underrated on IMDb .. This movie is just perfection .. The best adaptation of all time of the myth of Tarzan! As a Frenchman, I can say that it is the best role of Christophe Lambert, ridiculous in many films, but here absolutely wonderful, charismatic, incredible! The plot is great, well told, beautiful story, direction, atmosphere, music, everything is perfect! How to believe these sequences with Elgar's music, just perfect? <br /> <br /> Greystoke is really an incredible film, underrated here, I do not really know why, but I really enjoyed it.
