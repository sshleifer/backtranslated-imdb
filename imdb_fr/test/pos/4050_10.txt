When I started watching 3 episodes of this series on Action Channel, I must say that, among all the series that I saw, ADV came out, this one is one of the best series of all time . I had to see him again, and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set from this series at Best Buy for my 20th birthday. And I have to enjoy it, and see more episodes I missed on Action Channel, and the same 3 episodes I saw. My favorite characters in this series are: Sylvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation of this series was the best and the difficult costumes were good too. But the show also has an excellent voice composition like Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Auten and Hillary Haag, and more. So, if you like this show on Action Channel, you must own it on DVD. It's the best, and you'll see what I mean.
