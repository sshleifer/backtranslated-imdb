I am a big fan of Rupert Everett. I love Kathy Bates so when I saw that it was available, I decided to check it. The synopsis does not tell you much. It was sometimes silly, touching and sometimes hysterical. <br /> <br /> Anyone who really likes a personality, whatever his type, will find some small identificatory features with the main character. (Of course, there are many that they will not want, but that's the goal) <br /> <br /> If you like one of the actors, look at it but do not look for something Too dramatic, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I could also mention that you can see how pretty Rupert is. I mean, I knew it was 6'4 "but it looks even better in this movie, it even seemed to go down a bit because of the height of the other characters, it's big, I mean big !! !! And for you Rupert the fans there is a bare breast scene ... WONDERFUL!
