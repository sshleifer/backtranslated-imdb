The drama of Bridges on a journalist who discovers some flaws in the security measures taken in a nuclear power plant is well done and is a pretty interesting film of the late 70s. No wonder, but it's solid, the acting is pretty good, especially Jack Lemmon, but Douglas and Fonda were good too. It was a very good scenario and Bridges management was solid and fit. This is certainly not one of the best movies of the 70s, but one of the best. A good first film by Michael Douglas and Lemmon in his early youth
