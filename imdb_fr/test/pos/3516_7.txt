A quick glance at the premise of this movie would seem to indicate that this is just another 80s inbred slash fetish; the type where sex is equal to death and the actors are all boring stereotypes that you really want to die. However, "JBD" provides a lot more. <br /> <br /> Rather than focusing on bare flesh and goose bumps (though there is some sex apart, though), the film focuses on creating fear / growing tension a beautiful backdrop. These feelings are further exacerbated by a cast of realistic and more amorphous characters and antagonists than definitions of cardboard evil. Oh yes - George Kennedy is here too and when is not it a good thing? <br /> <br /> If you like "Wrong Turn", then look at it to see where the methodology comes from.
