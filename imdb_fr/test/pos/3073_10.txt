If you do not like Mel Brooks, you will not like this movie. It's a given. I do not know why anyone would not like his films, but for those who can not see the light, avoid it. <br /> <br /> Everyone: it's a classic. The whole cast is perfect: Carey Elwes is a dashing, smart, UK Robin Hood, Amy Yasbeck far surpasses Marion, Richard Lewis is her usual distracted and annoyed self, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence like "Mervyn" Rottingham sheriff and Dave Chapel, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield and the sadly underused Matthew Poretta are the perfect merry men. <br /> <br /> There are similarities with Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles ... and all the other Brooks Mel Film. But why would you change his style when it works so well? The references to the pop culture of this film are old enough to be funny again ... at least at the age of 16. It is a complete and complete parody, every second a room for laughter. Some do not work, but most are, well. I discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time I watched the movie! <br /> <br /> Of course, if you're not one to spoil yourself with constant visual and verbal gags, you do not like that. He's not an Academy Award winner, it's Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you enter it. If you want a laugh all the time, amazingly well-developed characters and slogans that will last a lifetime, look at this.
