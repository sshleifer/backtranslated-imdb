This is a must for everyone, but especially African Americans. It is time for a film to express and show the concerns that reign in African-American relations. It also allows other cultures to fictitiously see how positive Afro-American relations are and their results rather than the unwanted stereotype that plagues the African-American community. I love this movie to see absolutely!
