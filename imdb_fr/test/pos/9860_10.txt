The Museum of Animated Image, here in New York, recently organized a complete retrospective of Jacques Rivette's films. Having fallen in love with his "Paris Belongs to Us", I decided that it was not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Largely through long shots and smoothly structured scenes, the film describes two avant-garde theater companies preparing their interpretations. of Aeschylus "Seven against Thebes" and "Prometheus". In addition, we discover the daily life without direction of two individuals linked in a distant way to the companies: a woman of the working class named Frédérique who finds creative ways to draw the men of their money and a young man named Colin who visits local cafes. pretending to be a deaf-mute and playing high-pitched harmonica at the clients until they pay for him to leave. The first four hours are devoted to the establishment of the characters and their models, before a plot a little loose and whimsical emerges, finally implying a plot and the decoding of clandestine secret letters. <br /> <br /> Much of the film deals with life on the margins of society. Theater companies are a desperate business, using their elaborate and exhausting drills (which are really worth watching) to distract themselves from the fact that their actions are unlikely to be staged or even seen. Colin and Frederique both have very few friends, who only discover an excitement or a goal after the plot has touched them, as they are encouraged to know more about it. The film meditates on the consequences of the rejection of normal society in several memorable sequences, including a long shot of Colin wandering the streets of France shouting poetry. As such, the film was described as a counterculture analysis of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is no image of the film that does not overflow with energy and vitality. The fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. The camera also becomes an important figure in this regard; Throughout the film, shadows are visible here and there, or other similar mistakes, but they seem natural and fit into the action, because the camera plays such an important role. <br /> <br /> Most of all for me For me, the film seems to be a good example of another way to make films, a place of shooting out of the ordinary. For me, it was a rewarding experience, even more so than "Paris Belongs to Us", although it has many similarities of theme and structure. A must for anyone thinking about the nature of art.
