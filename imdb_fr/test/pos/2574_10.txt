If you want to see a film with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, a brutal beating of a woman and a child rape, this film will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively take revenge on the treasure of a woman who has left, this film has it. You have already heard the wonderful music that keeps the emotion raw. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music, a climax can happen in a moment of silence, without pedantic discourse that transforms the film. Look for a final scene that is unexpected proof of a wounded person's healing. Perhaps we who wonder why we wallow in profane abundance will learn that love can be located above the kidneys in the heart. From pounding, follow the pace to where love is sacred.
