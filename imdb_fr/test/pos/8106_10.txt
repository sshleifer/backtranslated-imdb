Before seeing this film, I did not really expect much, although my friend advised me otherwise. Following this request from my friend, I decided to go watch this movie. The minute I sat down to watch the movie, I was blown away. From the credits I fell from my place; I just could not contain myself. The film speaks of Hitler in all the glory of comedy. Hynkel is the absolute double of the Jewish barber, who returns from the war. Due to the heroism of the hairdresser, he managed to save one of the Germans and, in doing so, he embarked a member of the enemy, which facilitates the struggle of the Jews. But things went wrong and Stolz was arrested, but only then to escape to the confines of the Jewish suburbs, "The Ghetto". Because of this escape, the German army began to search, which meant that the Barber and Stolz had been arrested, but they escaped again, but were mistaken for hynkel and therefore took his poetry. ***** THE SPEECH THAT CHAPLIN MAKES AT THE END IS FANTASTIC, THAT COMPLIES WITH THE MORAL THAT THE COMPANY COULD BE DREAMING. IN THE SPEECH, THIS MEANS THE SENSE OF THE FILM, BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUSNESS AND SINCERENITY THAT HAS ADMITTED, AND IT WORKS DEFINITIVELY, BECAUSE I AM FALLING INTO LIFE SOMEONE OF THE GREATEST AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS OF WAR.
