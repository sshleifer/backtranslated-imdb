Choose your destiny: The terrible types of the fourth form, playing practical jokes that involve axes, or ... uh ... well-developed girls of the sixth form, who discovered some time ago the cigarette, the gin, sex and how easy men can be lost. The problem is that one set comes with the other. They are all present in Saint-Trinian, this extremely easy-going girls' English school, directed by Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). As Miss Fritton points out, "In other schools, girls are sent unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, the merciless world must be prepared." Miss Fritton looks like a fusion of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and undeniably possesses Sim's funny and comical genes. <br /> <br /> At Les Belles de Saint-Trinian, a silly and chaotic comedy by the team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, Saint-Trinian is, as usual, on the verge of a financial disaster. Salvation may be at hand, however, when a rich sheikh sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive a true education in English. The Sheikh also owns a horse and one of his award-winning riders, Arab Boy, is being trained near the school for a race. It's only a matter of time before the fourth girls form a pool of races and rely heavily on Arab Boy, with Miss Fritton adding to the fund the funds left at the end of the school. (A lot of the fourth girls' money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, and then bottle them by the rope to distribute it to Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney repairman, for distribution. really know what, "said Miss Fritton tasting the material," but send a few bottles to my room. ") Miss Fritton however has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who, according to some Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who not only placed a package on another horse, but who also has a daughter, and he placed Arabella in his sixth form to keep him informed.Soon, the sixth form took away Arab Boy, the fourth took over the horse, Flash Harry has joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth-form girls are determined that Arab Boy does not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and his gang wearing clothes in Homburg arrived, the parents prepare for the party of the pare and the Ministry of Education arrived in the person of a very competent inspector. The total war breaks out in Saint-Trinian. It's hard to say which one is the most dangerous, African spears or flour bombs. <br /> <br /> Alastair Sim and Millicent Fritton are a tour de force. Mademoiselle Fritton is a tall, big-breasted woman who loves long embroidered lace dresses and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything in stride, even a fourth old who hammers something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. "Oh my God, I told Bessie to pay attention to this nitroglycerine!" She is convinced that St. Trinian's is "a gay arcade of happy girls". Sim was one of the great British eccentric actors. Apart from the chaos of all the little girls (and not so small) who do terrible things, he delivers a lot of the fun of the movie.
