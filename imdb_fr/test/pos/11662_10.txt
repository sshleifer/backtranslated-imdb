How to know if a movie is good or not? It's the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "Dead Man Walking" pissed me off. I watched it twice. I do not know if I'll be strong enough to watch it again. No, I did not feel good after watching it, but the movie was as successful as possible. <br /> <br /> Robbins has very well integrated all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided presenting an argument that could easily be perceived as biased or subjective. I hope a lot of people will be able to see "Dead Man Walking". I believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty with such enthusiasm should see the film. <br /> <br /> I do not know what else might be needed to finally convince everyone that this relic of ancient times places it in modern society. <br /> <br /> The film itself does not argue in favor of the death penalty. This describes the reality. Reality is the best argument against the death penalty. <br /> <br /> A 10/10 for great performances, a good realization, and for the most important film made in years <br /> <br /> Thank you, Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
