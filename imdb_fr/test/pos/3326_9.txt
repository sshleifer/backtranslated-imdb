I can not help but notice the negative reviews of this movie. To be honest, I saw the preview of this movie and the premise intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading the comments of others. They are right that some roles leave a lot to be desired. They are also right to say that one of the best performances of this film was that of Dr. Graves. <br /> <br /> Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the wheelchair kid, is also interesting. I identify with the character he played, maybe because I'm in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> This film certainly deserves your attention.
