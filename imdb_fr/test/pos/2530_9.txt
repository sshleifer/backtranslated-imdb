For me, it's another one of those movies I saw off the Los Angeles-based "Z" channel while on duty. And it was another one of those films I saw when I was young ... and that I learned that there was a world ... that I did not want to accept. <br /> <br /> Moving to Los Angeles and watching international cinema has become my hobby of guilty pleasure and, to date, no television programming has matched that of the "Z" channel in its projection of international films. The three international films that were in my head were "Spetters", "Beau Pere" and of course this one, "Pixote". <br /> <br /> It was the most shocking and sad movie I have ever seen in my life. life. It was also one of the first films that made me understand that there is a difference in the cinema: entertaining and informing. Let me be honest ... I grew up in a small town on the east coast and I did not know there was such a thing. In South America, I only knew pamphlets about the fabulous holidays in Brazil and about drug trafficking in Colombia. <br /> <br /> Then comes a movie like Pixote. Sad. Worrying. Steadfast. Scary. You look: children. Those who need shelter, love, understanding and all of that are a way to survive day after day: drugs, sex, theft, theft, street nights and sadistic group homes, and so on. Their survival is difficult to watch with other street children, prostitutes, etc., and you begin to wonder how things like this can happen in this world. <br /> <br /> Pixote is not an entertainment film, but an informational film. It shows shocking and disturbing images, but shows the lives of these street children on a daily basis.
