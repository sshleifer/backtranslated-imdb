Although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, fantasy is sometimes more enjoyable than real life, and nothing could be more real than Errol Flynn in Custer. This remains the best film made on Custer. The music of Max Steiner is beautiful and throughout the film is played the Irish song "Gerry Owen", who was a favorite of Custer. The movie should have more bad guys because they are trying to focus all the bad guys in Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland is unlike any other of their films, and director Raoul Walsh, with his experience in outdoor scenes with many actors, is at his best.
