I liked this film. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, so I can not comment on the similarities between this film and other films like this, but I found this film quite compelling. the scenario, although a bit obvious, had really scary and tense moments and the acting (especially the female lead role) was not bad anyway <br /> <br /> In the together, I'm a bit surprised at the low rating this movie has got. I watch a lot of movies (working in a video store tends to help) and it's not as bad as people seem to think. I have some criticisms though. The last call from the cop was terrible, almost exaggerated. The dead girl in the bathroom seemed to be sleeping a bit (probably because of the amount of tequila she said she had drunk) and the kids' reaction to what was happening instilled in me hopefully that they were eventually killed <br /> <br /> hope this will help some people
