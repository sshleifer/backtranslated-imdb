I think this short television series was absolutely wonderful and gave both a detailed and clear explanation of everything on the screen at the time. It was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought it was one of the best documentaries of the last decade. This is really worth people's money! <br /> <br /> I also found the most fascinating and interesting side of the abyss and deep water. It was amazing to discover that the team of the "blue planet" has discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life! <br /> <br /> In this documentary, Attemborough has almost certainly earned its reputation. <br /> <br /> It was a masterpiece and will always be considered one of the best modern documentaries <br /> <br /> Many congratulations to the team of the "blue planet".
