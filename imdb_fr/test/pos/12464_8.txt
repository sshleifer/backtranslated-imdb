This is both a fun and touching version of the classic tale, also very clever, not at all from the school "Me Tarzan, You Jane". <br /> <br /> This is the famous story of a child who has reached adulthood. in the jungle by the monkeys. A British titled couple (the pregnant woman) is stuck in African nature after a shipwreck. After the death of the parents, the baby is raised in the jungle by monkeys. Twenty years later, this young man (Tarzan) saves a wounded Belgian explorer and brings him back to health. The Belgian discovers the proof that his savior is the young Lord Greystoke and sends him back to his legitimate domain in Scotland, where he has to adapt to a civilized society. <br /> <br /> The film is sort of divided into two parts. In the first period, we see Tarzan in his jungle environment. Not being an expert, I do not know the realism of his description of the life of the great apes community, but it's certainly fun. For me, the most moving part is the second half, when Tarzan must meet his real family, develop his language skills and adapt to the aristocratic British society, while courting Jane (Andie MacDowell). He is described as a "noble savage," whether in nature or in the elegant Edwardian salons. On the other hand, the upper part of the crust is described as being often much more barbaric than the jungle left by Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert is fantastic in his likeable portrait of Tarzan both in the jungle and in civilized environments. It expresses a real sense of confusion and conflict, torn between two very different worlds, its family of great apes of origin and its new human world. Sir Ralph Richardson, one of the ancient British legends, is as brilliant as ever in the role of Tarzan's grandfather, the sixth Earl of Greystoke. <br /> <br /> The film focuses more on Tarzan's difficulties in adapting to civilization and on his inner conflict than on his exploits in the jungle. This unusual version of the old classic makes it a typical dramatic adventure but also, above all, a moving personal story. I was not surprised to note here that its director is the same individual, Hugh Hudson, who also directed Chariots of Fire, another brilliant film.
