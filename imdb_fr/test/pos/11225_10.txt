It is a rare and beautiful spectacle, an allegory of death and transfiguration that is neither a preaching nor a mawkish. A work of mature and courageous insight, Northfork avoids the distinction of art and essay by refusing to belong to a genre. Unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison, 1987 of Wim Wenders of Desire (Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin), it maintains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum ranging from mundane to supernatural. This history of eminent terrestrial and celestial domains of the American West retains the literal fairy tale character that characterized his German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels losing their wings with obsequious sentimentalism. His celestial transcendence, whether inspired by a painful faith or animated by a feverish dream, never separates from crud and rot. This solid foundation is very popular with authors and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
