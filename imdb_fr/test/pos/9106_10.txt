That's the only thing I can look back at since 2006 and say now that it has rocked. It rocked hard, and yet it moved as well. Mr.MEATLOAF added a nice little touch to this film dish even before the opening credits were recorded. Now that it tells you something, this movie has rocked even before it started! Now, I do not want to do too much, nor be a spoiler, but this movie is rock! If you've heard the new album and thought about it yourself "it sounds a bit like Tenacious material, it's like I'm just playing badminton with Satan, what's up?" Then, this movie will increase your appreciation of music and marvel at this satanic masterpiece. For those who would like it better, I do not know what they want because better would no longer be the D. This movie is period D. So venture out if you dare the local movie theater if you want your socks be cradled.
