On several levels, it's fine. In fact, since it was a British independent low-budget film, directed by a feature filmmaker for the first time composed of many neophytes, it is a magnificent achievement. I do not know how much it costs. The figure of £ 8,000 has been mentioned in advertising, but you never know how reliable this figure is. The fact is that this film seems to cost two million pounds and it clearly costs a tiny fraction of these remarkable special effects, superb scenery, effective accessories and costumes, excellent photography, a good game actor and director, Sound mixing absolutely beautiful. Even after saying that, a lot of the scenario was great. The characters were clearly identified and all had something to do. It's a movie about ten men all dressed in pretty much the same way and it would be easy for them to be nameless virgins, but it's ten characters - most of them were made through dialogue and their reaction to things. Throughout the intermediate act, as the plot unfolded, the storyline told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole movie looked like the second act, it would be stunning. <br /> <br /> Before the ship explodes, twelve people go into individual evacuation pods or "e-pods" that move away from the ship. They are not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor turf plates inside are trapped, cramped and have no clear idea of ​​where they are going - but that makes sense. I like e-pods - they are a great idea and they make more sense than a good, spacious exhaust capsule. I also like the way we are told later, more specifically, that they are designed to escape from ship to ship but can quite cause the fall of the planet in an emergency - because, let's look at On the other hand, these guys were lucky that their ship was destroyed. so close to a planet. That said, it does not seem to me that there are still 116 e-pods unused on the freighter and one has to wonder how the prisoner can get into an e-pod - but he does. (And I just thought of myself: would not the captain have had to get off with his ship rather than being the first to get out of there?) Anyway, the e-pods will all land on a sterile planet with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation - or at least on a part of the sparse, sparsely vegetated planet, which may contain icy wastes and lush forests elsewhere. No, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it will be exactly the same everywhere. We must accept that all e-pods fall within a few kilometers of each other, so that the ten survivors can meet and shoot flares in the sky to locate each other. <br /> <br /> The captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could make a very good career in action movies if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try to contact Captain Behan with whom they intended to surrender. But they can not do it from the planet, they have to go into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units of two e-pods, they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift up on anti-gravity cups high enough to blow up above the atmosphere. Everything can be done automatically but it will take a "driver" to send the signal. The captain valiantly doomed to action, but in a laudable and reasonable movement, underlines the engineer who insists that placing the heavier man in the e-pod repaired somewhat crazy is ridiculous and that he must be the lightest member of the team. He's a kid. I really liked the way he now says his name is David and the captain starts using it, treating him with dignity and respect. It was a good narration and a good characterization.
