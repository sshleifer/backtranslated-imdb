So, WWE did it. They went into the film, the first being See No Evil, featuring their own Kane. I caught this movie and I did not expect it to be a good movie ... It just sounded clich√© and did not look like anything new. To my surprise, it was actually not that bad. A viewer said above that it's a good B-horror movie, and that's really the best way to describe it. Now the question I was asking was how Kane was going to hold on ... Well, let's just say that he made the fat ass of the "Jacob Goodnight" character. He sold the role very well and looked really threatening. But what can you expect from someone who is about 7 feet tall and weighs about 320 kg of muscle strength? The acting was decent and the story was not new, of course, but we all know it. The staging and cinematography were very well done and the backdrop of the hotel looked really run down and well done. Considering that this was done by a porn movie director, I was quite surprised. I would recommend this film if you are looking for gore and thoughtless killing and just fun in general. Think of this film as a modern day, Friday 13. And save space for the end too, because it's a good one. And stay after the credits too ...
