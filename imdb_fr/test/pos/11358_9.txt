Superb and charming. Justin Henry is handsome as an unhappy and mischievous Howard Kaylan, lead singer of the band's top ten hits, The Turtles. The real magic is the title sequence with an academy reward worthy of Royale Watkins. A performance that completely captures Jimi Hendrix's mystic and yet down-to-earth. Incredibly, few films can find the essence of a special moment in a life and an era. I would like this to be available at any point of sale home video without hassle. Uh ... what's the problem? <br /> <br /> Thanks Eddie. A valuable addition to the story of the sixties psychedelic. A definitive twinkle in the eyes of the mind.
