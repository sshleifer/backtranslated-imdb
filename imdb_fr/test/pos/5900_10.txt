In 2004, I wrote the following statements on a IMDb bulletin board when a user wondered if the film The Best Years of Our Life was a forgotten film: <br /> <br /> ***** For me, watching this movie is like opening a time capsule. I think that in many ways, "The Best Years of Our Life" is probably one of the most fascinating character studies and is extremely resilient to life in the United States in the mid-1940s after the Second World War World. I believe that "Coming Home" and "The Deer Hunter", both released in 1978, are the most recent films that have been the closest by capturing the many problems of soldiers returning from war and discussed in "The best years of our lives ". . <br /> <br /> What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was at university around 1980-1981 and many, if not all, students were applauding end of the film. <br /> <br /> This film is still successful and I am very happy to read in other publications that other users feel that their film stands the test of time. ***** <br /> <br /> I am very happy to see the movie ranked among the 100 best films on IMDb and AFI. Also, although it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, it's a wonderful life. We can say that the Oscar victories of the best years of our lives, including the best film, were well deserved. <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie in 2005 and, after almost 60 years, The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful film, beautifully interpreted and well designed.
