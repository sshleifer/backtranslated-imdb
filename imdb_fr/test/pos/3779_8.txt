Chaplin is a doughboy in his latest film of 1918, a doughboy who seems to have trouble understanding. He spent time "there" in the trenches of the First World War. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese is an improvised grenade. The narrow quarters of the barracks in the trenches and the fact that Chaplin and his companions are washed from their bunks by the floods are the highlights. Chaplin eventually captured several German soldiers alone, and he spanked the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he has surrounded them. Chaplin hides behind enemy lines like a tree, and these scenes are really fun. He escapes into a bombed house where he meets a French woman played by Edna Purviance. He is tracked down by German soldiers, he escapes them again and Purviance is arrested for helping him. Chaplin is able to shoot a fast by crushing a soldier and using the soldier's uniform. He ends up saving Purviance of course and capturing the Kaiser in the process. Along the way, Chaplin uses gags and slaps to get German soldiers back. With this film, Chaplin explored filming opportunities while keeping the public's attention during a feature film, which his contract with Mutual Film Corporation denied him. The film also allowed him to make fun of the enemy, which he would do even more effectively in The Great Dictator. *** of 4 stars.
