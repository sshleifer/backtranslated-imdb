I have seen this movie since I was a little girl and I come from New York and I remember how people lived at the time, it reminded me a lot of good memories. This film is not only about wanting a fairy tale end, but also about understanding the challenges of becoming a better person, woman and supplier, which Claudine has tried to do. It was the social protection system putting women in a constraining situation. It was the injustice of a system that invaded and forced a family to stay afloat. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and was well deserved. If you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments, enjoy Claudine. As a spectator, your goal is to keep an open mind and understand the general frustration.
