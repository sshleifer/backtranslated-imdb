Being in the suburbs of New York when the Z-Boys created the story at Dogtown, I was only exposed to a glimpse of what was happening. I had a Black Knight P-O-S skateboard with clay wheels. He left for a long time and on the ashes of my personal life. But I never forgot. It's like looking at brothers and friends who have been lost for a long time, and it strikes me where I live. I can not watch this movie enough. Every time I see it, another aspect rises to the top, another point of view becomes clear. Vintage images, huge still images, current personalities entangled in the bright shadows of a luminous past, the story sincere and not too finished, all beautifully mounted together to make a historical documentary of a true slice of American history . In the words of Glen Friedman - "It was amazing."
