This is the best of the films (so far) that Christopher Guest has created with his very talented performers. Previously, they had made the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and after BEST IN SHOW, they had made the very pleasant A MIGHTY WIND. As for their latest film, YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less we say, the better. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a documentary on dog shows and on several competitors in particular. You follow these few dogs chosen from the preparations before the show until the big night when one of them is chosen from the best of the show at the fictional "Mayflower Kennel Club". However, none of these people is a true dog show enthusiast, but a talented actor who improvises parodies many types of people you meet in the world of dog show. Surprisingly, even though the characters are rather odd, the characters they parody are very truthful - like decades ago, I had some experience with dog shows and it's a VERY ruthless group of people! My favorite dog owners were the extremely tense and tense yuppie couple who only breathed anger and volatility. I also liked the openly gay couple because they were terribly funny and intelligent. However, the best performance probably does not come from one of the couples but Fred Willard who played the role of presenter the most stupid and the least talented in the history of humanity. His comments were uniformly stupid and often betrayed his people as an incredibly stupid person - how would he become the announcer of such a prestigious show? The other competitors presented were also quite amusing - the high-end poodle handler and his wealthy owner, the farmer and his dog, and the "parents" of Winkie who could barely get together enough to get to the show. <Br/> <br /> Despite the improvisational style of film making, all the pieces fit together perfectly and tell a very entertaining and captivating story - a story that is NOT just for dog owners. Outstanding acting has made it one of the best comedies of the last decade. Smart and always funny. <br /> <br /> By the way, try to find it on DVD because the extras were really worth it. Although it was a bit of a pain to watch, I loved seeing Harlan Pepper and his collection of beach balls in particular!
