It was almost horrible, but China's syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when, at the time of its theatrical release, the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant occurred. I still remember that the attention of the whole country was glued to the hourly bulletins that came out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And you would not know, a China Syndrome scientist described the worst scenario that could make a region as large as the state of Pennsylvania uninhabitable. <br /> <br /> Less than ten years later, in Ukraine, at Chernobyl, the Soviet Union of its last days faced such a crisis that was not corrected as soon as possible. The syndrome of China is again a relevant film. <br /> <br /> It's more about cutting corners for safety than being anti-nuclear. Jack Lemmon is a man who has spent his entire life in nuclear energy as a captain of an atomic energy submarine. What makes him angry and pushes him to create the confrontation that culminates in the film is the stupidity and greed of business leaders. Stupidity and greed are products that are found every day. The problem with them is that there are places where it can be less tolerated in human society. <br /> <br /> Lemmon co-stars with two or three Hollywood kids, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a TV News reporter who is constantly assigned to reporting and is just in a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs. Hiding by his own station and his subsequent meeting with Lemmon triggered the chain of events described in The China Syndrome. <br /> <br /> The best scene in Fonda I thought was with Peter Donat, an information officer with his station. Take a look at his facial expressions as Donat emphasizes the importance of the story and condescendingly tells him that his very beauty forces him to stick to the flushes. Fonda knows that she has something and stays true to her. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays his iconoclastic cameraman, it's a typical role for him at the time. In his tribute to his father, Kirk Douglas, of the MTC, Michael said he had opted for sensitive roles. I could have seen a young Kirk Douglas in this part. <br /> <br /> What about energy for industrialized and post-industrial countries, a thorny issue that will preoccupy our government for another two generations? This film shows what can happen with a nuclear addiction. Our current geopolitical problems in the world come partly from dependence on fossil fuels, especially oil. Everything we use has unintended consequences. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the real hero of the film is Wilford Brimley, Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear plant. In the end, Brimley really got to work. <br /> <br /> See China's syndrome to know what I'm talking about.
