The Apartment is, I think, a very useful Hitchcockian movie. The plot was full of symbolism (that is, white and red roses) and twists and turns of intrigues that wrapped perfectly. The look was very Parisian and brought you closer to history. I saw it in London and I very much regret that it is not in video in the United States.
