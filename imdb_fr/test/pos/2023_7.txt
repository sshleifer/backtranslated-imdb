So, do you want to be a rock star? See this film. You do not like rock, you say? Or are you really in heavy metal? So put on your favorite album and dream, this movie has nothing to offer. I rarely saw a film that could represent the dream of being part of a rock band. I had long hair in the late '80s and early' 90s and I've been playing guitar for about fifteen years. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes. The music is good, not great, the actors are good and credible, even Jennifer Aniston plays her role to perfection. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as a budding rock singer. So you know what you are going to get. A film about dreams that become reality, about which we can walk and finally about real life. It's a good seventh out of ten, no more, no less.
