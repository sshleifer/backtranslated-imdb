David "master of the air" Niven plays the Big Boss (IVAN) which attacks the ill-fated Richard Jordan (PINKY) by forcing the unlucky former prisoner to exploit his new position in a bank. Elke Sommer (Miss PELHAM) most effectively provides the female interest, which Pinkie simply can not resist. <br /> <br /> It seems they have not been able to choose a name for this movie. is logical ??? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this turns out to be one of the last roles of Niven. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is fun and worth watching if you manage to get one. of his rare or last television sessions. <br /> <br />
