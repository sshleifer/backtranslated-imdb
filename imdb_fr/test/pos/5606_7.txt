Although this is not Hal Hartley's best work (my favorite is "Surviving Desire"), there is still a lot to be said about this movie, especially for Hartley's dialogue fans. Even for a new audience at Hartley, I would definitely recommend this film rather than the sophomoric "Dogma". This film is smarter, more faithful to its sources (the Bible) and more fun than any other apocalypse film before the millennium. <br /> <br /> This film is part of the French film "2000 Vu Par." (2000 By Vu) series; as such, it may even be a low budget film than Hartley's other works. While the need for simple scenes shot with a digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem of this film is the unfortunate overuse of the fuzzy / unstable effect. I would be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again; especially in the beginning, it almost makes the film impregnable. But neglect this flaw and you'll get a good movie. Magdalena (played by P.J. Harvey) is particularly remarkable and tells how Jesus saved her from stoning; a short scene that I found surprisingly moving. (Despite the fact that this is NOT Mary Magdalene, the woman in the Bible was not named.) <br /> <br />
