It's been a long time since the last time someone created a movie like this. A so-called movie B. It may not have been a good movie, but it's fun to watch, the classic Bruce Cambell, he has his good sides, his funny roles, those who are disgusting, even the roles artistic. ****** Spoiler Ahead ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---- --------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------- <br /> <br /> The part where his wife as a mannequin-robot-avenger is on I did not know about you, but it made me feel so weird, so sad and disgusted. I compare this scene to the scene of the Fly 2 where his dog dies like a monster. Make you think oh my god. <br /> <br /> ---------------- ------------------- ------- ------------------- ------------------------ ------ - ------------------------- <br /> <br /> ******** No more Spoilers ****** *** <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Bruce Cambell, you definitely want to have this movie in your collection. If you are generally interested in movies, you may want to. Just think that the purpose of the film is to make you smile, to disgust you (do not worry so badly) and to have a good time with your friends. Attention, I said friends, impossible future girlfriend.
