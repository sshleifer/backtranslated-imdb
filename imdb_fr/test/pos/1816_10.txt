Leaving aside the "I'm so sure" and "totally awesome", this is one of the sweetest and most true romances ever. Deborah Foreman (where is she now?) Like julie and nicolas cage like randy are as classic as romeo and juliet, tony and maria, jake and samantha ... you can not help but fall in love with them. the soundtrack - plimsouls, sparks, furs, flirts and of course, modern English - is also remarkable. for fans of young love movies, I would also recommend David Gordon Green's recent film All Real Girls.
