Fran√ßois Villon was a true poet and thug who lived in Paris in the 15th century. However, most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually a fiction - a play created in the early twentieth century. While in the film he met and became friends with Louis XI, he actually died in his thirties and was never involved in any intrigues as he was in this movie. In reality, he wrote beautiful verses and was often on the wrong side of the law - not the combination of a patriot and a character resembling Robin Hood, as he is in the movie. If you know that the film contains almost 100% fiction, then it's worth to be seen - do not assume it's a good history lesson. <br /> <br /> In THE BELOVED ROGUE, Villon is played with a wild abandon by John Barrymore. I was also very happy to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was the brave dwarf, has starred in tons of movies over the years and has had a very long career. Slim Summerville was a known actor to add a touch of comedy to the movies. Mack Swain is best known as the silent movie in many of Chaplin's short films and plays his partner in THE GOLD RUSH. The four men did a good job and have no complaints, even with Barrymore's somewhat excessive treatment reminiscent of Douglas Fairbanks' performance. However, the performance with which I had a serious problem was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. To call it "not subtle" would be an understatement. He played the role of a high school student who thought he was supposed to be the stereotype of Richard III - gargling and behaving like a demonic caricature. Although Veidt has been wonderful in many movies (both silent and sound) but here it is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As for history, it's full of adventures and action scenes - like a narrow film, minus the sailing boat. The sets worked well for all this because they had been used the year before for THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Both films were shot around the same period. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of the last great silent movies. There is a lot to love and the film is a beautiful combination of romance, comedy and action. It's worth seeing, even if it loses some points because of Veidt's over-responsiveness and the way the film plays fast with the story. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film was also shot twice in a row. KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closer to the original piece. However, in total, six films were dedicated to Villon and tell, more or less, variants of the same story!
