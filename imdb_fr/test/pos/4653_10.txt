I would love to see the cast and crew make an audio commentary on this movie! All the places they went to film this movie! Should plan very good anecdotes! Fans of this film would like to know: <br /> <br /> What kind of permission did they allow them to film in certain places? <br /> <br /> Have there been memorable outings? <br /> <br /> Are there any scenes that have been deleted? <br /> <br /> What are the challenges facing the cast and the team? <br /> <br /> Have actors had dubbing? "How was the collaboration with the other members of the cast? <br /> <br /> Are the scenes released? <br /> <br /> What are the responsibilities of cast members and cast members? of the team? now? <br /> <br /> Which places are still present, and which locations are no longer where are now a different activity? <br /> <br /> It's a thing to read anecdotes about this movie this site and other websites, but there is no comparison to get it directly from the horse's mouth! <br /> <br /> Come on guys! Get together and make a comment! Never go away from a challenge! Go for the gusto!
