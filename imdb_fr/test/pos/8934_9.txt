I always liked Brenda Blethyn and "Undertaking Betty" was not a disappointment. I saw it on Satellite the dull Sunday morning. Life has been stressful and this film made me laugh and see things that we usually view as disastrous in a joyful way. I wish she made more movies like this and "Saving Grace". Brenda Blethyn is a great girl who is approaching 60 years old. She is cute, beautiful and full of life, with nothing plastic or fake. There are not many actresses to whom we can speak realistically, but also comic and / or serious. Brenda - if you see that - continue like this. We need more Mrs. Bennetts, Bettys and Graces.
