This HTV series is beautiful. I highly recommend watching the movie. It has everything you need: a remarkable scenario, strong characters, beautiful landscapes and an exceptional atmosphere. Add an ambient Clannad note and you'll get an unforgettable image. I love all the HTV adventure films I've seen: Return To Treasure Island, smuggler, adventurer, but Robin from Sherwood beats them all. I would like to thank the entire production team of HTV and Richard Carpenter in particular for giving me a lot of adventures and thrills. I have the DVD release in my small collection of movies. I very much regret that such films are no longer made.
