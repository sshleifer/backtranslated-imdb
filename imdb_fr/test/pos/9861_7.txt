OK, if you think the film a few days now, it would not be appropriate. If you were watching FI now on the stage and that everything was pretty cheese (I agree), but all the movies of the 80s were not like that (Gilligan, Wonderwoman, etc.). But also, the people born between the early and mid-1970s or before have a cult status. Whenever the plane was approaching, Tattoo ran up to the tower and his accent shouted "Da Plane BOSS Da Plane" and you would wonder what everyone would like. People born in the mid-80s or later would not want to understand the hippie because if you look at it now.It does not have a Harry Potter, FX animation on Jurassic Park.It was just a step where you could almost see the thread attached to a guy who wanted to fly.But for us during that time, it was a fantastic island.
