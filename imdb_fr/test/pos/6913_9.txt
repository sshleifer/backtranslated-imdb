I thought Rachel York was fantastic as "Lucy". I saw it in "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Victor / Victoria" too, and in each of these performances, she developed very different and very real characterizations. It's a chameleon that can play (and sing) anything! <br /> <br /> I am very surprised at the number of negative reviews published here about Rachel's performance in "Lucy". Even some genuine critics of television and entertainment seem to have missed the purpose of his portrait. So many people have focused on the fact that Rachel does not really look like Lucy. My answer to that is, "so what?" I was not looking for a superficial imitation of Lucy. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And Rachel certainly gave us that, in depth. I also did not want to see someone simply "doing" Lucy's classic routines. Therefore, I am very happy with the decision of the producers and director to have Rachel represent Lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory. (It seems that some critics did not realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsals and not skits). I thought this approach gave an innovative twist to sketches that many of us know by heart. I also thought that Rachel was terribly cool and funny in these scenes. And she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the Professor and the Grape Stomping, in particular. There was a moment in the Grape scene where the corner of Rachel's mouth had the exact little recovery that I remember having had with Lucy. I could not believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally. <br /> <br /> I wonder if many of those who criticized the performance expected to see the Lucille Ball of "I Love Lucy" throughout the film. whole movie. After all, those of us who only knew her on television would have no idea what Lucy was like when she started out in the movies. I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character who was brilliant. She planted all the good seeds so we could see the clown just waiting to emerge, given the right set of circumstances. Lucy did not fit the mold of the old studio system. In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era, she continued to repress what would become her ultimate gift. <br /> <br /> I believe that Rachel has skillfully captured comedy, drama, wit, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sex appeal, self-absorption, childishness and stoicism all in a complex American icon. And she did it with a totally endearing authenticity and freshness. "Lucy" was a star for Rachel York. I hope this will bring him an avalanche of big roles in the future. I also hope it brings him an Emmy.
