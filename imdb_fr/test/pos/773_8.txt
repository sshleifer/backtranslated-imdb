A sweet and funny story of a 17-year-old boy, controlled by a dominant religious mother and a retired father, and how he finds himself in his work with a retired, eccentric and tragic actress. Very well done, especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of teenager, showing that his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter film series. Laura Linney plays her ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption, so there is no place to love her at all. But the film is a very entertaining film, made by the British in the style of Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls.
