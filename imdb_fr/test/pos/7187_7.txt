This film is much better than the first "Asterix and Obelix against Caesar", but it is far from perfection. The adaptation of the comic is good, some images and dialogues of the film are the same as in the book. But few things made the film as interesting as the animated film released in 1968. For example, the fighting between Numerobis and Amonbofis. It was neither necessary nor even credible, no more for Asterix's little love story. There were also missing items, such as the animated film songs, and other things ... The movie deceives me because they inserted what I expected to see and they showed things I did not want. or needed to see. I know it would have been very difficult to make the film exactly the same as the cartoon or animated film, but that's what I expected. In conclusion, even if the film is good, I still prefer the animated film, which is in my opinion much better.
