The Kinks warned against media heroes. Apart from movies, most heroes are also "ordinary people". Society requires role playing, but what happens when it extends to the parent-child relationship? Do some parents try to improve through their children rather than the other way around? How do you provide a model but not a role? A brilliant swimmer who hates swimming; a brilliant musician who will not play. Shifted, funny (despite the description of "serious" problems), very good multidimensional game on the part of all. Many twists complete the emotional tension. Celluloid heroes do not feel pain. I do not remember being disappointed by a Sigourney Weaver movie (I even liked "The Village"!).
