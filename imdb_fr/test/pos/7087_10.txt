Written by someone who went there, you can tell, but only if you went there. Excellent performances by Meryl Streep (of course!), De Renee Zellweger and William Hurt. <br /> <br /> Many people said it was a dysfunctional family. torment. NOT being dysfunctional would be dysfunctional! You lose your family as you know, can anything be worse? People need to see this movie, so when they face this nightmare, they may change the way they do it. Perhaps they will see that the father refuses precious time to which he will never have the opportunity again. Maybe they will realize how difficult it is to die or watch someone you love die. They did not miss the nightmare, hard to forget.
