This film was clearly a first attempt for a new director, but it still managed to be original and entertaining as well as at times to reflect. However, I must say that the story would not have been so clear without the remarkable performance of Paul Anthony as Pip. He made the parts well written very credible and emotional, and the parts more weakly written much more bearable. In addition, I must mention the performance of Alan Cumming. It was refreshing to see him in a game like this. He brought a weight to his role that provided a very basic element to the film. As for Paul Anthony: Who is this guy? Why did not I see more of him? Someone gives him more roles, please!
