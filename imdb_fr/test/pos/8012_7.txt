me and a couple of friends from the university - alberto lopez, dave hall, celina alcock (we graduated from uea, norwich, united kingdom in 1997), we always meet to watch quality B movies once a month. <br /> <br /> We are seasoned experts in the field of bad film making, and this film was quickly ranked in the top 10 terrible / brilliant films. <br /> <br /> DROID GUNNER, aka PHOENIX 2, is the movie for you! Marc Singer is fully aware that he is in the turkey of a movie here and is treating him for all he can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his wooden play and muscular moronity (is that a word ??) while he grumbles "But I want my 20,000!" Pure Shlock Gold! If you liked it, see also TRANCERS, THE RUNESTONE, DOLLMAN and all that is written by Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray ..... (but know that some of their films are completely devoid of merit and that you scream those lost hours of your life !!!?!).
