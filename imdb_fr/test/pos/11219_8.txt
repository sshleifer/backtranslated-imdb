NORTHFORK is above all a masterpiece of big screen cinematography. For this one thing, the film is well worth its time. The steep, open plains and badlands of eastern Montana are captured in the light, dark tones of fall or early spring. The gigantic gray cement Fort Peck Dam is the protagonist of the film. The film comments with subtlety and subtlety a dozen issues of Western Landscape. Dialogue can sometimes be difficult, but images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film. The 50's is working so well here and running so well. I think that the passing years will be good for this film.
