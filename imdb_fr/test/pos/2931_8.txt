The next American supermodel is a good show, it helps people in their careers, but lately I have been bored. <br /> <br /> Cycle 1: Yeah, I'm glad Adrienne won, I wanted her to win. the beginning. <br /> <br /> cycle 2: it's a shame, I think Mercedes deserved it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 3: I did not like Eva, but I did not like most girls in this cycle. <br /> <br /> cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. I do not know what they saw in Naima, but I really know what they saw in Kahlen. <br /> <br /> Cycle 5: Like Cycle 3, it was not a big cycle either. but on all the girls, NICOLE as a winner? eww! <br /> <br /> Cycle 6: I loved Sara and Joanie, but Danielle has no problem either. <br /> <br /> cycle 7: Caridee certainly deserved it. <br /> <br /> cycle 8: no, I did not want Jaslene to win. I did not like him. I have seen other girls in this cycle with significantly more potential than she, although I have not seen much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> good show, I just saw it too many times to love it even more:
