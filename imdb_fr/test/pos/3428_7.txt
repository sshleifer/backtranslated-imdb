An interesting comedy, taking place on a train from Stockholm to Berlin in December 1945. One can not help regretting the poor writer / critic who leaves his job and jumps on the train to Berlin. His ambition is to make a difference and to participate in the construction of the new united Europe after the war. <br /> <br /> I like the film's black and white format, as well as the closed decor of a moving train. <br /> <br /> Robert Gustafsson makes a classic "Gustafsson role" in this film. If you are a fan of him, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> The philosopher Wittgenstein, through his maxim: "We can never assume that anything is what it seems to be", is quoted several times the film.
