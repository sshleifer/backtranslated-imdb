I liked this Columbo film for its atmosphere, which looked like a thriller and its approach sometimes reminded me of the film noir, in the film its first 30 minutes or so. It's really cool and old-fashioned, with the right camera angles and the use of light. That's not to say instantly that this film is brilliant, but it's solid enough to consider it a good Columbo movie starter. It's definitely a better movie than the average of the "later" movies of Columbo. <br /> <br /> 26 years after his previous appearance in Columbo, George Hamilton is back again to take on the lead role against Peter Falk, again as a murderer, in a totally different and new role of course. I liked him in his role and he was a good "villain" of Columbo, who gave a good competition to the good old lieutenant. They had some nice sequences together. The problem with Columbo's new "modern" films had always been that he was not staging a well-known actor alongside Peter Falk. This film obviously does not suffer from this problem. But I must say however that this film does not present Peter Falk at his best. He certainly has better interpreted the character and his performance is not consistent enough in this film, which is probably also his director, Daryl Duke, who also directed the film really terrible "Tai-Pan", among many other projects . . <br /> <br /> The story is pretty good and nice, but the fact that the same kind of plot to hide the murder has been used in a previous Columbo movie does not help either. It was already used in the 1975 film "Columbo: Playback". Nevertheless, of course, there are still many "original" moments in its history, even if, of course, each Columbo film is more or less identical. But that's what made the Columbo series so great and consistent. If it is not broken, do not correct it. <br /> <br /> It is also true that in this film, more clues than usual are left out for the lieutenant, which does not mean that the film is his most stupid or sloppy murderer but I see him more as writers more enthusiastic than others. This does not make the film or story bad and, in fact, perhaps even more enjoyable to see Columbo working hard and discovering all sorts of small but important clues. Fortunately, the film is also filled with an effective and fun comedy that relieves Columbo. <br /> <br /> Simply a good entry into the late Columbo movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
