"Tourist Trap" is a really scary low-budget horror movie that will surely satisfy the horror fans. It contains an extremely strange atmosphere and there are quite annoying moments of total terror and fear. Some scenes are frankly strange, for example, there is a scene Chuck Connors sits down to dinner with a model who comes alive and begins to converse with him before his head falls. There is very little gore, but the violence is strong enough for the PG-rated horror movie. The models look very sinister and the climax is horrible. David Schmoeller has returned to make several other genre films. including "Crawlspace", "Puppet Master" and "Netherworld" .Still "Tourist Trap" is definitely his best horror movie, so if you want to be scared gem a look.9 out of 10.
