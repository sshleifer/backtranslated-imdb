This Norwegian film begins with a man jumping over the subway and apparently committing suicide. But the next scene shows him arriving in a desert on an isolated bus. He meets a man and is sent to a mysterious city where he starts working in a modern aseptic office as an accountant. The colleagues seem nice, but if he is watched, he quickly meets a girlfriend, but the city seems quite strange. The food has no taste, alcohol does not make you drunk and children are rare. Is it a dream or is it in heaven or hell? Although, sometimes, the film looks like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone (even at ninety minutes, the movie seems a bit long), it's quite challenging. The best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal, as when people engage in mundane conversations about interior design and come back to deeper problems. I have always thought that there is something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies, in the way they try to suppress the fundamental drives of human nature. And this film is the best when it devastatively criticizes this lifestyle. Unfortunately, the film is long and the director does not seem to know how to finish it, but most of the time, it is worth seeing.
