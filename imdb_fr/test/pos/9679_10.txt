If Family Guy offends you or if you do not just get the humor, unfortunately, this show makes fun of you and the masses of overly religious, monotonous and politically correct people in America. So put your moral aside and have fun with this show. FG is a hilarious revelation of the reality of today's society. Whoever said that this program is intended for a young and immature audience is mistaken enormously. With all the references to old movies and politics 10 to 80 years ago, I could not imagine a young immature child finding that funny. Family Guy is definitely aimed at a mature, open-minded audience that is not afraid to criticize American society. Hats off to Seth and the entire team who have made this show a reality.
