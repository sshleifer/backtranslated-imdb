Hynkel, dictator of Tomania, is a spoiled child who gets angry when he can not get what he really wants ... And what he wants is simply nothing less than the world ... In one of the extraordinary scenes of Chaplin's art, Hynkel plays a ballet with the "world" that explodes when he thinks he has it in his hands ... <br /> <br /> Chaplin also has some biting words about the war and his films. In a scene at the beginning of the film, which takes place during the First World War, the Tomanian messenger crashes on the plane and thinks ... He is about to die ... In a state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words ... The empty double language continues to rise in a brilliant takeoff of all the heroic death scenes of war movies ... <br /> <br /> In another scene where he becomes a fugitive in the Jewish ghetto and takes control of the resistance provoking rebellion among the old men, he plans to kill the dictator ... One of the members of the group must kill the ruthless conqueror of Austerlich ... Whoever is chosen there will die naturally, but her heroic death will be rewarded and her name will shine like a star in Tomanian's story ... <br /> <br /> The sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream cakes containing pieces to determine which one should sacrifice his life to murder the dictator is a bitter hilarity filled with great fear ... <br /> <br /> Despite all its disappointing shortcomings, "The Great Dictator" is still an important film for the ironic tones of the film adding some something that neither Chaplin nor more could have given him: the irony of history ... The need to assassinate Hynkel presages the assassination attempt against Hitler by his generals ... The strength of the original satire is exceeded only by the historical imitation art ... <br /> <br /> With a magnificent sequence like the duck shooting accident that led the dictator to be confused with the humbly Jewish barber and vice versa, "The Grand Dictator "is Chaplin's first talking film .. This time," Charles "and not" Charlie "want his film and not through a funny comedy, the last one in which he uses his famous character" Tramp Character ".
