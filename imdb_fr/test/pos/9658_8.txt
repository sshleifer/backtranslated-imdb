Satisfactory fantasy with ships sailing in the clouds with cannons, evil tracers, strange landscapes, manipulations of time, great scenery, devoid of reality, perhaps like Never Ending Story or something Merlin. If you like that, you'll love it. Christine Taylor is beautiful. Fighting with the sword is bogus. The music is delicious. The good wins, they kiss, everything is fine and the cook is delighted.
