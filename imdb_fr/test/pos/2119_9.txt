Not all movies are worthy of an Oscar, but let's be honest: sometimes, these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This one left me smiling and happy and I could not wait to kiss my own son. Anyone who has had a pet (no matter the type) knows how it feels to lose one. I think most people would identify with Buddy, almost losing his best friend he has raised since birth. Bruce Willis was great when the mogul became nice and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother. The little boy who played Buddy had a cherubic face and his sister and friend Edgar played an extraordinary safeguarding role. I loved the movie and it was something the whole family could enjoy. Thank you!
