I'm a huge fan of Tenacious D, and I think it's not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining. It's not laugh-a-minute but it's not what the D had planned. I went into the movie watching all the programs of the HBO channel, I memorized both albums and it made it even more enjoyable. Lots of jokes inside old Tenacious D albums and HBO shows. Since I already knew the new album, I knew the 40 minutes of the film because it was a musical. I would say he has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best 5 last minutes of any movie. Hands down. <br /> <br /> See this movie now!
