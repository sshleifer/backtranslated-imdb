In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story travels the screen with epic proportions at the height of the vast desert areas against which it is placed. It is a film that claims that you do not choose love, but that it is love that makes the choice, no matter who, where and when; and in addition, it is a question of heart often subordinated to prevailing conditions and circumstances. And this is the situation in The English Patient, directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune moments and times, proving that love will be predestined when he will be predestined. <br /> <br /> It's the Second World War; Flying over the African desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane being confused with an enemy plane. And although he survived the crash, he is badly burned. However, to his great happiness, he is saved by a tribe of nomads and finds himself hospitalized. But the existing conditions are governed by the circumstances of the war and Almasy quickly becomes one of the many patients transported by convoy to another facility. Arrived in Italy, he is too weak and sick to continue and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), decides to stay with him in an abandoned monastery. <br /> <br /> Hana soon discovers that his charge is something of a man of mystery, as Almasy does not remember anything of his past, not even of his own name. Designed to be English, the only clues about who he is are contained in a book he found after the crash, but they are as cryptic as Hana's patient. Slowly, however, under Hana's impulse, Almasy begins to remember bits of his life and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is all the more helped by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects Almasy to be the man he was looking for - a man with whom he wants to settle an account. But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, memories of Almasy continue to surface. memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) - as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And, paralyzed in his body and in his mind, these memories become the only thing he can cling to with hope, even as his life seems to be getting farther and farther apart. <br /> <br /> In addition to the production, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from Michael Ondaatje's novel. The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of "Doctor Zhivago" and "Lawrence of Arabia" by Lean; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. In simple terms, Minghella's film is a genius made. conceived and delivered with a poetic perfection, to look at it comes back to watching Monet come to life. From the beginning of the film, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell on her audience, which links and transports, with a story of moving beauty that lives up to the captivating and vibrant vibrant and energetic images given by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer. In every sense, it is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates a truly transcendental experience. Named in twelve categories, he has rightly received nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, High Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography. <br /> <br /> If one had to choose a single word to describe "the essence" of this film, it would be "excellence". Even an extraordinary film does not, however, receive nine Oscars without extraordinary performances; and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas transcend here the term "worthy of an Oscar". Nominated for the best actor for his performance of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush received the gold medal for Shine), Fiennes has never been so successful, achieving with his character a palpable emotional depth. Private and introspective, Almasy is not, by nature, an individual with whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds the way to open this emotional door just enough to let you in, enough for you to taste the honest passion that invades her. And it works. Almasy does not seek your friendship; however, he will gain your compassion. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas also received an Oscar nomination for best actress (Frances McDormand received the award for "Fargo") for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose Stoic figure masks emotional conflict raging in her, born of the forbidden passion which enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, getting rid of her chains of repression to embrace a love so strong that it threatens to devour her. The reserve Katherine has to maintain evokes public empathy, because Scott Thomas has managed to maximize the emotional depths of his character. It's the kind of performance that attracts you and holds you in suspense, beyond this curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what should be, if only for appearances, and allows you to experience a real sense of unbridled passion. Sober and subtle with subtlety, it's a great job of Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> Binoche gives an astonishing and touching performance, as well as the caring nurse Hana; it is his humanity, in fact, that defines love in its purest sense and offers a balanced perspective in the context of the film. His relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) gives us a glimpse of a passion of a different kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine. `The English Patient 'is a movie that will move you emotionally and emotionally; one you will not want to see end. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
