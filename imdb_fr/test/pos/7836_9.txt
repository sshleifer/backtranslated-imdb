Forget the sneaky (and useless) comments left here by some. This series is well played, well shot, and brings a refreshing change to most TV talk. <br /> <br /> Any fool can nitpick anything. However, in this show, the characters are credible, the story is intriguing and convincing (but requires some intelligence on the part of the viewer), on the whole, it's nice, and British! (We sometimes find gems, and this is one of them). <br /> <br /> The shows last one hour each and I think they are four in number (at least I only saw four of them). The show has clearly impressed some American television channels / directors who have produced a longer series that was far from convincing despite a larger budget. <br /> <br /> If, like soap operas and reality shows, you do not like or understand Eleventh Hour.
