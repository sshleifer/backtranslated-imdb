I'm 17 years old and I'm a fan of the Muppets. Although I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Movie deserves to be among the best. It is extremely entertaining, thanks to Jerry Juhl's catchy storyline, and the film is charming, with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of songs, I really appreciated them, of course, they are not the best Muppet franchise scores, but they were very enjoyable to listen to, especially Never Before. Never Before is now one of my favorite Muppet songs with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The Muppets, as usual, were fantastic, especially the always charming Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was excellent. And what a brilliant human cast - from Bob Hope to Orson Welles, from Madeleine Kahn (the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like What's Up Doc, Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman, from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor, all of whom made memorable appearances as a guest, being careful not to overshadow the Muppets in a fantasy film. 10/10 Bethany Cox
