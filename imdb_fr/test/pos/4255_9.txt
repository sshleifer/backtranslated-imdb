I thought I was disappointed to see this movie again after so many years. On the contrary, I am more impressed now than by my honest youth and brave humor. In 1969, the transition between Afro-American groups from a predominant conciliation and integration policy to a politics of confrontation and self-determination was still new and quite controversial. It took courage and finesse to describe both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as caricatures that often brought them closer to reality. A special mention must be made to the performance of Arnold Johnson: he succeeds in preventing his character from falling into sociopathy or buffoonery. I prefer to watch that "To Sir With Love" any day!
