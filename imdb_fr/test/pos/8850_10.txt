John Carpenter's "The Thing" is without a doubt one of the best horror movies ever made. Unfortunately, as in most of Carpenter's films, this is one of the most underrated films criticized by critics shortly after its release for an almost pathetic reason. It seems that at that time people were overwhelmed by the idea of ​​the "good" alien. An idea born after the success of "I.T." And the very idea that a film dealing with extraterrestrials could deviate from this idea was considered a heresy. Human ignorance is really a scary thing, people have to judge movies for what they are not for what they want them to be. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" is in itself an interesting study on human paranoia as the American Antarctic base discovers the presence of an alien being (referenced in the film only as a "thing" ) able to imitate any form of life. Not knowing who may or may not be the creature, we see how each character reacts to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic, but a slow and gradual descent into chaos as more and more people turn out to be ... not quite human. <br /> <br /> Carpenter manages to make this movie a much bigger thing than your average Sci-Fi / Horror. There is not "what is behind you?" jumping moments here. Rather than relying on an intense atmosphere of mistrust and pre-apocalyptic despair as well as visually balanced moments of visual terror and Rob Bottin's impressive creature effects, he offers us an unparalleled experience for many others. horror films. <br /> <br /> Instead of giving us facts and plot elements, Carpenter offers us a much more progressive and delicate approach. By suggesting a sense of mystery, it gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret what has happened in certain scenes, while offering enough intrigue to those who do not like the interpretation in the movies. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone's score works all the way. Its minimalist and depressing sound perfectly matches the overall tone of the film. Although I have always wondered how would it have sounded if Carpenter (he is known to compose all the OST of his films except this one) did it? The characters, although not as deeply developed, remain memorable thanks to the good performances of the actors, notably Kurt Russel, who interprets the down-out apathetic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady. It is worth noting how his character is transformed through the film. From his disrespectful attitude "do not give ...." at the beginning, to that of a rallyer and leader of the group of men who try to fight "the thing". But even with that said, there are no fake heroes here, there are no moments of "laughing in the face of death" and there is certainly no kind of comic relief, the film keeps its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. Speaking of this, here again, Carpenter keeps his tradition of creating a powerful end. <br /> <br /> A quarter century after its release, "The Thing" does not seem dated. And with the increasingly worrying use of computer-generated effects, it seems even stronger than before because it shows the work of life and the dedication of the human being and not the computer. Combined with its opening analysis, the viewer has much more reason to watch it a second, a third, a fourth or ... once. A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.
