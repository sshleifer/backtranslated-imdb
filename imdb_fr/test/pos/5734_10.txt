I can not believe that someone attributed to this film a score of 1 !!! and this is only a 3 way ... What not to like in this movie? It's original, there are a lot of scary scenes that took me out of my seat, and there are some great special effects. The story is fresh, there is nudity and it is very campy. The killer was scary in his own way and the end is very unexpected. I must admit that I really like this film, one of the best Spanish horror films. If you consider yourself a true horror fan, you have to go there and try to find this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised to do so.
