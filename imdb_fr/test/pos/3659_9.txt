The opening night of the South Asian International Film Festival (SAIFF) in New York was an event expected by many of us. <br /> <br /> I was finally going to be able to watch "Hari Om" ?? I was tired of watching the "promo" loop and the persistent taste of Nitin Sawhney's Angel song in the promo let me pray to hear the rest. I was impressed by the visuals ?? and hugely curious how a rugged self-propelled rickshaw driver would win the hearts of a gorgeous French tourist! I remember being quite intrigued by the theme, when I read a line or two about it in the newspapers a long time ago! Especially since I had been fascinated a few years ago, how Jodhpur's rickshaws were flamboyant! The snow and the crowds outside the theater only increase my anxiety. <br /> <br /> Once inside the theater, I found that the SAIFF organizers were just a disaster. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed by the poor organization of the event. I found myself in a difficult situation. I was trying to explain and offer an apology to my friends (of different nationalities) whom I had invited to the VIP guest list. I was hoping to prove to them that Indian cinema did not always concern Bollywood ?? Finally and finally, the film started sending us fresh air. Or did I think ?? Hari Om ?? started with chaos and noise. Autorickshaws honking, traffic and lots of chaos. I found myself smiling, feeling a sense of "home" filling in me. <br /> <br /> So began the journey of Hari Om ?? an auto rickshaw driver in Jaipur? The director could not have made a better casting call with this character. From the wedding of the monsoon to Hari Om ?? Vijay Raaz, despite his appearance as a non-hero, wears this film solely on his acting skills and his interpretation of the character, full of all the nuances of a rickshaw driver from Rajasthan. He is a winner all the way. But how and where he learned to speak English even if fluently, is the question! However, his character portrays beautiful nuances of humor and sensitivity. I like his innocent portrait of a simple guy from a village ?? who has great aspirations to be famous someday ?? and yet he knows when to cut into reality. <br /> <br /> Camille, on the other hand in the movie, wears clothes that EVERYONE would not dare wear in a place like this. It's funny though that no one really seems to care too much about her dressed like that. She looks very very dazzling though! Especially in the second half of the movie, when she changes her Indian outfit. His relationship with his boyfriend, however, seems very vague. This probably adds a touch of reality to certain types of relationships. <br /> <br /> The film takes us through the most beautiful parts of Rajasthan. The surprising part is that none of the places has been portrayed otherwise than they are REALLY. You see the land, you see the primitive houses ?? you see Rajasthan exactly as it is !! Again ?? there is only one adjective that he leaves you ?? "Magnificent". <br /> <br /> This is the first director who probably knows how to describe India as it is - with the dirt, the noise and all the inconveniences of India! ?? Yet this makes it one of the most beautiful places to live. <br /> <br /> Bravo! to him for that. <br /> <br /> The only drawback of the film that I could see is the rhythm ?? I found it quite slow in some places ?? but rest assured that you will never be bored. <br /> <br /> Nitin Sawhney's film scores add a refined and highly Indian international flavor to the film. The song "Angel", which plays at a crucial moment of the film, marries wonderfully with the visual elements. <br /> <br /> I also heard that all the actors, apart from the main characters, were in fact normal people. who had never faced a camera before !! This is commendable considering most of our so-called established players ?? I still can not represent realistic characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Overall, watching this movie was a great experience ?? It's a pot of emotions. It's romance, humor ?? realism?? beautiful visuals and places ..., good music, excellent distribution ?? A PACKAGE OFFER! When I left the theater, I felt proud to be Indian ?? A few days later, I asked one of my Bulgarian friends who had watched the movie with me if he wanted to watch another Indian movie ?? and his answer was ?? "Is it better than Hari Om? If so, I'll go ... if not, I think I'll go in. From now on, Hari Om will be the reference for every Indian movie I see." Mr. Bala, are you reading?
