The biggest tragedy surrounding this very charming film is its lack of distribution in the United States. I had the chance to see this film at the Boston International Women's Film Festival and I highly recommend it to anyone who has the chance to see it. Stunning performances, a thoughtful script and excellent direction from the talented and funny Rose Troche all contribute to making this film a winner!
