This is one of those films where you have to put aside some of its obvious shortcomings (the result of the date and place of its production) and accentuate the positive. In many ways, this movie is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> Forgery parody in the summary of a line, but the most serious disadvantage for an anglophone like me was the appalling subtitles. The engraving I saw bore the 1982 Soviet "Film Export" subtitles, which systematically used inverted grammar, no doubt to give the impression of a thirteenth century discourse. The real impact of this nonsense is to make it more difficult to track subtitles, which means you spend less time watching the images. Since cinematographic images are the strength of the film, it is a real problem. <br /> <br /> Other imd-IMDB have written extensively on the Stalinist propaganda elements of this film for themselves). They also wrote a lot about the battle on the ice, which is beautiful to me. <br /> <br /> The love interest is almost completely lacking in subtlety and yet strangely ..... lacks almost as much charm. But it is good to step back from time to time. <br /> <br /> I knew Prokofiev's music well in this movie before I saw the movie. The images and the music complement each other perfectly. And these are the images that will stay in the mind for a long time. It is clear that Bergman learned a lot from these images - those of his medieval works (eg, The Seventh Seal, The Source of the Virgin) developing and reinforcing Eisenstein's ideas. This film was made in 1938 in the USSR. In this context, it is a masterpiece, certainly imperfect. <br /> <br /> For the modern viewer, I suggest you follow the flow and enjoy the many treats presented.
