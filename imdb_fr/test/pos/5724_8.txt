Tempo Di Uccidere by Guiliano Montaldo is a strange film, but good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with a summary of the plot. Most of my readings give a false impression and make me think that most of the writers of these have not really understood the film. And you have to understand that on a certain level, even if you can not describe it yourself. This film is strange in style "Once upon a time in America", but only shorter. <br /> <br /> Many "Hollywood" stars (whatever that may mean ...) played in less known Italian productions. We know that many actors who are beyond their prime age or who are slowly getting ready to do so do so. Cage was not yet a real star when it was done. I am not a fan of him. He is very good in certain roles (Raising Arizona, Bringing the Dead) and weak when he plays the hero. I do not really know what to think of him in this one, but he certainly does not represent the main character of the typical hero. This film could have been without him, but the fact that he played the lead role may be the only reason why it was recorded on DVD. <br /> <br /> The support cast is good. None of them look fake and they act as if they are really there. Strong support <br /> <br /> I saw 3 films of Montaldo (Marco Polo, Sacco & Vanzetti and this one) and I think he is one of the greatest directors of this time. Unfortunately, nobody knows him. This film was his last for a long time (a 19-year break). I think that film may have failed in the office, but the way it was designed, I think for Montaldo, it was a personal project that he liked a lot. <br /> <br /> The production is excellent. It's always enough. Dusty military camps, claustophobic towns and beautiful scenery all play an important role. Everything feels very real. In some scenes, you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but the music of Ennio Morricone is very good. This is not a room that you whistle in the shower, but it works very well. <br /> <br /> The film has a perfect appearance, feel and sound. This does not serve the lessons learned on a gold platter, but it is perhaps the biggest difference between Hollywood and European cinema. It may seem strange to give an 8 and not to recommend it to people, but that's what I do. If you are looking for action avoid this one! If you are looking for a well-made Apocalypse Now in a different context and time, but with a similar path in a "state of mind" (sorry if that's a corny sound but I do not know how to call it otherwise), you just can enjoy this one a lot.
