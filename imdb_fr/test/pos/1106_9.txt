Received this DVD from the ACCENT range, a brand specializing in contemporary art films, they released Irreversible and a series of Bergman opus. <br /> <br /> The thing that struck me in the film strangely titled MODERN LOVE by Alex Frayne is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film that plunges us into the spirit of M Joe Average, which is full of voices in the head, visions and madness. It takes place in a rural region of Australia, the film does not trivialize and does not rent people like many Australian films. that is to say, our films are filled with "rogues", "hearts of gold", etc., etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Not in this movie. Stanley Kubrick's spirit is ubiquitous here, he is not flawless, but has a fascinating attention to detail, a romantic tendency and a mood that is invigorating, unless it is endearing. defective - the generics were cut in slices, they do not fit in the frame. <br /> <br /> In addition, one of the shorts is corrupt, it stops halfway.
