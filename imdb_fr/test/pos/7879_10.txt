Peter Boyle has always been a great actor and he proved it by his interpretation of Bigot, which made me hate him every time he used the word "N", I looked at him and his big mouth and wanted to turn off his lights . (Think carefully, Peter Boyle was once a monk) (Now an actor in "Everybody Loves Raymond") Susan Sarandon needs a bath right away.

I noticed that a large Raggerty Ann doll (the creator, John Gruelle) was the only thing Susan could trust and love, and the doll appeared in many scenes. If you really want to know how to come out of the 70s with drugs, free love and chimeras, then, enjoy the excellent direction of John G. Avildsen ("Rocky and" The Karate Kid "). always thought that Peter Boyle should have been This is definitely a cult classic that deserves to be visualized and shared with others.
