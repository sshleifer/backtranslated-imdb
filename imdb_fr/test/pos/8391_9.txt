I totally agree with the comments below about Mary McCormack throwing a bag of milk on TV, but the rest of the series is fantastic! Phil Hartman has been an excellent teacher, teaching celebrities the ins and outs. Foley is crazy, but in a good way. You never know what self-disparaging humor he will come up with. Regarding the game, it is entertaining, filled with witty jokes and ideal for any beginner who may even have an interest in the game. Too bad that this is no longer the case :( I just checked the program until August and it does not seem to be programmed for the future Bad Bravo You deserve to be beaten!
