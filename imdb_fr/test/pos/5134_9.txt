In "Hoot", Mullet Fingers engages in sabotage to stop the pancake. The problem is that manufacturers are starting from scratch and must take more drastic measures. When confronted with dogs, he makes them flee with snakes, not before being stung by a dog and forced to go to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Roy at bedtime asks his father, who works for the Justice Department, how he deals with crooks. His father says that this involves the tedious steps of digging in the newspapers, because sooner or later they all fail. You can see it with Enron and WorldCom. Roy examines the documents relating to the pancake house and finds a deleted document (he must break into the caravan of the company). So when the police see it, they have the law on their side. Unlike what happened while he was escaping the police. <br /> <br /> Notice that, as already mentioned, Roy is not always law-abiding and that the man of society kills owls (illegally), Mullet Fingers takes direct action. He can not wait for the law (Mullet Fingers is hiding). The film suggests that we need to work in the system.
