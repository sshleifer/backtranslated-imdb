Most critics seem to have rejected this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as a new patchwork of blind violence. And while there is a lot of chaos, DEATH WISH 3 is not a terrible effort, especially for fans of the show and its star. <br /> <br /> Paul Kersey's age, old Charlie, is unleashed. by a police chief desperate to clean up a part of New York City. The easily triggered vigilante settles in the heart of the gang territory, where he becomes a one-man army in an urban war between good and bad. Bronson, at least the "older" version, is really at its best. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that DEATH WISH 3 is a classic. Indeed, it has a plethora of imperfections to the discriminating eye. The characters are usually cardboard. The violence is above. A man well in his sixties exceeds dozens of young punks. But in the tradition of the original film DEATH WISH and subsequent films such as FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas, the film seduces with its charm. Who does not want to see the gangbangers get their due? There are also some good cheese moments and linings so common in 1980s movies. When a tenant in his building sees Kersey set up a trap, for example, the vigilante says lightly that he "clears up the flock" . A line that only Bronson can really make work. <br /> <br /> So you see that the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it as it is. It's not Spielberg and it's not art. So throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it.
