Women will love this movie better than men. Of course, women love all romantic comedies more than men - on average. In general, I like romantic comedies a bit, but I considered this a 5.5 for the top 50% of the movie, about 6.5 for the next 40% and about 9 for the remaining 10%. So, reluctantly, I will give it a score of 7. I record and keep all movies rated 7 or better and none that is a 6 or worse - at least that's my goal. I have over 1,200 movies, so why keep the dogs. <br /> <br /> My wife liked this movie a bit more than me, although I do not know why. I am a bigger fan of Drew Barrymore than she is. <br /> <br /> The intention of this film was to talk about a young woman who returns to high school (under cover) to write a story of her high school experience. She was dork in high school the first time and had to learn to be cool the second time. Her journey to the rural world, as well as the fact that she falls in love with a teacher, is history. <br /> <br /> What made me crazy the first half of the movie, it was how it looked balding. I wondered why they would choose her for this role until I realize how much she can look like a dog. So much so that I really do not think I want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning. ARGH! Naturally, she turned into a pretty (cute) woman at the end and she became very popular. <br /> <br /> The end is about 9.9 on a very soft scale, so the sappers will like that. Otherwise, it is not very memorable and easily missed.
