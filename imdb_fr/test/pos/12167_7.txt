This trio of short films of 30 minutes on topics related to gay is performed quite respectable. Each entry story is played with a pleasant charm and naturalness. This film deserves to be widely distributed and easily accessible. However, it is not. I had to order my video copy; no local video store or even any library had it in stock.
