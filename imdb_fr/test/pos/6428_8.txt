It's actually a very good surreal mystery film, despite the description that tries to sell it as a sci-fi movie. Balkans is a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she tries to reconstruct. She spends the majority of the film trying to make sense of her visions. Very atmospheric and effective. It is true that Kinski does not appear much in this film, but the actors who look at us are very good. There is only one dubbed version in English available in the United States, and the dubbing leaves something to be desired, but the actors are doing a very good job. The cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, winner of an Oscar, is excellent. THE FIFTH CORD, by director Bazzoni, is also excellent, and was also designed by Storarro.
