I just can not watch this movie too often, it is full of genuine enthusiasm and intelligence for Mickey Mouse in his first 30 years. Nowadays, Mickey is a clever little by comparison. The steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least the end where Mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato. The animation is very pleasant and although Willie does not have a dialogue on the steamboat, the music is enough for him. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, if this song does not deserve 10/10, no cartoon will be not only because it's a real classic, but also because it's full of joy and that it's always fun to watch.
