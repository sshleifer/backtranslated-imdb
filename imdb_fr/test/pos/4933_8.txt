How I Spend My Vacation ends the television series broadcast from 1990 to 1992. I have always loved the show for what it is. I have never compared the series to the Looney Tunes of the time. The video output was divided into four or five episodes (I do not remember when I write this) for television and is included in the episode list of the series. What is good in this series is that all the main characters in the series play a major role in the story. We see what they all do during their summer holidays in different parts of the world. Elmyra is with her parents on a safari, Plucky and Hampton are crossing the country with Hampton's parents, Fifi is on a beach, etc. The culmination is very good and in the end, all the characters of Tiny Toon meet for the beginning of a new year in the "Looniversity", thus putting an end to the smooth running of this TV show.
