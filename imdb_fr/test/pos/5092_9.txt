30 years after the original film, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" has been turned into a musical. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke played a leading role in this magnificent remake of beloved teacher Chippington, whom his wife calls "Chips". <br /> <br /> O'Toole was excellent here and received another Oscar nomination. You have to wonder what Peter O'Toole has to do to win an Oscar. He lost the coveted prize 8 times now. You must also ask yourself that he lost in 1969 against John Wayne for "True Grit", which reflects Mr. Wayne's long career and popularity. This year was also marked by excellent performances by Richard Burton, "Anne of a thousand days", as well as Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight for "Midnight Cowboy". <br /> <br /> Surprised to see Petula Clarke play the role of Mrs. Chippington. However, as it was a musical, a beautiful voice appeared and she also played a nice role. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the scene when Chips continues in the class despite the new beloved was killed in a bombing. He never had the opportunity to tell him the wonderful news of his current promotion. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and beautiful music only added to a memorable experience.
