I always wanted to see this movie and the first three quarters proved that I had not waited in vain. But what happened in the end? I mean, do not get me wrong, I liked the movie. It definitely made me nostalgic for the realistic and unique NYC of the 80s that we lost thanks to Giuliani. But he misses half an hour!
