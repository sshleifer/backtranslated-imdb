A good movie x diabolical with likes of "James Bond", "Romeo and Juliet", and maybe even "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> The count of the evil Von Bruno receives a guest English gentleman a very dangerous hunt. Elga, the simple and well-meaning beautiful lady who was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle. The missing eye count indicates a terrible past. The Englishman is not what the Count thinks and treats him terribly badly. There is also the terrible hunchback, the crocodiles and even the lateral appearance of some instruments of torture. <br /> <br /> Boris Karlloff, here in a supportive role, makes a strong but somewhat stiff presence. The other actors (and the direction) are the symbol of a time when the black and white film is strongly represented. From the beginning, there is no doubt about who is the bad guy, who is the good guy. Even traitors and steep can be identified quite easily.
