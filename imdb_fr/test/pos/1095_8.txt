This film is incredible, even if it is not perfect by Hollywood standards, it evokes gently the wide gap that separates the rich and the poor, in black and white, which is true in many parts of the world . He treats the public with gloves while offering a truthful view of the problems of society. The children are beautiful, especially note the young man who plays Sipho. The friendships that develop are universally true, everyone can understand the choices that these young people have to make. The influence of adults is interesting - it seems to be drawn from real life experiences because it involves conversations and interactions - as a child would remember having experienced it. I highly recommend this movie.
