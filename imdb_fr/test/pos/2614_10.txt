That was it! I would never have expected the end if I did not already know the backstage. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hated is why Shannon was started and not Alyssa. I hate her, I would prefer her character to die Shannon's. What was funny was that in the scene where Piper is dying on the hospital bed and Prue was crying by her side, I started crying too lol. At the time of its release, I was about 10 years old and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning, so I told myself that if she died, I would not see the show anymore! lol <br /> <br /> then all the back in time was a shock and really good. I also hold responsible for the death of Prue for Pheobe, because instead of being with her sisters, she must be a bitch b *** and be with her good for nothing, demon boyfriend. <br /> <br /> but I think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a classic CHRMED. <br /> <br /> FOREVER CHARMED! Blessed be!
