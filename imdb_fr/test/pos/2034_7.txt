I have been looking forward to the release of this film since I first heard about the concept two years ago and I was not disappointed. I will not mind summarizing the story since everyone understands it, but I will say it was just entertaining. The performances were excellent, as was the music, and the main characters were nice. <br /> <br /> My only complaints are: (1) the story was really missing; the film ended very abruptly - in fact, the writing became quite lax in the second half, as if the writers did not know what to do with the plot. Since the plot was not as important as the music and the action, it did not really affect the entertainment value of the film, so it's not a serious complaint like this. seems. <br /> <br /> (2) It's really thorny, but the music that the characters in the movie listened to was sometimes dated back to 1985, when the movie was filmed. INXS "Devil Inside" dates from 1987 and "Are You Ready" from AC / DC dates from 1990, among other errors. It bothers me a little, because they have obviously tried to make a good time, they could have checked the copyright date of these songs to make sure they date from 1985 or earlier. Again, not very serious. <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought something else strange. Members of the Steel Dragon band were supposed to be English, but for whatever reason, Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and guitarist Ozzy Zakk Wylde played the band members, and they each had a few lines of conversation with American accents. It was a bit lazy too, but it was cool to see real musicians playing musicians, so I'll forgive too. <br /> <br /> I could probably cringe all day, but I do not want to give the impression that it was not a super entertaining movie. I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I will definitely buy the soundtrack CD just for the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the Steelheart band singer, if you remember!). The highlight of the movie was perhaps an excellent release. Mark Wahlberg plays a rock song on stage and suddenly, we play "Good Vibrations" by Marky Mark and The Funky Bunch. The surprised look of Mark's face is priceless. A classic rock and roll movie! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment
