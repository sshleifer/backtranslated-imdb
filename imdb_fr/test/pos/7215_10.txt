This is the best movie we have ever seen in "Germen's Cine Club" (Buenos Aires). This film is a realistic critique of the society of the past and the next century. This makes a very good impression to all partners of the "Germen's Cine Club". I recommend this movie to all Troma fans and to all those who love good movies, not commercial movies.
