I know this movie is not suitable for everyone, and I will not tell you more, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people think about this movie. .. it was the best I have ever seen! !! It was so funny, and even though it was not the scariest movie I've ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat because I did not know what would happen next. If you like fun horror movies, you must see this one!
