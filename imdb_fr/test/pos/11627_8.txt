I must keep Barney piercing my head every day; well .. I guess there must be reasons. First, I am convinced that our children are not stupid, but simply (they know that my son of 1 year and a half "chooses" what to see) to know what is nice or disgusting. Have you seen the news? Do you think your children MUST KNOW the reality as it is? Maybe or maybe not; we (adults) are responsible for what we want for our children and what to teach them. A film of drug traffickers? news about the massacres in the Middle East? Of course, children need to know that there is a real life, but ... they are children; give them a little pity. What do you want for them? If you want kids to be trained with weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, put them on Lethal Weapon, Kill Bill, the anime of any manga, tell them that Santa Claus is depraved and passes directly by the chimney to violate them. I want illusions for my son (do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that Barney and his friends is the best, in fact, the series has a lot of flaws, I read other reviews and I agree with most); perhaps happiness is made of dreams or illusions. At least, I want him to grow up WITHOUT FEAR, BUT CAREFUL, who learns to think and believe that not everything is a serial killer or a hijacker, who is worth growing up to. At least he can be a little happy with his own dreams. So, parents, do not underestimate your children; they know what they want.
