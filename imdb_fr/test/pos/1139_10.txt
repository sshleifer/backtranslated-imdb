If you listen to Ween (The Pod, God / Satan), then you know what is happening with "Split". I found that watching the movie under the influence of LSD helped manage the audio / video plotters resulting from a fantastic editing job. The plot was important only from second to second. The acid allowed to interact with the sounds, the subliminal and general rhythm of this masterpiece. Do not bother writing about something that escapes your understanding ... There are not enough of these great independent expression attempts at the raw, amateur level. I challenge anyone to make a film that can both break their heads and change my view of the visual arts and the reality of the world. Not to mention the many realities that have not yet been explored by this human spirit. I love Chris Shaw's vision. I also like the textured terrorist film "The Begotten" by E. Elias Merhige.
