I must admit that I had never heard of this film. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so much and loved the end. Image of what a Marx movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X, then they gave up all LSD. <br /> <br /> Funny and edgy are two words overused today, this movie certainly has over 200 IQs. points from most comedies today and surreal to get started. I had to get up at 6 am and observe him until 2:30 am. I slept too much and I missed my obligations. It's always worth it. I would not recommend renting it, I would recommend owning it. It was as good as that. <br /> <br /> The only warning I have is that so are references that are dated and that might not be obtained by younger people. Bare with her and use your head. <br /> <br /> I should put it in my best comedies of all time.
