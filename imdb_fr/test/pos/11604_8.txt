I bought the DVD a long time ago and finally watched it. I really enjoyed watching this movie because you do not have the chance to see a lot of more serious quality movies like Bollywood. Very well done and but I would say that you have to be careful what happens because it's easy to get lost. When you start watching the movie, do not do anything else! In fact, I would advise people to read all the reviews here ... including those with spoilers, before watching the movie. Raima Sen gave her first great performance I saw. Aishwarya was easily at his best. All performances were strong, staging and cinematography ... watch it!
