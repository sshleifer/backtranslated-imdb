In 2006, I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Director Aku Louhimies presented his film and then participated in the Q & A session. For some reason, this movie is called Frozen Land in English, so I do not know how distributors froze Paha. It's a very good film. For me, it does not lack enough for me to go to the category excellent, but I spoke to viewers who felt that it was an excellent film. Louhimies said that back in Finland, people loved this movie or hated it, and that many people in theaters were leaving it. I am sure that some people have opposed certain scenes of violence, swearing, drug and alcohol abuse and sexual explanations. It's a very intelligent story of how these different lives are woven together because of a trickle effect. This film has very interesting and strong characters. I would give it a rating of 7.0 out of 10, I would see it again and recommend it with caution.
