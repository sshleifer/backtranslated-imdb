I am a new convert, so to speak. I borrowed DVDs from my local library. The samurai interest me since I watched 'The Last Samurai'. My dad told me that he used to watch Shintaro when he was a child. He said it was fine. We are in series 3. I absolutely love it. It takes a little time to get used to the dubbed English voices on the Japanese speaking characters, but I really appreciate it all the same. It's a bit odd to watch the little pauses when ninja stars are thrown at characters and sinking into a tree or wall. I was not used to that but I am now. But I guess that's the technology they had in the 60's. I noticed that Shintaro is kind, friendly, willing to help those in need, he's very humble, most of the time he do not notice anything (he only says he's better than the enemy ninja). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It's really interesting to see Koichi Ose's sword talent. It's amazing. This series is for anyone interested in samurai.
