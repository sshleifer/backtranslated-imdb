Where this film differs from the traditional Hollywood film is that it shows a real depth of feelings. In Europe, for example, we have had years of war, and although one nation can never eradicate the other, the old enemies have always lived side by side or side by side at the end of the conflict. In the United States, the white immigrant population exterminated the indigenous population until near extinction. the American citizen never had to live with his enemy. This explains, in my opinion, the often simplistic nature of the Hollywood film when it tries to explain the conflict of a foreign country. But in this film, the director and the scenario did not fall into this shot. It turns out that everyone in the story has real and false. it is a great story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.
