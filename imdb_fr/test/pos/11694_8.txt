I recently saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2007. The title of the film and much of its outline comes from Robert Graves' poem, Beauty in Trouble. Jan Hrebejk directs Petr Jrchovský's screenplay based on a story by Hrebejk and Jrchovský. the story begins in 2002, when Prague is hit by one of those 100-year-old devastating floods that destroy the families of Marcela (Ana Ceislerová) and Jarda (Roman Luknár) and their two children, Kuba (Adam Misik) and Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) Because of the mold conditions they currently live in, Kuba's asthma is a life-threatening condition. Marcela works and Jarda runs a cutting shop in the nearby garage. The shady occupation of Jarda puts him in default of right and one of his victims of theft is passionate about Marcela. Evzen Benes (Josef Abrhám) is a wealthy businessman who splits his time between Italy and the Czech Republic and offers to take care of Marcela and her two children. Jana Brejchová is the mother of Marcella who lives with her common-law partner Uncle Richie, played by Jirí Schmitzer, probably in the best role of the film. In addition to this excellent distribution, Emília Vasaryova is Jarda's mentally fragile mother who gives all the money she receives to the local religious charlatan. There is a lot going on here for a short movie and it's a good story with a good storyline and a lot of comic relief. Ales Brezina provides the score with additional music by Czech singer Raduza and Irish singer Glen Hansard. There are many things to love in this movie and I would recommend it with a rating of 8.0 out of 10.
