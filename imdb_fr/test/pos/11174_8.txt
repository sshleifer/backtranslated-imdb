Lucasarts has pulled a new beauty from a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. If additional proof was required to govern this kind of game, then that's all. Before playing the game, we wondered how writers would keep up the gags after the first two games. Fears were legion that he was going to wear a little thin. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how fast these fears are appeased. Introductory video with Guybrush in the boat dodgem (!) In the last stages of the funfair, the jokes continue. I was a big fan of the first two games and other Lucasarts works (Day Of The Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.) and this one does not fail to provide the quality. You will not be disappointed. (Well, I was not.)
