After seeing Big Fat Liar, I think Jason has learned a lot. When he told the truth that Marty had stolen his story, it was like the boy who shouted at the wolf. People heard it, but they did not believe it. Nobody did anything to help him. In addition, Marty's advice is not the only one to stink in Marty's films. The truth is not overestimated. I'm so glad he was exposed for what he really is. Everyone discovered that he had stolen this boy, including his parents. Not only did he steal this boy and lied about it, he gave them the work of someone else and tried to call him his, which is plagiarism. Does he not know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone's idea? Another reason he was fired. He is not trustworthy. He is a liar, a cheater, a thief, a crook and a plagiarist. Do you have this Marty? You are a plagiarist. Plus, you have everything you deserve.
