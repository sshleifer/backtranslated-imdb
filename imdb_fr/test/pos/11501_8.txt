This film is based on a real story. The author of the novel with the same title, Einar Már Guðmundsson, had a brother with mental illness. I found this film very moving, following the trajectory of the main character in the disease, to see how he was trying to live a life after the diagnosis and how he made friends in the psychiatric facility, all this was very convincing . There are also some very amusing incidents in the manuscript. The title of it does not reveal anything about the story. You have to watch it to understand ... and listen to music, which turns and moves your heart and soul upside down as the movie moves on. A must for everyone.
