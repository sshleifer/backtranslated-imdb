Fantastically written, played and produced! I loved seeing this brilliant and talented cast - all of them - give such a great performance. This film has warmed the hulls of my heart! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie for Black History Month. Filled with a faithful portrait of recent history and real characters who have overcome incredible pain - with dignity and belief in a better future. It is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually feed the talent of his adulthood. The next time you are with a child listening and watching, remember; show where he can be a writer in the making!
