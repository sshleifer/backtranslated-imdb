What is worth mentioning and omitted from the other criticisms I have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behavior of homosexuals at the time described in the film. Although the character of Courtenay is obviously gay, he is not the only one: we often speak of Mr. Davenport-Scott, it is the other, and the reason why we never see him, the reason evoked at his disappearance appears to be that he was arrested by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in England at the time. <br /> <br /> It can be read beneath the surface that this recent event has disturbed Norman, the character of Courtenay: and we can also see in a passing remark made by Oxenby, the character of Edward Fox, quick renunciation of any connection with such a person when the law is at stake: the fear of association affects many characters and is part of the portrait that the film portrays of the people who live there. Sir's abandonment of Courtenay at the end has been anticipated from the beginning, if this subtext is included: it also gives meaning to both the inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those to whom he thanks . Flamboyance, combined with the fear of exposure, produces the combination of burning desire and fear that Courtenay must "get to the spotlight", as he does when he announces the imminent air raids , a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous, but is at the same time a symbolic and literal representation of the inner torment of man. <br /> <br /> Thus, if the drama is that of Sir Finney's decline, much of the tragedy of the film and the play stems from the 'fatal flaw' of Courtenay's gaiety, and makes it a movie. on it, as the title suggests. <br /> <br /> The artistic direction, the stimulation and the cinematographic style of this film seem to come from another time, more distant than the eighties and, to some The implicit portrait of a society which still clings to an old moral order and the sympathy of the character torn apart and ruined by the cruelties of this order, inevitably trapped in the closed world of the theater. and the fact that we know how all this would be swept after the war makes this film all the more moving, despite all its faults.
