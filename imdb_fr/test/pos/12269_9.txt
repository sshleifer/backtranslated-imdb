For me, this magnificent roller coaster of a film allows enjoyable viewing several times. It's about the entangled life of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the haunting producer of workaholics. Albert Brookes plays the unattractive but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is the affable yet stupid newcomer of the group, news anchorman. <br /> <br /> The classic love triangle emerges with Brookes, in love with the spirit and devaluing, in love with Hunter, but she is naturally attracted to Hurt. <br /> <br /> This film works on several levels. At the very least, this is a brilliant comedy whose flying linings are so large and fast that each viewing brings a new harvest of those you may have missed last time. It's also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance. <br /> <br /> But the most important is perhaps the film that deals with the modern obsession with the physical appearance and its ultimate triumph of the intellect as a human attribute. This is personified by the meteoric career success of Hurt's character as opposed to the relative decline of Brookes. <br /> <br /> Despite its fifteen years, the film contains very relevant messages on the values ​​of the news and the continuing decline of journalistic standards. . <br /> <br /> This film is a classic in every way and it's hard to understand why it's been so neglected
