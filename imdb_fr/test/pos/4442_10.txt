Lucio Fulci has directed many great films throughout his career, and the way many of them staged a bucket filled with blood has led him to win the title of "The Godfather of Gore". Although Duckling's Do not Torture was made before Fulci became well-known gorehounds, he is not that bloody; it's certainly a hard and vicious little thriller, and for my money - the best film Fulci has ever made! Not to torture a duckling is really much of Giallo's genre in terms of production values ​​and unlike many of Fulci's subsequent films, everything is great in Giallo. The plot focuses on a small, rustic community where corpses have begun to arrive. The killings are even more shocking because the victims are only young boys. Shortly after the police sentenced an innocent man for these crimes, a journalist named Andrea Martelli arrives in the village and decides to start alone to investigate the murders. Martelli soon meets several suspects, including a sexy young woman named Patricia, a sinister priest and a local witch who likes to make wax effigies and stick pins there. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not necessarily contain tons of gore, there are two of the most nasty sequences of Fulci to catch up with. The most wicked involves a woman brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling off a cliff and hitting a number of rocks downhill may turn some stomachs. Do not Torture a Duckling is an absolutely great Italian casting. Barbara Bouchet (one of my favorites) is incredibly sexy in her role as Patricia and manages to work his muscles more than in the past. Tomas Millian is excellent, as usual, while Irene Pappas, Florinda Bolkan and Marc Porel illustrate the rest of the cast. The cinematography presented is breathtaking and Fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he gives a lot of care and effort to each scene. The story is played slowly, and it's always interesting, because Fulci never allows the film to deviate too much from the central plot. There is not much mystery about the identity of the murderer; but Fulci almost succeeds in letting us guess until the end and Do not Torture in Duckling does not culminate. Overall, it's a pity that Fulci has not made more movies like this one. Do not torture a duck is his best work and I insist that all fans of Giallo see!
