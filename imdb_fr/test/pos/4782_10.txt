While living in a Spanish country, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali joined forces to create the reference for short-term cinematographic surrealism. synchronized sound drawings (it was revealed that it was not the first, unlike other reports). It's also one of the simplest and most entertaining short films by Mickey Mouse (still in the style of the silent movie - the only sounds are those that dull Mickey and the animals). He also passes quickly enough for his race of less than ten minutes. But in these minutes, we immediately understand how amusing Disney and his characters are and how the new use of sound changes the way his creation uses animals as musical tools. There is no story to tell, only random events that happen and happen because of Mickey (uh, Steamboat Willie) on this boat on a river. And like the best Mickey Mouse shorts, its lack of speech is a benefit. It's a must if you have not seen it when you were a child, but if you have it, it may still be worth a look.
