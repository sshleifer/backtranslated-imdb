One of the best horror / suspense movies I've seen in a long time. Wow, it was a big surprise and amazing how good this movie was. Sometimes, a jewel like this one is surface but it is rare. I was expecting a movie of popcorn monsters and a slightly entertaining way to spend the night but instead a movie very well done and made with a lot of acting, done with passion and heart. <br /> <br /> It's a film that makes you feel the characters and what happens to them, and that is filmed as if you were there and it's really happening. I know other people compare it to "Open Water", but I do not agree, because I thought that Open Water was pretty boring and mediocre, whereas this film was the opposite, even if, superficially they are filmed in the same "realistic" style. <The actors are strangers, at least for me, but they are all very effective and translate the disastrous situation with frightening intensity and realism. The story is well done and going well, the plot is logical and seems to be something that could happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters are quite what a person would do and think. Very credible and it makes the film more real because of it. <br /> <br /> I had tears in my eyes at the end. I must say that a film rarely has this effect on me, it's how powerful and emotional this film was and I'm sufficiently impressed by the director and actors of this great film.
