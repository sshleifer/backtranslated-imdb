Okay, I'll tell you right off the bat that Loony Tunes' Inki cartoons are pretty shocking and I can understand why Warner Brothers pulled them off the market. Seen today, Inki with gigantic lips and very stereotyped is not politically correct. However, the drawings were well done and it is unfortunate that they were not published with an explanatory prologue (like the one with Leonard Maltin they included with recent, recently published, politically incorrect Donald Duck drawings). In other words, to completely throw the caricatures aside is to forget our story. In addition, Inki, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons exist, especially on the Internet. <br /> <br /> This Inki cartoon shows our little hero on the hunt. At first, he pursues a cute little caterpillar, then accidentally falls on a lion - a lion who is more than happy to have Inki dinner. However, through all this, a strange Minah appears again and again ... and you will finally understand why this bird is so important to history. <br /> <br /> Cute, well done and smart. I like Inki cartoons. In addition, I take pleasure in showing them to liberal friends with very thin skin, just to watch them get caught in an apoplectic crisis or a heart attack. A lot of fun, guys!
