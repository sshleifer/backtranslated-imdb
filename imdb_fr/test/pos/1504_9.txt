It's an interesting movie. I think it's very funny, although the humor is very dark. Fulci is good and funny, it's a really funny and really crazy "self-portrait" of an artist ("I make horror movies, if I made love movies, nobody would buy tickets ... "). And it's really a SEXY movie too: almost all the time there's an "action" or a tension going on; and a lot of sexy girls / women ... That may explain why anyone starts to do cinema / art ... It's a real psychedelic trip, better seen maybe a little drunk or a state of mind. similar spirit. Of course, there are really nasty scenes because it's Lucio Fulci. In fact, some of these scenes are pretty disgusting. Anyway, it's one of the three best and most complete Fulci films I've ever seen (the others are House By The Cemetery and Zombi, I have not seen The Beyond). In fact, the script is overall, in my opinion, quite ingenious. You can see this film as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person with obsessive-compulsive disorder (buzzwords): the character has a compelling need to confess "crimes" or bad thoughts; Especially crimes that he did not even DO. And he questions himself all the time: What if I did it? And if I want to do it? Did I do it? Do I want to do it? He reacts excessively and exaggerates his thoughts. I'm sure Fulci was interested in psychology and maybe even read something from the area. in his film "House By The Cemetery", for example, there is a character named Freudstein. It is perhaps the most concentrated film and the most directly personal that Fulci realized. I also like the simplicity of photography / images in this movie. The only thing that bothers me is sadism, especially towards women; I do not understand why? Is it entertainment? Is it art? Is this horror? Anyway and all in all, it's a really interesting and well done movie, a classic film recommended at least for fans or those who are interested in this genre. For others, it may be too much.
