and quite frankly, it sums up the situation well. <br /> <br /> This is a small computer animated series that is filmed as an animal documentary .... <br /> <br /> The animation is almost perfect (I thought the dinosaur eyes swimming in the long neck looked fake). <br /> <br /> However, some photo models did not look as realistic ... <br /> <br /> and I thought Jurrassic park made a better T Rex .. <br /> <br /> > If this is the kind of thing we see in a normal British TV series, I can not wait to see what they can achieve in the movies .. <br /> I give this 10/10 stars ... <br /> <br /> (and the video "making of" was also great ..... the dinosaur on the skate board was halarious) <br /> <br /> <..>
