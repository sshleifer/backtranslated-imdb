Accepted is a 2006 teen movie featuring the guy from the Mac and PC commercials. The film is about Bartelby .B. Gaines, a guy who rejected all the colleges for which he applied, decides to start his own college and invites all the other people who did not. The problem is that hundreds of people are enrolling in his school. The film is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it at $ 5.00 at a sale and have always watched it ever since. Overall, this movie is a must watch for fans of any comedy because it is funny, witty and just a good movie. I note this movie very just 78%. GO ACCEPTS MAKING A SEQUEL GUYS BUT MAKE SURE IT IS NOT FACE.
