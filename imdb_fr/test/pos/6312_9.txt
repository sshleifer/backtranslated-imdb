It's a very visual film. I mean, the dialogue is thin, almost to the point of being a silent movie for very long shots, starting with the initial shot. <br /> <br /> However, the silences are interrupted by a stunning sound. A track that goes from discordant and staccato sounds to a bewitching mix of violins and interspersed with voices that sound like dreams. It's a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes, one of the first visuals being a man walking on a street, so concerned about his interest in a well-made woman, that he goes to a lamp post: one of consequences of a metaphor of what lies ahead ... <br /> <br /> A long time ago, another film ?? Love Story (1970) - said that love is never obliged to say that you are sorry. This story reverses this idea in several ways, starting with the main character, Titta (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly innocuous long-time resident in a sumptuous hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Every day, week after week, he sits at the same coffee table, enjoying the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his loneliness. and he has been doing it for ten years. He sits, he observes, and once a week, he takes part in three very surprising activities that you will discover when you see this little masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> Love is explored in another way, in a direct counterpoint to Titta's solitude and reserved nature: two older hotel residents are still very much in love, but the man wants to die dramatically when the time comes, while his wife, who has been suffering for a long time, reprimands him for cheating the cards with the other guests, including Titta. Now, Titta is aware of their arguments, their love, the man's deception, his apologies to his wife and his moans. How? In a surprising and black-comic way ... one of those surprise activities I mentioned. <br /> <br /> But it's not a comedy, in fact, although it touches on the idea of ​​human comedy in Balzac's sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. This decision had been made for Titta, ten years earlier, when he had left his wife and started living at the hotel. He stays in touch from time to time, and it is clear that he still loves his (now grown up) children and the grief in his voice speaks volumes. But there is something more than just sorrow ... <br /> <br /> A life like Titta's would obviously seem to be quite boring, and in fact, in many ways. However, it is only when we learn what is hidden under his almost mortal face that the horror of his situation strikes the viewer between the eyes. But not until we know that the bartender woman Sofia (Olivia Magnani) is very interested in Titta and does her best to pique her interest in her. <br /> <br /> And that's when things start to deteriorate Titta: he finally succumbs to his femininity and discovers once again the consequences of love. Ironically, in doing so, he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life, and in the most spectacular way. <br /> <br /> I know that all the above is somewhat cryptic; but to say more would spoil the film and the story. If you like Italian cinema ?? I like that! ?? I urge you to see this one. The acting is superb; the sound track cools the spine; the work of the camera is really innovative; the direction shows the maturity of a true artist. <br /> <br /> I know I'll see this movie again and again ...
