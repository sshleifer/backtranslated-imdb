This performance leaves you no desire. We saw it in Offenbach, Germany, and it's breathtaking. We only got cheap tickets at the back, but we still had a view of everything that had happened. If you have the chance to see this live concert, go for it! The trip is worth it and, if I were you, I would wait a good half hour after the show to "calm down". The performances are breathtaking and all around the tent, artists with colorful clothes are there to distract, help, smile and make the whole tent more alive. Music - live music !! - is as good as the CD version: perfect! I bought a DVD later, but the show shot had less colorful costumes. It is the atmosphere in the tent that takes you feet. A great trip for young and old, and a good movie too
