I just saw Mar Ardentro and I told myself that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult subject in any field and unfortunately can sometimes distort the true value of a film. Many people were delighted by the excellent casting and the beauty of his images and his work with the camera. Javier Bardem is certainly an actor who brings something more to each of his films. To say that it includes true Sampredo is a bit silly, because I do not think any of the critics knew Sampredo personally. Staying still and using a certain charm is an acting skill that, if performed well, is not a "perfect" performance. Bardem does just what he does well ... and that's it. The work of the camera is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the film itself does not have to offer. Sampredo is pictured here as a man who so desires to die that he leaves his loving family behind him and marries a woman he seeks only when the other does not help him in his quest for a dignified death. Now, I'm not here to say anything about the right for or against euthanasia. The problem is that when you comment on such films, you can not escape. The subject of the film is so strong that you are almost obliged to talk about the film from this angle. I find it a weakness for the film - unwittingly - to portray Sampredo as an unpleasant character. Someone who is much smarter than his family, as described in the simple cousin who does not "receive" the double-layered poem directed at him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE thinks that his life is unworthy. A scene that juxtaposes with the lawyer who, according to the film, makes the "wrong" choice, resulting in a state of extreme insanity, indicating that the choice of Sampredo was the right one. The woman who constantly searches for her is almost ignored by the beautiful lawyer but is suddenly married by Sampredo when she agrees to help her die. These choices make Sampredo a calculated figure, regardless of Bardem's personality. Argumentif I would say that it does not convince completely and I think a little qu'Amenabar did not intend to add this unbalanced element in his film. For a young director, the film is always impressive and the highlights are certainly at the rendezvous (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo, for example). The camera is impressive and the film is well played. But 10 out of 10 ... no, the film does not reach this excellence.
