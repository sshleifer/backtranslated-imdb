Anyone who correctly identifies opening images as a god who kills himself without reading the end credits certainly deserves a free ticket to a nursing home in Transylvania. I imagine it's the favorite movie from "Dark Peak Lodge" to "Twin Peaks" on movie night if the weather was there. I would think that a better title could have been: "How much fun can you have with someone who is almost dead in the forest with only Neolithic technology?" The answer, it seems, is quite long. So, despite the stupid "God being killed", the pretentious pretense (an appropriate phrase from a previous letter), most clearly "Alistair Crowley - Hi, I'm the Beast, treat it!" Christian cosmology (I can not believe that another viewer had his head lowered to see the Judeo-Christian Bible in this area) ... despite all this ... it is a bold and important work that the most people should not see. I am both impressed and frightened that this has been done.
