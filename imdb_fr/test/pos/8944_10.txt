I accidentally hit this film on Cinemax while surfing on channels. I must admit that what attracted me was Christopher Walken. And the frame was the one I would like, so I started to look at it. At first, I was expecting a serious drama, and it seemed to me that was the case for a while ... until I started laughing here and there, and before I knew it, I laughed so hard throughout the movie. I really like its subtlety and lightness, but its impact on the public remains considerable. The plot is very simple, and it is far from being too hard to be funny as are many Hollywood "comedies", but it almost made me roll on the ground. A must for a good evening of rest or anytime in this case.
