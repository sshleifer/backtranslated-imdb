If you take Huxtable's parents and merge them with Kyle's parents, you get a perfect blend of extreme parenting skills that you can want for your own child-rearing skills within the family. The best part of every show is that parents do not let themselves be blinded by the fact that the upper classes, godly and self-righteous, know it well, but at the same time, they are not the under-educated stereotypical parents who are constantly fooled and neglected by their children. My children are 20, 16 and 6 years old; about the same age as Kyle kids and I see so many of their situations reflecting my own experiences with my family. The stupidity with which they engage only shows that when you have love in your family, you do not have to take yourself too seriously to keep your home together and have fun with your children.
