"Babette's Feast" and "The Horse's Mouth" are the two most insightful and accurate films about what a true artist is. The key words of "Babette's Day" are not, as other commentators have said, "an artist is never poor", but two lines that come before and after: <br /> <br /> > "I was able to make them happy when I gave the best of myself ... In the whole world, the heart of the artist resonates: give me the chance to do my best." < For nine years, I produced experimental multimedia musical theater in San Francisco, raising money for productions that brought together dozens of singers, actors, designers, etc., and the artists I supported were shooting the maximum of their money. effort to do their best. They were like Babette: they were desperately looking for all the money needed to do the best job possible. The art of Babette is a refined French cuisine, and for her, performing at the best of her art costs 10,000 francs. When, after years of political exile from France, isolated with two attentive young girls on a dark Scandinavian coast, she suddenly gets a gain of 10,000 francs, she does what any real artist would do: she sees that she lucky to do it unexpectedly. better, and she does it. She spends all the money to do her best work as an artist. The particularity of the film is that we do not know that she is such an artist, until she prepares and serves the meal. Until then, she seems to be just a French working-class woman who negotiates a little with traders and who is very serious (her husband and son were murdered during the violence in Paris in 1871). <br /> <br /> For such an artist, it is secondary if there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it. That's why the author organized this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly understand what they were getting. Babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two singles, nor to the religious community. His goal was not to reconcile the members of the little religious sect with a spirit of well-being. Indeed, she never leaves the kitchen to talk to any of them. After the meal, she sits alone and drinks wine, paying no attention to the guests' reaction. She is delighted to finally have the chance to do her best as an artist. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so gratifying and so important for the story that the general comes in unexpectedly - because, as Babette knows instantly, a general will know what he's placed before him, and appreciate him. Because there is a kind of tragedy in a great work of art presented to a public that lacks even a competent person to appreciate it. She is happy, very happy, he came. In fact, he is the only guest she has ever mentioned during the entire dinner, the only one she requests special treatment - not one of the single girls. But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it. <br /> <br /> To all those who had the chance to enjoy a real Parisian dinner of the first class, like me (my father was attached to the navy in Paris in the 1980s and I spent my Honeymoon in France), dinner, and Babette's satisfaction in preparing it and the pleasure it gives to the guests are absolutely convincing. If an art has the power to imbue the recipient with joy, it is a good French meal cooked and served in France. This film affirms the transformative effects of great art on the recipients. Before dinner, the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome and accumulate old resentments. The old hymns fail to restore good fellowship; people ignore them, talk to them. But the shared experience of great sensual art - so that people can taste the tastes of food and wine even if they are not convinced that they experience the great art - contains people, puts them in good Mood, reconcile them, and make them happy, encourages them to love one another, and thus has a sacred effect, similar to that of God, which is to bring peace. This is the current affirmation of the modern art movement: art can supplant traditional religions to make humanity more peaceful. So, unlike those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that the Christian ritual can not. After all my years in the art world, I must say that this assertion - that art brings peace that religion can not - is exaggerated and invalid. But it is a good omen and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> A last word: when Babette arrives at the daughter of the daughter of the daughter of history, a French general, Galliffet, is named a person who, in 1871, executed the husband and the son of Babette and imposed a military rule forcing her to flee. At the end of the film, while the general tells the story of the wonderful meal he had eaten in Paris many years before (before 1871), after some military maneuvers, it turns out that this same Galliffet was his host at mealtime. . At the moment when the general tells his story, the French general Galliffet congratulated the chief of this meal as the greatest woman, the only woman for whom he would risk his life. Of course, this woman was Babette. Thus, ironically, the same French general who declared that he honored Babette before all other women was responsible for driving him away from France forever.
