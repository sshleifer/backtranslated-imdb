This is mostly love in World War II, but we must remember that it is also a biographical film for Dylan Thomas and his entourage at this particular stage of his life. <br /> <br /> The timing of the film is just great. This really reflects what I think would have been the spirit during this time; smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed. Although it may seem boring for some, the film has a particularly dangerous edge. <br /> <br /> At one point, my heart was pounding towards the end when the film reached its climax. It really presents poignant moments that the four main actors manage with skill. Cillian Murphy is in great shape here, as is Matthew Rhys. Both are opposite poles, making it an interesting watch. The relationship between the characters of Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley is wonderful and we have to thank the actors (and pay attention to the 'Madness' Suggs cameo). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is rather slow. Coupled with the fact that there are barely two hours left, it's a long way to go. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully designed moments that have undoubtedly been aided by the sheer number of well-known British names behind the scenes. But it really buzzes too much sometimes. Always, a valid watch. 7/10
