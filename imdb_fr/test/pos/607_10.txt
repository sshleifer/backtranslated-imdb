This film talks about the aging of the geisha in the post-war period in Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other ex-Geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki), who want him enough. Tamae has a son, Otomi a girl, who, during the movie, announce their departure, while Okina, who has never been a mother, receives the visit of two men from her past who, it seems, only want money. It's a compelling story of your choices, what you do to go through life, your responsibilities and your responsibilities. Haruko Sugimara has always been to me one of the greatest actresses of all time and she embodies Okin, most of the time inflexible and uncomfortable, with an air of superiority that makes you not love her, but the to envy even almost. At a time when Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, among others, have made great films, Naruse is at his side. If you have a free DVD player in the area, you should try to find the two Naruse boxes published in England. I think this film was an excellent study of characters about women who may not be relevant. The fact that they are not really made this film a true masterpiece.
