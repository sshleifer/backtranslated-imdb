For the 1980s, it's a very dark film. At this point, filmmakers began to think that all films require comical humor relief (which, of course, is pushed to the extreme today), vivid action scenes (even more exaggerated today) or hot sex scenes. /> <br /> Hutton and Penn play wonderfully their roles as childhood friends who became spies of the Soviet Union. Penn in particular is brilliant as the unfortunate drug dealer Daulton Lee. <br /> <br /> What you have here is a real thriller / drama. There is no glory to tell, but the story is so compelling and the acting so superb that (hopefully) most people would not miss it. There are some fun scenes, especially where Penn tries to involve his Soviet benefactors in a major drug deal. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
