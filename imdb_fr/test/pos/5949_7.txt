I saw the move to Paris in May 2006 ... I was discussing between this and the mission impossible ... I am very happy to have chosen OSS 117 not only because it was funny, but as well to watch a French film in France. I had a good time ... I would recommend it. It is important to understand the French society today to really appreciate the humor of this movie ... I can not wait for the release of the DVD ... I do not know how some of the word games "game of words "'would be translated into English I will certainly buy it when it is released! P.S. I saw on "Brice de Nice" which is a movie starring Dujardin, whose children all spoke in France. This film is a comedy but more ridiculous than one can imagine ... Comparing the two films, I must say that Dujardin did a good job in OSS 117.
