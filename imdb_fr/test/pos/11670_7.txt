First, let me know that I entered this movie not for music; in fact I find it repulsive. Really, I was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. On this point, the documentary worked quite well. An unpleasant aspect was the many scenes in which the songs are played and the excited band and the belligerent crowd are shown crazy. If you have seen the first scene of this kind, you have seen them all. This superfluity is offset by the impression of the lyrics of certain songs. With these, the audience is able to connect mentally with the group. The lyrics are much more interesting than the clutter of sounds projected by the speakers. I do not know why all the lyrics were not printed. The scenes without words slow down (irony eh ?, Given the many references to the speed of the music) the unfolding of the film. Interviews with fans and groups were also interesting, but there is some disappointment when the interviews of the latter group are less exciting and humorous than the first two. Overall, it's a good movie that I'm happy to have seen. I will check the follow-ups if I have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote: He tried to hide the fact that he could not play by rubbing the peanut butter and breaking the glass. <br /> <br /> General generalization of punk: although their shame, lack of vocabulary and hygiene, and their drug-related unconsciousness are often hilarious, it is of course in the end that punks are not only pathetic minors who rebel through sophisticated texts and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize (ignoring Black Flag, who are slightly less misguided than their peers).
