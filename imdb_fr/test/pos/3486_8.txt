The latest film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ("The Antichrist", "The killer is on the phone") is a giallo truly suspensive but incomprehensibly overlooked, containing just about every brand that makes this sub-genre of Italian horror so beautiful and addictive. to the fans. There are very disturbing themes (child abuse, dummy priests ??), lots of scary moments, plot twists left and right, remarkable music and ?? finally and especially ?? a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is a kind of prologue, is a powerful horror! What about ordinary child dolls that make them so scary? When an anonymous man, disguised as a priest, assaulted a little girl and the broken head of her doll bounced down a staircase, it really made my back cold! Years later, the prologue girl is an adult woman attached to a wheelchair. She has inherited a lot of money, but she uses her fortune to encourage others to play sports and stay positive. She ?? Joanna ?? falls in love with his personal coach and they get married immediately. Naturally, he only seeks his money and begins to terrorize Joanna by bringing back to life the trauma of her childhood that paralyzed her. The repeated images of a sinister looking priest, guided by strange tunes and a nursery rhyme, give "Formula for a Murder" a ton of authentic scaring and the staging of Alberto De Martino is very resolute. The acting is quite competent, with David Warbeck ("The Beyond", "The Black Cat") in a role of villain greedy and glorious. Due to some conspiracy and a lack of originality, this film might not be able to compete with Italy's best horror efforts, but it certainly deserves more attention. Many unknown and unknown Italian gialli have received wonderful DVDs and, hopefully, "Formula for a Murder" will receive the same treatment very soon. In the meantime, good luck to find this baby!
