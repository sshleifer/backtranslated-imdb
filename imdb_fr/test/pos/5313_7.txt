After stabbing a retarded boy, Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a troubled and pessimistic man, is sent to juvenile detention. His teacher and aspiring writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) gets closer and tries to understand him, first with the intention of writing a book, then becoming his friend. Leland slowly reveals his sad vision of the world, showing that he is a sociopath. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a depressive and interesting study of a character. The captivating scenario, little rhythmic, reveals pieces of history as a puzzle; there are excellent lines and dialogues; the performances are excellent, although Ryan Gosling, 23, is not convinced by his 15-year-old adolescence; but it seems that a piece is missing to complete the puzzle and make "The United States of Leland" an unforgettable film. The disappointing clarification of the "why" of Leland's violent action against Ryan Pollard is not convincing or touching, it shows that this character is a sociopath totally disturbed by the strange and sickly look of the world. In addition, the way Allen Harris gets Pearl's knife is ridiculous. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Mundo de Leland" ("The world of Leland")
