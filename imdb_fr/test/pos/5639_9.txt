Okay, so I'm looking for a good documentary, especially when it tells a modern story of Don Quixote. One caveat: I met Mark Borchardt in the winter of 1995/1996 while still working on Coven. But I will keep this story for later. American Movie, whose production began shortly thereafter, accurately portrays the person I know, though more deeply than I would have thought or imagined. It's both a very funny and very sad film, which is brilliantly executed. Mark presents himself as his worst enemy: his childhood ambition and optimism - which I admire - are undermined by his apparent artistic incompetence as well as his strange tax expectations. But he is also a charismatic guy. His faithful sidekick Sancho Panza is also friendly: loyal, even if he is tired, deep down. Like Don Quixote, American Movie presents an ineffective aspect of the often overlooked freedom: people will be attracted to professions for which they are not particularly suited, regardless of their repeated failures. It's a great movie.
