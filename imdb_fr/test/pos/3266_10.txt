A refreshing black comedy featuring some of the best Australian artists. In the same way that Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels captured the funny side of London gangsters, Two Hands tears the underworld of Sydney. It would not be funny if it was not so close to the bone. <br /> <br /> An Australian classic. If Australia could pull more rabbits like this, it might have a film industry to watch.
