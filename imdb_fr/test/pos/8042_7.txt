It's certainly a quality film with an elegant cast. As for the movies about Carlos the Jackal, this one defeats the weak efforts of Bruce Willis in "The Jackal", then spits on it. I'm a little surprised that this film did not attract more votes, a kind of "sleeper" obviously. Too bad, because this film is really worth seeing. It's smart and never dull. See, 7/10
