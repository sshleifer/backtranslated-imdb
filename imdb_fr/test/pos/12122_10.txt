I just received this in the mail and was positively surprised. As a big fan of 70s cinema, it does not take much to satisfy me when it comes to this kind of movies. Despite the obvious low budget for this film, the acting is generally good and you can already understand why Pesci was to become one of the greatest actors of all time. I'm not sure about the authenticity of this film, but it's a good contribution to the kind of crowd ...
