Captain Corelli's mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's best films. He performs a great performance as a main character. It's a romance that takes place on the bottom of a torn island. The character of John Hurt gives his daughter, admirably interpreted by Penelope Cruz, honest advice on love This film does not have the fault to be completely predictable. This film also allows Cruz to interpret a performance as a strong woman who knows her mind and heart. Once the film heats up beyond the opening sequence, this movie keeps you focused. Once again, Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.
