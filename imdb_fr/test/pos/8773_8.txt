I'm a big fan of Hitchcock, since I saw "Rear Window" on TV. "Saboteur" is not what Hitchcock has best for me, it's fine but it's not a masterpiece. It has its flaws, some parts are rather slow and, therefore, the script is quickly imputed to the script, which makes it rather incomplete. But the management of Hitchcock is superb and the performances are not so bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane are both doing a pretty good job, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are about to steal the show. The story is good, speaks of a fugitive man on the run, themes very similar to those used in "39 Steps" and "North By Northwest", and cleverly provides a much needed escape. The score was absolutely exceptional; the music in the opening sequence was phenomenal, almost like a distorted march, and I enjoyed the excavations at Tchaikovsky's 1 st piano concerto and Beethoven's 5 th symphony. The cinematography is also sharp and smooth, the landscapes and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes. Namely the Statue of Liberty culminates, but the encounter between the circus troupe and the filming of Radio Music City Hall is also paying off. Overall, it's not the best of Hitchcock, but it's worth a look. 8/10 Bethany Cox
