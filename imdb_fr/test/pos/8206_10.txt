Wow! THE NET is, in my opinion, an excellent techno thriller at the forefront of progress that will leave you a feeling of well-being. When I saw it for the first time, I felt good for days. When Angela (Sandra Bullock) went to Mexico, I thought, "It's a really nice place for a vacation." As soon as Jack (Jermey Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) started chasing her, I thought, "Do not let anything hurt him! Please!" I also took several deep breaths to prevent me from screaming more than I had done before. On the plus side, if you ask me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I present you an excellent techno thriller at the cutting edge of technology that bites you, four stars.
