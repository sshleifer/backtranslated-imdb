Take a look at these faces next to the prison entrance. They are not the faces of Hollywood's extras. Someone from the production was very clever at filming in Oxford, Mississippi, because you can not get that kind of authenticity from a studio filming. Explore the narrow, dusty roads, the frozen earth and the skeletal trees that barely catch on. No wonder these faces look hard and ruthless; they only reflect the soil from which they come. The old man Lucas (Hernandez) fears better for his life, but he springs from this same hard ground. <br /> <br /> The film works because it tells a good story that does not preach or sentimentalise and even suspense. The old man Lucas is not very friendly. He is a victim and we sympathize, but he is also haughty and unfriendly. Well, the scenario refuses to soften it. In this way, we are forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the least friendly. The scenario also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism as it tends to become preaching and less effective. Instead, we are shown how prejudices can easily condemn an ​​innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death. Thus, it is by our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed, a much more effective way. It also makes sheriff's and lawyer's actions more understandable as they are part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> Note that the film does not attack segregation. It is doubtful whether the old man Lucas wants to mingle with whites anyway and there is nothing to suggest that even lawyer Stevens (Brian) wants to cross the line of color, except for justice. No, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future, as symbolized by the child (Jarman) whose head is not yet filled with "notions". He is not really friends with Lucas, but he has glimpsed the common humanity of befriending himself after falling into the frozen stream. The last line of dialogue also shows that he sits alongside his uncle, the lawyer, instead of his parents more shameful (the dinner table scene is important and can easily be overlooked). The lawyer might not participate in a future civil rights march, but the child could do it. This is the realistic aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> During this brief period of three years, between 1949 and 1951, there was a series of racist films. Even the famous MGM has entered the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately, McCarthy's purges in Hollywood ended "problem" movies that might not be used in the Cold War. Even in this case, each of them deserves to be caught, not only because they are good movies, but because even with the passage of 60 years and Jim Crow, they are still relevant.
