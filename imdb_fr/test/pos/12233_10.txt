Challen Cates does a wonderful job of portraying a wife in conflict, torn between the challenges that await her professionally, the memories of the freedom she thought she had at university (inspired by a famous author) and the security of her future marriage she really does not like. This film is definitely worth seeing - as predictable as it may be, the cast of actors is inspiring and a real chemistry exists between Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner.
