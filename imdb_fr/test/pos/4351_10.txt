I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew he was a former prisoner from Viet Nam in Laos who had escaped, but I did not know much else. In fact, I did not expect much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what distinguishes this film from other biography-type documentaries is that Dieter himself tells the essence of the story. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story of his life in Germany during the Second World War and its difficulties. We are with him in this same little town, where he describes his family, his inspirations and his difficulties. We follow him to America and on the way he leads to realize his dream of pilot. Then, later, Dieter describes his story of capture, escape and survival in the Laotian jungle. We are with him again in this jungle even when he describes and reconstructs his imprisonment and his path to freedom with much detail. We see the same primitive huts, the same villagers and the same forms of detention that they have suffered and have not really changed in 30 years. We see the thick jungle, the mountainous terrain and the rivers that Dieter was confronted with during his escape. It helps us understand his emotions, his pain and his fate. I enjoyed the man, the story and the style. Good job!
