like many Wong movies, many people find them boring and confusing. Well, I like them and I love this movie too. I went out and rented it on DVD and watched it 3 times. It's a very subtle film that provides an intoxicating experience. for those who have not benefited ...... you have lost 2 hours of your life ... too bad ... muhahahahaha.
