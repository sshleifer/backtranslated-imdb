GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The story is incredibly portrayed, the characters are beautifully animated and the weapons are authentic. The scenario is so interesting that even when you finish each mission, you must have more levels to beat them and beat them with a higher difficulty. And the multiplayer mode is so limited. You choose the weapons you want to play with, and then you play. Me and the three of my friends, as well as my brother, are still playing Goldeneye. If you do not have this game, I suggest you buy it.
