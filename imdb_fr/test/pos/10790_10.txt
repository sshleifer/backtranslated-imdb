Having never seen an Oliver Stone movie before, or any film starring Eric Bogosian, I did not know what to expect from this movie. After having the idea of ​​buying it for a while, I finally got it for free as a supplement with a Sunday paper and was extremely impressed. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of Barry Champlain, host radio-talker who can be incredibly rude to his interlocutors, often putting them in their shoes before they realize what's going on. Although this is what makes him a popular radio show host, he has also earned him many enemies. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie has been extremely impressive and contains no failed actor. Eric Bogosian is brilliant in the role of Barry Champlain, animator of the animated radio with Alec Baldwin in a remarkable performance, under the leadership of Dan, the boss of Barry. It also contains the voice of, and the appearance of Michael Wincott (reason why I wanted to see this). <br /> <br /> The story was very well written, because despite his arrogance, you feel like Barry. his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone because it is captivating and, more importantly, real in many ways, two of them being was inspired by the life of an animator from radio and the fact that you actually receive radio broadcasters and callers, such as those presented in the film in reality. <br /> <br /> High recommendation and 10/10. <br /> <br /> Hi, Cat Squire
