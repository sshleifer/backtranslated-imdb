It was good. It was one of those we got but we do not have enough evidence yet. In the couple of movies in which I saw her, I never really thought much about Stephanie Zimbalist. Professional TV actress she is but nothing exceptional. Here she was well above average because the former profiler was fed (or was he loaned?). His character gets along well with the motley group of police officers from the special investigative unit with whom she was appointed. There was not really a clumsy figure with which to roll your eyes and despise, which was good. As well it takes a while to find out who the murderer is ... but when I discovered that I was not that surprised. Never mind. Another thing that was good was the Los Angeles locations. Maybe if it was done today, they would use Toronto or Vancouver, but here they really shot downtown LA I like that a lot (although I half despise LA) also liked the movie. I do not know if I would watch it again but it was not too serious. My note: B-
