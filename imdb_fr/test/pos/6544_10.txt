For those of you who have seen this picture on VHS, I would recommend the DVD. In fact, VHS is hogwash. The main reason is that the film was shot on the big screen (2.55: 1) and that the producers ran out of money for the VHS version and published it in 4: 3 format. The result is that several actors are not at all on the screen, and in many drag races, less than half of the cars are visible, one being on each side of the screen. The DVD is actually a reasonable version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release. They were considered too offensive for minority groups. In fact, the prospect of an outing to the United States has resulted in even more cuts in the film. For example, Americans apparently did not understand words like Petrol & Strides. <br /> <br /> Mike's father and mother must have been hippies. Dad survives in the movie as a wasted guitarist. But the next scene with the mom was cut off. The scene took place on the roof of the house, which was lined with aluminum foil, fluoro lamps and filled with plants ... you can see the picture. The producers had rounded up a lot of real plants for the foreground and when they saw the result on the big leaf, they panicked and the scene was cut off. Cowards! <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is considered an Australian cult classic. Voted # 2 of the 100 best movies of all time in Street Machines, he is short on Mad Max ll. The latter had more than 10 times the budget of ROE. In fact, the ROE budget was so small that the manager could not afford to demolish any of the cars ... although there would have been a public outcry if someone had destroyed a real main owner. (Compare that with Smoky and the Bandit or Blues Bros where dozens of cars have been destroyed.) <br /> <br /> There is therefore a real GTHO and two fake ones. One of the fake was purchased from the Cobar Aboriginal community after the emergency GTHO crashed into the back of the Country Boy's truck. (It was impromptu!) The car was about to explode on the side of the truck.) The budget being so tight, it was made of ordinary brown masking tape instead of the painted gold trim of the real coin. <The 55 Chev is absolutely real. The car started as a very ordinary 4-door and was brilliantly and quickly converted to the '55 blown into the film. The engine was a 545 sailor that was about 1000 hp. This was reduced to around 600 for filming. The car could easily reach 170 mph as the different scenes of the film show. <br /> <br /> For the record, anyone with $ 12,000 could have recovered ALL cars after the movie. The HO, the Dodge, the '53 Ute, the 53 Rammer Chev ... the lot. I wonder where they are now? <br /> <br /> SW
