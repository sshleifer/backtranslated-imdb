Great movie of the late 1970s. It says a lot about corruption to the detriment of ordinary citizens, so that the powerful can reap huge profits and neglect the environment and the safety of others. <br /> <br /> Nearly 30 years later, this film is convincing for the power of some companies that, since the release of films, have increased their control capacity tenfold; This shows the need to regulate the public against powerful commercial interests whose primary purpose is profit. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon is brilliant, while Jane Fonda and Micheal Douglas play an equally important role. The frivolous 70s were cursed, this film redeems the decade. <br /> <br /> A film that improves after each viewing.
