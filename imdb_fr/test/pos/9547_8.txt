What could happen in a boring Texas city in the summer? Well, a group of teenagers are discovering that some things can and should happen. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than chupacabra, and the film, contrary to what its name suggests, is not a remake or a look-alike of American movies about the werewolf, but something completely different. <br /> <br /> Overall, for a low-budget film, it's not bad! A clever camera work, the effects of creature and gore traditional quite correct and, for once, people who do not know everything and who can make mistakes, like shoot a colleague thinking that this is the great evil beast, and are disconcerted by things they might not know. <br /> <br /> Sit in there and expect an exceptional multi-million dollar production. You will disable it with disgust after a while. Sit there waiting for some entertainment and a relatively simple story, and that's fine! Overall, I get an 8/10 from me for being creative, OK, and doing good work for the budget of this movie.
