It's my favorite movie and I think it's perfect. Unlike virtually any other movie I can name, I never watch this movie and think it would have been better if it changed this or that problem. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think so. Every brush stroke in Mishima is perfect and everything comes from Schrader's script. I've always liked Paul Schrader's work (we can not argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing movie), but if his writing often seems to be close to the huge power, his directorial style is usually nonexistent. It's deliberate, I think, because his films are usually about a search for redemption and unfold in the real world; ugly and hard. His style suits his themes because he presents his characters in a simple and realistic way, and allows them to show the public the truth of the situation. Imagine if Schrader had directed Taxi Driver or Bringing Out The Dead, instead of Scorsese. But as the protagonists of these two films, while Mishima was an ideal material for Schrader, right-wing, vain and at odds with society, his works were subtle and beautiful. In fact, he had a career as a junior writer as a female writer, describing what can reasonably be described as a romantic boiler. So you would not necessarily imagine that Schrader was the ideal man to capture this subtlety and beauty on film. I think the movie shows that he was. The scenario that he helped to shape divides man into three parts; his life, his death and his spirit. His life is represented in black and white, camera, formal compositions. His death, for which he will always be better remembered, is a pocket documentary. And his spirit is represented by the dramatized excerpts of his novels, each revealing the thought process of this complex man, who has almost never written a character that is not a reflection of himself. These dramatizations are beautiful to watch thanks to Eiko Ishioka's remarkable production scenery and Schrader's imaginative staging. In all areas, the acting is superb, especially Ken Ogata as Mishima, which captures the essential charm, arrogance and narcissism of man. The photography is excellent and contains images that the viewer will keep forever. Finally, the music is simply superb, perfectly matched to the images, although it was written and recorded before shooting, adjusted during the editorial process and then re-recorded. I do not know to what extent the music has influenced the shooting, but it is perfectly related to the image. I've seen a lot of ideas about what the film is about, what Schrader is trying to say. You know, the big things about life, death, etc. But I do not think the movie says anything. Mishima has already said, the film is simply repeated.
