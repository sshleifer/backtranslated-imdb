When making this film, I once heard a statement on television about it. Something like: "Is Killinggänget defeating Nazism?" <br /> <br /> Thus, my understanding of this film was, from the beginning, an idea of ​​Nazism. When I recently saw this film in the TV version, I had this filter in front of me and it was not difficult to see. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I have not yet encountered this way of interpreting the film since heard for the first time. <br /> <br /> These are the things I found in "Four Tones of Brown". In all four stories, lack of empathy leads to disaster: <br /> <br /> 1. The crematorial employee shows no real empathy for dead animals or those who have had to say goodbye to them. In the hall of the crematorium, facing death and fire, it's almost like a cheerful game. The father and his boy do not emphasize the gravity of death and fire, which is why, by ignorance, a pimple leads to disaster that seriously injures his father. <br /> <br /> Possible Lesson: It is important to show young, appropriate emotions. When they grow up, they will need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good. 2. The wizard maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer. Just when she thinks she started cutting the strings in the master's hand, seeking personality, integrity and joy, he pulls hard and is back in despair and despair. <br /> <br /> Their son tried to revolt by creating his own life with perfection and "good" taste in front of his parents "bad" taste. The real problem he faces today is far from clear: his father's behavior persists when his wife chokes on her immaculate environment. <br /> <br /> Possible Lesson: Oppression breeds slavery. <br /> <br /> 3.The father who was abused as a child transmits sadism to his children when he deceives them as an inheritance. It robs them of their childhood and even their legacy at the end. <br /> <br /> Possible Lesson: When no love is given to you, you can not give any. <br /> <br /> 4.Fathers abuse her father's daughter creates in her a ruthless avenger with a sadistic aggression. Here, frozen Nazismism becomes obvious in physical violence. This gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation for the actions of young nazists "with a scintillating head" when oppressing others. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson? Can Nazism be born in a perverse house? <br /> <br /> The abominable consequence of not showing empathy in family life is in the long run to give way to sadistic Nazism? <br /> <br /> It is very rare that a film contains so much. This is revealed little by little while meditating. I consider it brilliantly "painted" and the actors are superb. Especially the handsome kid played by Ulf Brunnberg who turns out to be the worst of all ..
