TV presenter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and radical camerman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are in a nuclear power station when a serious accident occurs. Factory managers downplay him, but Adams filmed everything. Wells and Adams try to spread it, but the company that runs the plant is preventing it. Plant operator Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) realizes that there are serious problems and tests have been falsified. He's trying to convince executives to believe him, but they know it. Wells, Adams and Godell discover that all their lives are in danger. <br /> <br /> I saw him at the cinema in 1979. I was 17 years old and it scared me. To make matters worse, the Three Mile Island crash happened at that time, making the film all the more real. More than 20 years later, it does not scare me, but the film is still excellent. It works like a mystery, a captivating drama and a talk about the nuclear energy sector. Fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as Wells - she perfectly expresses the growing suspicion and horror of her character when she realizes that a nuclear disaster could occur. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He begins by believing in his company and his work and slowly begins to undo when he begins to discover things. He was rightly nominated for an Oscar. Douglas is good but he has a small role and is completely eclipsed by Lemmon and Fonda. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - one of the best of the 70s. Do not miss this one!
