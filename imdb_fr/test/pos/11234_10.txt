It is quite obvious that many of your nights have passed alone. If you had watched 5 minutes of the show instead of watching the ad, you would have seen one of the biggest TV shows in Canadian history. Too bad you watched it alone. Probably the reason you hate it ... no play. The VIP's keys are hilarious, light and fun. Guys are going to eat this show. My game is tight and I can not wait to participate in this show. The chicks were HOOOOOT and the clubs were kicked their ass. I will watch every week. I wonder why other great shows like this are not produced. It is now clear that talent in Canada has the ability to produce American-quality television.
