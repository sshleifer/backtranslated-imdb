A man named Joseph Samuels is found brutally murdered in his apartment. It seems that Samuels was visited by a group of intoxicated soldiers the night before, and one of them seems to have disappeared, the evidence certainly implicates the missing soldier. But as Detective Finlay deepens his case, he discovers that they may be approaching the wrong tree and that this crime is about something terribly sad and vile, anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> Crossfire was born. from Richard Brooks' novel, edited by John Paxton and directed by Edward Dmtryk, William Crossfire (originally titled Cradle Of Fear) is a tense and striking picture that resolutely tackles antisemitism. Although the creators were forced to mitigate the story of the original source, the novel speaks of homosexual hatred as opposed to anti-Semitism, which remains largely because of the RKO sovereign Dore Schary and the producer Adrian Scott, is a kind of creepy discomfort that drops blackish style. <br /> <br /> The cast features three Bob, Young, Mitchum and Ryan, while Gloria Grahame, Black's darling, adds an emotional female heart. Only third is Robert Ryan's photograph, his interpretation of Montgomery's intimidation and connivance, which is part of the first draw, and which perfectly highlights the talent he has had in abundance. Ryan had good reason to give Montgomery some of his work because he had served in the Navy with Richard Brooks himself, the two men having discussed the possibility that, if the novel was to be turned into a movie ?, then Ryan wanted to play and play. Montgomery, so was born Ryan's career as weasel types! Gloria Grahame has also taken a wonderful and sincere turn, which is all the more remarkable as she was plagued by a violent husband at the time. Stanley Clements was known to be violent towards her and her constant presence around the set disturbed the other members of the cast, but Grahame, probably channeling the emotions of real life, became Ginny's character and really shone. Bob Mitchum and Bob Young have both launched brilliant colors to seal the deal on what is truly an intelligent image of Crossfire. <br /> <br /> Tho Crossfire was released before the other anti-Semitic photo of 1947, Gentleman's Agreement, and earning more than a million dollars at the box office, some of its thunder was stolen by the photo Award-winning Fox Studio Award Winner. Named Best Feature, Best Supporting Actor {Ryan}, Best Actress in Second Feature Film {Grahame}, Best Director and Best Screenplay, He did not win, but was hailed by critics as a brilliant change in American cinema. proud and dark as a daring and excellent job. 8.5 / 10
