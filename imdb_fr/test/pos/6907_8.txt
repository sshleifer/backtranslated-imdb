I sell the dead around the burglar Arthur Blake. Willie Grimes, a friend and friend of Blake, has just been executed and Blake will do the same, the next morning. While he is sitting in his cell awaiting execution, a priest named Abbe Duffy comes in and asks him if he will say anything he has seen as a grave robber. He then proceeds to give Father Duffy a quasi-biography of his most interesting exploits. <br /> <br /> The plot is made up of several incidents linked only by a chronology. This prevents the viewer from getting bored, but it also makes the events less meaningful, as you can easily add or delete a lot of scenes without worrying too much. Although defective, I thought overall that this method added to the fun and fun nature of the film and that it was very entertaining. Most of the stories are good, especially the alien, the Murphy and the vampire, but the others were not so great. <br /> <br /> The acting is not surprising, but I did not find it wrong. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance since he managed to be serious when it was necessary and also to play very well in the comic parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The characters were not very detailed, but they were all interesting. . I also appreciated how a number of villains were made almost comically. The part with the return story of the Murphy and their gang is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Overall, I Sell the Dead thus successfully combines horror, comedy and sci-fi in a hodgepodge of entertainment and excitement. This is one of the most interesting and original films I've seen in a while, and it's unfortunate that independent films like this one are not more recognized.
