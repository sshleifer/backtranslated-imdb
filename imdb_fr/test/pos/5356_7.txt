What ho! This one is very good. I say very well, old boy. Or should I say "old bean"? My mastery of British terminology is a little dusty. Anyway, my biker boots and I entered this projection without prior visual experience of Wallace and Gromit. I'm happy to say that my boots and I came out happy to have met them. <br /> <br /> Even though it's not as accessible to adults as Toy Story, W & G still manages to be smart enough to provide the adults with a bit of humor that will definitely fly over from the heads of those young people who are too busy crying at the vomit of the Were Rabbit to have the slightest idea that something is wrong. I strongly suggest that you be very careful every time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick previews of word games that you will miss if you are not careful. My favorite is a monster book that refers to the Loch Ness monster as a "tourist trap". If you've ever heard "I can really understand Kevin Federline" or if you're just illiterate, not only will you miss those jokes, but you should probably spend your time learning to read instead. to go to the cinema. Consider this as a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect of W & G is its clay animation. Thanks to the tedious process, it took FIVE YEARS to finish the film! According to press notes, there were days when the optimal goal was simply to complete 10 seconds of finished film. My friends, I sometimes find it difficult to find the motivation to finish answering some emails or to add captions to the photos of my critics (which is evidenced by the lack of photos in this review); so I can not even imagine having the patience required for that. <br /> <br /> I really like the raw and practical quality of modeling clay figures. The fact that you can see fingerprints in the clay is a nice personal touch. How not to be impressed by clay characters that show more expression and emotion than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves combined? The curse of the werewolf is, as its director Nick Park says, the world's first vegetarian horror movie to entertain children and adults alike. Relieving (and as a man who prides himself on his long-haired, cold-bearded masculinity, I hesitate to use that word) cute and (oh man, I probably should not use that word either) Adorable characters rather than becoming obsolete MC Martial references, W & G is proof that DreamWorks can create an entertaining animation when it chooses intelligence over the cheap joke.
