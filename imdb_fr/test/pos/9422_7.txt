From 1942, the character of Sherlock Holmes played by Basil Rathbone was located in Britain then "modern". Many Holmes purists rented the first two entries in the series (produced by FOX), but rejected the 12 features that followed. For my part, I have never been a diligent reader and I appreciate these films as they are without initial bias. In fact, the framework of this entry that surrounds the Second World War places it as a period element of British propaganda that manifests throughout the film. The execution of the modern Holmes is treated with much more care than the previous entry (Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror) and is doing much better for two reasons. First, Roy William Neil is on hand to lead (and would be for the rest of the series), and secondly although Holmes is opposed to the Nazis, the inclusion of Professor Moriarty gives more the impression that it is a battle of the world. intelligence between two rivals. . Lionel Atwill's performance has been criticized by many as being much lower than that of George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I have the impression that it is more the scenario than the interpretation of the characters. Especially after realizing that Atwill was very capable of being much more diverse and enthusiastic in other horror roles. Basil Rathbone is however exceptional in this entry. He seems to be having fun in the role of Holmes, but I want to write. For example: Holmes 'introduction to Voice of Terror attempts to immediately establish how incredibly intelligent Holmes is as soon as he is on screen, while this film shows Holmes' brilliant deductions, but also his flaws. Even in the climax, Holmes initially has the advantage, and then let his blood flow slowly from his body. Now, there are some flaws in this movie that I thought I could report. First, the opening; Are not the Germans too deceived? Maybe it's just me, but the bookseller has just come into the bar, he says he's going to ask Tobel not only to answer his door after weeks gone into hiding, but to allow him to to go in and walk with him? What!? Second, Tobel certainly seems to put everyone around him in danger. Leaving the parts of the bomb secret with genius scientists. Leaving the note with his fiance. Like what was he thinking? He put them all in danger. I thought he was that superb scientist trying to save England? And the whole concept of "do not use them before they use us" is not a little hard. Propaganda obvious. Third, how, in the name of God, was Holmes supposed to stand in the depths of this chest? It's really small! In fact, Holmes' entire execution of Moriarty's discovery under the disguise of the old detonator is not really explained very well. I have seen this film more than fifty times and there are still parts like this that are performed in a very confusing way. Fourth, all right, Holmes discovers that the first three scientists are dead, and then immediately assumes that Moriarty can not know the name of the fourth man because he was not yet dead. Well, if Holmes did not know the name, how could he handle it? The guy could very well have been face down in a lake. Stroke of luck. Fifth, again with confusion. When Holmes is supposed to die on Moriarty's operating table, how can he recover so quickly? He acted as if he had lost a few liters of blood, but not enough to prevent him from saving the situation. Despite these flaws, this is an extremely entertaining movie. The disguises are well done, the mystery of the dancing men is well done (especially the back-to-back scenes of Holmes and Moriarty both claiming to be analyzing them), and Dennis Hoey as a Lestrade Inspector is always an advantage . And finally, the interrogation scene always bugs me a bit, I always thought it was one of the most successful sequences of the film. Overall, this film occupies a special place with me because it is the one that has solidified my Rathbone-Holmes obsession. A classic. 7/10.
