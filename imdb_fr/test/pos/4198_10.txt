It's one of those movies where it's easy to see that some people would not like it. My wife never saw her, and when I looked at her again last night, I waited for her to go to bed. She might have been amused by a few short excerpts, but I know she would have had enough after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The head has nothing to do with a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. This could be considered a filmic surrealism in a word, or as a postmodern acidic journey across cinematographic genres. If you're not a big fan of these things - psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism and "aesthetics of acid travel" (assuming there is a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this movie . On the other hand, if you're a fan of this kind of music, you should buy Head now if you have not done it yet. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the film has never been very respected. This probably has a lot to do with preconceptions. After all, he plays in The Monkees - Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and The Monkees was a group of musical actors reunited by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider in the aim of Gummy Beatles for a television series . In their day, they had as much respect as Menudo, New Kids on the Block, The Spice Girls, etc. As another IMDb critic rightly notes - "Maybe in 1968 people, considering the Monkees as a stupid pop band made in the factory by the Beatles, refused to see (Head)". <br /> <br /> The Monkees and Head have never been able to dispel this negative perception of the public. It's a shame, because there was a lot of talent, musically and otherwise, in The Monkees. He is probably stranger than Rafelson, who runs here and co-produced with Schneider, and Jack Nicholson (yes, Jack Nicholson), who wrote the screenplay and co-produced as well, decided to follow The Monkees in this unusual direction. It's as if New Kids on the Block released an album equivalent to Ummagumma from Pink Floyd (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, Head's songs, written by The Monkees and frequent collaborators such as Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a quality similar to Floyd's, somewhere between the Syd Barrett era and the immediate post-Barrett era. This is much more important than any similarity of the Beatles. Some people have complained about the music of the film, but for me, all the songs are jewels. By the way, some people do not like the Barrett (or other) Floyd era, which is just as difficult for me to understand. <br /> <br /> But what is he talking about? The bottom line is that The Monkees engages in various genres of movies - war scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, drama scenes, western scenes, sci-fi scenes, scenes from romance, and so on. . Except that, in the reality of the film, this occurs mainly (if not exclusively) on a lot of studio. Basically, we watch the Monkees shoot a movie. Of course, all scenes of different genres have something surreal and self-referential and they, as well as individual shots within a scene, tend to behave mutually using a dream logic that does not is not very different from the TV show Monty Python. As a dream, Head tends to waver between a good dream and a nightmare, while being the one that would make you laugh while you sleep (which I do frequently, by the way). <br /> <br /> Technically Rafelson uses a wide variety of techniques to achieve the above. There are scenes with many negative pictures, there are a lot of very fast cuts (including a beautiful sequence featuring Davy Jones and Tony Basil dancing alternately in a clean room and a dark room, wearing a combination of white and of inverted black in every once in a while, there are a lot of strange scenes, there's an animated cowmouth, there are weird editing devices, etc. For my money, I'd like this material not to not just a remnant of the psychedelic era, that's the kind of artistic approach I'm crazy about, it seemed like a good idea back then and I still think it's a good idea. movies like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou using (2004) using these types of extended techniques.Now this would make this movie surreal. <br /> <br /> From an interpretive point of view, people who are not if in tune with the aesthetics of the trip ac ide complained that it is basically b.s. offer meanings for something not to have one. I disagree with such a pessimistic / nihilistic view; Head was meant to have a lot of meaning (s), and it's not just movies without classic plots that have multiple interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have a lot of interesting things to say about The Monkees - the film comments in a postmodern way on their manufactured status; pop star - long before Pink Floyd, Head combines celebrity with violence and pop, images of war with images of fans cannibally dismantling their idols; and na√Øve ideas of international perceptions and respect inspired by the United States - well-armed outsiders in a desert capitulation to Micky Dolenz just because he is American, then they explode a coke machine (again in the desert) for him because he is thirsty and can not access. The film comments on many other topics - from big industry to police, polls, the viewer (especially tragedies), and so on. Head is full of ideas, appropriately, with intelligent and multifaceted things to say about them. <br /> <br /> Head deserves to be considered a classic. It's basically about creating the same atmosphere as the Yellow Beatles Submarine. Both were created in November 1968, which is interesting, and both were meant to summarize psychedelic aesthetics. Yellow Submarine did not do very well. The head is all that Yellow Submarine should have been.
