All you need is a big house, a baby sitter and a phone. Simon West directs this thrilling and chilling remake of the original of 1979. This version is more a thriller than a horror movie. Emotionally tense with a growing fear factor. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) must pay an excessive cell phone bill; her job is to keep the two children of the doctor and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a beautiful masterpiece of the 1970s in wood and glass. Isolated and peaceful. The children are already in bed, the wind rises and meets in a pouring rain. The phone starts ringing, ringing, ringing. The babysitter is soon in a frenzied mode of survival, fearing the scary outsider on the other end of the phone. <br /> <br /> Belle is great as an innocent, intelligent and strong babysitter. The voice of the unknown on the phone is that of Lance Henriksen, while the physical unknown is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also presented: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Congratulations to James Dooley for the atmospheric original music.
