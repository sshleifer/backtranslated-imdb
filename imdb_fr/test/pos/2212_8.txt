I had the opportunity to see this independent film and I was impressed by it, despite the lack of excitement of the plot. The acting game was very good by everyone involved. Amy Madigan played the role of a guilt-thirsty, tired but well-intentioned mother determined to make up for her younger daughter's health. At the same time, she neglected her older sister, who was more interested in playing with her brother or sister with Savant syndrome and living in an escaped world. <br /> <br /> The men of the movie are very powerful their secondary roles. Christopher Lloyd, in a very discreet role, shows us why he is so versatile. He plays a teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research, but who lacks meaningful relationships. He and Madigan meet very well together, but they both know that nothing can come from their friendship anymore. Their silent goodbye is nothing short of brilliant, a drama lesson for budding artists. <br /> <br /> And in a small role, Fred Savage is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> You can tell why this The movie was based on a play, it's probably very good on stage. On screen, it's not particularly exciting, but it's nevertheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
