Seeing that this movie was on the IMDB Bottom 20, I just had to praise it. <br /> <br /> SUPRISE! SUPRISE! I have no regrets to see this movie at all. In fact, I really appreciated. There is a level of camp in this film that shames the cult classics of the 80s. Is this stupid? yes, but Jim Wynorski proves that stupid is not necessarily bad in the end. <br /> <br /> Praise him for a laugh that seems unexpected, but is actually meant to be funny. Wynorski is a genius. I hope he directs the next film Ninja Turtles
