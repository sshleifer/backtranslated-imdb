This is one of the greatest stories ever written, brilliantly presented and poetry on screen by this father-son team, working together, unfortunately, for the first and the last time. John Huston should end his career with a high note by bringing the work of one of his favorite authors to the screen, in what is easily the best adaptation to the screen of Joyce. Huston has made a career of adapting great literary works to the film, usually with great success. It is unfortunate and somewhat surprising that Tony Huston has practically started and ended his film career by adapting what would be his father's latest project and winning a well-deserved Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Once I had the privilege of sitting with the great screenwriter / playwright Horton Foote, who cited this movie as one of his favorite movies in recent years (at the time it was still a relatively new version). A rather prolific screenwriter himself (and a brilliant screen-adapter of his own works, as well as great writers such as Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee), he was visibly impressed by Tony Huston's first effort, and perhaps also baffled by his lack of output since then. If anyone has ideas to share on the subject, I would like to know more.
