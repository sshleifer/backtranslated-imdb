I had neglected this film when I went to the movie store, but curiosity had me and I decided to check it out. I liked it!!! The film begins with Judy and Jay heading for a halloween party at the abandoned funeral home of Hull House. We then meet some extra characters, Angela and Suzzanne (guests), Frannie, Max, Rodger, Sal and Helen. Then, of course, they start to party and when they are really in the mood they decide to do a session that wakes up a demon. The demon possesses Angela and she begins her horrible massacre. Will they survive the Night of Demons. <br /> <br /> The film was overall excellent. The gore was good but the nudity provided by Linnea Quigley (ROTLD Trash) screwed it again. I have never been a fan and I will never be.
