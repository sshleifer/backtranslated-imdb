As often when Manga is translated into real action, the translation is a little lost. However, this remains a very entertaining movie. The principle is unusual and it is presented in the discreet and sober style that prevails in Japanese movies (ha!). The special effects are a bit like a 70s camp, but that adds to the cartoon feel of the movie. I would not recommend this movie to everyone but, if you know (and appreciate) other Japanese horror movies like "Evil Dead's Trap", this movie will please you.
