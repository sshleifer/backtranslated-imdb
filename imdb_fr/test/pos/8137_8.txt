What are the movies? I mean .. what are the movies for? Shootings? Killings? NO. They are made for life stories and that's what this movie does. It shows how life has changed between two ages. The father and a son, the father needing a job and asking for help from the son. <br /> <br /> Although there is another generation, there are still some features, such as the caress for the family. The main subject is, in my opinion, the son's love for the father and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The film is composed of a single dialogue but this dialogue is more than I could ever want. This film is pure art! Once again, after "Marfa si Banii", Cristi Puiu gives us another beautiful film. Good game !
