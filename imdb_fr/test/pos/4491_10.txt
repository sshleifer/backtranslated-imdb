I will never forget the totally absorbing effect this show had on me when I saw it for the first time. From the moment the major is surprised by the clown, until his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation ("We are alive, we are people, we must have memories!" Quote inaccurate but close) his clever attempt to improvise a means of escape is a fascinating drama. <br /> <br /> Small attentions remain in the hands of the spectator for a long time after having looked at him. The moment when the beautiful ballerina dances for everyone, to the sound of the Scottish musician's bagpipes. Tramp's nostalgic remark, "A miss is worth a mile," the major's shaken conclusion that they must be in hell. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant episode, beautifully written and interpreted. The breathtaking beauty of Susan Harrison adds to the memorableness of this strange and touching story.
