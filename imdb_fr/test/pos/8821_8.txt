This is a "docu-drama" of (mostly) the last years of KW's life, with almost all the roles played by actors (but a spot that the quartermaster of the TV plays himself!). It was designed for the BBC4 art channel, but I think there will soon be syndication and DVD releases. KW is skilfully performed by the excellent Michael Sheen, who has successfully rehearsed his previous role on stage. Most of the supporting actors are also very good, and a nice touch is the reenactment of the appearances on vintage television with the new actors. It's not, however, a light-weight view - anyone familiar with KW's agendas and his unfortunate general behavior will already know how twisted he may be later in life - so do not expect 80 minutes of buffoonery Carry On style, because the accent is clearly negative. Recommended, but it's tragi-comic, indeed.
