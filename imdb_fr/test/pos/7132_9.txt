I saw this during the screening at GenCon in Indy. I had time to kill and I decided to check. Some 1,000 people ended up in a crowded ballroom reserved for standing. <br /> <br /> Wow, what a walk! The script was tight. Tense action. The perfect rhythm. The exposure of the character is excellent. One thing I really appreciated was that you knew this movie was not a big budget. Yet it soon became clear that creators pushed their sets and effects as much as they could despite their limitations. And it was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film was intended for a certain audience - players / table players - the creators made no effort to hide it. But other filmmakers could learn a lot from them. To go into the scene judging scene after scene and not worrying about whether mom watching is going to "get it", they laugh the biggest laugh over and over. But there is enough universality for Mom to laugh too, even if she is not in all the jokes. I think that too often, I see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator to please the greatest number, but the film ends up suffering. <br /> <br /> But not this movie. Indeed, this film was so solid that the public had taken it in the fingers of the opening credits. And, although the viewers around me * really wanted to * love the movie, they were not slackers - players can be among the most critical niches. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I could see him in a large crowd. At least 10 times, the public had such a good time that it was applauded during a joke or a scene during the film. How often does this happen during screenings? It should come as no surprise that there was a huge ovation at the close of the closing credits. <br /> <br /> For my part, I am impatient to publish it. In the end, one of the producers said he was shooting for a simultaneous TV / DVD release. This date can not come soon enough.
