A very different movie from Jerry Lewis, not like all the more famous movies that everyone knows. Lewis approaches the difficult task of World War II and national socialism in Germany in a rather unconventional way. But more interesting and more importantly, he does it in a very little American way. And, like many other things in the world and especially in the film industry, an American means more sophisticated, more subtle, smarter or just better. This is why the film was not a success in the United States but a great success in Europe. <br /> <br /> In total, Jerry Lewis proved by this film that he was able to do much more than just burlesque comedy.
