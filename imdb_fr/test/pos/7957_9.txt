I've always had the idea that Korean movies only talk about comedy and drama, but "Christmas in Autumn" has changed my point of view. This film is so simple. He does not have melodramatic scenes or the most popular comedy scenes. Not a single scene where actors shout loudly. Not even a scene where the actor and the actress kiss each other, not even a simple kiss. And yet, this film is able to reach its viewers in a way that, I know, exists. The end of the film left me speechless. I even cry, but my eyes were burning. This film left me with a feeling that I can hardly describe in words. <br /> <br /> I do not think I can recommend this movie to everyone, but I recommend it to those who want to watch real cinema. 9.4 / 10
