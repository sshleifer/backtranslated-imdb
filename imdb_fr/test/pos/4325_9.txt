Lost has been one of the most fascinating and exciting experiences I have ever seen. Not only is it the mother of coincidence, but every time you think you can put the puzzle in your head, the story takes a totally new direction. <br /> <br /> Take this victim for example, the United States. Marine, who gives Sayid the means to become a hangman, Is Clancy Brown, embodies the character of Joe Inman. In the last episode, he plays Kelvin Inman, Desmond's partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh? Yeah Right! <br /> <br /> I guess we'll all have to wait to see the rest of the lives of the wonderful people of this strange island, in the middle of nowhere. Knowing that many of my favorite characters, Desmond, Sayid and M. Eko, have a fuzzy destiny, I think that, with 24 and The Shield, this is of course one of the best TV series of all time, keeping Twin Peaks in a special place.
