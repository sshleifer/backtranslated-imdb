I'm always impressed when a director (and this director / screenwriter) takes a classic text - and makes it alive. Of course, Shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps, even when treated with personal importance, but seeing a production where true inventiveness makes the words wonderful is even more formidable. . There are many troubling things in the room. This is a racist piece about racism - which still clings. I never accepted Jessica's desertion from her father for no good reason. I have never accepted the position of pious holiness of Christians. But, brilliantly, there is a text prologue that helps us understand the times and politics in which the story unfolds and, happily, much of Jessica's is cut off. <br /> <br /> cut passages. But I only noticed one line that was cut off when I was hoping to hear it - and it was replaced by a look that says it all. This wise economy and editing gave us a captivating film - not just a movie of the play. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is a reason why Antonio is so loyal and generous towards those who do not deserve / are not related Bassanio - you can almost feel Antonio's pulse racing he sees Bassanio gondolaing or arriving for a visit. But it's as subtle as that - no more. I was fascinated. <br /> <br /> There were many other highlights. I felt that the arguments during the trial were heartbreaking. And, the suitors' lawsuits are hilarious. <br /> <br /> Add all this to a cinematography and glorious costumes that have resonated over time, and you'll understand why I'm looking forward to seeing him again. And even.
