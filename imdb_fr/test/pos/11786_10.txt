I just want to say that I was delighted to find these comments on the show. I tried online searches for information about the series, without success. I loved the show. I find it hard to motivate myself to exercise, but this show made me happy. Like another comment mentioned that it was not so complicated as the routines these days. It was an ideal workout to do the job! I would give anything to buy a copy of a single workout. I remember a lot of moves, but not nearly all. Someone is trying to retransmit it and make it available on DVD. It's so good to know that I was not the only one to have enjoyed this show! Thank you for making my day!
