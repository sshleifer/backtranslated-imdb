It is a magnificent film, precisely balancing fragile human stories (before and after 1945) and the blind struggle of war. The use of extracts from the Battle of Britain (a film that misdescribes the 1940s!) Strengthens, instead of harming the whole. A deeply impressive work, it has been in my memory for two years since I saw it, and I have just bought it to explore the aliens. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Like "Aces High", he alternates extremely exciting (or scary) aerial combat sequences, where the spectator risks losing characters he cares about, but also unpredictable interactions on the ground, where skillful writers and real-life experiences of life inform certain events involving and moving. It also highlights the fact that for many people, the year 1945 marked not only the end of one conflict, but the beginning of another, and even today, we still do not recognize the loss, the courage and the sacrifice of so many nameless heroes, or even worse. venerate them at a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that this entails - to make their sacrifices all the more valiant. <br /> <br /> Watching this film is an experience that will take you from the top of friendship to the deepest jealousy and back to love that lasts even after death. If all the war movies were like that, we would never have to fight again. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that it was worth watching? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
