The Argentine poet Atahualpa Yupanqui once said that some popular music is repeated in the same way in all countries of the world. They are alike but each considers them as their own folk music ... <br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, speaks of the same music that is repeated all over the world at a time in the history of each country. First, some listen to it while playing and try to make it heard. Then some people think they hear it, but they do not hear it. Then nobody says anything and some people seem to listen to him. And others acknowledge having heard it, but did not think others could hear it. Finally, everyone listens to the same music and suddenly, it does not ring anymore ... <br /> <br /> Love and poetry, true nationalism and inheritance of a father to his children ... <Why would you call? there the movie The Dead when no one dies? The Spanish translation of the title has refused to follow the same rule and we call it Dubliners, following the title of James Joyce ... <br /> <br /> A nice postcard filmed in 1900 in Irish!
