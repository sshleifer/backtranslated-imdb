This was recommended to me by a friend who said it was cute and cuddly for a "Lesbian Sexuality Flick". Was my boy wrong? I guess he just did not understand. Growing up, not understanding and then discovering through trial and tribulation, it's more like that. <br /> <br /> The characters are full and full of life and the story has enough fun in theatrical performances to interest others. <BR /> <br /> Rachael Stirling as "Nan" is going through so many attempts to find the love she desires, but she's the only person she was afraid to reveal and who ran outside. Johdi May as "Flo" was outstanding. I spent a few hours trying to remember where I had seen her before, only to find out she was the silent sister "Alice" in "The Last of the Mohicans". Fortunately, I grew up in a liberal family and had no problem trying a movie. like that. So many people miss out on movies like this. I'm happy to have followed my friend's advice and tried it. But, I'm sure I enjoyed it more.
