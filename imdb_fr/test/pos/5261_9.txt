I am a 58 year old man. One rainy afternoon, my wife suggested I go see The Women. After reading the reviews, I thought that could lead to a nap in the afternoon. Wrong- this film caught my interest from start to finish. It was great to finally see Meg Ryan become great again. Let's face it Meg looks much better with long hair. Annette Benning was different for me in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen shows her age, as does Carrie Fisher. The girl, Molly, has been exceptionally acted out by young India. I have been able to understand the dialogue that is difficult in many current movies because of the speed of speech. Cloris Leachman and the Finn were great as housekeepers who extended their usual tasks. The scenes in New York were nice to see. Oh, and Bette Midler had a short role but, as usual, it was great. So I gave this chick a chick a 9. Guys- Go see it even for the pleasure of the eyes like Eva Mendes. It will not disappoint.
