An amazing film that has so much revealed the disability that scares people. It has shown that bodies can be captured by less-than-voluntary bodies and that it is difficult to attend events involving other people who are wanted by a person with a disability. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humor and so many other things have been so well captured. The 2 main characters were very well interpreted by the 2 valid actors and invited your laughs, your tears, your worry, your joy and your consternation. <br /> <br /> I approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation, fearing too much of a sympathy game or lingering on negative aspects. It was however a beautiful story of 2 friends. <br /> <br /> I loved it.
