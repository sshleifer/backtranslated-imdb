Personally, I did not know either Karen Carpenter or Richard, so I have to rely on the description of the film. I think a better person to ask questions about accuracy would be his brother Richard. However, from what I saw and learned from Karen, I felt her pain, shared her sadness and she was a very special person for me in my childhood. I know I was not born until 1965, so I did not get to know her as much as some of your older fans, but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of it. I remember the song on the "Radio" (every song was so beautiful, etc.) and I remembered, "We're just getting started!" In fact, I've memorized many, many of his songs, and some people (many) tell me that my voice is almost identical to this one !!! (I'm not joking about it.) I was also anorexic during my high school and during my college studies (1978-1987). weighed between 82 and 120 pounds in 1987. I developed quite serious health problems that allowed me to identify with the actress representing Karen in the film.The mother (Agnes) was MUCH like my mother in many I could also feel the pain that Karen had to feel because my mother was often insensitive, critical and disapproved like Agnes (if that was true), the movie was helpful in identifying and knowing Karen a more personal note by not only hearing her music but seeing what she was living. It is important to describe the whole life of a person in 2-3 hours and to tell every detail to perfection. I must say that there is probably no such exact biography. I will give this story an 8 if! I would have liked to know Karen personally! I would be dead to meet her !! I would have liked to shake her hand, hug her or talk to her. I feel her warmth and love every time I hear one of her songs and we miss her a lot.
