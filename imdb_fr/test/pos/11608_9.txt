Chokher Bali was shown at DC Filmfest (Washington) on April 15, 2005. The director, Rituparno Ghosh, was there to give a brief introduction and answer questions later. <br /> <br /> As always, I think Aishwarya has fantastic work. I can understand those who think she should be more aggressive or bitchy, but would that be really realistic in 1904? Possible, perhaps; Realistically, I'm not so sure. I think his interpretation was valid, although there certainly could be other ways to do it. <br /> <br /> I do not like to use the word, but it was the most "inaccessible" Indian film I've seen so far. . I know a lot of Indian history, Hindu religion, etc., but the level of detail here was way beyond me. Clearly, you would have a much better understanding of the film if you were intimately familiar with Hinduism and its customs, especially as they were c. 1904. A lot of things have escaped me, including the fact that the mother-in-law wants Binodini to be at home to counterbalance her daughter-in-law Ashalata. <br /> <* Spoilers * Ghosh had several things to say that explained the movie a lot better for me. First, the original Bengali version was more than 20 minutes long. So what has been left out? Apparently, three main things: a starting segment where Binodini (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal for Calcutta. According to the director, various characters speak W. Bengali against E. Bengali, which will bring some political comment later. Of course, all this is lost in the Hindi version, and certainly for a non-Indian like me, it would not have mattered anyway - but a Bengali situation setting certainly would have it. Then Binodini wrote a poem - a sign of his independence, and so on. Finally, some business concerning jewelry. So, although some people think it was too long, I think the original, longer version would have been clearer. <br /> <br /> The woman's hair was apparently another sign (Ghosh again) - the mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows), her sister - also a widow - had the longer hair (more modern!) and, of course, Binodini / Aishwarya had extremely long hair to the waist (rejection of widowhood status). <br /> <br /> The end really threw me - suddenly Binodini, who had never had a political thought, is writing a political manifesto? Whoa! Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno at a film festival when the subtitles were made. Subtitles use the word "country" throughout Binodini's letter. Gosh said that a more appropriate word would have been (I forget her exact word) something like "self" or "independence" - she was talking about her own liberation and "ending up" - not Bengal, India and the British. . So, why does Binodini disappear the day after finding Behari? Apparently, because during her stay on the Ganges, she realizes she does not need a man - no man - to define / complete it. She can just be herself. So she rejects Behari, to whom she threw herself a few months earlier, and leaves. Of course, I do not know how she will buy her next meal, but that's another question. <br /> <br /> The red shawl (Ghosh again) she buys represents both "revolution" and "passion". I'm not 100% sure why she puts the shawl on the dying girl, but maybe she rejects the passion / revolution? The binoculars that Binodini uses throughout the film (to watch Mahendra and Ashalata, the boat on the Ganges, etc.). She is seeing a life she hopes she can not have. In the end (I missed that!), She left the binoculars on the table with the letter, showing that she did not need them anymore - she was going to lead her own life. <br /> <br /> Finally, Tagore's quote at the beginning explaining how he apologized for the end ... Apparently, Tagore wrote this as a soap opera, hooking his readers with the widow's sexy locks . But in the end, he sold himself to conservatism and made Binodini kneel at the feet of Mahendra and Behari, asking them for forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote to Tagore to take him to the party for his final sale ... and Tagore apologized for the end. In the movie, of course, Ghosh goes the other way.
