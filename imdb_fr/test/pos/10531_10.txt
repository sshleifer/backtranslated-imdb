This film is a very old remake of Fritz Lang's famous masterpiece, "M-Murder". It is well done and with a fun key to talk about the serious events and contemporary issues at Eurobe, but not just around the world. Ethnic intolerance is such a huge and contagious evil nowadays. Thus, "Children of Wax" or, as we know it in the American distribution, amusingly reveals the question of German and Turkish hatred. There is no doubt that it is well appreciated to be taken for distribution by the Weinsten's big brothers. There is another fact! The most beloved is the participation in this film of the favorite actor of Lars von Trier, the great Udo Kier, who shows playing with such pleasure for the Bulgarian director Ivan Nichev.
