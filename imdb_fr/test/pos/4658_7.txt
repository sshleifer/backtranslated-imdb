Somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells, a song is playing in my head. I can not forget it, no matter how hard I try. This is the madness of the night and it will happen to you! If only I could find a copy on a single disc. Five disparate teams travel to Latin America for a treasure hunt for clues instead of physical objects. A neglected game master with two wonderful assistants is the mastermind of all this madness that is about to break loose in Los Angeles. All the teams are stereotypes (this film dates from 1980, before the politically correct spoils everything): the "good", the "nerds" led by Eddie Deezen, the "jocks" beasts in love with beer, the "ladies of the type "we do not need a man", especially the redhead, the laughing twins are a scream, too, and finally, the "bad guys" with Stephen Furst as a leader.Furst is as hilarious as Harold, the overweight broth, who tries to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a gooey mess, movies like this are no longer made, nowadays the films have to be "nervous", Dark characters and other nonsense Let's go back to the days when the "good guys" led by David Naughton were always good and without absolute conflict, so give up all the serious pretensions and come back to 1980. It's midnight madness. .
