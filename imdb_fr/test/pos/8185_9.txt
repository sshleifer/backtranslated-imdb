Chen Kaige gives us a wonderful depth of atmosphere. Yes, it's a "vintage piece", but Chen's artistic use of imagery makes it something more. Actors often behave like players using the stylized diction, postures and facial expressions of Peking Opera. All the actors of a scene play on the "wall of the bottom", even when they speak to each other. They are like the spirits of the past enunciating with powerful clarity a story that has an urgent meaning for those of the present. "Jing ke ci qin wang", combined with a particular attention to the scale and mastery of cinematography inside and outside, is a magnificent story told with great reverence in his own idiom that captivates completely.
