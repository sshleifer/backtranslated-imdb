Many people remember the Waco impasse that happened a long time ago. What most people have probably rooted in their minds is the "cult leader," David Koresh, and the images of the complex burning up completely after a long confrontation. Many people believe that Koresh was some kind of crazy man who thought he was God. He was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and death of his supporters. In addition, many people feel that the cult committed suicide en masse when the FBI stormed Mount Carmel Center and the building was burning. Most people think that the cult was responsible for not accepting the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people feel that the cult was brainwashed from Koresh and followed by everything he said. Nothing could be further from the truth, because of the obvious evidence after the end of the nightmare, and this unique documentary proves it pretty much! <br /> <br /> This documentary is one of the most balanced reviews of the situation. It is much more complete and detailed than most people have received in mainstream media. In shock to many, this documentary will reveal that it was the ATF, the FBI and the higher echelons of the US government, who were the ones who were unfair, cruel and deceitful, not David Koresh and his supporters. What Korseh and the Davidians did was only protecting their constitutional rights, and the higher powers were violating and completely violating those rights. AFT has no reason to storm the complex; it was the AFT that fired first and they fired helicopters from above on men, women and unarmed children !! What is even more shocking is the actions of the FBI when they entered Mount Carmel. Look for yourself and you will develop a new perspective on the US government. There are infrared images that clearly show that the FBI fired with machine guns at men, women and children in the burning compound. It will boil your blood. This will really make you angry. You will wonder what kind of people run this country. Finally, you will wonder if everything you say to the news every night is the truth and nothing but the truth. This video is scary and I highly recommend it if you can find it. This documentary does not need to be purchased; it can be viewed for free on google video!
