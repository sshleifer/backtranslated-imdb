This is a charming yet original adaptation of Thomas Mann's novel of the same title. Dirk Bogarde gives his best performance on the screen - he believed it himself. The dialogue is minimal and his face must record the nuances of his anguished character - a composer (a writer of the short story - the only major change) who travels to Venice in 1910. Visconti admires the portrait of beauty, his disappearance and Drawn As an opera director, Visconti perfectly mixes Mahler's music and images in his best film since "The Leopard" (another amazing film, which greatly influenced Coppola's Sicily in "The Godfather").
