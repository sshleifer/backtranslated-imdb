I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for him since. It was obsessive: visual, textural, sensual. This film took me somewhere like a dream and I did not care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember how it made my head tilt. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I did not know what happened at the end of the film, but I think life is like that. It did not bother me. The injustice of the ultimate rejection of an innocent person seems to me sadly real. I loved the faces, the way the camera lived them. The camera looked at the scenery with the fuzzy eyes of a dreamer. Borderline was real to me in a way that movies are not. It is precisely the lack of explanation, of color, of sharpness that made him enter my consciousness like a thief in the night. I love that movie. One day I will own it.
