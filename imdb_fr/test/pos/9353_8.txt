My 2 best actors are in this movie - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. <br /> <br /> Ryan could play anything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller, and play it beautifully. In this film, when he begins his speech "... people with names like Samuels and others with names hard to say", it is scary to watch it. <br /> <br /> Robert Young plays the police officer who is called to investigate the assassination of Samuels (Sam Levine), a civilian who talks with several soldiers in a bar. Mitchell is the wanted soldier in relation to the latter - his wallet was found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a nice soldier, he misses only his wife. <br /> <br /> The story is told from different angles. Mitchell and Samuels make friends and return to Samuels's apartment. Samuels seems to know the loneliness felt by Mitchell. "For years, you've focused on a peanut and now you have nothing to feel," he says of the war. <br /> <br /> Ryan is superb like Monty, the psychotic racist. <BR /> <br /> Robert Young (with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was taken over by the film noir. "Crossfire", "They will not believe me" and "The other woman" are excellent examples. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is his usual laid-back character of philosopher Keeley. <br /> <br /> Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as "odd couple" are also remarkable in their brief but revealing roles. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best movie about racism ever made.
