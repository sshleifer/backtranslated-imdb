Personally, I think the film is pretty good. He almost got an 8. I liked the ethnographic aspect as well as the beautiful photography. The character of Colin Firth is not the most friendly but he does a decent job with the role. The heroine, portrayed by the beautiful Nia Long, is a well-known movie heroine who tries to do what she thinks is best for her child - to marry a respected member of her expat community - all by fighting his attraction to the "bad". "man - someone who is not a member of his community (the" outsider ") Most of the film is about this mother's struggle: should she do what is expected of her? that she thinks she's best for her son or should she follow her heart? I do not want to give an end. Let me say that it's a film that does good, with beautiful shots, Exquisite African outfits (it's worth seeing the movie only for African women's brightly colored clothes and headdresses) and friendly characters.The actor who plays Nia Long's son is brilliant and adorable. If you're a fan of Colin Firth, you MUST see this movie If you like classy movies, see it, I think I'll watch it again tonight !
