Family Guy must be my favorite cartoon of all time.It's definitely the funniest TV series ever made and it's better than the Simpsons.I have never laughed so much in a TV show of my life. Things that make the series so funny are the plot, characters and themes covered in the show. Very few themes have not been addressed in Family Guy. <br /> <br /> I've seen just about every Family Guy episode of all time. I must say that the show was better during the first two seasons.My favorite characters are Peter because he is very funny and is the best character in the series.My second favorite character is Stewie because he is the funniest villain to If you like Family Guiy, you should take a look at American Dad because it's so similar and is created by Seth McFarlane. I hope this show will never end because it's a comic genius! 10/10
