"Dead Man Walking" is an incredible movie. All actors act with realism and realism. The scenario addresses the issue of the death penalty on both sides, giving them an equal tribute. It is above all a deeply moving story of redemption, death with dignity and loss of the ego. Any film dealing with this incredibly difficult subject with such courage and maturity deserves a mark of 10/10. Thanks, Tim Robbins!
