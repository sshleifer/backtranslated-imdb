Lackawanna Blues is a drama from the ground up. It details the life of a strong woman named Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Everyone who knows her is referring to Rachel, but she could have been called Wonder Woman as well. She embodied strength, willpower, self-confidence and resolve. She owned a house in which she lived just about every type of person that society would refuse. Her tenants were a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants who made the house far from ordinary. At each successive event, Rachel followed suit and ran flawlessly. She was not a dictator devoid of compassion, but in reality she was the opposite. She showed compassion almost entirely by providing shelter and shelter to so many people that she seemed to have grown too much. <br /> <br /> Merkerson did a good job, but I think that role was important to him. The film had a uniform keel never departing from Rachel. There were of course some dramatic moments, but it was to be expected. Nothing was ever as shocking or profound as Rachel herself.
