I do not see how a movie of this quality receives only an average of 5.7 of the voters of IMDb. It is a classic Australian production that resembles recent efforts such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES, SUGAR FACTORY, OCCASIONAL AND COASTAL LANGUAGE, THE RUSSIAN DOLL, THE SMALL SAMPLE, THE SECRET LIFE OF THE UNITED STATES, SPAGNOLA, STRANGE PLANET, FRESH AIR, THE WHITE WAVE, PASSING TIME TO PATSY CLINE, etc., as a 19-year-old college student (Newton, in his role perhaps even better, tied with CHANGI at least) with a mother bored and over-religious gets the shock of her life when she decides to enroll in the same course as him - and before thinking about GOOFY'S OTHER MOVIE, that's not the case, there's a real stuff here . Of course, it's a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular (but they are rather simplistic with all that philosophical mumbo jumbo, do not they?), And maybe the study Sinead Cusack's character is sometimes a little confusing, but the film is brilliant, fun and contains important messages. The main cast is great: Cusack and Newton are wonderful and Rose Byrne (see also in THE GODDESS OF 1967) is so underrated that it's not funny. She is a beautiful and confident actress who deserves all the congratulations she receives. I gave my mother Frank 8/10.
