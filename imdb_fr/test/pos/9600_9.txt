I can not believe that the Bostock's Cup is not yet available on video or on DVD. I saw it only once, on a shady copy removed from the TV and although not a footy fan (), I thought it was one of the funniest things I have never seen. <br /> <br /> The famous sloping terrain wherever it is, the distraught coach driver ("Ponty-this, Ponty-that," "I'll take the next exit"), the useless plot; <br /> <br /> Being stuck in the United States, I'm desperate for good British humor, but not enough to spend the amount the production company demands. Come on, take it out on DVD pronto kosher.
