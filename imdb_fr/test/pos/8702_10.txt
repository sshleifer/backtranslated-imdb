the subspecies series is still the best vampire movie of all time. there is something about them that makes them special, I think that's the feeling you feel when you look at them. <br /> <br /> they are in modern times and yet they feel as if they were in the 1700s or 1800s if it has something to do with sets that are used if yes, so it works, keep it up, guys :). <br /> <br /> in a quick overview what happened in the first part - Radu would have been banished from his native country years ago by his father and he decided to come back and take what he thinks is his birthright. the stone of blood and all that his father killed so he kills his father who is played by Angus Scrimm (the great man of Phantasm movies). and take the stone of blood that has tremendous power to those who possess it because the one who needs it never needs to kill anyone anymore because the stone is supposed to drain the bloody of the saints and every time the Radu takes a drop, he goes away slowly insane. (That's all we need from a mad vampire as if a normal vampire was not enough). Well, Radu's brother, Stephan, is trying to stop his bad habits while trying to keep from falling with a tourist who lives in a house / fort that belongs to one of his friends. <br /> <br /> Well, one thing leads to another and the two brothers compete and you have to see the movie to see what happens from now on. <br /> <br /> I will soon review / comment on the other suites. <br /> <br /> The difference between Buffy and Buffy is too commercial, which will not please everyone, but its atmosphere is much better than that of Buffy, although Radu is not so beautiful. the full wonder, Sarah Michelle Gellar :). <br /> <br /> note for this movie 10/10 a nice example of how a vampire movie should be done :). <br /> <br />
