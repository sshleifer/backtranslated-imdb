I just bought "The Big Trail" {1930}. It's an incredible movie. I knew him by reputation, but I did not expect it to be so beautiful. My version is the one shot in 35mm and I'll talk about it later. When you think of the Western Myth in the movie, the names that come to my mind are John Ford and John Wayne. Well, you only have half of the team here, but the whole myth is there. Raoul Walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the real plot is the struggle of the nation's westward expansion. <br /> <br /> There is a plot centered on a love affair between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill} with the main villain, Red Flack being played in a memorable way by Tyrone Power, Sr. But this has almost accessory quality as the train of wagons fights against incredible obstacles - both natural and human. Examples are the crossing of the river, the Indian battle and the crossing of the burning desert. The end of the battle takes a dark hue when a doll is placed on the grave of a child killed, while a faithful dog lies on the grave of his master. <br /> <br /> Beautiful panoramas abound with energy and activity. The opening scene, as the train of cars prepares to leave, the interlude of Square Dance and the great flocks of Buffalo are a few that come to mind. We use the location of the film wonderfully. Another feature of this magnificent film is the fact that men and women have the same merit for the role they played in the great battle of Westward. Women work, fight and face these terrible trials with the same courage and strength as their male counterparts. The finale has an extremely uplifting experience as Coleman and Cameron meet in the gigantic Sequoia forest to begin their new life. <br /> <br /> The acting game is quite acceptable. I have already talked about the extraordinary performance of Tyrone Power. Tully Marshall is Coleman's excellent companion and Marguerite Churchill convincingly describes a woman who develops inner strength by facing her own problems as well as those outside herself. The comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are not common and are engulfed in the huge sweep of the film. <br /> <br /> I've read many reviews of Wayne's performance - some even blaming his "wooden actor" for the box-office failure. I think it's unfair. Wayne was in his first major role and had certainly not developed the charisma of his performance in "Stagecoach". But he continues to do a useful job in a role that will certainly play the supporting role for the big dominant theme. After "The Big Trail", Wayne played in a lot of low budget westerns. I have several and we can see the actor in development. When "Stagecoach" arrived, he was ready and "The Big Trail" was an important part of this learning. <br /> <br /> I mentioned earlier that my version was the one-shot version in 35mm. It's always impressive, but to get an idea of ​​the effect of the 70mm version, I set the TV screen to 16: 9, which causes no distortion. Without having the full effect of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to make me want to get it. In addition, the film shot in 70 mm contains some additional scenes that are not in the form of an ordinary theatrical projection. <br /> <br /> In all, this film deserves to be in the list of the greatest Westerns ever made.
