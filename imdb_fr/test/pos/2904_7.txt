There are many DVD movies, but the producers have forgotten some important titles for many viewers. The Egyptian, with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the big screen, epics with big budget had merit. Many people of my generation learn a lot about the history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas (the first time I heard about it was a very inexpensive adventure film with Charlton Heston entitled The Treasury of the Incas). Egypt or Rome saw many "bad" epics of the time. many production values, excellent use of color (the De Luxe color was clearer and sharper than the ordinary Technicolor), the casting was perhaps wrong, but in any case, the film had managed to give us an idea of life in ancient Egypt and In a way, the engine to buy the novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best, if not the best historical novel ever published. Also ousted was the superb score of Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann. I saw this film many times when I was a kid, it was not the big box office hit that Fox Studios wanted to do after the huge success of The Robe, in CinemaScope and Stereo, it was a wonderful a show that was obvious. I have the Lasser disk version.m the only way to see Ito its wdisescreen format. Soon, I hope will have appeared.
