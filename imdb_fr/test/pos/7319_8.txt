Although I'm not a big fan, I'm a purist of the Three Stooges. I think their best work, by far, was with Curly as a third Stooge and that their first films are usually the best. Indeed, after a while, they began to remake their movies and the gags began to fade. Here, in 1934, they were still fresh (in more ways than one) and fun. <br /> <br /> Boys play very unlikely roles here: respected doctors in a hospital! The three runners play bitterly, beat each other and make the pants of those who hope to get better. The energy and freshness non-stop make this one a must for fans. <br /> <br /> By the way, even though I liked this movie, I strongly recommend you try to find a short film much less known than that of education photos. NIFTY NURSES looks a lot like MEN IN BLACK but manages to be funnier and talks about the best hospital comedy of the time - better than Laurel & Hardy County Hospital.
