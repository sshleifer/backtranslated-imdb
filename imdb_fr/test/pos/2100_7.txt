Beautiful combination of giant monster and samurai genres. The giant monster Majin, god of the mountain, is a haughty, forbidden character, who looks a lot like the god of the Old Testament and who rains destruction and punishment to those who desecrate his sacred land - but it is interesting to note that this who wakes him up is not the suffering of the people but a personal and pointed insult. He is superbly photographed, with solid actors, superb miniatures and a superb score of the great Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a monster more than 400 feet like Godzilla - he is two and a half times taller than the evil samurai he tramples in the ground looks good in his contemptuous eyes as he lowers their fortress and the broken down. Not much in terms of extras, but it's nice to see this forgotten minor classic saved and restored to digital format.
