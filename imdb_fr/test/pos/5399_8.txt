Imaginary Heroes, the remarkable work of Dan Harris, then 24, carries the slogan "People are never what they seem to be." Perhaps this is judiciously chosen as a marketing ploy; However, I rented this film despite the slogan rather than this one. And I'm glad I did it. I found the move an insightful review of the tragedy. Personally, I found it to be a film about the realization of dreams, especially those that are lost. In the case of a son, the "loss" requires a thorough examination of what he has had and has not had in his life. Yet the central tragedy of the film, while posing enticing questions, serves primarily as a backdrop to highlighting different styles of adaptation. I think the film asks an important question: how can we face our dreams, especially when the heroes become imaginary?
