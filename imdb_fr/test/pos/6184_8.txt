This film re-appeared on Channel 13 in the 1990s, when it shot a series of Hollywood comedies in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, on the air of "The Jolly Fat Policeman", they had a montage of movie scenes to present the series of people laughing, including one of Gary Cooper chuckling while watching a movie in a movie house - a sequence of this movie film. <br /> <br /> It all starts innocently when Cooper, a millionaire, goes to a chic department store in France to buy pajamas. But he only likes to sleep in the highs. The clerk (Tyler Brooke) insists that he can not sell half pajamas as Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers to help her - she only likes to sleep in pajama bottoms. And if Brooke sells them each half? Brooke has never had such an offer before, so he goes to Walker (Rolfe Sedan) and asks if this can be done. It is also disturbed - the demand is rather unconventional. Finally, they contact the owner of the store (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed and comes out of it - his lean body supporting only a pajama top (though long enough for censorship). Can they sell to both customers a set of pajamas (half for each)? Correctly horrified, Halton replies, "No, of course not, it's communism !!" So, the sale is not allowed. Apparently, nobody thinks Cooper can buy the whole pair and sell half of it to Colbert. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch's BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WOMAN has a reputation for falling flat, most viewers do not like him because of a misreading of Colbert's character. She is considered a mercenary enough to Cooper - selling him on his terms. <br /> <br /> In reality, Cooper's character is more mean, because he is rich and thinks that everything has a price. He is right most of the time. Look at how Edward Everett Horton, Colbert's aristocratic father, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbert involves somehow an agreement stating that if he is hesitant or chooses not to marry him, he must pay damages. When he realizes this, Horton pulls out a watch and (in a very reassuring way) says to Cooper: "Take your time, boy!", To make a decision. We'll see later that Horton's wardrobe has become more modern and elegant. <br /> <br /> The film, screenplay by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, compares well with that of Mitchell Leisin, MIDNIGHT (also with Colbert, but also with Don Ameche and John Barrymore). There, Colbert is willing to sell for a pecuniary marriage with (to Francis Lederer), but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage to Ameche. She really loves Ameche (a taxi driver) but she explains to her in a moment of unexpected realism that her parents were married "out of love" but that poverty has made them hate each other. This is not in BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WOMAN, where Colbert has no such background (she is after all the daughter of a marquis). His plot is to give Cooper a lesson on his principles. <br /> <br /> The film presents interesting work from support staff, including Herman Bing as a private detective who turns out to hide things Colbert is learning and a young David Niven, who has a series of moments of choice as a typing medium and as a listening ear to Cooper. Coop tells Niven his problems with Colbert and makes her so annoying. Niven listens with respect. In the end, Cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he has to say. "Albert, how much do I pay you?" Cooper asks him. Niven reflects and says: "Thirty-five francs a week, sir." Cooper looks deep into his soul and says (shaking his head): "That's right!"
