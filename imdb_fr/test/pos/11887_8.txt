This is one of the great modern movies of kung-fu. Many critics seem to miss out on the fact that the comedy is based on a rather subtle contrast sometimes (sometimes even just in front of you) between ancient China and new China. Kara Hui, for example, is called a rustic country and has trouble every time she tries to adapt to the new but ultimately to save her family from the dresses as an old-fashioned heroine contrasting with the military style Hsiao Ho's modern style. Gordon Liu seems to have played his part to laugh while playing his serious monk character with stupid wigs and a guitar. The final fight is just fantastic and ends with a defeat for Johnny Wang rather than death. Kwan Yung Moon must be mentioned for his great game of a thug with "invincible armor" - just great. And Kara Hui makes beautiful actors and fights. A great movie.
