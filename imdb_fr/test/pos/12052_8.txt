I had never seen a Bollywood movie before, but I caught the first ten minutes of this night, made a fool of myself and pressed the Sky + R button. I'm glad I did it !! I hope not to insult anyone (because, basically, the BF and I loved it!), But we could not take it as seriously as the actors - especially the one who was obsessed (who, from what I understand, is a huge Bollywood star, because we've seen it on DVD cover since then and I've even seen a doll in Hamleys today !! The BF keeps talking of this guy - I'm starting to think he's obsessed! He keeps saying that it's strange for the best of times to be the anti-hero of a movie! But then we love them movies that are not your predictable Hollywood stock.) <br /> <br /> It was completely exaggerated, but really fun. . If all Bollywood movies are like that, then we watch more. I've had this bloomin 'song in my head all week and I can not speak a word of hindi! PS all recommendations would be appreciated!
