If you liked movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Smoking, you'll love LOVE Two Hands. He has the same kind of black humor as him and will entertain you throughout the movie. Like Pulp Fiction, he presents the wacky scenarios in which characters get started and how they treat them. With Gallipoli and Picnic at Hanging Rock, this must be one of the best Australian films I've ever seen. It also features a young Heath Ledger before it really gets big in the United States. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly underrated movie that, in my opinion, is as good as Pulp Fiction and these big ones. You must see that!
