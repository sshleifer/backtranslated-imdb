It was without a doubt one of the best horror / suspense / fantasy shows of the eighties. While the series had a barely able distribution at each episode, and it lost the value of production (that is, the sets), but know that I must give him the merit of being brave with the intrigues . I mean, the plot of each episode was pretty pissed off so that myself, a hardened horror movie, a shock movie, and a 70's bitch became a little nauseated. Great show, just great, regardless of what other reviews have said here. My favorite episode was called "Bug House", yeah that was the title I think? Anyway, it always gives me the courage every time I think about it, almost 20 years after its creation. Other shows such as "The Tales From The Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" were undoubtedly better from the production point of view, but in my opinion they did not nothing to do with the plot in relation to this sick little show! This certainly paved the way for the even more cult classic graphic design that was "Tales From The Crypt".
