After learning that her sister Susan was planning to divorce, Kate decides to go to the distant country of the clueless woman and spend time with her. However, when Kate arrives, Susan is nowhere in sight. It's because someone murdered her and stuffed the body in a basement safe. As the storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister might have gone and is putting her life at risk: the killer is still on the scene! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a strong dramatic performance. Merwin Gerard's game show is based on a short story by McKnight Malmar. Malmar's story premiered on television in 1962 as an episode of Boris Karloff's THRILLER anthology series. THRILLER stuck very closely to the story, which is a bit of a shame, because she could have been a little late. Admittedly, Malmar wrote a pretty scary number, but Gerard (creator of the show ONE STEP BEYOND) adds several clever ingredients that reinforce tension and suspense.
