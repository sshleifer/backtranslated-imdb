- A group of bandits devalues ​​a train of the cargo of gold that it carries. In their flight, the bandits separated. The only thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he can speak. Three men have a different part of the "index" that will lead to gold. Can the banker, the bandit and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing booty? Or are they going to kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious takeoff from Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Various scenes of the film are also mentioned in other films of Leone, Corbucci, etc. But for me, this is done in a way that does not disrespect the original work. Any Gun Can Play lovingly parodies some of the greatest movies in the history of Western Spaghetti. The opening scene featuring three men heading to town and the final showdown between the top three stars is a wonderful tribute to the previous SWs. <br /> <br /> - Castellari adds its own pleasant touches - the reflection in the spilled wine, the entry of the stranger with the bright red background and the fun way to discover the gold at the end. Although very incredible, many fight scenes are well staged and directed. Two fight scenes in particular (the battle of the market and the battle of the bain-marie) are very well done. He is not afraid to try different things with his camera. All close shots, shots in the air and shots in the corners are common in Any Gun Can Play. <br /> <br /> - Another advantage is the cast with which Castellari had to work. George Hilton is always good in these movies. Gilbert Roland literally plays Gilbert Roland. And newcomer SW Edd Byrnes holds firm with the two veterans of SW. The support cast includes, among others, Gerard Herter, a regular SW player. <br /> <br /> - Any firearm can play should not be taken too seriously. Little touches of humor can be found throughout the film. If it's possible with software, it's more like a "Feel Good" movie - very evocative of some Terence Hill / Bud Spencer movies.
