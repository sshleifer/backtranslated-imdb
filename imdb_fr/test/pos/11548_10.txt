Oh my God ! I can truly say that Maya Angelou is one of the most intriguing and important people in the world, especially my culture. She is incredibly inspiring and her story is that of a great woman! When I first took this film, I thought the cast was wonderfully staged and we can now see it in action! Maya Angelou is already my favorite poet and one of my favorite actresses. I believe she is the greatest of all time. This film had put me on the edge of my seat and was aimed at Kleenex while reminding me that no matter where you come from, if you decide you're going to be great then you'll be great! And Ester Rolle played a wonderful supporting role ...... 100% AWESOME ... and now even "I know why the caged bird sings."
