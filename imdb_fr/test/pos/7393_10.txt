Well, that was not what I expected. I rented this movie just to see what it would give since I still want to see the first one. But, this movie had a movie B everywhere. But when I looked at it, I realized it was very funny. For the first 30 minutes, it was how much the snowman kiiling a man and that a man was losing his sanity. But those first minutes had amusing doublings. When he threw the first of his little henchmen, I knew it would be very very funny. They all act like the gremlins of the eighty-four nintades who made it seem like it was a parody and I forgot it was a serial movie. So, if you like to laugh, rent this one.
