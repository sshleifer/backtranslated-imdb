This is without a doubt the most heartbreaking black and white war movie I've seen; In fact, Samuel Fuller was the only Western director to have attained at a distance his level of intensity and visceral power in his work. By the way, I had attended a Kon Ichikawa retrospective at the National Film Theater in London in September 2002, but I only managed to capture part of his work from 1960 to 1973. <br /> > The film is certainly as depressing as it is reputed to be; however, it also displays touches of welcome black humor - the "dead" man who wakes up to respond to an interrogating soldier and dies immediately, the delightfully ironic shoe exchange sequence, a moribund eccentric telling the hungry hero what part of the body he should eat, etc. The screenplay was written by a woman - Natto Wada, the director's wife! <br /> <br /> Ichikawa is a versatile and prolific filmmaker whose reputation is perhaps not so great it was at the height of his years (1956-1965), but his direction is often striking - the surprising sequence of pre-credits (the hero is violently reprimanded by his superior for leaving the hospital sooner than expected!), the death of a Japanese who surrenders to the hands of a Filipino woman carrying arms, the bombing of a hospital (medical personnel escaping to escape, leaving the wounded soldiers behind them to get out of the hut at their own pace), the automated machine march in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers (which also concerns business above mentioned wearing shoes that actually reminds of a similar scene in ALL ALL SILENT ON THE WEST FRONT [1930]), a hill littered with corpses of soldiers trying to climb it, the finale, etc. One of the major assets of the film is undoubtedly the astonishing cinematography of the muddy and unforgiving landscape. <br /> <br /> The film is known for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism (almost 10 years before becoming a commodity of horror movies), but Ichikawa's approach is not only subtle, but very effective: the flesh is actually called "monkey meat", while the hero is seen only once (and quickly spits the room with most of his teeth rotting!) Conversely, when the weak underprivileged soldier (played by Mickey Curtis, who, despite his name, was an idol of Japanese pop!) surrenders furiously, the nearby ground is splashed with blood. <br /> <br /> In the supplements, Ichikawa recalls that the main actor of Method, Eiji Funakoshi (whose portrait is unforgettable) arrived on the set at the time of the famine - with the result that the production has had to be interrupted for two weeks until he recovered! Donald Richie's insightful interview focuses on the film's nihilism on the patriotism behind a Hollywood movie as heartbreaking as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998). <br /> <br /> THE FIRE ON THE PLAIN is universally considered one of its THE BURMESE HARP (1956) is a war movie inspired by the characters, but with a spiritual tone, and that is also available on DVD at the following address: Criterion) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958, which actually benefited from a theatrical performance limited locally, as part of a foreign film week, two years ago). Personally, I also have a weakness for the surprisingly stylized color extravagance of the director, AN ACTOR'S REVENGE (1963), which I caught twice at the NFT in 1999 and the aforementioned retrospective of 2002.
