I missed it at the movies and rented it on DVD. If you're lucky, I'd recommend it, because it's better than almost anything I've seen in movies or DVDs this year. That's not to say it's one of the best movies of all time, it's just that I saw a lot of trash :) <br /> <br /> I can not really add anything to what has already been said except 8/10
