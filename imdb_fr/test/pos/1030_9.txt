Oppenheimer was an excellent series (it was the first thing I saw in Waterston) and it's a shame that copies are not available. A similar situation exists for "Glory Enough for All", a British series dating at about the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for these two DVDs. Is it really so difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that can be read in the United States? "Danger UXB" is another very nice series, at about the same time. A series on the defusing of unexploded bombs, hence its name. The one you can get from your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
