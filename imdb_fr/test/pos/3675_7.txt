It's one of the strangest movies I've watched in a long time. Usually, if they are so strange, I leave early and rarely regret it. Fortunately, I have stood firm for this one. Although I can not say it's a good movie (that's not the case), I can say that looking at it looks like a good acid trip - only a few really horrible moments and the rest filled with this "wonder." Lots of laughter highlights. A superb cast of characters with Meredith Eaton noted as a dwarf stepdaughter with an attitude.
