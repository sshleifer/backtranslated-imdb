This documentary is special from the cinematographic point of view, it is his passivity; which engages the public to delight in the delights of Gypsy music. It innovates in the form of documentary while presenting a tapestry of sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primordial similarity that emerges from the traveling music of (historically) itinerant peoples. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the film itself is unique "take" fast movements that roam the globe and pass effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to another. <br /> <br /> Watching this film, our breath is cut by the simple beauty of our common bond with music, rhythm, dance. If there is a more profoundly spiritual homage to the sound and movement of Gypsy cultures, it has not yet been filmed.
