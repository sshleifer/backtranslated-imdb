Three children are born exactly at the same time, during a lunar eclipse.Just before their 10th birthday, they embark on a slaughter. Evil children never generate any threat and there is almost no suspense. There is no gore or dread in "Bloody Birthday", but the film is slightly amusing. for example, we have death with a handgun, a baseball bat, a skipping rope and a shovel. So if you're a fan of slasher movies in the early '80s, take a look at it.
