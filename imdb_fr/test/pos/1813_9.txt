One of the best teen comedies ever shot in the '80s, Valley Girl has a young Nicolas Cage in a leading role. Deborah Foreman is amusing as an object of Cage's desire (and what has happened to her?). Look for veteran actors Colleen Camp and Frederic Forrest, Julie's hippie parents - they're a lot of fun!
