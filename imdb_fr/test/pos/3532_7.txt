I had postponed the purchase of it since its release on DVD? On the one hand, because the two other titles of horror of this director (SQUIRM [1976] and BLUE SUNSHINE [1977]) had impressed me a little, but also that the film itself had been slightly cut for the first time. Media Blasters / Shriek Show 2 Disc Set! I ended up renting by chance and I'm happy to have done it ?? because, not only is it superior to previous efforts (at least on this preliminary assessment), but I also found that the film was one of the best imitations of THE Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974). This factor, however, only reminds me that I have not found yet another example ?? THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977), Wes Craven's classic, I bought the 2-disc R1 edition of Anchor Bay some time ago, but, after all, Halloween is fast approaching ... <br /> <br /> The film manages a background atmosphere without disturbing effort (it was shot in the forest and mountainous regions of Oregon) ?? with a lot of effective thrills, but thankfully, not too much violence (even if the last of the bad guys is sent in quite scandalous ways!). The main young cast here (one of them interpreted by Jack Lemmon's son, Chris) is not as odious as the ones we usually encounter in this kind of genre offer ?? In spite of engaging freely with the shenanigans, one associates films directed towards teenagers and which, as a whole, persist to this day! George Kennedy appears as a friendly Ranger; although he does not have much to do, his characterization is definitely improved by making him a lover of plant and animal life. Among the locals, there is also the famous actor Mike Kellin, in the role of the drunkard who was the first to come into contact with the murderous duo of the narration. his warning to teens, of course, remains unnoticed, but he can then drive Kennedy there. <br /> <br /> The hermetic family that teens meet in the woods eventually turns out to hide a skeleton their closet. While one of the girls shows a real curiosity about the presence of intruders, the others are openly hostile to them? and in the case of strong, crude twins, quite frightening (one of them is even prone to manic laughter during his outbursts); At some point in the narrative, the Rangers even offer an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior.
