Even for science fiction, this film is a little different. Very good, more than a little ... My first thought after watching is that I had just lost my mind. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie while waiting for another Darko. Darko fans will never love another Richard Kelly movie because of their cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, overcome it. <br /> <br /> Richard Kelly likes to make movies that make you uncomfortable not understanding Deep's deep meaning the first time you watch them. To be honest, I had to watch The Box twice before enjoying it. <br /> <br /> Deep meaning - (to save you a lot of sociological psychological babble) Humans are interested, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and do not open mail without a return address. <br /> <br /> Summary: A scary old man tells Cammeron Diaz that if you press the button, I will kill someone you do not know and give you a million dollars. Of course, she pushes him and, as promised by the terrifying old man, gets a crate of money. Then the film plunges into the unusual. To save my fingers typing ... For pushing the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural extraterrestrial beings, in a complex experiment to measure the morality of the human race. <br /> I liked: movie will ignore the generic guidelines of the movie. It's different. It's intense. He has a deeper meaning (although his philosophy is a material). That lets you guess. It's not a Hollywood ending! <br /> <br /> I did not like: why a being with technology to prevent another form of life from designing such a ridiculous scheme? What god as stranger has patience for that? Diaz was good, but was there a need for country accent? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I give her a 7 because Kelly did not put as much attention on the details as in her other films. Overall good movie.
