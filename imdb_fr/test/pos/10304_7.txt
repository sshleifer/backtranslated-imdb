It's not an easy film to like at first with the two main characters that do not look like him at all, but fortunately, the heart and soul of the film is the touching performance of Paula Sage who takes the film to unknown waters and transcends the rather clumsy plot. This gives the movie a sense of truth and makes you think that you have seen something special. (7/10)
