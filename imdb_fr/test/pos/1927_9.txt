Note: This should probably be read only after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It's very rare to find a documentary or film that focuses on the loser. Deep Water does just that, making it one of the most stimulating films in a long time. It does not give us a hero to watch, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to question ourselves. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a group of men trying to go around the world alone and without stopping. Only one does, many die, we decide not to go home, each making a psychological journey quite intriguing to deserve whole movies. However, the most interesting is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way he is described by the filmmakers and our reactions to him. <br /> <br /> From every point of view, this man should be considered a vile figure, so why does he describe heroically so? Why are we so nice to him? From the beginning, he made all the wrong choices. He financially risked his family to get the boat, he left at a more dangerous time to get more publicity, he ignored all the warnings despite his lack of experience, he chose to lie instead of admitting the defeat these choices snowballed to the inevitable and the last: suicide. All for what? A place in history? A sense of accomplishment? Perhaps. What is important to consider is whether the situation of this man was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Every individual must ask himself whether his natural search for fame and human success would lead him to such recklessness, and I believe that by examining his own reaction Crowhurst's story will offer at least one answer to this question.
