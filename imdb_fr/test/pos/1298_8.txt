I really liked this movie. One thing I noticed is that Korean TV shows are much better, as far as the whole story goes. I watch movies when I do not have the time or want to live between 16 and 30 episodes. The movies seem to be in a hurry and if you do not look closely you may miss something. <br /> <br /> I feel that this one has been rushed and that I had to go back in some passages to try to find what I missed, especially towards the end. If you like beautiful love stories, I think it's cute, and if you have the extra time, I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It is always a pleasure to go back, to follow the actors the films as we do not follow them from their beginning, like the actors producers, directors and directors of our own countries.
