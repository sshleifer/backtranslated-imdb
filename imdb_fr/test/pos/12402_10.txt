I just watched the DVD version of BORN BAD and I found that it was tense, grainy and, in the end, too graphic for the most sensitive. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman are performing better. For a low budget movie, this image is effective. Depth of character and intelligent dialogue are two things you do not usually see in Roger Corman's picture. Discover it on DVD!
