God ... How did it end up in our DVD player, I'll never know ... my wife thought it was a new version that had escaped her ... Nevermind is two years old and in Danish (I think ) ... She kept looking for the English soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> All in all ... the movie was not bad ... Good production values, better performance and a smart story Do not go too far from the sea and do it for a neat and moody meal on the other side of the sea! The end will make you laugh ... in fact, the whole movie will do it. Incredibly strange characters, which really interest us, make a film that is worth it ... Without spoiling the plot, the title of the film and the cover of the DVD give you a good idea of ​​the direction this thing takes!
