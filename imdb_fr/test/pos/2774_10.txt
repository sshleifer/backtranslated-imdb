Do you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really touched you? Growing up with Disney, I've always been captivated by the characters. Everyone seemed really talented and knew how to behave through a movie. I remember Friday nights and ran to turn on the television just to watch their latest movies. Susie Q was one of my favorites of all time. I have never forgotten this movie. Even so far as the song "Susie Q" is mentioned, I still remember the movie. If anyone thinks of watching this movie, I promise you, you will fall in love with it. I do not think I'll ever forget it. You will not regret watching it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's sad to see Disney movies such as "The Hannah Montana Movie" coming out. What has happened to Disney?
