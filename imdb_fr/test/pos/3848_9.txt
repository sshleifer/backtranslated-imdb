The Aristocats is really charming, and is judged far too low on IMDb. The songs are not as memorable as those in The Jungle Book, but they were not bad at all. The animation is really charming, the best sequence being the Parisian landscape in general. It was wonderful. It's probably Disney's most relaxing animation, and as another author has rightly said, who does not like cats? Another great animation was O 'Malley who was looking into the Duchess's eyes, because their love story was so credible though not obvious (a good thing). but worked very well and the scenario was really funny, especially the fights between the kittens. They remind me and my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. My favorite scene was Edgar's pursuit with the two dogs, who were still arguing over who the leader was. The voices were a delight, including Phil Harris, whom I recognized from the Book of the Jungle, and Eva Gabor of the Rescuers. The secondary characters, Scat Cat, were also well done. In conclusion, a really nice movie, which is definitely underestimated. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
