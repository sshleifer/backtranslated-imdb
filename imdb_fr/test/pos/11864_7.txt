Okay. Here is the thing. I read the comments of other viewers - some ransacked the film and some said it was the funniest, darkest and darkest comedy ever made. Tarantino puffs, etc. Well, not exactly. But guess what? It's always a nice and ultimately fun movie. Not brilliant, no trash. Liv Tyler gives a great performance and you can not leave her eyes. She is a woman with very strong decorating ideas ... Matt Dillon, a greatly underrated and underused actor, is wonderful, as always. He always succeeds in crossing this delicate border between the game and the soul, and succeeds wonderfully well in comedy. Same John Goodman (although the religious connotations, probably funny in the script, really do not work). Paul Reiser is very good - definitely better than he was on TV. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, unbearable in general, is very suitable for this position. As for his cap, see the movie. Between this and "Wonder Boys", you remember that Douglas can act. The film will make you laugh in parts. Ok, not really laughing, but in the category I am amused, I am very amused. If you rent this, expect to see another "Pulp Fiction", forget it. But if you want something fun and fun, it's a good choice.
