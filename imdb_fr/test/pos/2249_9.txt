As an Israeli Jew of a naturally sarcastic nature and a fan of different and independent cinema, I am always pleased to see a film that presents a sensitive and respectful holocaust, while being original and unusual. While I have not read the book ?? or, by the way, heard of his existence before watching the movie? and therefore, like other commentators, can not comment on their ranking in comparison. Everything is illuminated gave me a great pleasure, and I can certainly comment. <br /> <br /> To label everything is illuminated a film about the Holocaust would do a great injustice, even if it is undeniably the Holocaust. So, call it a comedy or a travel film, even though it's a trip and it's as funny as it is moving. Everything is illuminated, it's Jonathan Safran Foer ?? played to minimalist perfection by Elijah Wood, in the most impressive drama performance in which I've ever seen it, with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals everything ?? A young American Jew and obsessive collector of family goods and historical objects, who travels to Ukraine in search of the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. This also applies to Alex, his tour guide throughout Ukraine, and Alex's grandfather. What's fascinating about these characters is that at the beginning of the movie, they look like comic relief to balance the melancholy nature of Wood's character; but Alex and his grandfather undergo fascinating changes throughout the film and turn out to be at least as important as Jonathan. In fact, Boris Leskin, as a grumpy and self-proclaimed blind grandfather, turns out to be the most beautiful dramatic representation of the film. <br /> <br /> Aside from the surreal character of the film and characters, the magnificent blend of original acoustic music and Russian folk music, sensitive cinematography and striking contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history, which Made Everything Illuminated a powerful and moving experience was the fact that we receive from Alex and his grandfather a very different and original point of view on this painful subject; several excellent films, such as The Gray Zone and Downfall, have already given us the perspective of lower-ranking Nazis who are portrayed as human beings who are not necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions but who are caught up. in the reality of war. Everything Is Illuminated presents a point of view rarely discussed before: Alex's point of view is that of a young man born many years after the war, who sees it as a mere historical fact, who has to face the horrors his own people ?? and maybe his own family ?? were able to. Alex's attitude change ?? and his grandfather ?? to Jonathan, to the Holocaust and to the Jewish people in general, makes this film a fascinating and original study of character development. <br /> <br /> Everything Is Illuminated is a great directorial debut for actor Liev Schreiber. the most original and unique films of 2005. This is a highly recommended experience, especially for those interested in the Holocaust and the Second World War.
