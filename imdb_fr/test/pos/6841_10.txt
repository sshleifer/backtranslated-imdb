Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows are a delight in this sexy hug. This film is intelligent, is one of the entertainment for adults, and is a relief in these days of predictable cartoons with great concept. Good music and camera work add to the fun of this New Orleans puzzler. Highly recommended. Ten stars!
