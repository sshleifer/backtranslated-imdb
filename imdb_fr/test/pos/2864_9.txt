Ok, I scored this fin, so do not get angry when I finish it. Now, I went in the movie hoping to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, almost every horror movie I saw was predictable, but not as serious as most others. What helped me was the story, I did not expect there to be a "WHY" to Kane's madness. But there was and although a little misty you still had the idea and understand the madness. Now, of course, if you like something that will scare you for the nights to come, this is not the movie you are looking for. But if you're a fan of Saw, or other movies that boast of their fame through sadistic content, this is a movie to watch. Now where I really throw in a spoiler for a second warning. I'm giving a 9 to this movie maybe because I'm a fan of WWE and Kane, but who does not like a movie a little better when it features someone we love. However, this film could have scored a 10 for me. . . (spoiler) ----> at the end of the movie when he showed Kane dead on the sidewalk. Even if a dog peeing in the eyes was "CUTE", it could have been classic: the Kane / Undertaker sits quickly and turns. A perfect 10 would have been awarded if that had happened. It was a perfect opportunity, but either the WWE had not thought about it, or a future sequel would start with the same sequence I mentioned. That's all. (9)
