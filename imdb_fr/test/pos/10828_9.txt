"Bon voyage" has a fast pace that reminds me in some ways Indiana Jones / Star Wars movies - it's like you're on a fast train or roller coaster ride. <br /> <br /> It's presented as a romance, mystery, thriller and farce; it is all this and more, including frank comments on the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion at the beginning of the Second World War. And it's also a juggling exhibition that brings together 7 main characters. The scenes all seemed historically accurate (in my eyes) and gave a great feeling for the period. <br /> <br /> All the actors were well interpreted and gave very good performances, but the most superb of IMO is that of Isabelle Adjani who played the role of an opportunist French movie star and egocentric; not only has she played the role of a young actress, perhaps half of her age, convincingly, but she has also played her deceitful tricks in a convincing way, so that the public hardly sees her so serious and more complex than a person as a researcher of gold. Its character and energy propel the film from end to end. It was only when I read Roger Ebert's review that I discovered that she was 48 at the time of the film. What a beauty !! <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the end - it's satisfying, but lets you write your own conclusion about what happens to the main characters. <br /> <br /> As another user commentator has observed, do not arrive late; you must be present right from the opening stage. Good advice. <br /> <br /> I gave it 9 out of 10.
