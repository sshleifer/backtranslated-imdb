It is not surprising that the majority of the highest rated votes were submitted by women aged 45 and over. This is the period in women's lives when they become caretakers of elderly and sick parents. In June, I lost my mother to cancer and lived most of the emotions described by Zellweger in this movie. Yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real and the development of the plot extremely accurate. Congratulations to all the actors and the team for this wonderful representation of life and death and the promises of tomorrow.
