This film has the courage to suggest that it may be better to simply accept your life as it is and keep smiling anyway. As a person more excited about taking charge of his life and moving forward, I felt slapped in the face, but it does not matter: I do not have to agree with a movie to love and respect him. Super actor Streep and Hurt, and everyone really, and some wonderfully weird scenes. A serious movie. And take a tissue.
