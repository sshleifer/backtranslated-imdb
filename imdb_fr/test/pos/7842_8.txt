Here you see Mr. Eastwood in all his glory (that is, at the top of his form as an actor and at the height of his physical attractiveness), but the "ladies" represented are hardly typical of South, at the present time and now. The girls at the boarding school are incredibly naive, some showing signs of truly depraved women, and Geraldine Page, full of corruption, barely represents the way to deal with the girls' school mistresses, at the present time or at any time. 'to come up. . (That's not to say there's no bad occasional apple in a barrel.) Mr. Eastwood said it was one of his two favorite movies. <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" has an original plot, many attractive characters and many surprises for the viewer. It's very captivating and entertaining but not really realistic. (I know, having grown up in the South and attended a school and a girls' college, and I know countless girls who did the same, not to mention their laid-back teachers, even "repressed teachers" who was far from the director described here.) She is downright comical in her portrayal of a southern sweet woman who is not quite what she seems. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit outrageous at his first appearance appeared and still is, I think, but you will not regret having spent your time watching it.
