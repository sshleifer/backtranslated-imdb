'In The Line Of Fire' tells the story of a match between a former presidential bodyguard and a former government assassin turned psychopath. The secret service agent / bodyguard (Eastwood) is in defense and the murderer (Malkovich) in offense. Challenges? The President live. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie ... I've seen it many times on TV and I recently bought it on DVD. Still, it's not an excellent movie. The plot is far too thin and attempts to thicken it are downright ridiculous. The whole love story is not very plausible and the way they added an extra character to the story, just to be able to kill her, is a kind of insult to the more or less intelligent viewer. Although I think these mistakes can not be forgiven, I can easily ignore them for an exquisite performance of Mr. Malkovich. I've always considered him a great actor, but in this film he's really on fire. There is a reason he was nominated for the Oscars. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were doing well, but I do not think their performance is memorable. They are never at their best. <br /> <br /> If you do not expect too much, you will definitely like this movie. It's not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is really amazing and I think no one can appreciate his performance. Well worth a look ...
