"We are both stumbling together in this untrained world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable or perhaps nonexistent, always on the verge of being killed by forces that we do not understand." That's what Ted Pikul says in the movie. Which, for some, sums up life and "eXistenZ" is probably a film about existence. What is real and what is unreal and how do you make the difference. Or not. The last line of the film is superbly ambiguous. <br /> <br /> The film looks like a hairy dog ​​story (it actually contains a real hairy dog), but it takes you on an interesting and provocative ride Cronenberg brings a new twist that will make you look at the amphibians , game pods, fish, thorns and bones. Some pieces are pretty disgusting. It takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called "GAS STATION" and the Chinese restaurant is called "RESTAURANT CHINESE". The film has a captivating texture to leagues away from your usual big-budget science-fiction movie.You can read There are many things in the film and it pays to watch more than once. <br /> <br /> The main actors are Jude Law who is doing well and Jennifer Jason Leigh who is great. Some roles are not suitable for this very talented actor, but when she has such a role, she is incomparable. Her unconventional beauty and her fascinating voice become Allegra. (That's fine with a short black skirt too.) There are other known actors but we do not give them much to do. It looks good, it sounds good and a score of Howard Shore completes the film very well. Cronenberg is perhaps the Alfred Hitchcock of the sci-fi / horror genre. Whatever film he makes, it's always worth watching.
