I was recently at a birthday party with five other girls of my age (eleven). We all thought it would be a harmless little film such as Jaws decided to rent with Rat Race. (We watched Rat Race after When Stranger Call to soothe our fear.) We filmed the movie at 11:00 pm and we lay down together in our sleeping bags, hidden behind blankets most of the time. I shouted five times, which is unusual for me when I'm scared in the movies but I'm never afraid enough to scream. <br /> <br /> We were all terrified of leaving the bedroom because we were all convinced that the Stalker (Jenkins as we called him for some reason) would get us. I played a bad trick; Everyone was asleep once the rat race was over, I hid under my sleeping bag and said softly and humbly, "HAVE YOU VERIFIED THE CHILD?" They all riddled like nuts and were so scared. Overall, I would say that this movie has a 9. The only thing I did not like was that 1. There were too many false alarms when Jill thought the Stalker was there and 2. The kids did not Never woken up all the time until Jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the closet. At that moment, they started crying like babies. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves thrillers. But one thing: I AM NOT BABYSITTING AFTER 21 H 00!
