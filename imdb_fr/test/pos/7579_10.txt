I have seen this film a few times and every time I watch, I always feel the excitement of going on a trip and the frustration of trying to overcome the obstacles that hinder the journey. It's more than just a desire to find a home; it is about the fundamental human spirit of making its way in the world, overcoming despair, dealing with the weaknesses of character that undermine our goals. The challenge of reconsidering the origin of life underlies these human efforts. Although this film is full of serious ideas, it contains just enough comic lines to give hope to the audience. It's surprisingly funny. The execution of the story is excellent! All this is packed with a visually appealing animation. A must see. <br /> <br />
