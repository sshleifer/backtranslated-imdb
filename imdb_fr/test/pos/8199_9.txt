I admit my ignorance of the existence of this film until I see it announced on a cable outlet. I was very impressed by the novelistic structure of the film. The film, which is in a language I do not understand, shone with intelligence and nuance for me. I think it speaks to the quality of the film. It was visually beautiful. The game was visually fascinating. The theatrical traditions of Chinese theater, used to enhance dialogue, are so convincing after watching a Western film, where actors traditionally focus more on dialogue. The action in this movie comes straight to you, without a lot of explosions to get your attention. It is human action that is so emotional here. The extra benefit that the film taught me about the history of one of the world's greatest tourist attractions, the terracotta funeral army of the first Qin Emperor in China, was very impressive. This seemed to give the film international relevance beyond the film's major ethical themes. It is a film that I can recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances.
