It's probably one of the best French movies I've seen in a long time! This "pastiche" or parody of spy movies is very well done and will make you laugh from beginning to end. Some references to today's world are very subtle. The whole Moroccan context of the film must be understood in the light of the current French culture / environment. That said, all the jokes and, apparently, the shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context are allowed and accepted because it is a travesty. <br /> <br /> My sisters who had already seen this movie told me that I had to go too and assured me that I was going to have a good time, and that's what I did ! If you liked the old movies 007 with Sean Connery and you also like movies like Airplane or Hot Shots, you'll be delighted. I just hope this movie will be released on DVD in the US ... Wait and see.
