Many movies tempt the ambitious. Few succeed. This film is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although presented as a black comedy, this term seems too restrictive to express the true nature of the story of Max and Grace. Multi-hyphen Michael Parness has managed to weave elements of the most absurd comedy with incredibly real human emotion. A feat quite remarkable, to be sure. <br /> <br /> If the comic aspect is certainly present, the heart of the film lies in its main role: David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the film - a real madman against true love - comes back to them and they succeed, going from the opening scene to the end of the heartbreaking story. David Krumholtz, in the title role and as narrator, anchors the image and does an outstanding job. We see the world through the eyes of Max and Krumholtz breathes into them a kind of wonder and hope that we would not expect it to be credible from a character who has already tried to suicide. At this point, there should be no doubt that he has truly earned the status of leader, well deserved after more than a decade of memorable secondary roles. Natasha Lyonne could be a revelation to anyone who has seen it in less difficult roles. Grace's role is vast, requiring her to show both great rage and tenderness, sometimes within a few seconds. She manages to convince us of Grace's deep despair, which is hidden behind her alternation of torpor and mania. <br /> <br /> This is not a kind of comedy by the minute, so do not see the movie expect a lot of humor at first. to finish. Think more dramatic than comic. There are some very dark moments, as one would expect given the subject of suicidal individuals, and strangely real moments told by Emma Adele Galvin in the role of Max's sister, Sis. The most humorous scenes are those populated by a myriad of actors named in secondary roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer lend their scenes the most surreal appearance, the other supporting characters that populate the institution where Max and Grace meet are the real treat. Guillermo Diaz is an unbridled thief in the role of Hector, the deliciously frenzied oddball. Ralf Moeller, as Bruno, acts as a straight man but has its charm and appeal. Rosanna Arquette fully lives the role of Vera with the brutal vitriol of a waitress stopped at the truck. Even his hard character eventually melts, as do all those who are touched by Max's literally immortal love for Grace. <br /> <br /> Can we conquer all could be the question behind the film and even if the inner realist says no, the films are about to escape reality, even if only for a few hours. I recommend considering this film as an antidote not only to the reality, but also to the cynicism that such a love story never occurs. Spending a few hours in a world where he can and does miracles works miracles on the psyche. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)
