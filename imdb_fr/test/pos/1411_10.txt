The theme song often crosses my head after all these years. I never really watched television, probably because I had just entered my busy adolescence when my family bought our first game in 1948 and that's never been part of my life. But from the first episode of Lawman, I became addicted and this is the only television series on which I schedule my week. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, credible, well written and well played, and John Russell is always for me the most beautiful man I have ever seen. (Peter Brown was not a dog either: o) <br /> <br /> I agree that this is one of the most underrated television series of all time. I hope I can find some episodes to watch for my grandchildren.
