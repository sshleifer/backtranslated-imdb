"STEP BY STEP", in my opinion, is a pure success of ABC! I do not remember every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when an incident occurred at school. I always laugh at that. In fact, I think about each of J.T. (The Brandon Call lines) and Cody (Sasha Mitchell) were funny. It would have been nice if Penny (Patrika Darbo) had stayed in the series all along the way. Everyone has always given a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes well designed and the writing still very strong. In conclusion, I hope this will never stop being syndicated.
