An interesting and involved movie about a "life prisoner" just trying to live his days in peace. Elements of the main character appear in Michael Mann's latest films, such as Thief (1981), Heat (1995), and so on. You can see it at the UCLA Pedagogical Media Lab - one of the few places in the country where copies are easily accessible to the public. It's a super!
