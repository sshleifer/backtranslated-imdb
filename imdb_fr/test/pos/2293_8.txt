You must have lived in Japan for a while to enjoy the beauty of this movie! Believe it or not, what you see gives a very good and accurate picture of differences in East / West mentalities, both from a sporting and personal point of view. A funny, funny and comforting film that deserves better than what Americans can watch. 8 out of 10!
