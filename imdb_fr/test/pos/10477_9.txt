This film is almost unknown, but it is very good. In an isolated Danish city, two older sisters live in the memory of distant young people. When they had to give up happiness because of a strict Puritan education. Solitary then, live in a dignified austerity, until the arrival of Babette, who leaves Paris, frightened by the horror of the war. In a short time, she will be able to transform the kindness and love she received upon her arrival. A good lottery prize allows him to organize a grand banquet, respecting the best rules of French gastronomy. All neighborhoods are invited (all purely fanatical). They accept, but they pact to show no trace of pleasure or enjoyment, because it would be a sin. However, the seductive force of the delicious meal they eat allows them to be seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy. The banquet ends with a very felt but discreet happiness. The love between humans has woken up. The miracle of the rise of human kindness due to the pleasure of meaning has begun. The film is surprisingly good, but it is not for all tastes. During most of the film, nothing happens, everything is so calm and peaceful that for several minutes you can only see the life of the inhabitants of the city. But as the film develops, it becomes more valuable, when Babette wins the lottery prize (after 30 minutes of film), the show begins. The author is able, with a perfect staging, to show us how Babette prepares the banquet, how she mixes all the ingredients with the most wonderful (Love), all in a delicious and silent style, with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting. . Then, as the banquet goes on, it is simply amazing to show how the mood of all consumers changes mood due to the meal, and only in the foreground, with impressive scenes filmed one after the other. In addition, the contact with colors and photography is also superb, almost every scene in the film is like an image, so the work is involved. If you are able to admire a good cinema and realize that sometimes it is more important to tell you something rather than what is said is your film. If you like good food and enjoy good food, you will probably have fun, because most feelings of the film will be familiar to you. A totally deserved Oscar. The only problem is its slowness in setting up the story, but, I can forgive it (I hope everyone else too)
