The Beguiled is a rather satisfying film for those looking for the above. For the fans of Clint Eastwood, it will be a disappointment. Although Eastwood does his best here in his atypical role (except that his character is a charming womanizer, whom he does not know so badly), the ambiguous nature of his character, who is no longer a kind of fallen hero. for a manipulative and insatiable woman eater (to put it that way) will ultimately be too difficult to handle for anyone seeing him play heroes in the purest Western tradition, morally a little impure but still without that dark side. I think he manages to pull out this unlikely piece, but those who really steal the show are the two rival women, school teacher Geraldine Page and the students' heads, played by Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> We see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman, especially with regard to sexuality and sexual desire. Hartman's Edwina is the sweetest and most innocent girl in the world until she becomes passionate about John McBurney and becomes possessive of him. This is what causes the tragedy, as well as the secret covetousness of the director, the forbidden fruit. She wears a big and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother, whom she clearly idolizes. The fourth factor in this "impious" love spiral is the wicked Carol, played by Jo Ann Harris, who keeps John away from his crush on Edwina and lies down in bed. <br /> <br /> All the nature of the story this film has a kind of gothic feel, making it a rare thing in the Western genre, but popular in the movies of the 70s. A unique achievement of the Siegel / Eastwood team and a film that is not for the sensitive souls.
