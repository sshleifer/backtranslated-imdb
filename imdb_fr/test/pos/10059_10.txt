Why does everyone feel he has to constantly lower this movie? It's cute and funny (exactly what it's supposed to be). Anyway, Madonna was not ready to prove herself as an Oscar-winning calligraphy artist with this movie! She was doing just what the character was asking for and she did it well. I loved him in this movie; it's my second favorite Madonna movie after Evita. The soundtrack is excellent too. It's neither better nor worse than any film from the 80's. To all critics, do not take it too seriously and you could have fun watching it. Madonna is a goddess !!!
