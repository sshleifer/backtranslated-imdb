A ghost story about a typical Turkish high school with beautiful sound and visual effects. Taylan biraderler (taylan brothers) had made his first plans on a television show a few years ago, as far as I know. It was a bit like a Turkish X-Files, they had very nice stories but lacked visual effects. This time, it seems they had what they needed and used them well. This movie will make you laugh, that's for sure, and you may be scared too. He has a beautiful plot and some young and brilliant actors. If you are a high school student in Turkey, you will find here a lot about you. There are many clues in the film about its history and its end, some that you understand for the moment, others that make sense, the dialogues were written in a very intelligent way. They make the film one of the best Turkish films made in recent years. Do not forget that this film is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
