I agree with one of the posts here that the book is not like the movie. I read the book in second grade high school at Sumter SC. I immediately fell in love with the book and I was looking forward to the release of the mini series. Although I liked the film and found it very well done, I was disappointed that the film did not follow the book. I was glad the Orry was not killed like in Love and War or N & S II. <br /> <br /> Growing up at SC and graduated from SC University, I fell in love with the history of the South because of that. mini series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes at a symposium in 1988 at USC. I stayed after and met Mr.Jakes. Unfortunately, I could not ask him a question. But meeting him was an honor. I specialized in accounting but got my minor in Southern Studies. In addition, I have modeled my mannerisms much after Orry Main. Orry and I are very similar. I feel that I was born 150 years too late. I am a man from the south and I am very proud of that. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with two women in the movie .... Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Dude, did I have a crush on Wendy !!!! I have never really been able to find a version of his life in real life. I hope someday too !!!
