I have seen this film several times and I find it very convincing and sad. The lack of real emotion of most characters is very disturbing. They seem empty, hopeless. The story is based on a real event. <br /> <br /> A teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend for no obvious reason - apparently, he just wanted to. Then, he brags about his friends and, as they do not believe him, he takes them to see the body several times. Nobody reports the murder. Keanu Reeves and Crispen Glover - The character of Crispen Glovers is seriously annoying. <br /> <br /> Keanu's character, Matt, seems to be the only one to have the sense of truth and falsity. It's Keanu at its best - a flawless and highly credible performance - anyone who thinks this man can not act must watch this movie. Matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the movie. Only twelve and no factor of compassion or love in his life. It is very sad to think that there are children like that. This makes you really grateful for what you have. 9/10.
