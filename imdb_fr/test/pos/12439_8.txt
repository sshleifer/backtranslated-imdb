The play is cleverly constructed - start with the Rainbow doorman - and let the audience see the background unfold through their eyes. The film follows the piece with great fidelity and probably works on the simple premise that it could not be improved. Now add a host of superb characters - and the result is a resounding triumph. A must do not miss.
