I must admit that when Madonna played for the first time in Holiday on Top of the Pops, many years ago, I told my wife "another American prodigy who is wrong!" She wore a frightened wig and was wearing a terrible coat. I never learned to love her like my daughter but I have to eat my words. I like some of his works and sometimes enjoy his filmed concerts. This film of the Confessions tour is great, even if the music is not (and it is not). I was impressed by the staging and the concepts. Madonna's incredible performances have been enhanced by the incredible dancers she has chosen to support her. My daughter was at the London concerts and was crazy about it. The lady (Madge) proved that my initial assessment of her was very wrong !!
