A brilliant horror movie. Absolutely horrible and very scary too. The Chose is a remake of John Carpenter, but please do not get discouraged by this movie. It's just great. At the beginning of the film, the extraterrestrial shuttle swept the Earth centuries before humanity roamed the planet with an explosion that unleashed the title of the film in a stunning white and bright blue, proclaiming "THE THING". One of the best credits of a horror movie to date. <br /> <br /> All the actors who interpret the scientific team of twelve men is a pleasure to watch and the filming locations of their station in Antartica are visually impressive. on widescreen DVD. It must have been great at the movies. I regret not having seen this on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who grudgingly becomes the leader of men trying to fight a lethal monstrosity that has changed shape and infiltrated their base. All the actors are really good and create terrible scenes of paranoia and tension about the infected person. My favorite scene in the whole movie must be when Macready tests the infection in everyone alive, it's tense, scary and finally spectacular. I like it a lot because it's funny too. <br /> <br /> We must especially congratulate Rob Bottin for his truly incredible makeup effects and his changing motives from the stranger himself. If he did not receive an Oscar for the best visual effects at the time, he should have done so well. The question of whether it is John Carpenter's greatest film is certainly a horrible masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Expect a cold winter night. Get Budweiser in the fridge. Sit down and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece that throws heroes fighting, transforming changing gore and mud. <br /> <br /> Absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten.
