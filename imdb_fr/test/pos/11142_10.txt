I felt pretty sorry that this movie is not popular at all, even in Hong Kong. However, for all fans of Die Hard, it will be a masterpiece that should not be forgotten. It's "Mo Lei Tou" (a comedy style based on an unrealistic and ridiculous plot developed by Chow) at its peak. The plot is absolutely absolutely finally 1000 times ridiculous than any movie you can imagine. The dialogue is great. No part of the movie gets cold so you stop laughing. <br /> <br /> The plot looks simple, but crazy enough for you to start laughing. It starts with Chow featuring a young magistrate (a corrupt magistrate of course) trapped in helping an innocent married woman whom he likes at first sight to free her from the murder charge, that plot of a a diabolical minister whose son was in reality the real condemned. Chow escapes from prison and fled as a refugee. He intends to go to the capital to see the emperor and report his sentence. On the way, he managed to pick up two pretty women, one from the circus, another a prostitute, while mastering the supreme ability to quarrel and be blamed for the thin Mama-san (which happens to be his future law) ). . Finally, he was able to force the emperor to reopen the case by black mail to the emperor whom he met in the house of the pass. The emperor appointed him a higher-level judge to try the case with the diabolical minister. He managed to set up brilliant but hilarious plots to force the convict to commit the crime, to execute it while throwing the diabolical minister into prison. <br /> <br /> The intrigues are really hilarious and ridiculously bright. And do not forget the wonderful dialogue that includes a brilliant quarrel between Chow and Mama-san, a quarrel between fat Mama-san and skinny Mama-san to encourage Chow to learn the technique of quarreling later. as well as a quarrel between Chow and the evil eunuchs near the end. Beside that, some scenes are also brilliant. <br /> <br /> One thing to mention is that in order to fully understand the film and make up 100% of all elements correctly, it will be essential to master it. Cantonese really good. Which may be why the first Chow films receive a moderate response from the Asian world. However, when the film Chow began to spread its influence around the world, hardcore fans like me discovered that his film was not as funny as the old one.
