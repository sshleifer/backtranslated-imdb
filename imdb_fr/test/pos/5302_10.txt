This is Ghibli's latest film and is also a MAJOR departure from the studio's established style. First of all, this film was obviously aimed at young children, much more than any of their previous films. It lacks the depth of other films and proposes a new style of animation much less realistic ?? and yet, it's still fun. Although there is nothing in place to attract adults, I have always been drawn to the screen and completely immersed in the story. The secret of the film is a brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are very candid with their feelings / intentions, etc., but it makes them even more endearing. Special attention has also been paid to the soundtrack, which is absolutely incredible, although very different from previous Ghibli soundtracks. I find myself singing all the time the cute theme song, like everyone who sees this movie!
