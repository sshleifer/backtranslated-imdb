Chucky is back but this time he's not scary (a lot), but he's funny! <br /> <br /> When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trashy girlfriend, Tiffany, he kills her quickly and also turns her into a doll. Tiffany and Chucky are now discussing with the case of two high school graduates - eekkk !! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie - he has a lot of fun. It's scary, funny, strange, wacky and stupid! <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10.
