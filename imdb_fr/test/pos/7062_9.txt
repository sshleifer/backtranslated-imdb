I caught this on TV one day when I was young and loved it. In the 1970s, there were a lot of lame comedies that were trying too much to be funny, so it was a nice surprise. This is one of the best comedies of the 1970s and the final comedy of the summer camp thanks to the excellent comedy show of Murrary, which remains one of the greatest. This is the film that really caught Ivan Reitman's attention as a director. Reitman proves with this film that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. While this film is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so terrible it's fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely awful. Recommended for those who liked STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
