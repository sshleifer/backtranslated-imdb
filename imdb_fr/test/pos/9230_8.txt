The bullets may not have fallen on his chest, but The Lone Ranger was for me the symbolic icon of Superman, my other childhood hero. He embodied truth, justice and the American way in a classic Western televised context, assuming he would never use his weapon to kill, while traveling the American Southwest with his faithful Indian companion, Tonto to bring to justice every outlaw. The advent of television was the perfect opportunity for post-war generations to find the one that suits them best in an enigmatic masked man who defended public order while offering unparalleled entertainment for five seasons, for almost eight years. <br /> <br /> Today I had the opportunity to see for the first time the entirety of the original episodes in three parts, without the standard opening and closing sequences, which would interrupt the continuity of history. For Ranger fans, it's the grandfather of all Western sagas, telling how Texas Ranger John Reid survived the ambush of the Butch Cavendish Gang and how he was cared for by an Indian friend from his childhood. Tonto (Jay Silverheels) declares his companion "faithful scout" and names him Kemo-sabe. I have read various interpretations of the origin of the term Kemo-sabe, but I am satisfied with Tonto's explanation. If you read too much, it only hurts the story, as does the English translation of 'tonto' in Spanish, which I will not reveal, because it is better not to know if you can help it. <br /> <br /> I found it clever enough how the original story created the Lone Ranger's mystique, like the sixth tomb that created the illusion that all Rangers died in the ambush of the canyon. You never see the face of the man who becomes the Lone Ranger, because he is always diverted or obscured to hide his true identity. Even the origin of money is treated brilliantly; the voice of the narrator of the story describing the exceptional qualities of the wild stallion. Does it concern, say, sterling money, money? I had the greatest enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Of course, over time, watching the episodes of Lone Ranger today allows us to see just how unsophisticated and out of the box. Some of them are almost embarrassing, especially when it comes to a clash with Lone Ranger when he hits in the midst of a crowd of villains to drop a pistol from his owner's hand. And what about the little wave he sends to Tonto every time they're about to ambush the wicked - it's always the same, but Tonto always knows what it means under different circumstances. Then you have episodes where Clayton Moore removes Ranger's mask to put on a different disguise to mimic another character in the service of the story. He once even went undercover as an actor playing President Abraham Lincoln to discover a villain, a top hat and everything! <br /> <br /> Few fans I meet know that actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore for 1952/53 season in a contract dispute that Moore had with the show's producers. If you've ever seen this episode of "Happy Days" where Fonzie idolizes her childhood hero, you'll notice that it was John Hart who appeared in the credits. In fact, it's hard to tell if you're watching an episode of Hart or not, the bottom line is listening to the voice; Moore is so distinctive that it's a deadly gift. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the chance to taste some of the color episodes of the final season, you'll be thrilled. The interpretations I've seen on VHS are absolutely beautiful, although I do not know if commercial prints are available. Most black and white episodes have been repackaged by any number of distributors in different configurations. So you should not have to worry about it. What you need to see, of course, is the three-part origin, and if you do not look at anything else, it gives you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the most famous heroes of the West. Hi-Silver, Awaaaay!
