The 80s are widely regarded as the decade in which the horror decided to have fun. Sometimes there were well-defined brains ("Evil Dead II", "The Night of the Creeps" and "The Return of the Living Dead", for example), then there were those stupid but really low-key movies. and were perfect for a night with beer and friends. Movies such as "Pieces" and "Blood Diner" brought together rental shelves in the 80s and 90s, offering little intelligence or skill, but full of silly entertainment activities. Kevin Tenney's movie "Night of the Demons", released in 1988, is part of this tradition-stupid, badly played and not an original bone in his body, but damn it if you do not have a good time. <br /> <br /> The plot is so simplistic that it must have come from the 80s: a group of stupid teenagers interpreted by a group of actors aged 20 to 20 years decide to go to a party at Hull House hosted by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (The Scream Queen Legend, Linnea Quigley.) Well, Angela and her colleagues. decides to start a session. It turns out to be the character of Will Arnett's "Arrested Development," Gob would call it, "a huge mistake," because a demonic force soon possesses Angela and begins to reach out to others as well. <br /> <br /> Take "The Evil Dead," "A nightmare on Elm Street" and your stupid, dead little teen movie, throw them in a blender, and "Night of the Demons" is this that you obtain. The film is anything but original and it's really not a good movie. Everything is incredibly derivative, the acting is terrible, the jokes often fall flat, the characters are annoying (especially the character of Stooge) and the intrigues are numerous. It's always a lot of fun. So why? <br /> <br /> Well, on the one hand, the effects of makeup and gore are first-rate, with truly memorable moments (especially a nasty and just strange shot with a tube of lipstick) that really stand out. Moreover, he rarely, if ever, takes himself too seriously. Yet, with the exception of terrible word games, he plays directly and never squanders public time with low self-awareness. In addition, it is almost impossible to resist the energy and enthusiasm of the entire company. Yes, it's not special, but he knows it and he could not be proud of it anymore. It's a zany party horror movie, and it never pretends to be anything else. <br /> <br /> This may not be a classic, but "Night of the Demons" is a good example of a well-made horror junk food. It may not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you do not want a refined beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.
