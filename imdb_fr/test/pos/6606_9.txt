A dozen bored surfers, mostly children from Venice, California, not only reinvent skateboarding, but transform the fashion phenomenon of suburbs once forgotten in the 1950s into an action sports revolution. <br /> </ br> > As told by Sean Penn, Dogtown depicts life in the more dilapidated seaside communities of "Locals Only" around 1974, which consisted mainly of surfing the morning tides and wandering around. The Zephyr Team (or Z-boys, as they are called) spend a summer fighting boredom by building their own boards with the help of a local with a surf shop. After participating in the new skateboard competitions in SoCal, they transfigure all of this into their own scene. one that spawns a generation of skateboarders made up of big names like Tony Hawk, Shaun White and the creators of the X-Games series. <br /> <br /> Dogtown introduces the chronological perspective into skateboarding and the beginnings of everyday life. A story you never knew. <br /> <br /> Andy Frye at MySportsComplex.blogspot.com
