This black-and-white film arrived in the Spartan film house of my Frisian village about 18 months after its release. At that time, a lot of our full comedy prize came from Denmark (Nils Poppe, do you mind?), So this movie was like a crush - it made me cry out of defenseless joy, ROTFL, as we said now. Okay, some of the visual gags were actually recycled vaudeville "schtick", but how could this "barefoot boy with coppery cheeks" know that at the time? Anyway, my favorite scenes were Jerry's frantic clown, like this boxing match in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> See "Sailor Beware" again fifty years later, I sneered still loudly. Certainly, without the nostalgia component, it would probably be another rather mediocre comedy. But then another film that threw me into even more powerless stitches, that of "Fireman Save My Child" in Spike Jones, now looks dated and scalded, aside from a few too short orchestral pieces and the scenes of Doodles Weaver. It must be a special ingredient that allows Martin & Lewis products to stay fresh longer. For me, this one at least is valued at eight out of ten.
