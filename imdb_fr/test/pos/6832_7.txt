I had this film on eBay mainly because I'm gay and I like Til Schweiger. However, it's one of those movies that, when you look at it a second time, never say, "Hmm, I forgot that boring part, I'm going to make popcorn." He does not have this part. It is a very fluid film and constantly interesting. And yes, Til Schweiger is worth it, if nothing else. But, it's an excellent movie even for heterosexuals.
