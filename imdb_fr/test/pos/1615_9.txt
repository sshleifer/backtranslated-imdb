Brett Piper realizes again a very good film which is criticized by the so-called "experts" of the film. it's a small budget, but fun, and the main woman is very sexy. I wish I could see more of Irene Joseph. Good viewing fun. I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. Special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than computer generated shit they call effects today. I still enjoy Brett Piper's movies, and if you liked that, I recommend you Bite Me, Screaming Dead and all he did. I can not wait to see more of her work and more of Ms. Joseph. I just do not see why this woman has not been in more movies because her game is excellent.
