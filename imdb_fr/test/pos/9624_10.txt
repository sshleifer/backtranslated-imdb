This was the very first kung fu movie I have ever seen. The dubbing is not the best but much better than some I've seen. The plot is much better than some that are made today. It's sometimes bloody, but that's what gives it that particular momentum. The material of the Academy Award is not it? But if you like watching fights and a decent story, this is for you!
