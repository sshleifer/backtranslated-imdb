"Batman Returns" from 1992 was Tim Burton's second tour as a director and he still hit hard by making this film dark and gloomy like that of 1989. Gotham City is once again a place of darkness and darkness, where the Crime and corruption spread on every corner. It was also clever to see how Burton used politics as a secondary plot that fit perfectly with the corruption of businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) and the plan to make Gotham's mayor "the Penguin" (Danny DeVito). )! Anyway, Keaton comes back again as "Batman" / Bruce Wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and ripped man who just can not find love in a normal world , but he is challenged when he meets another solitary soul in Selina Kyle only. Ms. Kyle has her own very dark secret and she's just a vampire as a sexy and mysterious and yet dangerous "Catwoman" (Michelle Pfeiffer). A plan is formed between the two villains to destroy Gotham and most importantly, they both want to get rid of the bat. Really this film, although violent and a bit rude with many penguin scenes, is clearly an exciting excitement from start to finish, as you never find a boring moment and congratulate Tim for exploring such dark and conflicting characters that resulted. even more interesting movie. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance was the best of all time, because no one could have played better than "The Catwoman" and Devito was perfect, because the "Penguin" frame perfectly matched the character, even though glum was fun to watch. . "Batman Returns" is an exciting excitement you can not turn away from the eyes. As a spectator, you will enjoy it many times. It's also exciting and explosive.
