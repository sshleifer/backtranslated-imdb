As you know, "The best game ever played" is golf. I used to sneer at the overly dramatic title, but thanks to a superb visual presentation attributed to director Bill Paxton (best known for his acting in Twister and his hilarious supporting roles in Aliens and True Lies), we discover that it makes a lot more sense game. <br /> <br /> Although the film is about golf, it seems that sport is only part of what is really happening. What is really happening is that people are being told that they can not realize their dreams, be it their age or their social status. A conflict between the wishes of a son and the demands of a father. Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a God-given caddy who has never been allowed to play. Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) plays the lead role. golf in the first place. Despite the resentment of the upper class "gentlemen", it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. The discouragement of his father, played by Elias Koteas (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Sugartime), who considered that playing a simple game will never improve their poor living conditions, constituted a greater threat. With the continued support of his mother, Francis finally meets his idol, golf legend Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane). <br /> <br /> The cinematographic realization of the film is more impressive than the game itself. This proves that storytelling is successful through pure cinema. The whole movie could have been said without dialogue. There are scenes in the film that build a strong suspense and emotion with only images. In one scene in particular, Francis Ouimet swings and the crowd turns their heads to watch the ball fly away, except for the face of Harry Vardon who looks intently at Ouimet without flinching. The way golfers visualize the course offers more aesthetic pleasure. <br /> <br /> A nice support cast completes the whole thing. Peyton List plays the interest of love and seems to be worth it, and Josh Flitter plays an adorable caddy that keeps Ouimet concentrated while the pressure overwhelms him. Lovers of golf or not, you will appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great way to tell any story.
