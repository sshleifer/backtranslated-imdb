MONKEY is surely one of the best shows to be broadcast on television. I remember when I was a kid, I went to my grandmother's house every Saturday morning and turned on the television so I could watch MONKEY. I liked it. There were kickass action scenes, cool special effects, a beautiful story, a fantastic theme song that was guaranteed never to leave the head and hilarious dubbing. But it's a bit odd whether it's in China and the actors are Japanese and shot in Japan, but nothing prevents us from making this TV show enjoyable. <br /> <br /> MONKEY tells the adventures of three people: Pigsy (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (Shir√¥ Kishibe) and, of course, the unforgettable character and the most adorable, Monkey (Masaaki Sakai), who travel from China in India to get sacred scrolls to save the world. <Br /> <br /> MONKEY is a lot of fun and it's magic.
