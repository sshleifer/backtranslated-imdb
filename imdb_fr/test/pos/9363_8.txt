RKO Radio Pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to get it nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. The acting, the scenario, the continuity, etc., are almost perfect; and the story is worth 82 minutes. Although the photo tarnishes the true story by making the murder victim a Jew rather than a homosexual, most viewers will see the victim as a Jewish homosexual - such disguises never work, they may not have not designed for. <br /> <br /> I could choose from a few details, but just for fun. There was no cinema all night in Washington, DC in 1947 - and if there was one, I'd like Robert Mitchum and his friend not to talk during the show. There was no bar where a GI could take a pretty blonde. NO! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the latest murder scoop, he should have bought the Daily News; not the Times-Hearald, the Evening Star and certainly not the Washington Post. But these little things do not detract from this classic. <br /> <br /> The film benefits enormously from the absolute absence of partition, except during the credits. I only saw it in a few movies. <br /> <br /> From a negative point of view, since 1995, it is presented with an introduction to the TMC, in which some liberal blabs explain what the public was "ready" in 1947 .. blah, blah, blah! As if this fool had any business whatsoever to judge his best. I would say that the former GIs of 1947 - the largest generation - were much smarter - and had better values ​​- than some commentators, film historians or other wise men in 1995. Put a sock in!
