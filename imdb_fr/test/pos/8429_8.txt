I am a big fan of the 1995 version, which I have seen many times, and I am considering an excellent and subtle film. This version of 1971 that I bought yesterday, with a little hesitation, but now that I saw it, I am delighted because it is more faithful to the book and ideas of Austen. The 1995 version has a more spectacular power, largely because it honed many characters. In the 1995 version, Lady Russell is more posh, more manipulative, less attentive to Anne; Sir Walter is even more vain and tasteless. Elizabeth is more mean; Mary is more unbearable; Mr. Elliot is more smarmy; Lady Dalrymple is much more stupid - but I think the characterizations of this 1971 version are closer to the book, to the vision of Austen and the real characters of the time. The 1971 version also includes more lines and key scenes from the book, including the key scene where Anne surprises Wentworth talking to Louisa (or is it Henrietta?) The importance of strength of character. I found the acting game more subtle and evocative than a lot of critics here, but the game of the 1995 version is more powerful. I agree with critics here that the actress who plays Anne is too old for the role; I watched her entry on IMDb and she was 38 at the time of shooting, while her character is supposed to be 28 years old. I thought, however, that his game was subtle and effective. Wentworth is a good age and I found it very convincing. In particular, this version of Wentworth from 1971 has a lot more sense of humor and teasing; that of 1995, much more sense of power than a captain of the navy would have, and more passion. The admiral in the 1971 version lacks the gruff presence and warmth of the 1995 version and has no idea of ​​the power that an admiral would certainly convey; I found him the only really weak element of the production. I agree with others that the scene of the "fall" was too much wood and that it seemed unconvincing that she would have been so hurt by such a small fall. However, it is possible that she bangs the back of the head against the threshold of the stone, which, if so, would produce a very dangerous wound and make the scene more convincing than that of the 1995 version, where it falls further but is clear of any sharp edge that could likely cause a serious injury to the head. Regarding the costumes that some have criticized, I am not an expert and I can not answer, but I will note that none of the Navy characters (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version wears their uniform, The 1995 version all routinely wear their sophisticated uniforms. I suspect that the 1971 version is accurate and that it still bothered me a bit in the 1995 version, with the officers still in uniform when the nation is clearly at peace and the officers on active duty. My father and grandfather were US Navy career captains who commanded aircraft carriers and submarines. They did not spend every day on leave or at their leisure. I doubt it was different 180 years ago. Uniforms give a lot of zing to the 1995 version, and I prefer it, but I doubt it is true that in the past these officers wore their uniforms so frequently. Finally, it is true that the production values ​​of the 1971 version are much lower than those of 1995, but given the year (1971), the format of the television and the budget, we can not hold the artists for officials. Contemporary viewers who can make a mental reservation for lower production values ​​may find this version well worth their time.
