Thank God for the Coen brothers. Their success brought them bigger budgets, but did not free them from their creativity. I had planned to see another movie, but since it was full, I went to see it instead. At first I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they do not make cheap jokes just to make you laugh. The writing is brilliant and interpreted with great skill by George Clooney (after that, no one can say he's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. This can be enjoyed on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I do not remember the last time I saw such a smart movie. I've seen others that I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny, and charming, all of which also describe "Oh Brother," but this film reminded me of older episodes of Seinfeld where all the subplots came together . You can feel that their journey is being done, but you can not say what. And the Coen brothers do not miss us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It's surprising, and perfectly connects all the details, without bearing the story.
