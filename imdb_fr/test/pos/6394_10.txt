This show is ideal for many reasons. The father and the mother can communicate with their children that day. It's really great to see a real family instead of a family that's too heavy and muddy. I watched that once and got addicted. It was really great to see a black family on TV that is worth watching. This program left too early, but when she left the room she was talking about pregnancy, sex, drugs, bad dates, death, etc. The best thing about the series is that she treats it with great humor. Great show for the family .. I can not tell you how many times I sat watching this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head. Great pg 13 rated show.I liked Everybit of this show.
