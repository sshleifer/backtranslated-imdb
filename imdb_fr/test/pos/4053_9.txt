As in many modern American movies, there must be a supernatural element in the plot, but if you let that go, it's a charming tale and a kindly heart encased in a crab shell. <br /> We are presented with a scene of a city in an economically disadvantaged region that has trouble finding something to celebrate. The character of Beau Bridges is really competing with a growing family, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who was sold to a big chain of stores that he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub the nose. D'Onofrio finds his rather superficial lifestyle, Bubba, cramped when he has to take care of his "blessed" little brother, Joey, and he is eager to escape the chains of this lifeless city. Their boss's business is closing (much against his will) due to lack of new clients and his father's memories haunt him as he reinforces the tension that drives him to his own self-destructive attempt. <br /> <br /> Joey, who seemed to personify the curse inflicted upon them, is lost at sea - allegedly drowned - in an abnormal accident. His miraculous restoration by the Portuguese trawlers whose boat they had just built and launched (perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew) is the sign they were waiting for and they all decided to give a last dice to life. <br /> The atmosphere of this work is beautiful and has allowed us to hold our attention with as much brilliance as "The Shipping News". There are also other parallels with subsequent work, which lead to suspicion of a remake. I like 'Signs of Life' for its simpler and less artificial narrative and its interpretations of actors' stars working for their craft rather than being noticed as stars.
