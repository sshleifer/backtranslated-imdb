Presented at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and gaining some renown, this film appears as another modern and profound school drama. <br /> <br /> This is a group of teenagers who spend a revealing and desperate day at school. Everything revolves around a suicide - shown at the beginning to a certain extent - that occurs at 2:37 pm. The characters are somehow all connected to each other. What moves them is described in short interview sequences, strictly shot in black and white. The characters are well written, the actors play intrigue (Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus are discoveries). <br /> <br /> Let's stay in the cinema technique. That really impressed me. There are rarely cuts, most of the time, the camera follows one of the protagonists, as in Elephant Gus van Sants. Some scenes are presented more than once, but each time from a different point of view (here: character). This surely evokes an atmosphere that develops slowly, but literally catches the inside. The colors are vibrant, somewhat improper given the difficult plot, but it's nothing less than a clever contrast, a worrying "everything is fine". The use of lighting is adequate all the time, emphasizing the real mood of the characters. And finally, there are decent investments of music. <br /> <br /> 2:37 itchy somehow from the beginning. It does not compromise and does not serve to laugh. Rather, it links what psychologists would define as moments of terror. This film focuses primarily on emotional precipices. There is no one who should not handle a kind of neurosis, even the minor parts described (eg teachers) seem to be in a state of disorder. And that's what keeps this movie from being really good. His account of piercing tragedies is unrealistic for all his bones. There is no friendship, no love, no smile, no truth, no passion. There is: simulacrum, humiliation, despair, sickness and blows. It's like you're hurting your face all the time, but you're numb after the first hour. This film continues to touch you until it reveals something very informative in the end. <br /> <br /> To be sensitive and superbly played: 9. To be technically innovative and original: 9. To be one-dimensional: 3. <br /> Give a solid 7 out of 10.
