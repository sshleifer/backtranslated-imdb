While the concept of "Doctor of the Date" is the only thing that prevents this movie from being a classic romantic comedy with a classic plot for the genre, I found it quite pleasant to elevate my opinion about it and I ended up loving him a lot more. only if she had just had a mediocre plot without a lot of twists. Will Smith does a great job, as always, as Hitch, the man who spends his life advising men how and how not to win women ... since his unsuccessful attempt to keep his girlfriend in college. Albert Brennman (Kevin James), his overweight and obese asthmatic patient, is successfully courting his beautiful colleague, Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). In addition, when he decides to rid a woman in a turkey bar who does not seem to understand that she does not want him, he finds himself attracted by Sara (Eva Mendes) - it seems like a big deal for him so I guess since college, he never really practiced his own rules about himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in the "appointments doctor" who had a seemingly silly guy like Albert with Allegra - especially the AFTER player / jerk, breaks the heart of his best friend (Julie Ann Emery) and indicates that the date he saw the doctor disgusted her, when she did not realize he had refused to see him. Still, trouble ensues and Hitch gets stuck left and wonders what to do with his own relationship, while helping Albert to try and find out what else to do in his own. The acting is good, there is a lot of humor and some other good points with meaning. Hitch's character is witty and wise, sometimes managing to be both at once. Certainly, the misunderstanding where the woman is offended by something that the man has not really done (why is he always showing it?) Is it common and irritating - supposes that this would not have been the case if it was the 1st, not the 5th time I saw - but the rest of them were completely new. I only wish this film to last longer - I remember watching the 3/5 while playing once on a TV in a restaurant - but I still agree. It is really worth paying for its brevity.
