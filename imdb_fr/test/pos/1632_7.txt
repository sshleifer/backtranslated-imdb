I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say that this is one of the few books I could not read by reading it. <br /> <br /> The film was about what I expected, a lot of action, with a mysterious story. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> You will not have to worry that this is as serious as The Da Vinci Code, is all it was not. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense and less unnecessary controversy. If you have not read the book, do not worry, you will always find it very interesting. And if you've read the book, let's say you might be a little disappointed because I found many missing scenes that I was hoping for. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is really impressive for all viewers. But maybe not something too special for Dan Brown fans.
