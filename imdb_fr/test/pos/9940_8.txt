If you agree with the extravagant work of the first director of horror Italian, able to accept his scandalous intrigues and flamboyant style, you should have a good time with Opera. If you do not do it, then you will not do it. <br /> <br /> Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a beautiful opera lining that puts the spotlight on celebrity (in an avant-garde production of Macbeth) when the star of the show is hit by a car. As all artists who have marched, as Macbeth knows is a production that bears a curse, and Betty soon discovers that the series in which she is now the star is no exception: a killer systematically swears the theater ?? and poor Betty are forced to watch by the sadistic murderer (who strips needles under his eyes to prevent him from closing them!). <br /> <br /> With the help of a little girl who crawls in her air Betty discovers the identity of the murderer and the truth about her mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Opera is a crazy movie, with its absurd intrigues, its complicated death scenes and its end that jeopardizes belief. And although the director Dario Argento has never been a film for, as they say, classic stories, this giallo in particular is so silly and presents so many of its elegant touches (which have all grown to the maximum), it's almost as if, with each successive film, he sees what he can get (sometimes almost parodying his previous work). <br /> <br /> That's exactly why I find the movie so much fun !!! <br /> <Argento's camera moves are absolutely incredible: hovering, crawling and, in an incredible scene, even dive around the opera above the audience; the power of Verdi's music blends perfectly with the majesty of Claudio Simonetti's score, providing an appropriately grandiose accompaniment to sumptuous visuals; and several exceptional board pieces (featuring the nauseating effects of Sergio Stivaletti) prove that no one dies better than Argento (see the breathtaking excerpt of a character in which a bullet is idling in a porthole of door, and right in the eyes!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
