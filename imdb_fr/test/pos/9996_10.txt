This film gives a good rating to golf, it was well played and well directed. Giving you a glimpse into the story that will appeal to some non-athletic fans. The historical factor alone gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really well done. I am in the north-east and I saw Brookline as a fan and as a person who loves football. The film was well done at all levels. TO SEE 5 stars. The acting game was superb, Disney has another winner in his bag of great movies. If for no other reason, watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people who may not see hope in their lives. I would say that the setting in the late 1800s and early 1900s is very realistic. The costumes and the dialect were also up to par. Beyond the call of duty for a golf movie. A must for fans and non-fans.
