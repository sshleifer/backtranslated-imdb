This is the forty minute film that introduces us to the character of the butcher, who will be examined in more detail in the feature film Alone Against All. In this film, he follows the beginning of his life from 1965 to 1979, but focuses on the late seventies. The first images are those of the massacre of a horse, then the birth of a baby, the girl of the butcher, which we see growing rapidly each year. The Butcher (played by Philippe Nahon in both films) is a bitter man with the world. He hates a lot of things. His anger rises when a man attacks his autistic daughter. The butcher mutilates the bad man and finds himself in prison. <br /> <br /> This film follows the life of the butcher until his release from prison, then Alone Against All takes over. I watched the movies badly, Alone Against All First. Try to watch this little movie first if you can.
