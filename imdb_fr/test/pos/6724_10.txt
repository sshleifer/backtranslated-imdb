I saw the Korean version of Daisy first. It seemed like a simple love story that went well from beginning to end. I saw it 3 times while I was waiting for the copy of the director's cut. <br /> <br /> Then I got the DC and watched it. Wow! I think this is the first REAL director's cut I've ever seen. Amazing how much the edition is detailed in both versions! The DC is presented as a hardcore thriller, with the love story in the background. It evolves at a slower pace than the Korean version. The variations between the two versions are so radical that it looks like two totally different movies. I thought I would be exhausted watching the movie again, only criticizing it for the added scenes. This was not the case. I really felt like watching a brand new movie. <br /> <br /> While the domain controller takes 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, you will have trouble locating the changes made. 2 seconds off here. A second added there. An entire scene added here. Another erased there. In both versions, scenes have been added, omitted or hashed and rearranged. In some scenes, entire dialog lines have been replaced or reordered, while the scene itself was intact. Even simple sound effects have been added / omitted from each version, which has a major impact on the mood of the film and sometimes even changes the outcome of a scene. What appears as a tender moment in the Korean version is a dark and somber moment at the DC. The endings of both versions leave room for interpretation. As far as I know, both versions end VERY differently and were designed this way. <br /> <br /> I guess most people will buy the director's version of the film and find it pretty decent, but a bit long and boring. If this is the case, look for the Korean version. Same movie, but different feeling. I think there is a deluxe 3 DVD version that contains both excerpts from the movie - not sure. <br /> <br /> The versions complement each other so I'll look at Daisy more often than I do. one of my other favorite Korean movies. Alone, I would say that the Korean version is a beautiful love story that I would watch from time to time. The staging of the director, I will look maybe once or twice, then never again, because I find the rhythm boring. But they go so well together! For what I consider the best experience, I would say to look at the Korean version first. Then watch the director's editing to fill in the gaps in the story that interested you. <br /> <br /> Editing is the real star of the film.
