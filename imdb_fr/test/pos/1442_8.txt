Excellent little innovative film (in 1955) on an important subject. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from Sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised. Aimé Kim Novak! She was beautiful! <br /> <br /> I loved Elmer Bernstein's jazz score! As great as Lazlo Schifrin's for "Bullitt"! I'm very surprised that it does not seem to be available on CD (if anyone knows the availability of the soundtrack on another format, it should show it somewhere here). <br /> <br /> The direction of Preminger was, as usual, at the limit without flaw. <br /> <br /> I have not read Nelson Algren's novel or the slightest idea of ​​the story's fidelity to it. Frankie's sub-plot as a "hot" reseller was also a bit of a surprise, as were a few other things. But see for yourself. It's definitely worth seeing ...
