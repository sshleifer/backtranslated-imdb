'Radio' is a beautiful film based on a true story of James Robert Kennedy, a mental defender, nicknamed 'Radio', and T.L. Hanna High School football coach Harold Jones. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding, Jr. is excellent as a radio! I never imagined seeing him in a serious performance, especially because most of the movies I watch with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great like Harold Jones, but this actor is awesome, so it's not a novelty. <br /> <br /> The young man with the intellectual disability named James Robert Kennedy, still walks around the T.L. Hanna High School, without disturbing anyone and almost not noticing. One day, when the football is thrown close to him, he decides to stay with the ball, under the eager look of Johnny Cash, one of the best players of the football team and one of the most unpleasant that you have ever seen. One day, Cash decides to punish James, making fun of him with other football players and even tying him up. <br /> <br /> When coach Jones discovers this horrible act, he remains angry and punishes the entire team. , deciding for this day to help James, nicknamed "Radio" because of his passion for radios in general. <br /> <br /> The film shows how the radio becomes a skilled assistant, helping the team to train despite the difficulties of the players, and even get the respect of practically all the inhabitants of the small town. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. He has a life lesson and shows us in particular how a person can make a difference, even if it is not what we call "normal". Radio has a big heart and is unable to hate anyone, and that's something we should all apply to our daily lives.
