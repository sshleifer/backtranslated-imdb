I saw this film at the NFT in London, where it was screened as part of the John Huston season of the BFI. I did not know what to expect and the first few minutes of the movie gave very little. In fact, the rest of the movie continued to give little! No real plot, no action, no suspense, very little drama and, with the exception of a short section at the very end, no decor. <br /> <br /> The result of the absence of all these features was however wonderful film. I do not really understand why, but I think that his discreet nature made the film almost completely perfect. The acting, the scenario and, above all, the cast were at the rendezvous and I do not remember leaving a cinema so well, but I still do not understand why. I just know I'm going to get the DVD (it's one of those movies that I'm sure will be as good on the screen as the movies, as long as you can find a quiet place to watch it!) And I will watch it again soon. I will also be interested to know what my family and friends think. I am sure that not everyone will choose it, but I am sure that many will agree with my opinion. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
