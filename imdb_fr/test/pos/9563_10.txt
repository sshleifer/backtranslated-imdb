I recently saw this movie for the first time. I had so much fun that I went out and bought the DVD. This film is a pure genius and only becomes more funny at each viewing. Anyone can write funny jokes or dialogues and ask the actors to memorize them, but the basis of this film is to improve !! How do they do? Thank you, Christopher Guest!
