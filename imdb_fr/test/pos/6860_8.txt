I saw Anatomy when it came out and I recently bought it, as well as the sequel of 2003, and as I watch a lot of foreign movies in different genres, you have to watch the movies in their original language. Not only is it annoying to know that the voices do not belong to the actors, but they still look happy, as if the entire movie was a big, long-lasting toothpaste ad or something. This gives a otherwise fantastic movie a horrible appearance and I had to convert a lot of my friends who thought that foreign movies are not as good as North American movies - that they are not enough "Hollywood" . In addition, their translation is never correct, it is too literal and distorts the mood of the film, even if it's basically the same thing. I watched the anatomy myself last week in German, then subtitled with my roommate because he was on his laptop and he did not want to miss any passages when he could not to see the subtitles because he was typing. 30 minutes later, he asked me to let him finish his work and then repeat the film with subtitles. He loved her! Both movies are great as intellectual horror movies! Kelly
