I did not understand what it meant ... I understand it now. I did not really want to see Dirty Dancing either. I had rented it but had never looked at it - and today I did it. And I thought it was a really fun and awesome movie that makes you want to get up and dance. Well, it was sometimes corny ... but it's still a good movie. I can not believe Jennifer Gray was 27 in this movie - my friend and I thought she looked like 18 or 19 - 20 at most. I guess this is attributed to her acting talent. And she looked really clumsy at times. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can say he is in his thirties and seems a little old. Nevertheless, still very good. I love the songs of the 80s, so it really touched me and the love story (yes, I'm romantic) was done in a wonderful way. I really enjoyed this movie. Exceeded my expectations!
