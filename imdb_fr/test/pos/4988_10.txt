It's also the best book I've ever read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are doing well together. There was drama, adventure and sweetness and sadness. I laughed. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when Gus speaks. I wish Gus would have hit Clara like he did Inez. Clara has just been leading Gus all these years without any intention of marrying her. She just loved playing with him. It was sad that he had spent all his life regretting it. It would have been nice if Woodrow had married Maggie, but she would have died anyway. Woodrow was a man who could not express his feelings and kept them locked up. It was obvious that he loved Maggie after the raid on Austin when the rangers came back and ran to hold her back. Val Kilmer is great for playing strange characters. I liked his portrait of Captian Inish Skull. I loved the whole saga of Lonesome Dove. Comanche Moon is the best of the group.
