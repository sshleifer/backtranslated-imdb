David Lynch shot his first film, Erasurehead, for several years, adding new scenes every time he managed to raise a little more money. Kevin Smith worked as a Clerks clerk at work. Robert Rodriguez boasted that "From Dusk Till Dawn" cost exactly $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a lot of money to collect if you work as a cleaner in a graveyard. And if an aspiring filmmaker had not only such a job, but also all the ambition of these personalities and all the talent of Smith, but absolutely no talent. One such figure is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary that tells of his attempt to make a pair of movies for many years. Borchardt combines his wild dreams with flights of depression and a fatal incapacity to call him a day; one senses that he almost prefers the endless efforts of seeking an impossible perfection to a compromise with the reality that he is simply not very good (according to the evidence presented in "American Movie"). And, like a modern Ed Wood, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of losers, his affection for whom is his greatest trait of redeemer. The collection includes his parents at war, his best friends (one a criminal, the other a reformed addict), his own unlucky children and the best of all his old uncle Bill. Bill may be living in a caravan and almost gave up, but he owns a small fortune ($ 280,000 to be precise) and the touching but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men is at the heart of the film. . Borchardt manages to recruit some actors (next to him of course) but, on the whole, he depends entirely on his friends and family to carry out his work (even Bill plays a role in the camera). On British television, the BBC brilliantly scheduled a screening of "American Movie" immediately after "Lost in La Mancha", the story of Terry Gilliam's unfortunate attempt to film "Don Quixote". In this film, we were impressed by the enormous professionalism we showed (which was insufficient for the task at hand) and how extremely difficult it is, even for experts who spend millions of dollars making a film . While Borschadt is not only penniless, he is also so clown that he can not even pronounce the name of his own work properly ("Coven"). In the end, Borschadt is human enough that you want him to succeed, but enough so that the viewer can still laugh at his failures. If this film was a fiction, you would reject it as incredible; but as it is, it's one of the funniest documentaries you can see.
