I became a fan of the TV show 'Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the series, but I became a fan very quickly. It was a unique police show: visually different in its use of portable cameras, taking the viewer everywhere with its multiethnic and multiracial distribution and its diverse and fascinating personalities, and covering all the advantages and disadvantages of a department police, including corruption and personality clashes that surface. <br /> <br /> Homicide: The Movie, the sequel to the series, is as good as a movie for television. After the filming of Lieutenant Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), mayoral candidate of Baltimore, the actors of the series are back to help find the murderer. In addition, cast members who have left the police and those who have died can also find their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the return of the series and the scenario are bristling with the same fire that marked the series. In short, a great TV movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
