This historical film can now be seen in two different versions of the movie Grapevine Video, which also includes the English translation of Selma Lagerlof's novel, based on a Swedish folk tale. The first version is the Swedish edition under the title THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is a re-enactment of how it was presented in the United States under the title THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT, as published by Metro (previously, it was M-G-M). The American version has long since disappeared, but a detailed analysis in The New York Times lets us know how the scenes were reorganized for a national release - and both are fascinating to watch. Each version of this film was presented at The Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with theater organ scores provided by artist Blaine Gale. A live recording of these performances has been made and appears on the Grapevine DVD with the novel and notes on both versions. While THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlof's novel, THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT is in some respects easier to follow. See the two different editions is a teaching on how silent films could be effectively edited for distribution in different countries. <br /> <br /> Some viewers consider this film to be a horror film, which it certainly is not. It's a morality game with nuances of the supernatural used to strike his message. The staging of the great Victor Sjostrom was ahead of his time. It's easy to understand why M-G-M brought him to Hollywood to make films such as Lillian Gish in THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND, as well as Lon Chaney in THE WHO'S GOT THEM. In America he was known as Victor Seastrom. He would also play the lead role in WILD STRAWBERRIES by Ingmar Bergman, giving a masterful performance. Bergman was strongly influenced by KORKARLEN or THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE in his early days. <br /> <br /> It's a powerful film that you have to take the time to discover and study. The publication of Grapevine Video is a great way to do it.
