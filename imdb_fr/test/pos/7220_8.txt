I do not think the world was ready for this movie. I know I was not. I was expecting a low budget standard boiler for schlock mining. Instead, I had the most intelligent editing of Shakespeare ever since Peter Greenaway's "Prospero's Books". This should become the definitive version of Romeo and Juliet's film. It will not be of course. But it's the loss of the world.
