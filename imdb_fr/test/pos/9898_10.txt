I just saw "Checking Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a fantastic combination of a comforting storyline and excellent distribution. Director Jeff Hare has done a remarkable job of inviting the audience into the hilarious and disconnected world of Morris Applebaum and his family. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy crazy jokes while feeling the real pain and worry they feel for each other. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually a fan of Peter Falk, but he is Morris Applebaum and plays the role with a lot of humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone will have the chance to see this wonderful movie and enjoy it as I did. <br /> <br /> Hat to the Director, Distribution and Crew for a job well done!
