This is a well-crafted piece of the master of everyone's favorite suspense. As usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are remarkable (especially for the film time). I did not find the first part of the film very exciting, but it certainly compensated for this with a thrilling scene after another. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like in this film was Farley Granger's choice for Guy Haines. In one way or another, I did not find it very credible. For his part, Robert Walker is a sinister "villain" Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend it.
