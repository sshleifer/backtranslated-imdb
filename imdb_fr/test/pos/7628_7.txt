Superbly beautiful. This film embodies the genre of movies "so bad it's good". <br /> <br /> The only two talents there are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark, and only Boone is good. It's a bit sad that the man who has known glory as a Paladin must end up in this ugly pile of celluloid. As he turns into a fantastic performance, I can not help but think that he has so outperformed all his fellow actors in this room that he should not even have been there. <br /> <br /> The effects in this movie are laughable, but fun. The idea that a dinosaur is buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly come alive is the golden B-movie. When the "triceratops" is killed, watch how it falls. It is clear that the stuntman in front of the suit knows the best moment. He falls to the ground, long before the back half of the dinosaur does the same. <br /> <br /> About costumes, there is nothing good to say about purple tyrannosaur in this movie. He seems to have some kind of stealthy technology, since Bunta (reputedly the best tracker in the world) does not notice it twice, until he is within reach. I do not know how are all the impressions, but in the version I own, Tyranno's roar contains Godzilla's trademark. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun to watch if you like bad movies. I love them and especially the bad monster movies, so I consider this the jewel of my collection. If you prefer bad movies, get this one.
