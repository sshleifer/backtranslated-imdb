I watched this movie on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters receives a special mention because she creates an interesting, diverse and interesting character to watch. Ben's character is a bit shy and stoic, but the changes he undergoes are beautifully interpreted by Rupert Grint. I would certainly say that he has a future in the role of Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is very good in her role as Ben's protective mother, the only thing that has escaped them is to do it too .... Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother, and in the end he is just as honorable. Bryony was the only character I did not really like. It was a little simple and useless, I thought. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a great comedy drama very easy to watch. one of my favorite movies of the year easily.
