Anyone who criticizes 'Jacqueline Hyde' as anything other than the playful and undeniably erotic madness for which she is destined is simply not playing with a complete game. Just in the title, it is obvious that this comedy of horror low budget is not supposed to be taken seriously ... it is as pretentious as the French kiss of a nympho and equally titillating. The female members of the cast are all great and fun to watch. Go see that, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown prince of the horror of the soft core. Unlike most soft-core horror movies, this one is entertaining with charismatic and exceptionally appealing actresses. The film does not even try to follow the plot of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, but rather looks for all possible ways to create risky sight gags and erotic situations. Blythe Metz, the femme fatale brunette who describes the sexiest and homicidal side of Jacqueline, is a real knockout. Watch and enjoy!
