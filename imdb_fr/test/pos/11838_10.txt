This 1931 comedy improves with each performance thanks to Marion Davies' comedic talents and the formidable performance of C. Aubrey Smith. Smith plays a gruff old man who gathers his adult children (from his youth). One is American (Davies), the Englishman (Ray Milland, who is about 18 years old) and the Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises as the plot evolves with Ralph Forbes (which has no appeal) for Davies. <br /> <br /> Davies and Smith are just wonderful and very touching. Davies can also do some dances and make some "big" entries. And of course, Davies is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Halliwell Hobbes, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and David Torrence If they had supported the Oscars in 1931, Smith could very well have been named. He is just excellent in this jewel.
