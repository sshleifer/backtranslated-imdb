For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a short lesson in making an American movie. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are very much about casting. You choose and choose characters that you believe will enhance the dramatic and entertaining value of your movie. <br /> <br /> After shooting a ton of footage, you combine them to create a movie with ups and downs, turns. , climaxes, etc. If you're having trouble with existing footage, you can shoot others that make sense, find footage from archives, or be smart in your narration. <br /> <br /> The claim that the filmmakers used sequences The places that are not part of the film (the favelas adjoining beautiful beaches) do not detract from the value of the film as a play and the image is one that resonates sufficiently to justify its inclusion, which is not entirely true. In any case, you use the footage you can. So they did not manage to get images of police violence for this particular neighborhood. Does it mean not to include it and just talk about it or maybe add an animation so that the audience is not "fooled"? Uh no. <br /> <br /> As for the optimistic end, why not? Yes, the Americans did it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why end on a low note? Just because it's happening in a foreign country and foreign films end up on a negative note? Let strangers depict the sad prospects of life. <br /> <br /> Let us Americans think that there could be a happy ending in the future. There may be one.
