This masterpiece by Perry and Croft has not lost any of its value - as good as one of the best episodes, it was happily shot in time before the late James Beck sadly passed away for inclusion to show his talent. <br /> <This shows from the beginning how the platoon is formed by the state of national emergency and shows the boys as incompetent under the orders of Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier), as they are usually in the series. <br /> <br /> On the way, Mainwaring shows his usual desire to show authority, but the guys can not help but let him down every turn, during the wargames and in case of suspicion invasion. However, they have a chance in the movie to redeem themselves when they capture the Nazi airmen who hostage the congregation of the church. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful final, especially since Mainwaring had been able to prove itself to the general. , given a last chance to take shape. A good movie, full of good replicas and laughter, that's another movie for the DVD closet - I'm glad the BBC is repeating it - and that day, the 2.8.08, they were rightly the "Night of the army". Do not miss!
