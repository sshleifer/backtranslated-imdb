It's one of my favorite comic films. Chris Farley is hilarious as an idiotic prankster and David Spade is perfect for playing honest with Farley. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between them is brilliant. The scene where they are both in the car singing for The Carpenters' The Superstar is a classic. <br /> <br /> Chris Farley was a great comic actor who had incredible potential - he will be missed a lot. /> <br />
