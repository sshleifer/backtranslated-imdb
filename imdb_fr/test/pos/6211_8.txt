When I first saw Colleen Moore, it was in the great silent movie series called "Hollywood." She was there in 1980, her hair was provocatively styled as in the 1920s, a sparkling, witty and charismatic old lady - the very definition of "presence". Then I watched her fabulous dumb comedy perform in films like "Ella Cinders" and "Orchids and Ermine". Then the disappointing talker "The scarlet letter". And now, she's in "Power and Glory," performing a breathtakingly powerful show and working skilfully alongside Spencer Tracy, one of the biggest actors in talking movies. <br /> <br /> I found the film a bit glossy. history, but Moore and Tracy give such brilliant performances that the story does not seem to matter. Both actors age during the film, from youth to old age, mainly acting alone with a minimum of makeup and hair changes. Moore is almost unrecognizable as an elderly wife and the scene where she discovers that her husband sees a younger woman is one of the most beautifully performed scenes I've ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, that's where her silent actress experience gives her the edge, even on Tracy. Compare that to her delightful comic who plays in another silent sequence when she is young and Tracy has trouble offering him. Amazing! This film reveals more than anything else, it is shameful that Hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through her fingers and spend most of her life in retirement.
