It's one of the most anti-traditional war films about what I've seen. Instead of the typical movies that insist on glory and perhaps superhuman characters (like John Wayne), this film is the exact opposite: it focuses on the dehumanization that ALSO occurs in war. The story is about the Japanese who are stranded in the Philippines after the US returns in late 1944-early 1945. By the time the movie starts, the Japanese have been clearly beaten, but because of Bushido's crazy logic, they do not can afford to consider giving up. At one of the most poignant moments, the main character is informed at the beginning of the film to go to the hospital, because he is not able to fight because of his tuberculosis. The problem is that the hospital will not accept him, so his commander tells him to go to the hospital again. If he does not accept it, he should blow himself up with a grenade! Well, it only happens in the first five minutes of the movie - much worse for this soldier and the few late comers, because they will not surrender. In addition, there is a case in the film where a soldier tries to surrender but is shot. This happened much later in the war because the Japanese soldiers who surrendered often trapped themselves to explode when they approached. In addition, the film shows the most vivid depiction of the famine and the madness that accompanies it from all the movies I've seen. Moreover, cannibalism, cowardice and treason all accompany this very realistic, realistic and depressing film. You simply could not have made a better movie of this type. Horrible but great.
