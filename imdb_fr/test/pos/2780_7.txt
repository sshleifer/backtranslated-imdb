I anticipate that many students are now registering for a student exchange in Barcelona and that they are disappointed not to live such an exciting time. <br /> <br /> The film was nice. It is of course always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou. <br /> <br /> However, part of the film poses a big problem for me. The lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women like to be physically dominated (which bothers me) and shows him a kind of catchy gesture that guarantees a woman. Xavier then tries the butt on a shy married friend - who starts by saying "no no" "I'm married, I'm married" but somehow succumbs to the asshole? Suddenly, she moaned "yes yes" and they let themselves go on the park Guell benches. I found this really very offensive. In addition, he is very stereotyped. How many times have we seen scenes where the woman says "no" but obviously does not want to say it? No means no. Seizing the butts / physical domination will not solve the problem. This totally supported stereotypical myths about rape. <br /> <br /> I did not even know how to read the following scene where he jubilant to the lesbian to explain how it worked and how he would require next time "suck, bitch" (or something like that) . Did he really think that engaging with a woman who did not respect her feelings was the answer? <br /> <br /> This section really ruined the movie for me.
