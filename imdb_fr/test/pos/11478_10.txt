"Sorte Nula" is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004, despite its extremely reduced budget. And I must say that it is a well deserved success. What I like most about "Sorte Nula" is the complex details that Fernando Fragata followed to interest you in what's going on and what's going to happen next. He is very detailed and superbly advanced for a seemingly simple thriller of love story. What is even more amusing and ironic about this is the fact that the characters are in the same situation. None of them know the whole story and are left to their own assumptions, which gives "Sorte Nula" a head start. This is definitely not a movie you want to go out for a break in the bathroom because you will definitely miss something important. I think one of the major attributes of the film should be the environment it creates. It's scary but hilarious at the same time. I read somewhere someone quoting this movie saying, "... it was like watching Hitchcock ..." and I totally agree! I love movies like this, where you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING to understand what's going on. 9/10
