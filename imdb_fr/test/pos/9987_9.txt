The biggest game ever played (TGGEP, 2005) is an incredibly uplifting, contagious and contagious film that never (really) gets into sap or heaviness. Yes, it takes many freedoms, as most Hollywood movies do, but these freedoms are forgiven because they add to the fun of the movie and do not hurt it. In fact, there are many moments of truth. You can really say it's a "Rocky" movie since the beginning of the movie, but who cares? Directed by none other than Bill Paxton (I know, is not it ?!), He is cleverly crafted and immensely observable! TGGEP tells the story of Francis Ouimet (played with confidence, courage and class by future superstar Shia LaBeouf), an amateur golfer from an Irish-French immigrant family living in Brookline, MA, in the early 1900s. qualifies to play at the 1913 US Open. The legendary Harry Vardon (with class, dignity and ferocity by Stephen Dillane) is one of his competitors. Ironically, Vardon is the 2nd outsider of this movie! The film begins in the 1870s in Scotland, where property developers tell the young man they are building a golf course at home and that golf is a game that is not for those who are like him. Francis suffers some of the same prejudices as a boy in Brookline in the early 1900s. The stories come together at the 1913 Open. <br /> <br /> What's ironic is that even as a Adult and multiple major champion, Vardon is still excluded from British society because of his education. Francis learned a lot about golf by reading Vardon's books on the subject, and Vardon is his idol. Unbeknownst to Vardon, they met in 1900 in Boston after Vardon, who won the Open this year, was shooting while Francis was only seven years old. <br /> <br /> In addition to Francis and Vardon, participants in the 1913 Open include British friend and champion Vedon, Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus) and John McDermott (Michael Weaver), two-time defending champion and classless. The film really shows the different personalities of these men. <br /> <br /> Redhead Marnie McPhail is incredibly serene and dazzling as Irish mother and veteran Elias Koteas of Francis gives a stern, reserved and taciturn performance like her French father. In addition, the brave young boy Josh Flitter (as Eddie, 10-year-old at Francis's) almost flies the procedure on his own. <br /> <br /> Paxton adds many modern details, such as special effects zooming-in shots to show players and CGI positioning on the dashboard for a large number of golf plans in order to maintain the film is exciting and at a steady pace, so as not to transform the film into a period piece. But the film always convinces us of a specific place and time. <br /> <br /> What's interesting is that even though Rocky-like, everything is based on a true story! So, the end is satisfactory on many levels. An entertaining film about golf that takes place in the early 1900s ... Wow!
