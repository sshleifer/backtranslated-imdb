Okay - it was in black and white and probably on 2 "tape - which means the BBC wiped it, did not it? But I still have in mind all these years ( 1960?) Like a slice of perfect story animated by the most innovative editing and wonderful actors full of youth and bravado. <br /> <br /> I want to see it again! Read this, BBC? Find your tapes original 2 "or 35mm film, deal with actors and directors for rights, and re-release! I know, I know, some of them are dead, others are missing. <br /> <br /> Where can I see Mary Morris as "the heart of the snake wrapped in tiger skin"? Where else can I see Paul Daneman doing "Winter now is discontent ..."? Or does Robert Hardy pronounce his speech on "the ceremony of this idol"?
