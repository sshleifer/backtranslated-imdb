Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about knowing how to survive in a hostile extraterrestrial world against even more hostile enemies. The task becomes even more difficult when the closest enemies are within your own surviving group. <br /> <br /> The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has already been seen several times in different variants. But what makes this film shine above the others is its well-written characters. <br /> <br /> The group is made up of very different people with little more interest than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot who has trouble with his own conscience; Johns, a bounty hunter; Imam, a holy man confronted with the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not just himself. The characters begin to live in the movie. They are not just paper as in many other films of this kind. You start to worry about the characters, especially Riddick, although that sounds pretty strange. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this film, the line of demarcation between black and black is very fine. All characters are familiar with both. <br /> <br /> Another thing that works in this movie is the casting. The actors rarely match their roles as well. Radha Mitchell is adapted for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelty and responsibility to Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does a good job as Riddick. In his hands, Riddick is a pretty scary character, certainly very dangerous and profound, as he is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> How do you survive Pitch Black? Keep your close friends and your enemies even closer.
