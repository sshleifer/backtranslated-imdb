Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice among all the actresses of today's movie if I had to choose one to fail on a deserted island. <br /> <br /> I could just look at her, for example, sitting on a chair for a few hours. It is difficult for me to be completely objective in relation to one of his films. <br /> <br /> However, I really liked this movie and its story, in itself, more than what is indicated by the average ranking people who have already commented on this site. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford is not one of the actors, however, but I appreciate his performance the most. But it is one of the few that has reached the level of passage of 7 to 8 figures per film, so who should I claim? <br /> <br /> Although Ford is often funny in his style, he sometimes seems to have a serious need for an antacid and a dose of caffeine - "Random Hearts" is part of this group. <br /> <br /> His obsession with investigating the losses that he and Thomas have suffered in regards to their joint ties, is understandable, given his detective profession - but not at the level presented here. Although not far off, he crossed the line in the "boring" category. <br /> <br /> However, most of the scenes that followed his involvement with Thomas were interesting and well played. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a 9 *, but I would not be as good Two or three levels, based on the overall performance of Ford, and another, because it contained a few more elements of subplot superfluous as it seemed necessary.
