Veterans of the Second World War are returning home and have trouble adjusting to civilian life. This superb drama is expertly directed by Wyler and beautifully filmed by the famous filmmaker Toland. Despite its length of almost three hours, it does not drag a minute. Sherwood's screenplay features very human characters and an excellent dialogue. Andrews may have his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Wright is also a good-looking young woman, Mayo, Andrews's wife on the trampy, and the old veteran Russell, a man who has lost both his hands. However, the honors go to March and Loy as a long-time married couple, facing challenges while being revived.
