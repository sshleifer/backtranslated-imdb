I remember seeing this film in the late teens or early twenties on TV - probably HBO. I watched it with my parents, a brother and some friends. Since it was about 30 years ago, I do not remember much of history. I remember that the entire group of viewers agreed that it was the funniest movie we have ever seen. When it was over, our belly hurt us with laughter. My father worked in a hospital, so it was all the better. <br /> <br /> Every time I see The Party in the TV channels, I watch if this one is there too. To my dismay, it never is. Although I liked The Party, I think this one is funnier. Peter Sellers has been great as a dishonest hospital administrator. Why it was never broadcast on video is a mystery to me. It's a classic, but it seems that no one under 35 or 40 has been allowed to see it. I would buy it in a second if they ever came out on DVD.
