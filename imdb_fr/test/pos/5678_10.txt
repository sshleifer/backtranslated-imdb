I went out with my friends and saw this movie last weekend in London. We did not know what to expect, the poster gave some of it, and I will not say more about it to avoid spoiling the plot, but we found it to be an excellent movie with an excellent rendition, a compelling and scary intrigue like hell! After doing some research on the making of the film, I have to hand it to these guys, filmmakers, actors, screenwriters, etc., to have concocted such a film with such limited resources. Post-production is also very well done. Nevertheless, I give them a 10 out of 10 and I hope they will continue their excellent work. Keep it up, guys. You rock!
