"House of Dracula" is a good continuation of "House of Frankenstein". There is not as much action but the acting is just as good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent doctor who turns out badly after transferring blood from Dracula (Dracula was receiving the transfusion to defeat his "affliction" but he casts a spell on a hunchbacked nurse and then transfuses his blood to the doctor. ). It turns out that Dracula did not really come for treatment, but instead drained the blood of a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed and the werewolf is next for a healing treatment (successful). Meanwhile, Frankenstein's monster is discovered and briefly resuscitated before being burnt to death (do not worry, the same trio came back in "Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein"). John Carradine plays again a sinister Dracula (Baron Latos is his alias at the beginning of the film and in "House of Frankenstein"). Lon Chaney is the friendly Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as Frankenstein's monster. Lionel Atwill plays an inspector again, which he often does in Universal Studios monster movies. A guardian for your collection.
