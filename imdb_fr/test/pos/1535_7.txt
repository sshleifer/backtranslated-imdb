This two-character drama is extremely well played and contains a valid message as well as really shocking moments (shocking not because they are graphic, but because you are not prepared to receive them when they come). But it ends up becoming oppressive, just like it did a little similar "A pure formality". Alan Rickman should have been nominated for the Oscars for his multidimensional performance, that's for sure. (** 1/2)
