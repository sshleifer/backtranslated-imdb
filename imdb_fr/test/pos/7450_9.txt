Yes, I am a fan of FF7, but how many people who will watch this movie will NOT? And so, I review this film from the point of view of FF7 fans, and without regret. (I would not know how to properly edit the movie for someone who did not play the FF7 game.) <br /> <br /> Visuals - 10/10 I loved the children of Advent. It's a sensory delight - a complete audio-video overload. The visuals were breathtaking: some exploits were accomplished that I just would not have thought possible with an animated feature film. When the scenes of action occurred, it was, for want of a more precise word, a roller coaster. With spectacular camera movements that range from one range to another, ball effects perfectly integrated at crucial moments, down to the level of detail, it's hard to say. The animation has a big budget, the style and the images are impressive, and the effects sometimes made me forget that I was watching animation rather than live images. I could walk around for hours telling myself about the fantastic quality of the visual effects, but that would not do me any justice at all. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 The sound was fabulous. The voices of all the characters did not disappoint (no one looked silly) and the sound effects were audacious and accurate. The music - the game that (in my opinion) had the best soundtrack of the game, was beautifully transferred to the movie. Most memorable themes in the game are present in the film, although they often use different instruments to better adapt to what is happening. From time to time there was more daring music and some thrash metal on the very intense action scenes, but everything matched perfectly with the situation of the film at that time. <br /> <br /> Story - 7/10 The story and characters would be the main flaws of the film. Both aspects were just not up to the game - but again, the game could spend more than 40 hours developing these points - the movie only lasts about 90 minutes. As for the story, the plot was not bad or anything else, but not as ambitious as expected by someone who played the game thoroughly. In reality, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and story progression / development, that the film never really had the opportunity to compete in the same league. Instead, the film took the most sensible approach - developing the action and trying to place as many jokes and inner themes in itself instead of trying to recreate in an impossible way the factor of massive history , which was originally such a driving force in the game. The lack of use of Materia also caused me controversy - the story of the film chose to use little (though not ZERO) Materia, and instead many supernatural combat skills and abilities. I hope that if a sequel is created, Materia will be much more extravagant and important in the film. There were also a lot of holes in the plot in the movie - all of this can be forgiven if you think of Advent Children as a random anime, but you seem ridiculous to see how much it's based on a game that runs extremely well the plot. <br /> <Characters - 7/10 The characters, although all present in one form or another, do not necessarily shine to their true potential. There is simply not enough cinema time to spend with everyone. And so, all their background stories and abilities are not fully presented, and in some cases, almost not (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no lasting impression). Even Cloud, who is the focal point of the movie, I feel he does not use enough of his familiar abilities of the game. The question of materials is a strong reason for that. That said, it's a pleasure to see the actors come back into action, even if their role is such that they do not use them fully. However, the new characters are the ones who caused the most conflict - the trio Bad Guy and the kid Denzel - there was a big lack of explanation about them. Anyone wishing to be imaginative can probably add something reasonable and put an end to the whites, but objectively the question has yet to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> Value - 10/10 The playback quality of this film is excellent. Personally, I want to see it again bigger and stronger - Bigger screen, higher volume. <br /> <br /> Enjoyment - 10/10 Whatever the flaws of In the movie, they just were not important enough for me to enjoy, and I think that will be the case for the most people. I really enjoyed Advent Children and I encourage other FF7 fans to see him.
