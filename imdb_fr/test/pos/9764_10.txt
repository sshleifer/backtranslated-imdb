This film is a sleep - I watched all the miniseries that have been on television, sometimes, and this one is the best. Wonderfully cast, superbly played, and the characters are well developed. Helen Morse is perfect for Jean Paget - strident, in control, treble, and a little warlike. It bounces well on Joe Harmon, the cowboy / taciturn / kind "it's going to go". I was sorry the film did not fit the book, in that there was no romantic interest between Noel Struan and Jean Paget. For those who do not know it, this is taken from a true story of English women walked in Malaysia for 3 years by the Japanese, who really did not know what to do with it. Very few of them survived. Neville Shute spoke to one of them, and that's her story. This film deserves to be in the collection of all those who love the stories of the second world war.
