Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a charming, funny and brilliant movie that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and children alike. I think it's my favorite childhood movie because it combines great characters, a beautiful story and a great spirit that is irresistible. The plot involves Kermit the frog (interpreted and expressed by Henson) in his odyssey across America to realize his dream in Hollywood. On the way, he meets Fozzie Bear, Grand Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and DR. Teeth and electric chaos. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many good things that I can not even say. But it's memorable and every time I think of a puppet or a muppet, I will think about this film. Look for Mel Brooks, Dom DeLouise, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles. Excellent and spectacular, one of the best movies of the 70s. A ++
