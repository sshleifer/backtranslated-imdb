"Big Fat Liar" is a welcome - superficial, but welcome - a breath of fresh air after too many bathroom movies, bodily fluids, acidic pets, gas jokes and fork pranks . After all, "See Spot Run", "Max Keeble's Big Move" and "Snow Dogs" had reported the degenerative spiral of Kiddie's filming. The worst is the realization that the younger audience will later be satiated by the simpler offers of "Not Another Teen Film" and "Slackers". Written by Nickelodeon producers Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who co-starred in the 80s sitcom "Head of the Class"), the film stars Frankie Muniz as Jason, who is always ready to leave to fall the errors. (Where is the English newspaper? Dad chokes on a Swedish meatball.) Her teacher (Sandra Oh) issues an ultimatum: present the paper by the end of the day or attend summer school. Jason tells a story titled "Big Fat Liar" and is hit on the way to school by a limousine carrying Hollywood's insensitive producer, Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf gives him a ride, but Jason leaves his diary behind him. No one will hear the truth this time and Dad will tell him that he has lost his trust. <br /> <br /> A few months later, Jason and his best friend, Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) see a preview of the movie "Big Fat Liar" and head to Los Angeles to wreak havoc on Wolf's life - all this to obtain a confession that he stole Jason's paper to make the film. They even get the sympathy of some mistreated Wolf employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), his former driver (Donald Faison), his movie star (Jaleel "Urkel" White, himself playing) and his stunt coordinator (a Lee Majors very old). . <br /> <br /> Because "Big Fat Liar" does not have the same advantage as his "Malcolm in the Middle" sitcom, Muniz is easy to understand, but does not have much to do with it. The same goes for Bynes, who directs his own sketch show at Tracey Ullman on Nickelodeon. All assets are conferred to Giamatti, whose projecting eyes and cheeks jostle each mocking insult. <br /> <br /> The film takes snapshots just by trying the high road, and should appeal to its target audience (especially since high jinks occur on the Universal Studios lot). But here's a puzzle: the message is that it's worth telling the truth. But did not we see Jason come to his vengeance by telling white lies throughout the movie? At least there is no shit.
