It seems that some previous critics had expectations a bit too high for this film. I found it by sweeping the satellite channels for something (not knowing what) and fell on it. I thought in the title that it was perhaps one of the many soft-core porn movies that appeared regularly on movie channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Even if there was some male frontal nudity (in fact, more than your typical soft core title - will understand!), It was not the purpose of the film. It was just fun. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by my tastes: my last screenings included Before Night Falls and Europa, Europa (both great, IMHO). But I also appreciate the total mental stop when I watch a movie. Virtual sexuality did that for me and it's not a bad thing!
