Hello. To read the entire plot around "OZ", just watch IMDb here to find it. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW! ** Oz is a series that not only moved me, but also shows a little bit. As far as the US prison system is concerned, but I have to say (judging by the chain discovery program in prison), it's not really realistic. <br /> <br /> Even though I have to say it, there is no shyness, rape, shanking (stabbed) happens allot. Still, it's still television, so for you, who thinks that is wrong, there's a good deal of violence, and scenes here and there excessive (plot, conspiracy after plot). it can get pretty boring. But remember that the series is almost old now. So the times are changing and I think I should judge that in the allotted time. <br /> <br /> As the season went on until season 5, it was pretty good! Until one of the disadvantages wins a $ 2 million lottery ticket, because he spoke to God, it seemed like "ok, it's going to go to the point, I do not want to see this anymore." series ", I still proceeded! And now, I've just seen Episode 3 of Season 6. This is where the cereals lose their brain, then their "mother" holds it back, while they drool. Then you see O Reilly crying also seeing his brother like that (RL BROTHERS also) Now it's by far the best scene of the whole series "OZ", it was real for me! Do not always read that I'm trying to plant and burn it. It's a very good series! And even in 2010, it's worth a look! I give him a 7 because of the scenario that weakens with the season. But still a golden glove.
