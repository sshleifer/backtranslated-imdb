Fame was published in the United States a year before my birth; I was too young to remember the original version of Fame - and yet I heard and read many things about it. As for example the fact that it has generated a television series and that his soundtrack was directed by Irene Cara, the success of Giogio Moroder, "Fame". <br /> <br /> Fame is probably the first of its kind to present and present the world of the performing arts in the form of a feature film. The lives, struggles, obstacles that students and some teachers themselves have experienced were under the gaze of viewers. <br /> <br /> The performances were great, but Gene Anthony Ray particularly caught my eye. , who played the difficult but promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and initially rude, his character became less angry, more frustrated and more engaged in his studies - not only with the practical aspects of the game but also the theoretical field. Irene Cara was good at the Coco scene with her cleavage while a pervy director filming her was rather uncomfortable to watch, as was Paul McCrane for his incredible portrait of a vulnerable but hidden homosexual who was trying to cope with life. enrolled in a school of performing arts in New York after being fired from the military when he told them he was gay. Ralph played by Barry Miller was interesting, but sometimes his character hurt my nerves. <br /> <br /> The choreography was excellent, there were good dance numbers involved and the "hot lunch" scene in the cafeteria was worth watching. Another great scene was the song "Fame" that was played and all the kids started rushing into the streets of New York and dancing wildly and carelessly around the world. It was a unique street festival of its kind. <br /> <br /> Debbie Allen is the only star to have really benefited in the long run. She went on to become a producer, director and star, even though she worked mostly behind the scenes of shows like Everybody Hates Chris and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Paul McCrane then played alongside Peter Weller in the film "Robocop", in which he played a villain and ER in the role of Dr. Romano, a hateful and heinous judge. <br /> <br /> The British director Alan Parker filmed this film very well - it allowed the performers to dance, act, sing at will without interfering with their styles. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we see the different stages encountered by the students during their film. years, from their first-year auditions to graduation at the High School For The Arts in New York. <br /> <br /> Fame is one of those movies that is aimed at a particular audience that I'm not necessarily a passionate consumer film community - it's certainly not for everyone. <br /> <br /> For my part, I appreciated this because I have an interest in the arts - and not technically in terms of interpreting, not as someone but as someone who knows that creativity and artistic expression can be canceled by hard work, commitment and passion for what we do with their talents. Therefore, if you are an aspiring dancer, an actor or just a creator, you might be interested in a film like this, even though the Fame events really resemble those of a college / university of arts. the scene. Life, so that's a completely different question. <br /> <br /> The 2009 remake of this movie was released recently and frankly, it is practically pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> As for the original celebrity, almost 30 years later, it's a bit out of date, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic, but as a cult classic of the 80s, in line with other hit movies of the 80s dance, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame strikes 'in law. Is not it a coincidence that all these dance films start with the letter "F"? <br /> <br /> Gritty, moving and intriguing, this one is worth the detour.
