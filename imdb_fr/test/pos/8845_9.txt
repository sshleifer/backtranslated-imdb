This being my first film of John Carpenter, I must say that I was very impressed by The Thing. From the beginning, the film attracts you and never releases tension. The special effects and models of the film stand up well even today. Aside from Kurt Russell, I did not know any of the cast members, but they were all exceptional in fear, paranoia, and desperation to survive. The Universal DVD contains a lot of interesting extras behind the scenes. Highly recommended, 9/10.
