The plankton comments had to be written on Topsy-Turvy's day, because everything stated by this simple life form is the opposite of the truth! <br /> <br /> 'The eighth wife of Bluebeard' is hilarious in every scene, anyway - The chemistry between Colbert and Cooper could not have been finer ... The secondary distribution is superb. <br /> <br /> The writing and the realization are magnificent !!! <br /> <br /> Like so many other comments on this chart, I lament again: "Why can not movies be like that?" <br /> <br /> This is the classic 1930s Paramount comedy, at its best!
