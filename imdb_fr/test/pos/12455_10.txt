Look at him with an open mind, he is very different, nothing is unhealthy about it. Very well done realistic tale of Tarzan. The animatronic chimpazés are well made for 1984, Christopher Lambert brilliantly imitated the language and the behavior of chimpazés. I would not be surprised if he took lessons from Jane Goodall.
