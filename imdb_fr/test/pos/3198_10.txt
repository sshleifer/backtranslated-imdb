I understood this as part of the Black Cartoon package at Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was just brilliant; the saving grace of what was another forgettable sage of simply a bad grouping of films. <br /> <br /> A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with a simple but excellent animation, it's simply a cat story chasing the moon. Funny, charming and touching. A little paradise for cat lovers, romantics and anyone who appreciates the beauty of simplicity. If it's in your city, see it. This short is worth the price of admission.
