Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in this crime story. Its sex appeal, its many assets and its sexy southern accent make this film redifferable. But the film has so many "other" things that make it a modern classic. Simon Baker's performance for one thing. Really that of a great actor. Til Schweiger is so perfectly molded that I wonder why he is not a huge crossover star. Gil Bellows completes this crew and literally steals this show. The other Gugino cleavages easily represent the best performance of the film. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so brilliant ... I can not even describe it. Great chemistry. <br /> <br /> The music is so powerfully eclectic that it's a character in itself. Wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> People can say that it's influenced by Tarantino ... I do not agree. It is clearly unique and intelligent in itself. Sebastian Gutierrez does a great job in making this film very tight and minimizing many scenes that have left me shaken. The end is perfectly sinister and you will never see it coming. In short, it's a beautiful film that, for me, is the very definition of what a good movie should be.
