From 1950, a thriller about a couple who smuggle diamonds from abroad and the contagious disease, smallpox. Evelyn Keyes is an essential victim of this film noir. Back in the United States, she does not realize that she could spread the disease to everyone and everything she comes into contact with. Finally, she is prosecuted and must be arrested before the occurrence of an epidemic. In addition to the remarkable performances of Keyes, the villains Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell lend their support. The finale is a humdinger with Miss Keyes on the edge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below. A good B movie!
