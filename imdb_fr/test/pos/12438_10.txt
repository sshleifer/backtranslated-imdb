After a long tour of the West End, this charming film transforms Margaret Rutherford into "Miss Whitchurch" as part of this financially successful adaptation of 1950. <br /> <br /> All shots were shot in studios Riverside in Hammersmith, London. The outdoor scenes were filmed at a public girls' school near Liss in Hampshire. During the twelve weeks of filming, Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell stayed at a nearby hotel and often went to school the night they were having fun in the company of the real school mistresses. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the film contains only two original lines of the original piece. The protagonists and supporting actors are in great shape and you can only feel sympathy for their situation, especially in the final scenes.
