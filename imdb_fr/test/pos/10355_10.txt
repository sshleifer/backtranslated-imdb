This film revolves around an Arab leader (Amir) who dies and wants to live. So, a Dr. Lloyd Trenton is paid to transplant the Amirs brain into a "willing" participant. But in the basement of doctors, his dwarf assistant, Dorro (Angelo Rossitto) drains the blood of young girls for medical purposes. Meanwhile, Dr. Llyod pays a man to kill the people who helped Amir in the country (Reed Hadley, Grant Williams and various unknown bodyguards.). Grant is the only survivor when his car breaks down on the road. Meanwhile, the doctors, the assistant Gor, are sent to look for a body for Amir and hurt him so much that Dr. Llyod can not operate. Meanwhile, Grant finds the "girlfriend" Amirs Regina Carrol and tells him her story. Grant sees the man who chased him off the road and Dorro kills him. Then, since Gor failed to get a body, D.r Llyod places Amir's brain in Gors's disfigured body. Then Grant and Regina go to the medical laboratory <br /> <br /> ------------------------ SPOILERS ------- ------------------ Discover his secret. Soon Amir (Gor) prays to kill people and in the confusion of what I think is the plot. Dr. Llyod has a brain rifle that hurts Amir to command. It turns out that Mr. Lloyd is looking for a country in which all scientists can work without law. So Regina dies. and in the end, Amir's new body (I think) says it will be a new country, blah blah. <br /> <br /> I still do not have the end, but all in all, it was a very pleasant piece of very fragrant cheese. This film presents Grant Williams in his penultimate roll of film. I recommend it to all fans of Al Adamson or those who love Brains.
