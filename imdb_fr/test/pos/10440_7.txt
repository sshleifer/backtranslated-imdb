The reality before reality TV? Copy of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High"? A precursor of "Say Anything" which is more serious? I can not decide, but the soundtrack * is * the 80s - Blondie, Journey, REO Speedwagon, Devo, Lionel Richie AND U2 - I can not believe it, they would never throw all these genres together in a teenager movie today. <br /> <br /> I remembered this as a teenager - mostly the sexual parts and not a hint of altruism. Why? I was an excited teenager in the 80's. When I saw her again, I just can not describe how much I like this piece of Rose, played by Kimberly Richardson, turns out to be the voice of "Pepper Ann" in the 90's and she was almost 30 when she was in Last American Virgin, playing alongside 16 - fantastic! Complete cheese, reality, fantasy and comedy - with a sincere cherry at the top.
