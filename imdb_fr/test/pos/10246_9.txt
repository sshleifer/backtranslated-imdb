A jewel of Japan, where many of the best films in the world have been shot. Stylistically, it's not something so special. It's just a simple drama (with some comic nuances) about recognizable people who live their lives. Yuko Tanaka, best known for playing Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays in a 50-year-old girl. She is proud of her health and spends a vigorous workout each morning as she distributes milk up and down Nagasaki's steep hills. After completing this part-time job, she took up her usual job as a grocery clerk (called S-Mart, which made this Dark Army fan laugh). Along his milk road lives a 50-year-old man, whose wife is dying. It turns out that the milky and the man, a child services worker, came out of high school and they apparently still have a crush on each other. The film actually has some major narrative issues. When the writer really wants the two lovers not shared unite, he uses a pretty incredible technique, that of deus ex machina. The culminating sequence is also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and attentive to the two main characters, as well as many secondary characters. The film also includes several secondary intrigues that seem to weigh down the film, without ever doing it. I think the best thing in the film is Tanaka's heartbreaking performance as a lonely milky, who has resigned herself to being alone all her life. Whatever the problems, the film transcends them for the most part.
