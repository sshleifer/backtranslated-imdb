<br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful piece HOMEFRONT and makes it an engaging movie. <br /> <br /> THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast, all deeply rooted in their characters. The role here is TOP NOTCH! <br /> <br /> We must also thank the director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between the past and the present were ultra-soft. The sound effects during the fight scenes were scary and actually added to the tension. <br /> <br /> Remove all Vietnamese elements from the story, and there would remain interesting characters struggling with the evil full range of family dynamics. (A viewer can see this point more clearly, keeping in mind the "Discover the Old Picture" scene from the beginning while the rest of the movie is watched.) <br /> <br /> As a movie I found THE WAR AT HOME to be more direct and to the point than born on July 4th. A great effort - almost a 10. <br /> <br />
