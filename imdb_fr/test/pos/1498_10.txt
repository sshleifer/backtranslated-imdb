Returning to these "good old days" of 1971, we can vividly recall being treated with a whole season of Charles Chaplin at the movies. That's what the caller called when we saw him at someone's old talk show. (We can not remember who it was: MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, either!) The guest spoke about Sir Charles's career and the fact that his films were out of circulation since the exclusion of the former 'Little Tramp' of Los Estados Unidos in 1952 on the grounds that he was an "undesirable alien" (no Schultz, he is NOT from another planet!) <br /> < CHARLIE was considered a "subversive" because of his interest and his open inquiry into various political and economic systems: from the anarchist movement of the 1920s to the present day, the craze for technocracy against socialism in its different forms was a fair game for discussion at Chaplin nights in Hollywood, inclusion of the Soviet style, which we commonly call communism. <br /> <br /> UNDERSTANDING The difficult situation of Mr. Chaplin was confused by a small detail: he had never become a citizen american. <br /> <br /> ANYWOW, enough of this bottom already! <br /> <br /> SUFFICE to say that he had become "Persona Non Gratis" in the United States of America. It was high time to take the old movies out of the moth balls and return them to cinemas. It would certainly be a great gesture on our part, easily forgiving and quickly forgetting the Americans. <br /> <br /> It's a nice gesture for the great filmmaker; In addition, the Academy of Arts and Sciences of Cinema was planning to give Chaplin a special tribute to the 1972 Oscar Show. This would surely be a popular and joyful packaging of pathos, enough reason for America to invite Charlie. to come back and come and receive a special Academy Lifetime Achievement Award, in front of a world television audience numbered in the Millions. <br /> <br /> In addition, it would be a natural way to promote the Chaplin season at the theater! (Remember that the little vagabond was as clever as a man of dollars as a filmmaker!) The show consisted of projections of MODERN TIMES, LIGHTS OF THE CITY, THE GREAT DICTATOR, MONSTER VERDOUX, A KING TO NEW YORK and finally THE CHAPLIN REVIEW. We remember being very excited about the anticipation of the multi-date film festival. <br /> <br /> In our beautiful city of Chicago, he was booked for the Carnegie Theater on Rush Street. The festivities begin with MODERN MODES and all the others will be shown one by one, each staying for the period necessary to satisfy the public's desire to see each image. If we remember well, the latest program was THE CHAPLIN REVUE. <br /> <br /> RETROSPECT, we look back and wish that they started the race with REVUE; as there were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers (a bit like us) who knew very little about his films, with the exception of Keystone, Essanay and Mutual Silent Shorts, which were regularly featured in many Kiddy shows all over the world. country. Oh well, again, no one has consulted me! <br /> <br /> CONCENTRATING today's guest film, THE CHAPLIN REVUE, we discovered that it was actually three separate images; carefully linked through the use of Chaplin's narrative (Himself), living themes, and fortuitous music (again written by Chaplin) and some cheerful discourses and serious narration (Idem of Chaplin.) He opens the procedure by using some "home movie" films describing the construction of the Chaplin studio in Hollywood, as well as some films shot repeatedly, showing the director Chaplin showing what he wanted to a group of actors. <br /> <br /> This segment has been well done and well received by the public. The humor of the building and the repetition have been amplified giving them the appearance of being accelerated. (Repetition naturally, the building speeding up the photographic process of the camera.) The old tower seems to show that buildings were built almost on their own. <br /> <br /> This amalgam of short films incorporated three of Chaplin's short comedies from his time at First National Pictures, approximately between 1917 and 1923. The choice was well thought out and gave us a great variety of subjects and moods. <br /> <br /> The first place was ARMS D'EPOLELE (Charles Chaplin Productions / First National Pictures, 1918), as the title suggests, it is a tale from the First World War, published in October 1918, about a month away from the Armistice Day, November 11 it was a comedy comedy a love story between the soldier Chaplin and a French girl (Miss Edna Purviance) .The lightness is fast, physical and rebels from the great tradition of ridiculing the enemy, the army all EXHIBITING an excellent example of the old adage about children and dogs bringing people together, the upcoming film DOG OF LIFE (Chaplin Productions / First National, 1918) traces the parallel lives of Chaplin's Tramp and a new adopted wanderer, Scraps. The story of the film involves families, two of them. A Homo Sapiens, a Canine and both bringing us big surprises. <br /> <br /> In the final, we have THE PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923) was a good choice for the final. It was bright, light and tight. It was an excursion in the Western Spoof area, comedies of this type having been performed since by each actor and each team. The "pilgrim" in history is not part of your standard Thanksgiving variety; but rather a "guy" or "Tenderfoot", who ventured into the West. The tramp is not just that guy; but his character is an escaped convict who is wrongly considered as the new clergyman of a church in a western city! <br /> <br /> OUR evaluation (that is, Schultz and me) is ****. (It's Four Derbies) <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
