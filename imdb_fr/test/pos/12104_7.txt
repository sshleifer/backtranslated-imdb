Akin's award-winning 2004 film, Head-On / Gegen die Wand, depicts the chaotic and seductive world of a self-destructive but dynamic German-Turkish rocker named Cahit (Birol Ünel). This documentary is an offshoot of Head-On and explores the range of music that we could find in Istanbul today if we were as energetic and curious as the German avant-rock musician Alexander Hacke of the group Einstuerzende Neubauten (who arranged for the music of Head-On) and benefited from the help of a film crew and Turkish-speaking director Akin. You'll find everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classical song, rock, Kurdish music and Turkish pop. It is a world as chaotic and open as that of Cahit, a world where East is and East and West but where the two meet. <br /> <br /> Like Istanbul, which lies at the edge of Europe and Asia and brings the two worlds together while remaining sui generis, it's a mix of Turkish pop, traditional Turkish songs, Kurdish lamentations, of Roma jazz musicians and a group of street craftsmen (Siyasiyabend), lively and offbeat scenes of street life, and some speak in front of the camera of the synthesis and the personal and musical history of singers and musicians . Working at the Grand Hotel in London's Beyoglu district, where Cahit remained at the end of Head-On while searching for his beloved, Hacke criss-crosses the city with his team and equipment interviewing people and recording their music. <br /> <br /> It starts with a little rock with the group "neo-psychedelic" Baba Zula ?? They are musicians with whom he joined by assembling the score of Head-On. He's here for the absent bassist - and for Turkish rappers (including brave women)? Thus, some old men leave the theater early and miss the mainly melodic and easy-to-listen sounds that make up most of the film. (The narrative excesses of Head-On have been tempered periodically by musical interludes performed by a traditional Turkish orchestra seated outside the Bosphorus.) Hacke gives us the opportunity to meet and hear some of The most famous Turkish singers alive, including Müzeyyen Senar, a lady in the late 80s whose aging and elegant musicians recalls how the great Egyptian singer Umm Kulsoum used to perform. Hacke asks Orhan Gencebay, movie star and composer, to make a striking solo on the oud on which he wrote all his songs and persuades the now elusive big Sezen Aksu. to make a special performance of one of her most famous songs, "Istanbul Memory." It's a hit, as is the lament of the beautiful Kurdish singer Aynar recorded in a bath whose acoustics are spectacular, if only they could have lowered the heat ?? The faces of the singer and the musician are dripping with sweat. There is also a young Canadian, Brenna MacCrimmon, who speaks fluent Turkish, sings traditional Turkish folk songs with expression and fervor. The sound mix is ​​of high quality. We would like to see a sequel; many great examples of popular and classical Turkish music have necessarily been left out. <br /> <br /> Film released in summer 2005 and shown in festivals in 2005 and 2006. Opened at the Angelika Film Center in New York on June 9, 2006.
