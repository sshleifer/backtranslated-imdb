It must be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family leaving everything behind to live in nature. When mom and dad both lose their jobs, not to mention the green mud in their bathtub. They decide that it is in their family's best interest to move to Oregon. Once everything goes wrong. An interesting cast of characters compliments this movie. Including a young Molly Ringwald, I would definitely recommend this movie.
