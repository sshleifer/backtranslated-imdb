Attending this film was an excuse to escape the work I had to do during my classes, but it was one of my best experiences here in France. The film allows to quickly create multidimensional characters and presents a perfectly smooth scenario. The characters really had the voices you expected while reading the illustrated novels and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations. The music was catchy and the comedy pleasant and light, almost a tiny inclusion of modern elements in playful ways. The film was captivating, cute and action packed at the same time. A wonderful story spun with expertise. I will show it to my French students.
