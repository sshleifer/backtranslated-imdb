It's hard for me to explain this show to my adult friends. I have a group of Shasta Daisy's in the back yard that I affectionately call my "Chuckle Patch". My friends make fun of me and look at me like I have two heads. It would be great to see this DVD series for us, those who fondly remember our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there was really something to laugh about! Today, where children's TV shows are composed of violent cartoons, characters who are doing magic or a talking sponge that lives in a pineapple under the sea, The Magic Garden was real in the sense that it learned good values. <br /> <br /> I will keep fond memories of Carole and Paula, as well as the Chuckle patch.
