Return to Me is a movie you want to own. It's a story of inspiration and family love that will appeal to all ages. The story, although seemingly impossible, aspires to a divine intervention when a man loses his wife in a tragic accident and finds this love in the woman who receives the heart of his wife. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver offer warm performances as future designated lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor, as grandfather of Minnie Driver, is authentic in all scenes. Bonnie Hunt as a friend whose spirit and encouragement emphasizes Minnie as a "sister" is both funny and warm, especially with James Belushi as husband. Classical scenes and writing make this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again. Thank you for making a film that shows families and friends as close and caring people who love each other in difficult times.
