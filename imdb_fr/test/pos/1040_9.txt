Has anyone ever found a way to buy copies of this series? I can see that many people have inquired, but I can not say if any of them have succeeded. It is hard to believe that a series of such quality can not be seen by people today, especially if it is based on real problems facing real people for one period at a time. tense and exciting in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? At the same time, I agree with all the comments that other authors have made about this series on this website. This is an excellent story of events that everyone should know and know today. Many of us saw this series when we were at university or at that time anyway. Now we want to share it with our children ... but we can not? If true, what would be the good written documents that would relay the same information?
