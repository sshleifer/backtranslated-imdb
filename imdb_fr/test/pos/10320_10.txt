Probably the best short film Three Stooges with Shemp, "Brideless Groom" is as good as any other short of the trio with Curly. The memorable moments of Stooge abound. The opening with 'Professor' Shemp, who gives voice lessons to Miss Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), a talentless and lascivious singer, grimacing at her dreadful vocals and opposing her advances, is an excellent example of Shemp Howard at his best. Many regarded it as the most naturally amusing of Stooges. <br /> <br /> Later, when Moe and Larry try to help him find the courage to find a woman (and claim $ 500,000), Shemp thinks he cut his head. when his mirror is turned back. Fixing the mirror, he cries with relief, "There I am, and pretty as an image!" "Yes," Moe responds quickly, trying to shake his pants, "an APE!" <br /> <br /> The best scene (and perhaps the best of Shemp with the trio) comes when he calls the young and seductive Miss Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). Taking him for "Cousin Basil" long lost, she suffocates him with hugs and kisses (which also causes a hilarious argument between Moe and Larry in the hall), without giving him the opportunity to explain his true identity . Suddenly, the REAL cousin Basil calls and she goes mad madly slapping him repeatedly and accusing him of taking advantage of a "helpless" defenseless woman! This last line is delivered to her as she puts her hand in her jaw (with a real punch, according to Shemp and the crew), hitting him through the door and into the hallway in a perfectly gag executed. "What happened, kid?" Moe asks. "Can I help him if I'm not cousin Basil?" Shemp asks before fainting. <br /> <br /> Other classic elements include Moe and Shemp getting tangled in a phone booth, trying to find a lost coin, Larry being slapped over Shemp's bad-looking face (his face stuck to stand glass phone) and the big girl is fighting in the justice of the peace's apartment. The great Emil Sitka delivers his classic line (inscribed on his gravestone): "Hold on, you love birds", again and again, his apartment being destroyed. <br /> <br /> I prescribe 'Brideless Groom' as a medicine for anyone who thinks the Stooges' glory years have ended when Curly is gone. Granted, Shemp did not have LOTS of super shorts with Curly, but that's because of Columbia's lack of growing support and age (and others). When Shemp was healthy and the trio had decent gear, he was always on top.
