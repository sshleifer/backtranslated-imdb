Begotten is distorted black and white images. It looks like it could come from the 19th century. However, the sound is crystal clear, minus the timing and the addition of quiet-sounding sounds. <br /> <br /> This film was very critical of the struggles of life. It shows an unmarried mother and her child in a violent world that benefits the innocent. The mother is very unaware of her environment. This causes a lot of torture, pain and death. You can look at it several times and see different symbols, various plots and, basically, "what does it mean?". <br /> <br /> If you enjoy art in movies, you'll love it. Otherwise, do not bother.
