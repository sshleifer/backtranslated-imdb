When I see a movie, I usually try to entertain myself. But of course, if I know what kind of movement it is, I will look for what it is supposed to do. For example, if it's a deep film, I expect the movie to make thoughts in my mind and make me think about what it says. But who is this girl? is not a deep film. But it's entertaining, nonetheless. It's a kind of campy movie that is a joy to watch. There is hardly a boring moment in the film and many humorous scenes. I watched it when I was younger. Casting is always fun as usual. I had a small crush on Griffin Dunne, although he was not the type of male idol of the day. Haviland Morris is also a star. And the Austrian actress Bibi Besch, now deceased, is here too! Overall, a delight!
