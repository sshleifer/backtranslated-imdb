The only problem with Married to the Mob is that it's not funny. He dresses exactly like a romantic comedy, but almost nothing that happens is funny. But if you can watch it as a movie where almost nothing fun is happening, you'll have a great time. It's a glitzy glitter film, too, as the title says. Extremely sumptuous. But the director, Jonathan Demme, is one of the few directors of dominant sects to have fully integrated the 1980s into his work this decade, instead of pretending it was still the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The opening credits combine Animation of the 1980s, American-Italian and staging foam at a time. From there, despite the 80s, we feel good. The lights of Tak Fujimoto, Demme's director of photography, and the soundtrack of the jukebox are very varied and present varied and varied sounds. They are more and more controlled and nuanced in the atmosphere. Demme is talented for instant and colorful characterizations in her visual and sometimes seemingly impetuous mix of fun styles, a plot that could have gone anywhere, where an FBI agent, played by a very bland Matthew Modine, was trying to infiltrate a mafia family, sees a chance when a gun, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, tries to leave the criminal lifestyle after her husband, the trigger man, in what you were hoping for during a performance Alec Baldwin, is screwed. <br /> <br /> It works for a while because Demme seems to have a firm hand on the steering wheel. He knows it is important to show us the very subjective and relatable scenes of home life with Pfeiffer, as well as his concerns and desires as a morally conflictual mother, although his relationship with his son Joey is taken for granted. What ugly son listens to the partying mother when her father's boss, playing with the natural characteristic of Dean Stockwell and by far the star of the cast, gives her such impressive gifts? Overall, however, Demme's stylized stylings are easily seen as a new interpretation of a fun police thriller tale. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, we find that we are wrong, because inevitably, Modine and Pfeiffer must fall in love. It's not intrinsically bad, and here and there it feels really bearable, but as a romantic sub-plot, it's not managed in an interesting way, or even well, just because it runs up against many different shots, which meets the original hope of the 1980s movie date, and for this audience, I think it has the right impact. But for someone who is really interested in history and the aesthetic approach, it's a state of boredom. <br /> <br /> So it's a decent film with huge mistakes at times, but as a date film or a nostalgic piece for those who grew up in the 80s, maybe saw a lot of Date films in the 80s, entertainment value is not as likely to fluctuate, with the exception of this lack of sincere laughter. There may be some taunting, and it's largely ironic, but I would not leave the comedy scene with the high hopes with which I would have originally entered. Be that as it may, there are additional joys in the roles of big players who have already begun to fade, like Nancy Travis, Joan Cusack and Oliver Platt.
