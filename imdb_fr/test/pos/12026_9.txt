It was really one of the most enjoyable specials I saw on TV. He is just an incredible artist. His personality is reflected in each of the songs he plays. I really want this DVD to be available as an uncut DVD so I can watch it again and again without the "beeps-" keyword for explicit language. I did not get the chance to see it live, but it's something that I really want to do now. I can not forget his replacements. They really added a lot of substance and humor to the series. With their campy style and flamboyant dance moves, they really complement Dan's true talent. I wish there were more songs on his live CD, which is also amazing. It's refreshing to see someone like him playing. So incredibly friendly and real, I can not really say enough good things about Dan and this show. Once again, I would like this DVD to be available as an uncut DVD.
