Okay, all right, I must admit that I look a little like Peter Liapis and I admit that this is not the best suite of Ghoulies. I mean, yes, he had his faults, such as NO GHOULIES themselves. But the two Ghoulies coming to Earth were really funny, I guess they were called Dark and Lite. I enjoyed the plot of the film. And even at the end of the film, the two Ghoulies hinted that there would be a sequel. Still waiting. lol. Peter Liapis has taken over his role as Jonathan Graves, playing this time as a detective, it's cute! Ghoulies IV may not be scary, but it's really funny. I thought I was commenting on this movie and just saying - it's not that bad. It is worth looking at even if the Ghoulies are not there.
