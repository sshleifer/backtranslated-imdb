This movie was fabulous. It's definitely a top 5 hitchcock movie. The staging and shooting are almost perfect (except the scene of the dog when he licks the hand of the guy, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very likely that an innocent man could fall into such a trap. <br /> <br /> I would say that Bruno is the second most interesting character of Hitchcocks (of course, Bates is the first). Robert Walker plays a very credible maniac. He did not exaggerate the part that made it believable (about the same with the way Perkins did not exaggerate his part). Overall, it's a great movie, must-see for all hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
