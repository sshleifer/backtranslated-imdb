As a French, I found it very nice to be able to laugh at the old stereotype that is made of French like that, some Western faults, Spy movies etc ... and many other things, en route. .. I have already seen 3 times and every time I discovered new things and I started crying ... Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Béjo, the director Aure Atika and all the actors, all the members of the team did a fantastic job. This movie is funny but although much more than that: it has a lot of levels to it. You laugh because of simple gags, because of critical criticism (the film has the courage to be critical), because of the physical comedy, because you believe in the characters, etc. Aesthetically and musically, it is also a success. Go see him if you can.
