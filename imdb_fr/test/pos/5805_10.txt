The show was amazing and very professional. Madonna is nonstop, dancing and singing for 2 hours. The opening was pretty good when she came out of the disco ball and the jump was a very good performance. The whole series was full of energy, so it's hard to say what the highlights were, because each song had something special and unique. I saw two of his previous tours (Drown World and Reinvention): they were good but we can not compare with this one. The dancers were fantastic, the lights and the whole show were perfect. Madonna always looks very good. If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend you to see it. You will enjoy the show from beginning to end. Madonna is still the queen of dance.
