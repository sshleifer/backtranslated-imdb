I was first informed about this movie when I saw a preview before another movie. I was intrigued, but he was not seen until the end of theatrical shooting. <br /> <br /> This is not an easy film to watch many times. There is a lot of violence inflicted on unarmed civilians. There are lessons to learn here. One of Patricia Arquette's lines summarizes. "For Americans, if it did not happen on television, it just did not happen" There is a lot of truth about it. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that she thinks for a moment that it is because she announced an American citizen that the soldiers will separate and let her go. It does not work like that. <br /> <br /> The landscape is beautiful. The acting is all decent. THE TEACHER is particularly good. Especially if I care about these characters. Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are fine, but their appearance is short, so they do not count much. Patricia has the courage. In the hands of a minor actor, it would have gone very badly. Since this is love or hate for the film, you should always leave with the idea that there are still military dictatorships in the world in this century, and until one of us is hurt, we do not know his oppression. <br /> <br /> Aung San Suu Kyi, is the political leader of the film. In real life, she won the Nobel Peace Prize. She was only released recently. The W. Bush administration, as of this writing, is trying to pressure the military government to start talks with it and rework it. The Burmize government was subject to such control that changed the name of the country to the Maynamar Republic. The US government has not yet recognized the new name. <br /> <br /> If you do not want a message in your movie do not look at this one. If you do not fear a little education with your entertainment, that's fine.
