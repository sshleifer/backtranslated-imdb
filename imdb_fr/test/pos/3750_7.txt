I remember this old movie. It's a scary atmospheric horror picture of a man settling in a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange activities in the corridors at night. And there are even strange events taking place in Hollywood's most familiar labyrinth of hedgerows. Yes, it's the labyrinth that you've seen in all feature films and that included a topiary puzzle, including "The Shining". But the end of this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly did not see him coming. This is a fine example of the quality and conviction of a film, even if the script is completely distorted, almost laughable. I would recommend it to anyone.
