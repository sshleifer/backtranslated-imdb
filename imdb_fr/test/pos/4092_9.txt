I recently bought Lost Horizon on eBay, having vivid memories of the number of things I did not miss from my childhood (I am a 29 year old). I also recently finished the novel on which it is based. I was so pleasantly surprised to find a real hidden treasure. A wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a wonderfully simple and elegantly told story, subtly updated from the original film (and now a separate entity from James Hilton's much more intellectual and stimulating book). Sally Kellerman, in particular, has a radiant presence as a suicidal na√Øve Sally Hughes, who is slowly warming to the charms of Shangri-La. Only Liv Ullmann resonates in the teacher's wooden representation (a much more appropriate role for a guy like Julie Andrews) The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hussey are all dubbed does not matter because it's almost impossible The songs vary The quality of the music is much better than the lyrics, but it is still a vibrant and captivating film that really deserves a DVD release and increased recognition.
