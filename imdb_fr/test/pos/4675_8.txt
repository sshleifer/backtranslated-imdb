I enjoyed this movie. More than I expected. There is enough action, intrigue and places to be worth it. Although I still can not consider Mark Wahlberg as a leader, he is good enough to be a credible manager and that's okay. <br /> <br /> The superhero of the movie is the Mini Cooper. It has been shown to have the speed, dexterity and muscle to perform any job. And to handle a manic driver like the character of Charlize Theron.
