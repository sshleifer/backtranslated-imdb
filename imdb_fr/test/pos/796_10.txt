I do not know where to start writing on this jewel, except to say that it represents the young Buster Keaton at the height of his powers and must certainly be among the half-dozen of the best short comedies ever made. THE GOAT, they are twenty minutes of gags beautifully executed at a frantic pace, perfectly photographed. two coils of endless comic invention, animated by an undeniable undercurrent of paranoia and leading to a happy ending - which has not always been the case with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for a case where fatalism finally got the better of it, or ONE WEEK for the victory of defeatism.) If I had to describe this film in one word, I would call it "effortlessly", but if you do allowed two I would call it "seemingly effortless" because it is obvious that many hard works are necessary to the realization of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease. Yet they did not call him the big stone face for nothing: Buster never let the public see him sweat. <br /> <br /> A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence unfolds "along Millionaires' Row," that is to say on a line of bread in a sinister urban setting, where Buster patiently waits at the back of the line and, therefore, does not get fed. But it must be emphasized that not for a moment he plays for the pathos; Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks for it. Soon, through a series of absurd accidents, coincidences and misunderstandings, Buster is thought to be an escaped murderer named Dead Shot Dan. All the cops are chasing him for miles around. Yet he is clearly dismayed by the turn of events never a hint of self pity or even surprise; it seems like he always knew it was what life was for him and he did not have time to complain anyway, he had to find new ways to duck these cops and to escape from the last trap. . <br /> <br /> As much as Buster abstains from playing for sympathy, he does not seem to have fun either to laugh either, which is particularly impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the smallest most entertaining comedies. This is the film that depicts this iconic Buster photo driving the cow-catcher of a train to the very lens of the camera, which is not a gag but in turn , causes laughter in its strange way. Meanwhile, there are gags involving guns, dogs, cops, an incredibly hairy mustache and a clay statue of a horse that is melting under the weight of Buster (a truly surrealistic sight), but some of the most Big boffos are kept for the final when trying to escape from his main enemy, Big Joe Roberts, a round policeman who is also the father of Virginia Fox's main wife. Trapped in Big Joe's dining room, Buster jumps frogs at him and crosses a transom, turns a phone booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear. He then uses the elevator himself to get rid of his pursuer and win the girl on time. for one last gag of fade. <br /> <br /> Saying more would be a bad service for viewers for the first time. I only wish I could see this film in a theater filled with people who had never seen it before, and float in laughter. Live music accompaniment would be good too; and incidentally the music score provided by Kino for the video / DVD version of THE GOAT is excellent, serving as a cherry on a cake already tasty.
