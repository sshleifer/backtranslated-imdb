eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, in which characters run from kingdom to landscape, from landscape to landscape, trying to beat a game they do not know the purpose or where it leads . This virtual reality game includes several layers of virtual reality games, which puts into question the "real" reality. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not spectacular to hide the fact that it's not going to respond reasonably to a real reality, instead of challenging the idea that it's real or a video game , even until the end. I'm not even sure that Cronenberg claims that this distortion will not be there. It's so incredibly obvious in a way that it's a little disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The problem of this film is however its fundamental nature, in a sense. Cronenberg questions the reality AND criticizes the game. Yet the same things he uses to criticize the game make him happy: violence, discontinuity, lack of concentration and, in a sense, pixelation, even if there is none in the film. I've already heard someone say that Cronenberg's violence was actually a criticism of hyperviolence in the media, but he's hiding so well that he's having an incredible pleasure in breaking new holes in human beings, animals and amorphous piles of biological sludge. /> <br /> What is brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game concepts (not being able to say exactly what you mean during cutscenes, the lack of relative environment or environment that does not make sense, only a few people around where he feels should be a lot and vice versa, all this) with the reason for penetration. It definitely deconstructs the reality of the video game in a nauseating and absurd way, but it does it even better by replacing its electronics with "pods" of biological material that wriggle and move and which, frankly, are disgusting for the one of the most frightening degrees. For what it's worth, this film provokes a reaction in you. <br /> <br /> But what for? He criticizes virtual reality, but it's a film: it's his own virtual reality. He seems to criticize the banality of the lines of the plot and the design of the characters in video games, while maintaining this banality. He really seems to be concerned about killing a video game character is more acceptable than killing a human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in the game. real life, and yet I say once more, it takes great pleasure in tearing people, objects, animals, objects and bodies in bloody rags. <br /> <br /> So while he has a focus of anxiety, he does not really do anything about it. , not really. Only what he does is to present this anguish in such an original way that his own moment of splendor can not be denied. <br /> <br /> In a way, it would be much easier to hate this movie. to be bloody and violent, because there is no good reason to love him and yet I can not ignore him as mediocre or bad. It would be easier not to take it, but as I can, I can not do anything about it. I think it's a little excessive, that it did not really need to go that far, but Cronenberg's intentions are so confusing and confused that I do not know if that was Cronenberg's fault or his about, and I do not do it. I think there is really no way to understand it except maybe ask him directly. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
