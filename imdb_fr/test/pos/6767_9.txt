Okay, so I'm usually not one of those who buy foreign movies ... mostly foreign black comedies. I think I can count on a hand of the number of movies I've found really hilarious from start to finish. This film will be added to the short list. Even black Hollywood comedies sometimes stop me because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. But this one had eyes full of tears. My sides hurt me. I have not laughed so much in a long time. This film was recommended by my mother and I do not think I would have even dreamed of watching it if she had not delirious Do not be afraid to read during your movie, you will miss a hilarious movie played well.
