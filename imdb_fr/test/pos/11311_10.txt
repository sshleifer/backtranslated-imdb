Julie Brown hilariously demolishes Madonna's attempt to produce a rockumentary with heartbreaking humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival those of Madonna. The cinematography and the decorations are excellent. <br /> <br /> Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own comedy infusions that enrich and complete this film. The appearances of Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale, as such, constitute an additional asset. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say if Brown's performance is intended to insult or playfully tease Madonna, although I do not think the Material Girl finds humor in it. <br /> <br /> My favorite phrase: "Why do not you come here (in the Philippines), they eat only dog ​​and I am a vegetarian".
