This is the best effort made directly on DVD by Van Damme and I have seen. Van Damme plays the role of a border police officer who works to prevent heroin smugglers from crossing into the United States. The action in this film is excellent and the fight scenes rank among the best of Van Damme. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For more evidence, see "Undisputed 2". Adkins is so good in fact that before watching "The Shepherd", I thought Van Damme might not look very credible for defeating him on the screen. Van Damme holds on well and although he is not as athletic as Adams, he can still hit with the best of them. All the fight scenes in this movie are very well done and the rifle fights are also above average for this type of film. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a bit underdeveloped. I think that the motivations of the character of Van Damme should have been presented earlier in the film, especially as regards the reasons for which he wears a rabbit. The reason he does it is very cool, but you will not know it until the end. There are some other things that are never really explained either, but it's a Van Damme movie. So you know where the priority lies in the creation of this type of film and it is not the development of the character. But overall, it's a solid action movie that I recommend. Run to the border of Damme!
