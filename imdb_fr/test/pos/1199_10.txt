The anti-war musical "Hair" is my number one cult movie. I do not know how many times I have seen this movie in movie theaters and in VHS, nor how many times have I listened to the CD with the amazing soundtrack, and now this masterpiece has finally been published on DVD in Brazil. <The pacifist and touching story is still astonishing, a hymn to freedom, friendship and freedom of choice, and represents a generation's resistance against the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70s and their dreams, because the current world is probably worse than in the 70s. I do not remember who won the Oscar in 1979, but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least one nomination for their impressive performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely beautiful in the role of a spoiled hypocritical teenager. I've seen "Hair" probably over twelve times, and my eyes are still wet as Berger walks over the plane singing "It's me, it's me, it's me" and I start crying with his tombstone at the cemetery. I think this is one of the most beautiful, sad, and touching conclusions in the history of cinema. My wife, my daughter and my son also love this movie. Therefore, I can guarantee that "Hair" is timeless and recommended for all audiences. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hair"
