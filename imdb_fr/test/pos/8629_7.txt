So I guess Bud and Lou just loved playing classic stories (though they had some interesting results). In this case, they make babysitting a bad boy, and Lou tries to read to him "Jack and the beanstalk" but falls asleep and dreams that he is the butcher of Jack and Bud. of the giant (Buddy Baer). <br /> <br /> I think my favorite scene was where Lou was trying to turn the giant into an omelette and ... well, I'll let you see what's going on. Since it was a movie from Abbott and Costello, they had some useless songs, but other than that, it was pretty funny. For other interpretations of classical history, "Bewitched" and "Gilligan's Island" both had episodes portraying him.
