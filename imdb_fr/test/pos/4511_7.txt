Greetings again from the darkness. Based on author Khaled Hosseini's mega bestseller, the film gives us a glimpse of the ugliness of the invasion of Afghanistan and the terror of the Taliban after Russia. Director Marc Foster adds to his resume a jewel that already includes "Monster's Ball", "Finding Neverland" and "Stranger Than Fiction". <br /> <br /> The story of young friends Amir and Hassan and the unknown connection they share in the next generation. It's a story of honor, courage and loyalty, an unusual tale about the transition to adulthood. Some great scenes of the boys when they are children, then some really astonishing scenes just as Amir returns to adulthood to find the imprisoned son of Hassan. <br /> <br /> This story is close and captivating with a message. The acting is solid, no actor stealing the screen. Although this story is not pleasant to watch, it certainly has a meaning and a feeling of heart. Plus, a helping hand from Midnight Oil playing in the billiard room is a welcome gift.
