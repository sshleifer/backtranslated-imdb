Each story has a lesson for young and old. But what I can say more could spoil a future story. But, I think what I have to say is for everyone; Just for a particular episode: The soldier and death. <br /> <br /> Alright ... of all the stories, the one that strikes me the most is "The Soldier and the Death" because it was the goal of my life realized that life was terminally ill . I am not joking. The broadcast took place on my eighth and a half ... and I will always remember it. I did not remember his title until tonight, but I did the synopsis again. (May 15, 1988) <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I am living proof (currently 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and remind adults from time to time ... <br /> <br /> I write this with tears in my eyes. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor of my age - passed away today. It reminded me of many lessons I have learned in my life. That's why I write this as a reminder to young and old ... no one is safe from what lies ahead. <br /> <br /> I hate to say that death will happen, but this story was the first time, death was not a bad thing. but part of life, was literally in this story. I can not help it. It was a moment that changed my life and will always remain so. <br /> <br /> And for that ... <br /> <br /> I love you Jim Henson (and I still remember a lot of your work in until the day of your death and your Muppet memorial Show) and thanks to Brian Henson for keeping the studio alive !!! Honestly, I thank you all your colleagues, editors and trainees. <br /> <br /> The scene is only a scene / And a show is only a show / But the imagination will create Magic / That Forever the world will know. <br /> <br /> Thank you !!! <br /> <br /> (And for all those who doubt me ... Dance, Magic Dance)
