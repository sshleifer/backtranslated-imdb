Gilles Mamouni plays with the audience with the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his greatest lost love (Monica Bellucci) just before becoming engaged to another woman. Mamouni uses many flashback sequences without warning. The best way to know where we are in history is to watch the haircut of the actor. Otherwise, it can be very confusing ... Another good film debut for Mamouni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (the 5th element, the messenger), and Monica Bellucci is a darling to watch ... I felt a little disappointed towards the end so I gave it 9 out of 10.
