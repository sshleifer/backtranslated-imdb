Three words: piece of art. This movie is just great. It's beautiful, sad, scary and at the same time provoking reflection. The score is constantly in my head, the acting is wonderful, the scary and beautiful landscapes at once. <br /> <br /> It's more by chance than by intention that I saw this film. By the time I decided to watch this movie, I was bored and reading lists of Asian movies, which may be good. Well, I saw the title "A tale of two sisters" that seemed very interesting. Then I read the summary of the plot and decided "You do not just watch this movie, you have to buy it". Said, done. I bought this movie and became addicted from the first minute. <br /> <br /> The plot has always interested me, from beginning to end; the twist towards the end of the movie made me scream. I really did not see anything like that coming. And the final scene made me cry ... it made me cry. It was so sad. <br /> <br /> Well, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie that combines an interesting plot, scenes and a scary atmosphere. Although you must be aware that the end is, as I already mentioned, very sad. But that's exactly the mood of the movie, is not it?
