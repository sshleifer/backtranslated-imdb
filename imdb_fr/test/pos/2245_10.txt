Again, Doctor Who delivers the goods to the bucket's charge. There is humor ("You just invite as you go!" "Yes, but I do it with flying colors"), action, monsters (in this case, even more cyber criminals) , tragedy and tactics of fear. In short, exactly what the doctor prescribed (pun intended). The way emotions move from one to the other is so well done that there is no feeling of "moving on". So, write down 3 of the 4 last episodes that made you laugh, then made you cry, and made you look like "eue". <br /> <br /> As for the development of the character, this is clearly the decisive for Noel Clarke is Mickey (and Ricky). Being one of the doctor's companions, you know that he will do what is right and may even suspect how he does it. However, confirmation of his future is still difficult to deal with. <br /> <br /> While "The rise of the Cybermen" had more and more of the grim rise to terror, "The Age of Steel" is an out of breath. Like "Alien" versus "Aliens" - two true classics, but in different ways. Can the series continue at this level? Let's hope so.
