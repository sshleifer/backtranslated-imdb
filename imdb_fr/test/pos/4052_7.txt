A boat builder in a sleepy Maine town is closing its doors and the lives of all (soon to be ex-employees) and their families are upset. The biggest disappointment is that the two stars - Bates and Bridges - have only a few pieces. <br /> <br /> Interesting, but not something you would see twice. <br /> <br />
