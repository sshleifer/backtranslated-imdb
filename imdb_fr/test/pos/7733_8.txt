I saw this film a bit like Skywalker02, but when I managed to see it again and with a formal film formation, psychology and life had time to really take my hand and start beat me, .. I really click with the movie. I remember that pay TV service channels played this thing almost to death, much like the poltergeist when it came out, and many other popular movies. At the time, I felt that it was not worth it and the "airtime" constant (I know that the cable is not really broadcast), but I was very young and the drama of the adult situation would not have and should not have worked However, the recent visualization of the film enlightened me about the film. I think that Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald were probably studying the screenplay together, and I would be a bit surprised Surandon led Ringwald during this project. Ringwald's other projects, although good, do not allow him to show the potential depth of this role. Surandon nailed hers, like Raul Julia too. Cassavettes and his wife have given acceptable performances, but I recognize that sometimes the first-class acting becomes mediocre. There is a steady stream of acting in many scenes, but overall, I understand why the story might call the dynamics to become more subtle. <br /> <br /> In the end, I do not find This film will be the festival of boredom "take me and drown", as Skywalker02 would like. I think that perhaps with a good psychological training and a little more difficulty in strategically placed domestic life, associated with some cinema classes, maybe this film would look different. I would say that if you feel a bit melancholy and long for a simpler life, and have had your share of marital discord among dysfunctional family units, then maybe this movie will provide more insight and entertainment than you do not think so. I feel like it's a classic and it's a lot more entertaining than mainstream movies that are supposed to share many of the same elements, such as Terms of Endearment, which I think might be missing some of Jack Nicholson's extraordinary performances. . then ceremoniously burned until there is nothing left. (How could a film like this attract more attention than this? Talk about boredom.) It's best not to believe my words or someone else's, see the movie and support our industry.
