When the first trailer of this movie was watched by myself, I was curious to know what angle would take the plot. After all, the plot of reviving one's childhood in the present leaves many possibilities. Bruce Willis does a remarkable job in the role he has been given. I was surprised how much he could play in this part. It's also a good career choice, as many others have said, but I now agree with that idea. The main purpose of this film is to remind you of the kid you were and realize that you are not the adult you planned to be. It's a wonderful story and a captivating story that makes you think. Usually, we make fun of the movies "What if ...". For example, Waterworld attempted to answer the question "What if the world was covered with water and ...?" But to tell the truth, no one cared. This film however concerns everyone in the theater. While young children may not understand the idea of ​​growing up and fulfilling all your dreams, this has a significant impact on the adults and parents of these children. This film is definitely worth the detour. Although it will be better the second time because you will not think much (how the kid got there, and why and all that) Relax and have fun. And take something with you when you leave this cinema. Take this piece of your childhood that you have forgotten and enjoy.
