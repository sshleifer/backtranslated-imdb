Sam Firstenberg's "Ninja 3: The Domination" blends the martial arts with "The Exorcist" as a horror. The horror elements projected on the screen are simply laughable, but the film works as an action movie. martial arts without reflection. The fight scenes are well choreographed. and exciting, and the movie is never boring. So, forget the stupid dialogs, the lame games and the boring soundtracks: grab a beer and have a look at this one! Strongly recommended!
