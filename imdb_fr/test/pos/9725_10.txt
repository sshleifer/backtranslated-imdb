It's the best television series for children (and adults) of all time. John Hurt is an excellent actor, with many excellent performances over the years, but he was born to play the storyteller. The scripts of almost every episode are great crafts, and the productions span the gamut of emotions, being both funny, sad, cheerful, exciting and always hauntingly beautiful. It's hard to pick the best episode among so many great contenders, but "The Soldier and Death", with its timeless pathetic, is unbeatable. It's a series to watch with your kids over and over again.
