In many ways, this film defines the essence of all that I love about cinema, in terms of capturing these strange, elusive moments of unguarded truth. In other respects, this is undeniably an amateurish and fuzzy result of junkies having fun with a camera. In the end, it is somewhere between pure brilliance and unassailable (fortunately much more first than last). Part of me wants to reward him only for his absolute innovation and his moments of pure sublimity, but at the same time, I can not completely ignore the "actions" sometimes terribly terrible and the bad values ​​of production. In the beginning, the editing seems excessively sloppy and unnecessarily annoying (or maybe simply "innovative" wrongly), but after a while, I got used to it, which is ultimately the real sign of success or not -conformity of a movie. do not. I guess this answer sums up my overall feelings for the movie. That is, despite its inevitable imperfections, overall, it works very well. And, if nothing else, a movie like this shows how fake documentary is fake and artificial, the shaky-cam style can sometimes be used when it is so obvious that it only applies to the effect (as in films like the admirable Roger Dodger, for example). Here, the aesthetic obviously stems from the necessities of the filming situation and does not only serve to make it "cool".
