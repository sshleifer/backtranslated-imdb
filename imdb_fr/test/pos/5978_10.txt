Having seen this, I find it hard to believe that it is not better known. COME AND SEE (Klimov, 1986) must be one of the greatest war films of this film, a little more known but almost as shamefully neglected. They are significant, powerful, incisive. THE ASCENT also has a little-used but brilliantly torn score by Schnittke.
