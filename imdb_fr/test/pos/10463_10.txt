It is sometimes difficult to watch movies with subtitles (in this case, Danish), but watching them is worth it. As the story progresses, the reasoning for choosing two sisters to take care of their father is questionable but their society is different. Their choice leaves them alone until a French woman arrives. One may wonder why the French woman came to their home and this is never fully developed. The party that occurs later as a result of unexpected funds from France is a source of unusual fun for all participants and something they have never experienced before. It provides a thank you adjustment for the kindness given to the guest. Filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty, it's a great experience for the viewer.
