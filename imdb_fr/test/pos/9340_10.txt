Before this clip, the music videos were simply meant to show an artist. "Thriller" by Michael Jackson has created a brand new section of music videos that can honestly be called mini movies. "Thriller" follows a couple while they go to the girl's house after a movie. Along the way, they meet zombies announced by the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite part is where the zombies mingle with the couple and where the girl turns to see that Michael has become one of them. Then they do a little dance. The scariest thing about "Thriller" is maybe it's still more fun and enjoyable than a lot of movies that are made. After twenty years, it remains the first music video. <br /> <br /> PS My clip Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a prayer" 4 - Guns N 'Roses "My sweet child" 3 - Nine Inch Nails "Closer" 2 - Peter Gabriel "Sledgehammer" 1 - Michael Jackson - "Thriller"
