Sometimes a movie is so bad that it's good. This film was made in Germany and is dubbed in English, so you have to go beyond that. The acting was also forced and forced, apart from what the real rats did, for which IMO did a great job. Clings to the rat wrestler. Be that as it may, the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and local garbage collectors are going on strike, leaving large piles of garbage everywhere. This scenario has already been used, not to mention what happened in real life (too often unfortunately) and the audience has no surprises. But it is good. We know what will happen and when, and sometimes the public needs a movie in which many brain cells are not needed. We have our hero, the chiseled face and body, the semi-hero (s), and of course our heroine, who happens to be the doctor, but only in training, although it is she who discovers what is really happening. when so many people end up sick and die, not just because of a rat bite. Of course, the bad guy has to die (okay, all the bad guys, that's the rats), and the final scene is one of those that reminds the audience that a sequel is in the making . This is one of those movies that you can only watch and appreciate for what it is or not.
