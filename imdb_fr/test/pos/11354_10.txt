A strange bond is created between the man and the woman as they face their sadness by playing in turn their spouse, before a more complex link is created ... <br /> </ br> > No summary can do it justice, for Hong Kong The author "In the Mood for Love" author Wong Kar-Wai is nothing short of a miracle. A story of sadness that manages to be touching and sometimes funny. A romance that never feels forced or wrong. The director's method is undoubtedly for many. <br /> <br /> Directed from a nonexistent scenario (although the concept largely stems from a new Japanese) to promote improvisation, the film immediately stands out the freshness of its performance. The whole film revolves around this and the rest is a pure improvement. At the heart of the film, you'll find two characters that will resonate in your heart and stay long after the closing credits: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply incredible and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth . The extra material is also excellent: the film is beautiful to watch (partly from Christopher Doyle's "Hero") and the music is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> This is something everyone must see, if only because it is by far the most sincere, mature and authentic "love story". Do not miss.
