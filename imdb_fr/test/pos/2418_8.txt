I thought this movie was great, if you do not take it too seriously. Relax and enjoy Hilary Swank in all its splendor and laugh when the monks travel to Boston, MA. I also think that this movie has an excellent message about self control and inner strength. In addition, Mr. Myagi was so kind, I would like him to teach me karate!
