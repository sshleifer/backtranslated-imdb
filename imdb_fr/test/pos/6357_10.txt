First of all, I must say that I do not speak Spanish and do not generally appreciate Spanish-speaking movies ... BUT Two Coyotes is an exceptional film. There is enough action and hard dramas to make it a Spanish film. The subtitles were easy to read and did not block the action - OR the drama! <br /> <br /> I would like to tell fans of Spanish movies and non-fans of Spanish-language movies to see this movie. Action and drama are worth every penny. <br /> <br />
