I just wanted to inform anyone who might be interested that the movie "New Jersey Drive" was my personal favorite of all time. I admire the work of Nick Gomez and Spike Lee in this movie masterpiece. This film really impressed me with its reality and taste for the details of urban life in New Jersey. Personally, it touched me, because I grew up with friends like those described in the film. It impressed me even more because I spent time in Teaneck many years ago. Some characters have been kept "real". Sometimes this movie seemed like a documentary because you did not know if it was real events or not. Although films such as "Boys in the Hood" and "Menace II Society" attract more attention, I personally believe that these films have been somewhat "improved" to attract a wider audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an uncompromising piece of reality "in your face". Lee and Gomez covered all the details of this urban drama: music, clothes, slang and place. Unlike some movies I mentioned earlier, the actors played as if they were not "actors". Nothing has been compromised to make "theater". The only misfortune to come from this film is the fact that many people have "slept" on it. I look forward to more works by Nick and Spike.
