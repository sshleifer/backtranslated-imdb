IN & OUT, in my opinion, is a very hilarious film. I thought Cameron (Matt Dillon) was wrong to say that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. The part I liked the most was Howard's bachelor party. It's because they joked about a lot of things, including Barbra Streisand's films. I also thought that Emily (Joan Cusack) was very beautiful in her wedding dress and that Howard was handsome in her tuxedo. My favorite quote from IN & OUT is: "Is everyone gay?" Is it "THE TWILIGHT ZONE"? It was absolutely hilarious! The only character I could not stand was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). It was because she was VERY conceited and snubbed.In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all fans of Kevin Kline who have not seen it.Prepare yourself to laugh loudly and have fun when you see.
