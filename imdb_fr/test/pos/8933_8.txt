I wanted to see this movie for a very long time. I finally ended up buying it on E-Bay because it's so hard to find the condition. But the wait was ... a little bit worth it. <br /> <br /> I can not say that the movie was great. And I can not say that the movie was hilarious. But it was good and there are some pretty funny points. Other than that, the shots in this movie are simply beautiful. And the whole cast, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I had not seen before, unfortunately), was excellent. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a good romantic comedy and I recommend you check it unless you've just died in the family. <br /> <br /> The final chapter is well worth it. >. <
