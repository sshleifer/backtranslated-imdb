This film stars Peter Lorre as an exceptionally kind guy who immigrates to America. Unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he is under a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned. Because he looks so awful, no one wants to hire him and, out of desperation, he resorts to a criminal life to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness. Where the movie goes exactly from there, you will just need to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I marked this film with an 8 because, for the money spent on it, it's a pretty good movie with a lot of twists in the plot to keep it interesting. The film could have degenerated into a mere horror or crime movie, but it goes well beyond that and offers real surprises. In addition, Lorre's excellent acting shows that he was able to do more than just play supportive roles. It's a great movie and offers more than most "A-pictures" of the day.
