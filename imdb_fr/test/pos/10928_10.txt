I had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the Miami Film Festival last Saturday and I want to say that I was stunned. It was the only movie of the whole program that I liked. He is beautifully shot, composed, edited, played and written. After the screening, I saw the director at a party and asked him what he was doing next. He said he was working on financing the short version of the short film. He described scenes to me. It looked like the genre of the first big-name movie in the industry. If you have the chance to see this short film, I highly recommend you take it. Hat at the cross star.
