Bring Back The A-Team was a one-hour special show presented on Channel 4 in the UK last year and hosted by presenter and comedian Justin Lee Collins. The show tried to find and bring together the members of the A-Team cast. , for the first time on television. This has been something that has never been tried before by anyone. Well, that's not the case for everyone I know. <br /> <br /> Justin is an excellent presenter, and his eccentric personality and humorous jokes have shone throughout this program. The attempts he made to reach the actors are still funny, but he was also very perseverant and eager to fulfill this task as well, which is to his credit, in my opinion. Anyway, he's great on TV, whether it's showcasing a show like this or the Friday Night Project with co-host Alan Carr. <br /> <br /> There were appearances and interviews with Dirk Benedict. - the Faceman himself, Dwight Schultz - alias Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heasley who played Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging alias General 'Bull' Full Bright, the creator of Team A, Stephen J Cannell and the great man himself , Mr. T aka BA Baracus. They were simply fascinating to watch and hear what they had to say about this show that became a worldwide success in the 80s, as they evoke and relive the good and the bad moments of the series: during and slides. Unfortunately, no George Peppard, but of course, he is already in heaven, he is understandable and quite strange, not Melinda, who plays Amy. <br /> <br /> I just did not understand why she was not featured in the show. Okay, she was injured after 3 seasons or whatever, but she was the first and original woman member of the A-Team. It has been replaced only by the Tawnia de Marla. It would have been great to see and hear his side. Team history, in addition to other members of the cast. <br /> <br /> In the end, Bring Back The A-Team was an excellent style of documentary film. Maybe it could have been more publicized by which it could be a six-part documentary. Nevertheless, JLC has made considerable efforts. advisable
