This film had two objectives: to assert a political point of view and to tell a story of frightening adventure. It is often difficult to argue a political argument while telling a good story (think of Ellen's last season, which is very political but very entertaining). Beyond Rangoon finds a good balance between politics and narration. <br /> <br /> I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and knew the oppressive political situation in Burma. The film was mainly a dramatization of what I already knew. But I thought the film was about Aung San Suu Kyi and the faceless dictators who had been trying to silence her for years. The device of presenting an unknown scene through the eyes of a character to whom the viewer can identify is quite common, but it is rather well done in this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the true measure of the movie was its entertainment value. Arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant and unfamiliar place to shake her off her depression after the violent death of her husband and son. She is convincingly detached and depressed. Her state of mourning gives her a clear reason for her distracted wandering in the midst of a dangerous situation she does not understand, which she would otherwise be too smart to stumble upon. <br /> <br /> Once the dangers will become such. It is obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of sorrow, she is trapped, without easy way out. This puts her on an adventure path where she needs her intelligence to survive. The authors deserve to be commended for making her intelligent and resourceful enough to deal with many dangerous situations, while finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble from the get-go. The staging is strong too, maintaining the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship. <br /> <br /> This film had an extra impact on me and my wife because of other events of the same period. We were preparing for a trip to India and heard new information about Western tourists being held hostage by a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite different from escaping an oppressive dictatorship. But the film and the news shared the fact of avoiding a danger in an unknown country. This common feature has given the film a meaning that exceeds the strength of its own skillful narrative. The film illustrates the worst nightmare of international tourists.
