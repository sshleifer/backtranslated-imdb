if you are going to see this movie, certainly do not go in this movie, because the wait of this film will be absolutely hilarious, because you will be disappointed. Yeah, sure it's funny sometimes, but I would consider it a political thriller disguised as a comedy. the performances are very good, especially on the part of jeff goldblum at the head of the electoral society. Even if he has little time in front of the screen, he makes a lasting impression. of course robin williams is excellent.Laura Linney is very good too what a surprise. she is one of the best actresses in Hollywood and one scene in particular shows it well. this film makes you think. And if a comedian presented himself as president and actually won? would the country be better or would it be broken into a million pieces?
