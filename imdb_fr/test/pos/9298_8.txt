Let's face it, Australian television is mostly horrible, but it's a real rough diamond that few people watch. The Chaser group, which produces the satirical newspaper and CNNN, is trying something new by mixing live comedy, pre-recorded sketches and political satire on a public-facing show, somehow like Rove, but funny . They love to stir up controversy and this is causing some of the funniest moments in the series, including Chris telling his wife to "freeze" live on TV and Julian giving a check of novelty signed by Saddam Heusein to the head of the AWB. It must be one of the funniest Australian shows since the Micallef program.
