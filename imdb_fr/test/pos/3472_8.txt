Let's be clear from the beginning: I am a jerk with the emotional sensitivity of the cubic stone. Therefore, I consider the dramas of people with disabilities, social stigma or any other problem they have and that they cry over and over again about it like stupid movies and bad taste. I mean, if you have a message, you can say it without the help of sick or pitiful people. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this movie. These are people who have incredible bad luck in personal health, but they do not cry, on the contrary, they try to live and people try to "protect" or "take care" of them by removing them life. The message is to live life to the fullest, even if the end is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: the dramas of sick people, this one is a guardian. It's sad, but hopeful. I like James McAvoy, although he still seems to play the arrogant rebel. I also say that Steven Robertson played very well. Either that or he really has partial paralysis. :)
