I try to be diverse in my films. I can enter "Pride and Prejudice" as easily as in "Missing Acts". Love Jones is my favorite of all time, this is the criterion by which I judge of any modern urban romantic comedy. Very well filmed, the plan of Nia and Darius going up Lakeshore Drive on the Motorcycle is one of the classic films of 3 seconds of all time. Of course, no one will ever remember. When it came out, I thought it would be a new paradigm for making modern urban films, good actors, no guns, etc. The film industry has disappointed me to a certain extent, you will sometimes have your Drumline, or Roll Bounce, or "Why do I get married" from Tyler Perry. So, whenever I need to see "my people" presented on screen in a very professional and elegant way, I connect to Love Jones. There is no better movie ever made, to many people and opinions for that. But it's my personal best. My favorite phrase from Love Jones "Baby, I just want to come talk!"
