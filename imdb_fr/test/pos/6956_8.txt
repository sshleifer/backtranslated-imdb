Director Jay Craven's adaptation of Howard Frank Mosher's "Where the Rivers Flow North" is one of the finest transitions in on-screen literature. Craven is an admirer of Mosher's work - he also directed "A Stranger in the Kingdom". <br /> <br /> The cast is superb - especially Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal. Torn proposes what could be the most beautiful role of his career: Noel Lord, the independent and fiercely independent former logger who is at the center of this story. Tantoo Cardinal's portrait of Lord's resident housekeeper is also final. I am both amazed and disappointed that none of them were nominated for an Oscar at the release of this film. The performances of this caliber must be recognized. The only character who is a little difficult to swallow for me is the leader of the power company played by Michael J. Fox. He looks too much like a child in this role. I imagine that juvenile appearances are a curse, no matter how many people want them. <br /> <br /> Craven has done a good job of staging the Vermont character of the early twentieth century - places, angles, scenery, all combine to transport the viewer to the time and place of the story. Photo director Paul Ryan was exceptional. The score of the Horseflies is also excellent - it goes perfectly with the atmosphere and the landscapes. <br /> <br /> And the story itself ...? One of the most fascinating portraits of the fiercely independent American pioneering spirit - a trait that is in decline nowadays. When it appears in modern times, the person is often viewed with suspicion and disdain. In Noel Lord, we have a character we can admire for his values, and even for his obstinacy. <br /> <br /> This is not a heavy "period piece", but a vibrant look on a bygone era. , and a type of character that has virtually disappeared. They are not gold plated heroes, but real people, with their strengths and weaknesses. struggling in a hostile environment to live their lives and at the same time be at peace with the world in which they live. Like today, there are those who hold power who would have the opposite.
