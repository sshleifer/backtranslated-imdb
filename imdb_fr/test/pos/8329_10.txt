Walking With Dinoasaurs is an exciting new program that uses amazing visual graphics to display living dinosaurs. The information presented here is staggering. The moods of the series are changing to catch your attention, such as dramatic music in combat. There is clear evidence of a documentary that is cracking! My greatest thanks to the authors, directors and producers, not to mention the other people involved. If you come across this video in stores, I suggest you buy it not only for the graphics, but also for the extreme efforts and productive work of the series. 10/10
