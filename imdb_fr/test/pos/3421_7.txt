POSSIBLE SPRAYERS <br /> <br /> No one is likely to take a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it concerns the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. Hilary Swank embodies a South African exile who returns to her hometown as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of South Africa's parliament who was tortured by prison guard Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who seeks to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt to conceal her undeniably American accent. Nevertheless, she is the only known actor in the film, and that would probably not have been done without her or such a well-known person. She does a fair job. However, Ejiofer and Muller (pronounced in the German way with a culmination on the "u") are remarkable, as is Jamie Barlett as chief of police, responsible for the murder of Mpondo's comrade and captive companion. The scenes of torture are shown in brief flashes but they are lively and credible. What is not credible is the Truth and Reconciliation process - if it is not. "Red Dust" should be seen for this reason alone, because it was and is incredible that ANC prisoners can forgive the torturers, and it is as close as possible, we will probably see the process in action.
