All Americans who think they understand the Second World War should see this film. Few Hollywood films on the war have challenged the stereotype of Japanese soldiers: unemotional brutes obeying orders without thinking. We like to think that every Japanese was ready and able to fight to the death until the day we bombed Nagasaki. "Fires on the Plain" shows a different reality: troops insufficiently fed, demoralized and hungry to the point of becoming cannibals. They refer euphemistically to human flesh as "monkey meat". The film and novel on which he was based also put to death the myth that Japanese soldiers all preferred death to surrender: they had good reason to believe that their enemies were in no mood to take prisoners . For me, this raises a question that most Americans prefer to avoid: if the Japanese armed forces were beaten so much at this point in the war, why was it necessary to neutralize Hiroshima?
