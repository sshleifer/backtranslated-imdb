Before seeing this film, I suggest that the viewer eliminates any expectation that the victims of the crimes described will obtain the same treatment and the same consideration as the author. There have been a lot of films on victims of crime. This one is about the murderer. <br /> <br /> "Dead Man Walking" finds realism in the simplicity of the story: no crack lawyer comes to save William Poncelet or any dramatic story. The film does not try to put it in a good light; he is guilty, disgusting, racist and responsible for heinous killings. In view of all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: to look at him as a human being despite his crimes. In this way, the film puts into question the notion of "justice" given by the death penalty. Whether you are for or against the death penalty, the film raises questions as to whether the culprits can find redemption, unfairness in the justice system and the justification of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> The great performances of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. In particular, the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penn's abilities.
