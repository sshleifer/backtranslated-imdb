I really like this film: music, cinematography, acting, history and all Mormon pictures. It is not because they are clich√©s that they are not true! It's not perfect, it's a movie after all. Although the excommunications took place in well-lit rooms with beautiful large desks and chairs, it was quite appropriate to describe them as the dark and cold scene they made in this film. I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop, smoking a cigarette. I thought it was so cool. I mean, I believe the angels watch over us. What are we supposed to do in the meantime? Smoking is a way for some people to spend time waiting. I loved the irony, because Mormons do such a thing as smoking. I saw this film 7 times in Salt Lake cinemas and I cried every time! It's blowing me. And I watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time. I would jump at the opportunity to see him on the big screen. I hope that the Tower Theater in Salt Lake will bring it back regularly at the time of the General Conference as a cult film (pun intended, but no offense envisaged).
