While browsing the channels, I was lucky to find the beginning of this film. I must admit that it caught my attention almost immediately. I like old movies and it's or should be considered a classic! One of the most wonderful rarities of this film is that the main character was not only a woman but also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie!
