I just bought this movie last night and I love it. Everyone has played very well, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The plot was great and, as Dunn said in the DVD supplements, they felt like reliving the whole thing. This film made me the first place in my favorite movies! I can not help but replay again and again scenes, just to see them again. I have never done that with any other movie. I would definitely recommend this video to other people because it's a great movie and if you like Bam Margera, it's a perfect movie for you !! The small montages they show between each scene are just great. I think that must be my favorite parts of the movie. They are very sad, mainly with music from the band "HIM", which is of course my favorite band.
