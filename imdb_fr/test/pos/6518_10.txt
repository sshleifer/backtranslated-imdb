Beautiful family film that should be a staple at Christmas time. It's a mystery to me why that's not the case. A real lost film that I met for the first time, glittering on my old 19 "RCA in black and white, while the movie Million Dollar was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York.This fantastic film directed by Rudolph Mate should be under everyone's Christmas tree But this was never shown in the personal video, and I think I've seen some of it on AMC a few years ago, before many of their older films are removed from the rotation TCM should take over to play it at Easter or Christmas Eve Any movie with Santa Claus, Aunt Bee, the hostess Cupcake Lady and an actor with the name King, can not be bad Ann Blyth as "Sally" is a bundle of energy During her school years, she rushes to the chapel to ask Sainte-Anne to help her and guide her confused family struggling with financial difficulties It works. After graduating, she places a statue of St. Anne in her own room. At one point, the entire O'Moyne residence is transferred to another address. I think it was done to put an end to an argument between the O'Moynes neighbors and the ugly mate next door. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play the lonely grandfather in his sleep. Overall, it's a satisfying cinematic experience.
