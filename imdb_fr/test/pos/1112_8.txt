We see a man move from town to town and change dramatically - his family asks questions, but he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Strange and brilliant film to project here in Israel. Wonderful places, great actors, a film that pretends to be a "thriller" but is rather a case study of madness in the main man. <br /> <br /> The film was well above the other films screened as part of the AICE festival here in Israel. Good luck to the team that came to this film. It's a Grand Guignol, a little black masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My only criticism that prevents a "10" is that sound and music are sometimes irresistible. This tends to hurt images, which speak for themselves.
