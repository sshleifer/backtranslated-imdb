This film is the most moving and funny film I've seen in a long time. As a housewife and a fan (Rupert), I found her friendly. Anyone who misunderstands Dirk's angry outburst is wrong. Kathy Bates is not really an actress I know but she is perfect, all the cast is perfect for their roles. Julie Andrews held me in my arms. I look at her after reading Rupert's self-biography, which makes it even more fun. It is sometimes very moving. I'm not really a fan of the type of music in the film, but you're attracted to romance and see that you sing songs for days. This film deserves to be more widely available. Our favorite The scene involves Dirk and a gun and his pants, look at him and see!
