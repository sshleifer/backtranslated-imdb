For some reason, I still love movies that people hate, when I really do not think they are so bad - and that's one of those movies. In the case of this film, I think it is much too criticized, I'm really not so bad as a movie. In fact, I think it's one of the best suites. "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" begins the night before Halloween, where Michael brutally murdered Jamie Lloyd (who was taken captive by "Man In Black" in Part 5) after the birth of his baby. We are then introduced to the Strode family, who now lives by chance in the former home of the Myers (which seems to change in every movie). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, the now grown-up boy who survived the original murders. They have to fight together to save Jamie's baby from a perverted cult that caters to Michael, while Michael himself is driven to kill by an old Celtic ritual where he has to sacrifice a whole family to Haddonfield. <br /> <br /> surely one of the best suites in the series, in my opinion anyway, and I can not understand all the hatred she had. There was a good suspense, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, I admit it), scary moments here and there, and many gore and knife nicks to appease all the gorehounds. Not all the actors were great, but it was pretty convincing for me. Marianne Hagan is the main woman and she is very friendly. Paul Rudd plays the role of an adult Tommy Doyle. He is also very talented and plays his role well. The rest of the cast (aside from the awesome Donald Pleasance) is not commendable, but it was not bad either, all things considered. I still do not know if it was absolutely necessary to explain why Michael Kills was killed, but it finally turned out well and I was not sorry for the way they tied everything up. The open conclusion was also strange, but could have been something more. <br /> <br /> I also saw the famous "Producer's Cut" of this film, its original editing, and I think that in some ways it is better. This explains in more detail the curse of Thorn that animates Michael and that presents some additional scenes that really helped to support the film. Moreover, the end was much better in my opinion. It seemed more natural to us than the conclusion we had in the studio version of the film. I hope Dimension publishes this alternative version of the film, because I personally think it's better. The chances of this being is very slim though. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" is a very good sequel and will delight all fans of the series. This movie is not the best of all horror movies, but it's worth it if you want to see Michael doing his thing. Just do not expect shine, and you'll enjoy it. 7/10.
