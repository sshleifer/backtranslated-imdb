When I watched this movie as a teenager, I tried making the soundtrack. Some bands of the soundtrack that I still did not know. However, during the movie, I had already noticed its quality. U2, Blondie, Police. , Quincy Jones, Commodores. Sensational soundtracks. <br /> <br /> In Brazil, it has been a long time since this film was not shown on television. Today he went on cable television and I remembered being able to access the site for comment. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie surprised me a lot, but that's what happens in real life. Not always, whatever the thought of being the ideal, that's what happens. <br /> <br /> Life brings us a lot of surprises.
