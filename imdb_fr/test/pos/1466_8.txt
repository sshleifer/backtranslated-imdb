A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who will soon be a woman. Charlotte and Venorica, both trapped by their lifeless lives and do not know how to cope. Charlotte owns a beauty clinic, she broke up with her aggressive ex-husband and moved into a single apartment with all the furniture stored, except for her large bed. Veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog. She is sensitive and disturbed by her mother's visit and bad relations with her father. Her only hope is that the next transsexual operation turns her into a real woman and everything will be fine. All she can do now is wait for a certificate of approval. <br /> <br /> Then these two people meet by chance and, little by little, they are involved in the lives of others. Sparks separate them, but no one is brave enough. face the truth because they are not willing to accept change as most people do. Finally, the end is very satisfying and leaves a little imagination to think about it. <br /> <br /> The excellent work of the director gives me a very good impression, she manages very well the development of the characters, the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense. Plus, I'm so obsessed with the dark lights of the whole apartment, Delphic but full of desire. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are incredible in their roles, a very impressive performance and chemical reaction between them are authentic and convincing. <br /> <br /> This indie Swedish film talks about dating and change, no matter if you are gay or straight, man or woman, the quirk of life exists everywhere, every time you come across it, you'll be hesitant and disconcerted, but at least do not be afraid, follow your heart and choose the right path.
