For all those who believe that dialogue has value, and who appreciate a joke that is smart enough for you to take seriously, this movie will surprise you. This is not a "polar" for people who may not be able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). <br /> <br /> Cornell teaches in southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel for four years, his wife is divorcing, he drinks a little too much and is blessed or cursed with a caustic spirit, which he freely gives to his students. He recommended a friend for promotion and a bright young student submitted a manuscript as an independent project. Cornell does not even want to read it, give him an "A" and push him to the side. Leaning back with a drink in his office, he looks out the window as the brilliant young student falls in front of his window on the path of the meeting on the sidewalk during a brilliant meeting. <br /> <br /> Hal comes to talk, and they argue, drink again. Cornell realizes he has to read the manuscript now. When he returns home, his wife waits with divorce papers. He drinks again. She leaves and leaves for a professors business, only to find her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife learns that the student is dead, she faints and learns that she had an affair with the student. Of course, it makes him drink more seriously. The next morning, he wakes up to find himself in the dormitory of one of his students, a freshman named Syd (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> He feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and learns that he has been poisoned, is irreversible and has 24 to 48 hours to live. He does not have a lot of time to find out who killed him, and there are secondary intrigues, motivations, relationships and surprises at every turn, although everything makes sense in the end. All his discoveries and exchanges are adorned with sarcasm, a dark spirit, and lively observations. Let's just say that this movie will give a new meaning to the adage "Publish or perish". <br /> <br /> There is no bad performance in this film. There are recurring images and symbolism used at regular intervals. Watch for cracked glass and distorted images through the glass. Some of the shots are revolutionary for 1988 and some violent actions are carefully and skillfully choreographed. The music is discreet and appropriate, although sometimes it makes its own statement, in the lyrics of the songs. The images in this film are impressive. <br /> <br /> In case of failure, it is that the 20 minutes of opening move a little slowly and almost put you to sleep. But the pace is increasing rapidly, with just the right amount of exposure between the action segments. <br /> <br /> There are no explicit sexual encounters, although there is violence and rude language. <br /> <br /> This is a writer's film, best suited to those with a good sense of humor about their success or failure. I think if you take it seriously, you already have big problems.
