If I had only seen Nurse Betty's poster, I probably would not have touched her with a ten-foot stick. But after hearing a positive buzz, and knowing that it made noise in Cannes, I decided to try it. What I got is a really nice movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by the dirty comedian Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> The film oscillates constantly between comedy, drama, novel and thriller. Yet, despite this apparent identity crisis, it resists pretty well. I found my eyes on the screen from start to finish, always waiting for the new twist of the story. The whole cast is loud, if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that director Neil Labute (who caused a sensation a few years ago with the very impressive and dark film of the Compagnie des hommes') got too based on many Hollywood clich√© conventions. The musical effects creating a mood that filled our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! And he did the old classic game "Let's take some of the minor characters and associate them at the end with an illogical and useless love story," just to be absolutely certain that everyone comes home with a smile . Why do directors and writers have to treat their audience like idiots? <br /> <br /> But the film is still too pleasant to be dragged far away by these annoying irritations. In a very mediocre year for film, "Betty Nurse" is one of the most enjoyable surprises of the year 2000. 8 out of 10.
