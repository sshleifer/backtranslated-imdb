After a long time, the Marathi cinema arrived with a good movie. This film is one of the best Marathi movies ever made. This shows how an old grandfather is trying to save his grandson's eye. He tries everything possible in his hands to save the child's eyes. A doctor and a family member try to help him in his attempt. <br /> <br /> The action of the grandfather, the boy and the doctor is simply superb. They showed the true image of a typical Marathi life. Every action has a meaning. I would recommend watching this movie, because at first I thought it would be documentary, but it was above my expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie will really touch your heart. I would expect more Marathi movies to come up with performances like this one.
