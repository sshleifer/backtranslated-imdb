with that, carry the same gloomy weaknesses that we all unfortunately have: lying, deception, laziness, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, as an American, I was shocked to find that corruption and racism exist today. police forces, as evidenced by the horrific detective from the Duval County Sheriff's Department and police work with the murder of a white tourist and a 15-year-old accused black male. I am ashamed to be ashamed to find that detectives are protected from their abusive work while a young man's life is suspended in the twisted balance of justice. <br /> <br /> However, there is also a story of hope in our justice system and how poorly paid public defenders stranded by their weapons (intended irony) and forced the truth to the detectives. I wanted to fly to Florida and tell any influential person what a great team of public defenders Duval County has; these lawyers care about the "little" man and, more importantly, about justice. <br /> <br /> The other thread is about faith and the family. Praise to the accused's family and his strong Christian convictions (to submit any dedicated religion) and to his wonderful family values. I hope they will win their case against the Duval County Sheriff's Department. <br /> <br /> Congratulations for justice !!! Congratulations for the little guy !!!
