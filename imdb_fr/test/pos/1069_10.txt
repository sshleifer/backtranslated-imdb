I first saw this movie about 15 years ago and have been thrilled with it ever since. It's such a nice experience that I could look at it with joy any time of the year. However, for me, this is the ultimate Christmas film. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is black and white is irrelevant, although I often wonder how it would be in color. You can just have that warm and radiant feeling by watching the Christmas events unfold. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly fine, and Greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character, Sakall is a dazzling joy to watch. <br /> <br /> It is a slight relief that certainly does not tax the brain, but leaves you happy to have seen it. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for it to be available on DVD in the UK. I will certainly be at the head of the line to buy it.
