A group of uncomfortable teenagers visit a former funeral home for a Halloween party. They find themselves trapped inside and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally woken up. The possessed teenagers start killing others and seem headed by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) who floats and speaks in a very serious voice. The remaining teenagers who are not yet possessed are forced to fight the demons and try to escape from the house. <br /> <br /> This is a decent horror movie with exceptional special effects, among some nude scenes as usual) digging a guy's eyes and pushing a tube of lipstick in his nipple. There is also a scene where a couple makes love in a coffin and where a guy gets bitten his tongue. It's a great movie to watch with a group of friends late at night while eating pizzas. The terrible acting and the atrocious dialogue almost ruin it. Overall, I would give it a 7 out of 10.
