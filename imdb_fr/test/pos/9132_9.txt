I imagine that Melville wanted this film to be the definition of cool; he has the cool approach to thrillers of the late '60s / early' 70s - the same quirk. THE RED CIRCLE, a bitter and fatalistic story, is also the playground of Delon, Bourvil, Volont√© and Montand in their determining roles. <br /> <br /> Bourvil is a policeman who has three cats and a daily routine in his apartment. Delon is a thug. Montand is a sick and failed cop. Will plays an escaped suspect. THE RED CIRCLE is of course well above a heist film; Melville uses his techniques - long, wordless detailed descriptions of each step of the heist, and so on. Still, this action drama is way better than his other movies - and it's very unlikely they'll be so much better. The look of LE CIRCLE ROUGE is very particular to Melville, very Melvillian. <br /> <br /> Delon was lively and cool; Bourvil brings his talent, and Montand plays perhaps the most beautiful role of this film. his performance has an unexpected warmth. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the characters are just sketched, no more than strictly necessary, and are personalities. Or masks; yet, the portrait is inspired, economic but suggestive. <br /> <br /> Another film that proves that Delon is a good, a very good actor; and the fact that he is not a genius does not imply that he should be scorned as a fourth-class actor. He is good, he can bear the proximity of a Bourvil and a Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. Before THE RED CIRCLE, Melville realized, in the late '50s, a tasteless and boring black pastiche (which featured him) and, after only a decade, he was in great shape with this rather startling action drama. Stylistically, it's a success. <br /> <br /> Before I saw THE RED CIRCLE, I was not a fan of Melvillian; now, I guess I am rather one. <br /> <br /> THE RED CIRCLE is a drama, namely an action drama, one of the most demanding genres. Melville scores.
