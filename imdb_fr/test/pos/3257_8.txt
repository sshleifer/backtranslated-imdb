This Australian thriller, at once casual, discreet and discreet, unfolds with a relaxed ease and a relaxed self-confidence that is pleasing to see. Jimmy, a child of the impatient beaver working class (an attractive and flawless Heath Ledger) aspires to do something of his ordinary life without reward. Jimmy had his great luck when the local crime leader, Pando (a Bryan Brown), entrusted him with an easy messenger job of giving $ 10,000 to an old lady. Jimmy is struggling with serious knee problems when he loses Pando's money. Writer / director Gregor Jordan recounts with captivating simplicity how things are not always what they are supposed to be, young love, all the actions having consequences and this old heckling about the fact that crime does not pay works wonderfully marvelous wealth of well-observed minor strange details, a strong subtext about the ability of man's duel for good and evil, a pleasant sense of untrammeled irony, the frighteningly realistic way of presenting violence and the marvelous foundation of the assortment All intricate and intricately complex characters of low life in a banal, immediately recognizable and totally believable banal reality (eg Panda is played playing Scrabble with a stooge and momentarily interrupts a conversation professional with a colleague, with his son on the phone). Judging by his finely nuanced, two-fisted portrait, not to be overlooked with Pando, Bryan Brown is undoubtedly one of the best actors to ever have the grace of celluloid. A small sleeper robust and satisfactory.
