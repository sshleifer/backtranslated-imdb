What a wonderful film, filled with eccentric and unique characters that are wonderfully made by a big cast. The director has also done a great job in keeping the story, getting those great performances (not playing them with) and using music (and the wonderful music she has) to good effect. S. Epatha in the lead role is awesome. I've always heard how she was a brilliant actress and, although I appreciated her in Law and Order, it shows what she can do with a complicated and fulfilled role. Macy Gray is great, Mos Def, as usual, beautiful. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smits, great, and do not try to focus because he's a star. A real piece of play together. <br /> <br /> Rent it, enjoy it, enjoy it and cherish it. Something special.
