I will freely admit that I did not see the original movie, but I read the piece and so I have some basic information about "the original". If you eliminate the fact that this is a remake of an old classic, this movie is smart, witty, fresh and hilarious. Yes, casting decisions can seem strange, but they work. <br /> <br /> I am a fervent feminist and I am absolutely not offended by this film - despite what other women might say. It's NOT a movie for men to see (so please, ladies, do not drag your guys to see it with you, it's just cruel); women will have jokes, situations and relationships. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the depth with which Annette Bening brought her character ... she did a great job. Debra Messing was lovely and Candice Bergen was fantastic. Meg Ryan impressed me less ... she brought emotion to the table, but her comic interpretation was less strong. The all-female cast is strong, and it's really a kind of comedy to laugh loudly. I really enjoyed this movie and I intend to see him again with my mother. The women will understand.
