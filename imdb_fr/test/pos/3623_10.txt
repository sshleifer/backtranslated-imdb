I saw the film at the Closing Gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London, England. Enjoyed immensely. Although the crow and the Chinese policeman do not appear and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the author (screenwriter / director) expressed by Lord Richard Attenborough works very well. <br /> <br /> Rumor has it that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the movie for only a pint of beer. <br /> <br /> The film was shown to Spike, it was filmed before his death and enjoyed it a lot.
