This classic has so many great one-liners and hilarious scenes that I do not even know where to start. If you want advice on dating, it's here. Ignore completely the person you want, then say classic lines such as "Good chicken ...

He buys a car for no good reason to be able to murder two gang members ... paying with "CASH" ...... chunnng ... He buys an ice cream, simply because "it's America, n 'is this not?" he says, "and ends up wasting someone named" crazy to laugh - he laughs when he runs "just because he stole his camera.Object, this" giggler "is so fast that the regular gun of Bronson can not even catch him, he has to order a special just to get this elusive phenomenon.It is cleaned just to be able to eat a REALLY odorous meal (stuffed cabbage) in a rat trap with a couple of old people who like to wear 90-degree thick clothes, he starts in the dentistry business, he always seems to find a raven when he needs it (and it's the same!). Finally, he always seems to have a spear in case he needs to get rid of Chuck, Richie Cunningham's older brother, who is now in dire need of a makeover Anyway, all that will make sense once you get saw this classic ... all I can say is enjoy it! "I owed you this type "
