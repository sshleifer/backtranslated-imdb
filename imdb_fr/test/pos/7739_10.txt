What will Prospero be in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why should a man choose to live on an island with his daughter and his girlfriend? Because it is too difficult to live and to love in good conditions of "civilization". This man (John Cassavetes) is a giant with a broken heart, he can control the storm. He has the power, the strength but he is human. The deep love of life is the subject of this extraordinary film. The acting is incredible, all the genius of John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman, Shakespeare and Paul Mazursky of course. do not miss it, it will be a mistake, this movie is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. And I saw a lot of movies.
