Graphics is not the best part of the game. It's the best number one game in the series. Next to metro. He deserves a strong love. It's a crazy game. There are huge levels, huge unlockable characters ... it's just a huge game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even if the graphics are nil, it's not a good game. In fact, the graphics were good at the time. Today, graphics are shit. WE DO NOT CARE? As they say in Canada, it's fun, yes. (You have to go to Canada in THPS3) Well, I do not know if they say it, but they could. who knows. Well, Canadians do it. Wait a minute, I move away from the subject. This game is great. Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it. It's PURE BRILLIANCE.
