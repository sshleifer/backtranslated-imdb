... the opportunity to examine Ireland's past was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing this with my mother, who was originally from Cork, and looking, we talked and I learned a lot. of her on the way things were at the time. <br /> <br /> Things like Deasy and Co. was a non-alcoholic beverage company in Cork; how rain could really destroy a crop; how farmers used to collect the crop; how, in dance halls, women and men really had to stand along the opposite walls before the men came forward and asked the woman to dance; on the bellows that kept the fire; how did the priests really call the list of church donors and their gifts and a little bit of money at the time (that my dad helped me by showing me a holster displaying the coins, shillings and crowns that were used at the time England also)). <br /> <br /> I did not pay much attention to the quality of the film, but I was very grateful to have had the opportunity to revisit a period of time for some Irish. The story, but also that of some of our parents and grandparents, is only their childhood.
