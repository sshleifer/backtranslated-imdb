A classic film from the late 50s. The old-fashioned headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography and play of the youngest are compelling. In the sense of the 50s (which I love). <br /> <br /> The contemporary film "Far from Paradise", very artistic (over-artistic?), Reflects exactly this kind of film (and I suspect this film can be one of the models). A stupid plot, of course (hey, we are in 1959!), But as a movie - glorious! As a reflection of society, extremely interesting. And as a witness to the way Hollywood breaks with the idealistic portrayal of American sexual mores, fascinating.
