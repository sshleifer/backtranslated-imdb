I love this film, it is excellent and so funny, Ben is in shape and I would like to meet him on vacation! I rate this film at 10 because it's his band and I hope they will never succeed because it would never be the same. It's funny when André looks at the moon and he shouts to Nicole to "go out and look at the moon", it always makes me laugh and I never get old. Another thing is that Nicole looks much older than 14 years old ... but she's an actress gr8. But I need help with something Is not the name of the song played in the end when Nicole and André are dancing ??? This is really a problem for me because I want 2 not what it is because it is a beautiful song !!
