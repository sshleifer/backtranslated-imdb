Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur" (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock film, "Sabotage" made in 1936 that has a completely different plot) is not the greatest film of Master of Suspense. It does not have the depth of "Vertigo" (1958) nor the dark atmosphere of "Rebbeca" (1940) and it certainly does not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in "Notorious" (1946). It offers thrills, adventure and a highlight. Both tracks, of course, are quite weak. It's easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the role of Robert Cummings and Barbara Stanwyck for the role played by Priscilla Lane. In addition, the patriotic speeches of which Cuumming speaks (written by Dorothy Parker) date badly, and the encounter with the circus troupe is poorly made (the beard of the bearded woman is clearly false). However, the last half-hour is within your reach, the highest point at the top of Stature of Liberty is very well done and the film is a clear predecessor of "North By Northwest" (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the beginning of the shooting at Aircraft Factory is a superb sequence. It's not the best film Hitch ever made, but it's probably one of his most entertaining films.
