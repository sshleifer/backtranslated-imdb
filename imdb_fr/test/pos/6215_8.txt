In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic children's shows I grew up on. Seymour was a big, fuzzy green puppet, with a huge tooth-grinning smile that almost cut off his head. I remember him wearing a variety of Elton John-style shades. and had a guy from Jesus in a white tuxedo sitting next to him. They would have a moral discussion and then make a song about it. <br /> <br /> Do not remember much else besides the opening theme, Seymour and Hippie. <br /> <br /> Nobody other than me know it at all. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was produced in Detroit, as a previous post said, it was not just local. Seymour made me think of Sherlock the Squirrel from the Magic Garden (another psychedelic children's show, if there is one).
