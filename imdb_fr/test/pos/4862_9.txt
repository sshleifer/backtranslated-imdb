Cleopatra 2525 is a very entertaining and entertaining show. You should not take the entire show seriously, but if you want to have fun, it's your TV show. Made by the producers of Xena is a guarantee of quality, and Cleopatra 2525 is not so different from Xena. The formula of warrior women is brought into the future, where they are not forced to fight against warriors or gods, but against dangerous robots that remain on the surface and where humans are forced to live underground. During Cleopatra's two seasons, they develop an interesting and fun underground world, and we get to know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They are all different but, as a team, they work really well. The three main actresses have appeared before in Xena, like most regular / guest actors (some Hercules faces are also known, or both series). I especially liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from all her roles I knew before. So, if you like Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you do not know them, try it: I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
