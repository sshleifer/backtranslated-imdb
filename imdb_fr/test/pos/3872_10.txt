by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who plays the role of Reggie, fights against the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find his father's killer. A week after his father's death, a preacher, Reverend Packer, arrived dead. Reggie was supposed to be the one who would kill him, but did he do it? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it a type of installation? Back in the Day also offers some romantic scenes. You see, Reggie falls in love with the preacher's daughter and J-Bone does not approve of his demon of love. As J-Bone tries to destroy what they have, Reggie learns that love is about forgiveness. But what does J-bone do? Does Reggie and his girlfriend separate or does it bring them closer? I like this movie because it lets you ask what's going to happen and did this or that. I like movies with suspense! It makes you want to be part of the movie to be able to detect things. I also like this movie because everything is set up, if you really pay attention!
