One of the funniest movies I've ever seen at the movies in the early '70s, and unfortunately it has only been on television a few times since. This film should be broadcast on video. This is Sellers in his most devious and slender role as a dishonest hospital administrator. Super casting, super movie. If someone has a good copy of VHS, I'd like to buy it.
