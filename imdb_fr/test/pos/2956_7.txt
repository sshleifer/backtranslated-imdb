The Lone Ranger was one of the heroes of my childhood, and I have never failed to witness his adventures in reruns on Saturday morning in the mid-50s. However, this film touched me up to I have the chance to get it today thanks to the library of my local library. During the course of the story, I was struck by a number of elements, because from the beginning, you have a new Lone Ranger theme song before hearing the traditional opening used in the TV show. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in a much expanded role, even if he manages to accumulate his lot of bumps, being beaten and shoot more than once. Perhaps the most interesting of all, the Ranger shoots to kill in a few situations, putting his character in conflict with the vision created for the TV series that he would never use his weapon to kill, only to protect himself or herself . <br /> <br /> Aside from that, you have a fairly traditional western adventure. The Ranger and Tonto help an Indian tribe whose members are murdered by hooded raiders who try to find five medallions that together make up the key to a fabulous treasure. Interestingly, the leader of the wicked is an already rich woman, described disarmingly by Noreen Nash. Douglas Kennedy plays his best hand and it is not surprising to see Lane Bradford as one of the bad guys. Bradford's character was one of the men killed by the Lone Ranger, which led me to think how many times that could have happened in the television series. A quick check revealed that he had appeared on the show "The Lone Ranger" fifteen times, while Kennedy had appeared six times in total. <br /> <br /> The most interesting of all the elements in this photo is his attempt to present the Indians in a revisionist light at a time when television and Western cinemas still largely portrayed the red man as a wild illiterate. The character of James Rolfe (Norman Fredric) is the most revealing in this respect; He is an Indian who studied and became a doctor, then returned to the country of his tribe to meet the needs of all his citizens. For the sake of history, he had to emulate a white man to be accepted by local breeders. It was the most difficult thing for me to accept about storytelling because Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of the elderly chef Tomache (John Miljan). That nobody in history, with the exception of Paviva (Lisa Montell), knew that he was really an Indian, that seemed to me exaggerated. I suppose it was possible that he had left the tribe at an early age, but without this story in the background, it did not make sense to me that no one else in the tribe knew who he was. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it intrigues me so much, but after watching and reviewing more than two hundred Westerns on this site, I came across three films over the last month that use a flat-bottomed gimmick like the one performed by Tonto's Scout horse on this image. Roy Rogers' Trigger performed a similar feat in "Son of Paleface" from 1952, and I still caught him in "The Big Country" from 1958 by a horse named Old Thunder in this movie. It's a bit of a comic relief in a situation that does not normally occur for a horse, and it makes me curious to know when this thing could have been done for the first time. I will have to continue watching older westerns. Not to be outdone, Silver also had the chance to shine on the image, thus realizing the rescue of an Indian baby about to be used as hostage by the bad Brady. <br /> <br /> About gadgets, Clayton Moore borrowed a tactic from the TV show when he disguised himself as a gentleman from the south to hide the bad guys by masquerading as hooded looters. Whenever he did it in the half-hour format, he was still smart enough to hide his true features, usually with a beard as is the case here. One of the most interesting episodes I remember was the story of a Ranger under the pseudonym Abraham Lincoln. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on two gaffes I spotted en route. In one of the first scenes of the opening, an Indian is shot by one of the hooded plunderers and, moreover, there is blood on his shirt but no bullet. Later in the story, Ross Brady and Wilson confront the Indians after they kidnap one of the bad guys in jail. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the raiders, but he is immediately shown about to go on horseback with Wilson.
