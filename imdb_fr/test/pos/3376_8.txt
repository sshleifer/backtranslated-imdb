The principle is rather original and well thought out, but unfortunately, a good story is a very small budget that does not even allow decent special effects. Jeff Fahey does his best among a poor cast, just like the always beautiful Linda Hoffman. They should do more movies together. The film, even if it is not worth renting, deserves at least a viewing.
