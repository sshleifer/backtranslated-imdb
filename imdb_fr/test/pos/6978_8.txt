Early coppola with a sublime cast that most people have never had the chance to see (pity). There is something wonderful in this film: the best performance of Shirley Knight (an underrated actress), a road trip of the late 1960s, James Caan very restrained and moving, Robert Duvall in a role for which he was born (edgy, solitary, motorcyclist) and a touching scenario with F. Coppola driving. <br /> <br /> If it had been done five years LATER by some, it would have been a success (both for timing). Anyway, I recommend it to anyone who does not need explosions in outer space, bad jokes or a budget of billions of dollars to sit a few hours and watch a story unfold. Give this one a chance if you can find it!
