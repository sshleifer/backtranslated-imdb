John Huston was seriously ill when he did his last feat. This is his testament: uncompromising, difficult, thousands of miles away from fashion and crazy, it will be the best "last film" you can dream.A very austere scenario, no action, no true hero, but a group of people struggling with the vanity of life, the ephemeral years and death.The party does not deceive people for long.Welcome, warmth and affection emanate songs and meal, complete with the turkey and the pudding.But time has partly ruined Julia's voice, first crackles in the mirror.Then the camera leaves the room where the guests are gathered and searches the room of the old lady.For sure , hers seems to have A happy life, but a life that ends inexorably - A plan shows towards the end of the film Julia on her future deathbed. Maybe an unsatisfied life because she remained single, without children to pursue. Only a few poor things, yellowish photographs, trinkets and knick-knacks .... But are the hopes and dreams of a human being all fulfilled? Look at Gretta.He's a married woman of about 35, she is still beautiful and healthy but she knows that something is broken.What she is today, Julia be tomorrow, that's why in her flow of consciousness, she goes back in her past, to discover how deeply her memories are heartbreaking: a young man committed suicide for her, symbol of his youth endangered. The final monologue, if we listen to it carefully , we all commit ourselves to this eternal tragedy, the human condition doomed to failure, the masterly lesson of John Huston.
