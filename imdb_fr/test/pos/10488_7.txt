I did not know this movie well until I saw it included in a list of the 20 best spaghetti westerns I've met recently (after the marathon I made in recent weeks with sub-genre films) ; so it was good that the film was broadcast almost immediately on Italian late-night television (for the first time, I am sure, in many years)! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast has not been great recently: I recorded the film on VHS but I decided not to keep it for this reason; In fact, the very next day I watched the movie, I discovered that it was available on a Region 2 Italy DVD (with an interview with uncredited screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi). After being sufficiently impressed, I decided to order it. from time to time, even if I knew that I would not go to DVD before a long time, I like to leave a little time between watching a movie and the next one! A short parenthesis here: when I recently bought a series of Spaghetti Westerns on an Italian DVD, I chose not to order FACE TO FACE by Sergio Sollima (1967), because I felt it was was acting on an unfounded case; However, I just learned that the disc actually contains an interview with the director (as was the case with THE BIG GUNDOWN [1966], which I bought). It seemed confusing to me that Sollima did not offer a similar contribution to the DVD edition of this film when he actually considered FACE TO FACE as his favorite work (according to the director's biography of talent included on the disc of Blue Underground Region 1 from another Sollima Spaghetti Western - RUN, MAN, RUN [1968]); The problem is that I liked THE BIG GUNDOWN so much that I followed it while watching FACE TO FACE via the recording I had been made by Italian TV! I ordered the DVD of this movie now - especially since it is still cheap - but as I said about a second look at THE PRICE OF POWER (although I can always consult the interview of Sollima when the disc arrives) ... <br /> <br /> OK, the film in question is a Western western spaghetti quite unusual and very interesting, even ambitious: it is about a transposition of the the case of the assassination of JFK in an Old West setting! In fact, it is reminiscent of Anthony Mann's laconic black-and-white thriller, THE TALL TARGET (1951), about an assassination attempt on the life of the United States. President Abraham Lincoln. It features one of the most popular Italian stars of this sub-genre, Giuliano Gemma, in what is perhaps its most impressive role in the West (many of his other films tended to look light) . The support troop includes at least two other notable: Van Johnson (in one of his Italian films, almost insignificant), killed by US President killed in the post-civil war, Dallas, and Fernando Rey, at the head Sudden conspiracy - who plots his assassination but also conveniently maneuver the new acting head of the United States, the vice president of Johnson, by means of blackmail! <br /> <br /> Benito Stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who is pursuing Gemma throughout the photo and with whom he has committed several times in a "duel in the dark" - the weapons at a fire resting on the ground rather than in their respective cases and the only light in the room provided by the tips of the cigars of the cowboys! Ray Saunders also plays the role of black teammate Gemma, whose story eventually turns into a condemned figure of "Lee Harvey Oswald". Stelvio Massi - who later made his weapons, as a director on a number of poliziotteschi - is behind the luminous cinematography of the film; Similarly, Luis Enrique Bacalov provides yet another great score "Euro-Cult" - which is sufficiently different from the style of Ennio Morricone to be equally distinguishable. The direction given by Valerii is perhaps as imposing as in other spaghetti westerns, but he manages the procedure with sufficient efficiency (the last exchange of shots is particularly well done); the film is certainly one of the most underrated entries of the sub-genre and, for those who wish, the novelty of the plot of the plot should make it an element to watch ...
