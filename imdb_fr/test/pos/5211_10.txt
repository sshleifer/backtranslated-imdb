For the main critics of the film ... The love story: it was not a love story. They were two panicky people trying to find humanity in ANYTHING. The same thing happened with the soldiers and the Russian boy. He added a feminine touch, but let's look at American movies ... not close to the love story. There was no scenario: does the war have a scenario? I think it's silly criticism. The story is the following. They start with 400 men and the film shrinks to show the lives of a dozen men and their role in the death of each. Death is the ultimate end of all history. It's not because there was no happy ending that it does not have a scenario. <br /> <br /> There was a horrible truth in this movie. I would not call it necessarily "anti-war". There was of course a political statement, but the film was not just about politics. In fact, except for a few cases where the captain? appeared, there was never a stifling air of Nazi Germany. They were far enough away from the main Nazi party. Big cats were not going to Russia! <br /> <br /> Maybe not quite right and it's not a Hollywood hit, but it shows a good knowledge of the private soldier (I would say exactly from almost war) and what they have to cross. It was a losing battle, of course, the movie will be depressing. And to the person who said it was rash (and stupid) to portray even the Germans as victims: there are victims on all sides in every war (any real soldier will tell you). <br /> <br /> is a nice balance between film and documentary. Some problems with this when we only discuss for one, but it instills the best of both worlds. Look as such. Be careful, however, because it is a difficult film to watch if it is not graphically, emotionally. <br /> <br /> I wait until they make a film about Iraq. He will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial, I want to see who has the courage to do it first. (Jarhead does not count)
