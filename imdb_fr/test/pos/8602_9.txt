I did not really focus on the more important genocidal aspects of the story (although the horrible images of the beginning are very powerful). The human story of the girl and her family really fascinates me. Imagine living your life without knowing if you have a time bomb inside you. I was really torn to see Yasuko being rejected as "contaminated" by the bomb. The image that stays with me the most is when Yasuko stands in front of the mirror combing, watching her form herself en masse.
