How on earth can people give this movie a low note. Unbelievable. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of merit that I can only imagine that these detractors have been weaned on blockbusters and porn. (If it sounds bad, it's because I just wiped my 400-word original text) Tom Wilkinson really impressed me. All greet the guy. It is a performance of considerable subtlety and enormous skill. His evolution as an actor from the movie Full Monty to this masterpiece of a performance is incredible. One of the best things to do in making movies in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson is a little less imposing, because of the glint in her eye that says, "see me, this brazen woman here ... you can not guess what I'm going to do because I do not know it either! 'It seems to be something she can not help but show us in every role, but she's still an actress of tremendous ability and presence. sexy here, as she needs to be, and fair to her for that: it's a screen quality that normally, for me, she does not have in previous movies. <br /> <br /> As you would expect that Rupert Everett, required to play a doctoral course in How Not To Toss Toss on Heading to Hell on the basis of total selfishness, forces him to play a higher class character at the end of the 30s. He is so skinny here, throughout the movie, however, I'm worried about him. Linda Bassett's housekeeper is also Excellent: a small role but with a big rebound to make, it makes you think about the talent we have in Britain in the game of characters. I want to see more of her. <br /> <br /> The narrative arc is going well; it's a pretty interesting plot, as nobody in the cinema seems to be trying to convince Joe Public that there's nothing new under the sun, although he's moving away from the 40's melodrama in the last movie". But no matter, it's a good 80 minutes for anyone with half the money. Congratulations to Julian Fellowes for his first directorial work: o We need more movies like this. He shows great skill in adapting the original novel and telling a story with great efficiency and subtlety. And also congratulate Mr. Tom Wilkinson for his huge show. What a geezer. <br /> <br /> T.
