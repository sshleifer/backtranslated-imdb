"The Boogens", a great version of the early '80s, is an attractive and moronic version of $ 1.50 from the awesome underground creature that makes this entertaining monster a messy food centered on a spooky monster that makes an instant meal out of the ordinary. Unhappy soul crazy enough to sting around the notoriously off limits Gold Spike Mine. Your heterogeneous assortment of standardized numbers including intrepid heads: a hard-nosed chef, a cute but tasteless blonde, a feisty giant, a frightened geologist, boozy, inexplicably accented in Aussie (!), Of doofus without charm, and without doubt the most annoying character in the uniformly irritating group, Dweeb, a nerdy nerdy-eyed writer who tends to speak with floral and melodramatic utterances - dive into a dark and unattractive cave in search of gold. Naturally, these extremely insupportable fools discover that the mine, allegedly abandoned, is home to a deadly, ugly, multi-tentacle beast that, at the time, honored the frenzied fashion of the B-movie series, taking the band one by one. Directed, co-written, co-produced and co-edited with breathtaking melancholy by Melanie Anne Phillips, acted with consternation by a cast of unnamed rank, still marred by lethargic stimulation, a very sinuous, dark and obscure narrative, a clever cinematography, a pseudo-John Carpenter synthesizer score quivering and redundant, and a crisp spin, lively and jerky, slow motion animation that only very quickly glimpses at the end of the film, extremely cumbersome, amateurish and therefore quite enjoyable Terrible Scarefest potential commits all the faux pas necessary to be qualified as true four-star stinkeroonie.
