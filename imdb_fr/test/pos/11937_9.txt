I think Toy Soldiers is a great movie. It's one of the only movies that, apart from well-known actors, has an unknown cast that can play. In my opinion, the plot is captivating. This holds your attention without having a scandalous story that could not happen in real life. I think everyone would like this movie. Sean Astin always seems to choose the perfect films to show off his talent. He is very underrated and does not get the recognition he deserves. Other films that he has been in other actors have been in the spotlight but this film and Rudy present him really because he is the main character in both. I hope he will one day get the honors he deserves for his role. If you want to see a good movie, you have to watch this one and if you are a fan of Sean Astin, you will definitely love this movie.
