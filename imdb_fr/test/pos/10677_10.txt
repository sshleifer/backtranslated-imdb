I saw this movie in the early 70's, when I was about 10 years old. old on TV. It was after school, and while I was watching, I was so fascinated by the idea that the two astronauts went on a mission to another unknown planet, that I asked my mother if I could take out the tape recorder cassette. She left me. So I wrapped the microphone cord around the Channel button to hang it in front of the speaker. This film is the first one I pay enough attention to - and I want to record enough. (Just the audio - there was no VCR at that time.) The plot will let you hang on every word .. every minute of this movie .. The end will amaze you. After watching the trip on the other side of the sun, you will have memories in your mind for a long time. I replayed the audio recording for many years ... and I "saw" it again and again in my mind. Then, maybe 15 years later, when VCRs were commonplace and they sold cassettes in the stores, I always looked for them, but I never found them. But when the Internet came one day, I looked for it and bought it in a second. So ... after about 30 years after seeing him for the first time, I saw him again. WOW! ~~ It was spectacular! Just for reference .. I must have watched 50 times since.
