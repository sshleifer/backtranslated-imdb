I loved this film !!! It was so easy to be part of the characters' lives and to feel all the emotion they were experiencing. <br /> <br /> A film filled with laughter, sarcasm, shock and upheaval, that upsets a fantastic romantic drama! <Br /> <br /> The only part I did not like is in the special functions. The comments behind the scenes were a little confusing. As I had already seen the movie before the extras, I prefer to think of actors as characters (idiot I know), but the actors' personality is very different from that of the characters they interpret. But nevertheless, it is a fantastic, spectacular and brilliant movie that I recommend to all who watched this movie and who thought hmmmmmmm should I buy it? the answer must be a real yes!
