A wonderfully thought-out and engaging film that leaves an impression far beyond its initial flight. Based on a true story, one of the many "small" pre-World War II stories that help to understand the spirit of the majority of common human cultures, touched by others perceived as ancient enemies and perhaps future enemies war clouds on the horizon. Seen at the Stony Brook Film Festival, the film was greeted with enthusiasm. Well written and skillfully cast. The characters were very credible and attracted everyone to experience their trials and tribulations.
