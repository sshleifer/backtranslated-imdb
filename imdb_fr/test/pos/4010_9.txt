My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought it was so cool and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush on me (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny - except when it wanted to be serious, and just a big show overall. But since we could not afford to keep Nick, I could not see any episodes after February 1996, which may make me think more about the show than I should. For me, it's more the epidemic (now that it does not seem spelled!) To have to say "goodbye" to someone you love and KNOW that you will never see him again. And I still think that because, as far as I know, it is not planned to release it on DVD so soon ... yeah, life is skinny! I discovered it with certainty (although you can find a weird episode every day here and there ... but I never liked pirated copies of these things either). <br /> <br /> Enough of my sad life: (.... most 7th grade kids do NOT need power like Alex can get them through life (unrealistic - of course), but How many cities have super-evil chemical plants This show is fun to watch, although I agree that the diaglouge is a little too developed (and even a little politically correct sometimes). children would have a reason to enter the factory (a videotape or something like that) as a children's version of "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six" (which, a few years later, I became addicted to this series of games for the same reason probably)! The "security" team of the factory who is desperately trying to find the "kid of the accident" ... very bad guys (at least when I watched the show for the first time ... they seem more sympathetic to me now) I feel rather sad for Larisa Oleynik, I'm not sure she does not think about that role that turns her into characters ..... but that's what I'll always remember her by. plays Aaron Peirce of "24" is here too as a school coach or something ... too cool! Maybe he could make the producers of this show have Larisa next season "24". I only talk about it because Jack Bauer is my other TV hero and I really want to see things cross, lol :). Both are in California, so I will keep dreaming ... I can see it now: "Leave me alone with this suspect for a few minutes ... no, I do not need a car battery! "
