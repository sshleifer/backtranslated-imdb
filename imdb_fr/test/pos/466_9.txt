It's really a movie you have to see twice. When I saw this film for the first time, I was really drawn to the story. Although most of the story takes place inside a hotel room, the stories shared by Buddy (Nick Drake, wonderful allusion) and Daphne take you outside their room and into their world. Through their conversations, you feel the loneliness and pain felt by everyone. The soundtrack accompanies the film perfectly, dark, lo-fi and intriguing. When you see the movie the second time, you can find all the clues you missed the first time, which led to one of the best endings I've ever seen. I hope to see this movie find a distributor for the DVD so that it is more accessible. Excellent movie, you will not be disappointed.
