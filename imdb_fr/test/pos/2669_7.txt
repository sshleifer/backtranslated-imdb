Frank Sinatra played in this odd little RKO title that is now in the public domain. The film came out at about the same time the war was over and was a strong advocacy for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Sinatra's song. After leaving the stage, he enters the alley and finds a group of children who choose another because of his religion. Instead of shouting at the boys (or helping them elsewhere), Sinatra gives a nice lesson in civic education about religious tolerance and equates prejudices with fascism. The children seem to have understood the lesson, then, unexpectedly, Sinatra begins to sing a song that, frankly (understood?), The children would have hated it. He had a beautiful voice, but unfortunately, I think it detracted from the excellent message he gave to children about tolerance. It's a good message with too much singing - even if the guy who sings is Frank Sinatra. It is also an interesting curiosity - a beautiful historical piece that is often overlooked ... besides, it's quite touching, even if it sounds a bit schmaltzy.
