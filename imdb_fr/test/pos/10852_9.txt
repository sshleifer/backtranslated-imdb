I loved this film. Not because of romantic stories between women, but to visualize human strength, despair and liberation. This film is to see absolutely. Entertaining! Emotional! Captivating! All characters are very well written and performed by very talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. A journey of the mind, the body and the soul. You identify with the characters and at certain times, even with the scenario. <br /> <br /> I must say that I recommend watching the movie first and then reading the book. If you read the book first, you will be a little disappointed. The adaptation to the scenario has changed a lot and some things have been changed. Some for the better and some for the worse.
