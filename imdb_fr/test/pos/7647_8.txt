This one surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read a few reviews in advance that qualified this film as a good B and were preparing for the worst. Halfway through, I suddenly realized that I was completely enveloped and that I enjoyed it a lot. There were very tense moments during which you sat in front, nervously fiddling with the remote control or any other object within easy reach. Overall, this film certainly does not deserve the grade B label. <br /> <br /> We must thank the director Gary Ellis and the writers Bill Boatman & Todd King for their film debut. I hope these guys will continue with bigger budgets and studio support.
