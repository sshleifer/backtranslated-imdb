It's one of the best action movies I've seen. Geena's portrait of the hard-nails, "Charly" / sweet mother "Sam", was superb and Samuel L Jackson makes you laugh all the time, with his classic liners. Of course, there were some holes in the actual story, but this fast film keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. <br /> <br /> I thought that Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam. / Charly and her versatility as an actress are obvious for her role as a mother in the recent film "Stuart Little". Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, Sweet Yvonne Zima and newcomers, sexy Craig Bierko and Melina Kanakaredes. This film highlights the growing trend towards a strong feminine character and the diversion of traditional male / female stereotypes as Sam / Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) rush from one disaster to another. Although I and many others have loved this film, it's fair to say that there will always be people who do not like it and that it's good, every man for himself. I highly recommend this movie to action fans for its hilarious scenes and quick action.
