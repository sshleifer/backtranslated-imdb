Anyone looking for an episode of "Law and Order" or "CSI" should go elsewhere, as the most basic elements of police or forensic work are completely ignored in this case. <br /> <br /> A murder was committed The police only grabbed a 15-year-old boy in the street and took him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and told him that is the guy who did it? Of course, the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty. It does not matter that he does not look like the real killer and he was dressed completely differently. He had to shrink, reverse his age from 5 to 10 years and change clothes. <br /> <br /> The police made no effort - and confessed it! They did not question any other witnesses and beat the confessions of a 15-year-old man. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system was it just down the road in Jacksonville, Florida. Let everyone now start talking about "Southern justice".
