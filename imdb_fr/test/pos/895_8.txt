Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There, she is greeted by a couple and other couples who are swaying. They all stay in this huge tourist hotel with a huge swimming pool. One night, they organize a party by the pool with "real" indigenous dancers. It's very politically correct and very kitschy. Later, Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be in one of these safaris by car, stay in your car (even if the photography is beautiful). Throughout the film, Emanuelle attacks all the men she meets. The photography is very well done in this film. There are scenes with cascading waterfalls, galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. The film is worth the detour for the soundtrack of Nico Fidenco only.
