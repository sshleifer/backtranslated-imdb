There are times when you do not want these deep dramatic series. When you do not want a series with heavy stories or a must watch every episode to hang on. There are times when you just want to watch a simple series, with lots of action and great characters. For those times, you have Cleopatra 2525. <br /> <br /> I was one of those who really enjoyed Charlie's Angels. Critics said it was too superficial and silly. But the thing is, that's the point! People who can not relax and expect a serious movie hate it. It's exactly the same with Cleopatra 2525. It's superficial. He has stupid and unrealistic characters. And that's why I like it. This is unlike any other series. <br /> <br /> The first season was not very good. The Cleo character was irritating and a little too much. The story was a little lame and you did not learn much about the characters. But hey, they only had 20 minutes in each episode. <br /> <br /> In the last 5-6 episodes of Cleopatra 2525, they finally gave the series 40 minutes. And this is where I started to like him. The series finally began to become a very qualitative series. Too bad they had to cancel the series. Because the last episodes of Cleopatra 2525 were really good. I will never forget Hel, Sarge and Cleo. Unique characters that only the creators of Xena could have created!
