Fun and entertaining movie about the German spy (Julie Andrews!), A German WWII spy, who falls in love with the American pilot (Rock Hudson), while trying to unravel his secrets. For some reason, this was attacked by critics and rejected by the public in 1970 - I do not see why. He is beautifully photographed, offers beautiful interiors and costumes, as well as exciting aerial fights. Andrews also does a striptease (strictly PG material) and sings a beautiful song - "Whistling in the Dark". The film has problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shoot - and it shows. Their love scenes are sparse and they have no sexual chemistry. Yet, they perform satisfactorily. The film is a bit long (even in the director's cut that I saw 105 min) and becomes much too dark and serious in the end. It is still worth catching. Try to see the directors cut ... the other lasts another half hour!
