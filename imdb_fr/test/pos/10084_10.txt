We open in a doctor's room of some sort. A girl is escorted in front of the doctor. He asks him questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions, ignoring the obvious traumatized atmosphere of the girls. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of two girls who are brought home after spending some time in a psychiatric home after an "incident" before. Upon arrival, they are greeted by their mother-in-law who is too tempting, too beautiful to be beautiful but so totally perverse, for which the girls are obviously resentful. At home, the wicked stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. And, to top it off, there is an avenging ghost that is far from helping the girls recover ... <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing. There are twists, turns, and certainly leave you thinking a lot without making sense. The relationship between the two girls is so comforting that it almost makes you cry at times (I know I had a tearful moment of two, more specifically "the closet scene"). But what I like most about this film is the total feeling of fear up to the credits. The soundtrack is irreproachable, the furniture of the house and the use of color are fantastic. A pure joy for the eyes. It is a must for all fanatics of Asian movies. Or ANY kind of movie buff! An easy 10/10.
