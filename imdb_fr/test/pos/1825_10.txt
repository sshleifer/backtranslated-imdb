Valley Girl will always have a special place in my heart: I would say it's certainly the best teen sex comedy from the 80s, but it's a compliment in reverse. It's a good movie, period. It is very accurate in time and place - almost twenty years later, it's a wonderful snapshot - but its story remains timeless. (It's just Romeo and Juliet, less death, after all!) Nicolas Cage is great. He promised early on that it turned out that he had wasted his crapola. Deborah Foreman is the revelation of this movie and I can not believe she did not have a bigger career. someone rediscovers it FAST. It's sweeter and sweeter than most movies of this kind - the nudity required seems to be part of the contractual obligation - and even if it's not revolutionary, it's nice to see that kind of film that respects its characters and do not crucify him. shallow girls to have fun - even Foreman's team of best friends, poorly guided by peer pressure, is never portrayed as a bad guy. (Indeed, her friend Stacy, forced to double with Cage's friend, Fred, has a good time despite his protests and realizes that Fred is in the back.) This will take you back to the early 80's if you were there, but it's pretty good today. Warning to those who are not familiar with the film: DO NOT look at one of the seemingly continual representations of VH1 - go praise it in its unheard-of glory. Otherwise, you're missing some of the most powerful and accurate dialogs in the movie. And we can not write about Valley Girl without talking about the fabulous soundtrack of the great 80s tunes - most of them illustrating unique wonders, which are not only part of the sense of time and place in this film, but which are also well themed. selected. See - awesome little movie! Iron shur !!
