By 1950, John Ford had already fully developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful westerns. For example, there is always a strong sense of belonging to a community, captured most poignantly in the Joad family of Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (1940). Within these communities, even among the more noble themes of Ford's racism and pioneering spirit, there is always room for smaller human interactions, minor friendships, and romances that make life worth living. to be lived. "Wagon Master (1950)" came after Ford released the first two films of his trilogy "Cavalry" ?? "Fort Apache (1948)" and "She wore a yellow ribbon (1949)" ?? and it covers a similar territory, but without the military perspective and, what is even more damning, John Wayne's strong lead. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr. are excellent actors, but they feel they should play the second violin with someone else. The former cursed Mormon of Ward Bond, although potentially a candidate for such a role, is not sufficiently targeted. satisfactorily to the addition. <br /> <br /> In "Wagon Master", Ford seems so comfortable with its proven Western formula that any character development is largely ignored. Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and the charm of a Mormon girl by Harry Cary Jr is so superficial that it's almost non-existent in the final film, which makes us think to the survival of deleted scenes. It is only in the charismatic and unscrupulous Uncle Shiloh that Charles Kemper tries something different, and it works, even if he's surrounded by a yokel troupe with lazy jaws. Ford's success lies in orchestrating the agglomeration of three different races of Americans ?? value-oriented Mormons, easy-to-live horse dealers, eccentric traveling fairgrounds ?? in a united community of pioneers looking to the future. This apparent harmony is turned upside down by the arrival of Uncle Shiloh's armed outlaws, who exploit the anarchy of the western border but end up losing to the noble cowboys who "have never fired snakes". > Ford would have considered Wagon Master as one of his favorite films. This may be due to the absence of big names such as John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with his stock selection of the usual players, Ford is able to create a sense of community by avoiding focusing on one character, although most Mormon travelers are still completely anonymous. Although no doubt well done, I can not help but think that this film does well only what other images of Ford did best: the formidable majesty of the western border was presented more beautifully in " She wore a yellow ribbon "; romances and friendly quarrels among community members have taken a more prominent place in the "Fort Apache"; the first relations with the Amerindians, which we have only mentioned here, have been examined in more detail in "The Searchers (1956)"; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more poignantly (though by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in "How West West Won (1962). "Wagon Master" is a pure John Ford, but it's not a benchmark.
