This is a very "straight on the deal" movie that offers everything almost right in your face. I am a Christian and I liked the film in a way. There was a bit of average acting from the main person, and it was a small budget as you can clearly see. It may seem a bit long, but the film contains very good cars that save it from a lower note on my part. As a Christian movie, it was pretty good, but maybe a little bit right in the message. The movie works best on a big screen. * SPOILERS * The fight scene with the two brothers can remind you of the fight scene between the two brothers in the Christian thriller "Mercy Streets" with Eric Roberts. * End of Spoiler * I give it a 7/10.
