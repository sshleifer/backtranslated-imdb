Perhaps the best film ever directed by director Kevin Tenney (well, his Witchboard is not at the top of my list of horrors), this one is a strange and fascinating mix between Pin and Child's Play, both better than this one, but not so much better. Of course, the plot is artificial and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good, Rosalind Allen is very pleasing to the eye (just like Candance McKenzie - Bless her for the shower scene!), The young actress interprets very well the disturbed girl and the puppet Pinocchio are scary enough to give you some thrills in the back. For a movie B not bad at all.
