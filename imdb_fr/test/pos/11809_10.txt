*** Contains spoilers *** <br /> <br /> A nice movie with Brad Renfro and the always wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Mazzello. Of all his films I've seen so far, I've loved each of them for different reasons, and The Cure is no different. Brad Renfro is doing very well in this film too. The Cure is a drama / transition to adulthood from the point of view of a sick child and his friend. <br /> <br /> The basic idea is: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) has AIDS. He ends up befriending the kid next door (Brad Renfro) but Erik's mother is very narrow-minded, uninformed and a little "hard" about Dexter's illness. She thinks AIDS is contagious like a cold, so she does not want her son to go near Dexter. <br /> <br /> After many unsuccessful attempts to heal, the boys go to New Orleans. find the cure after reading a booklet about it. After being kicked by Playboy magazine, Dexter's health is heading south shortly after, and as his health deteriorates, there is still enough life for the boy alongside Erik for two pranks. to pretend to stop breathing. Unfortunately, poor Dexter actually died of his illness, leaving poor Erik behind him wondering why he could not find the treatment. Throughout the film, he ends up forging stronger bonds with Dexter's mother. <br /> <br /> It's a very comforting movie to watch and is not absolutely perfect (movies are rarely perfect), but you will not care about how you get involved in the movie anymore. A must for fans of Joseph Mazzello, one of his best performances of all time. Very well recommended movie to see absolutely - if you can find a copy :)
