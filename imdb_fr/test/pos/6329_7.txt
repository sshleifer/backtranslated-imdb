Bergman and comedy do not really go together. Some of his comedies are so nauseating that you are almost scared. This movie has the strange naff moment - the last 30 seconds being the nadir, but overall, it's a lovely (rather than funny) piece, nice all the way through. Bergman launches many of his usual suspects that work well. There is a big scene in the train between David, Marianne and a rude salesman who will remain etched in the memory. Part of the marriage material is typical, cynical of Bergman, but it's Bergman lighter than dark. <br /> <br /> This film has its moments and is well worth 90 minutes. Not one of its classics and not the place to start if you want to crack for Bergman.
