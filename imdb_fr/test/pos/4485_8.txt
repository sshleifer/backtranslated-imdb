Strange film but wonderfully original. Truly scary, scary and ridiculous in equal measure. The staging of a high-rise red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the haunting action. The thought of a secret room sealed in a place like this is sufficient, but when the naive-minded couple begins to clean the old bed they find in the room, the scene is ready for classic chills. The casting is fantastic. Tanya Dempsey is really lucky to paint scenes after being underrated in other Full Moon films. Joe Estevez proves why Brother Martin Sheen is so much bigger in Hollywood: his eyes rolling during the shoot are really hilarious. Charles Band co-produced with Stuart Gordon and this is an exceptional release of Full Moon / Darkwave. Danny Draven also directed Hell Asylum with Dempsey.
