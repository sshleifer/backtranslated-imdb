ALEXANDER NEVSKY is nothing less than a large-scale film. The film opens a window to a world and a culture that most Americans will never know. And much has been said and written about the film's barely veiled patriotism in the face of the impending war with the German Nazis. <br /> <br /> According to American standards, the acting is a little scalded. The screenplay is short on words and great on visuals and action. And even if the action can become tedious, the visuals are often breathtaking. The direction is incredible. <br /> <br /> On another level, fans of the animation of Ralph Bakshi may notice that he stole many of his visuals for WIZARDS directly from a copy of ALEXANDER NEVSKY.
