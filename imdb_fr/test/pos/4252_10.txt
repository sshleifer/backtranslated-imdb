1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope is Robert Downey's second film to be recognized. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope has made a much broader statement. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and heinous. Both films were so wicked that they effectively blocked the Prince's feature film career for several years. <br /> <br /> The subject in question is Putney Swoope. And it's a crazy joke / satire that must be seen to be believed. I will not go through the plot here. Which parcel ?? People looking for a plot will scratch their heads. Keep scratching !! This movie is not about PLOT! It could be compared to a film by Mel Brooks; only without the parody of Hollywood that Mel has always organized. I also see some Monty Python in this. About: this film was shot before Monty made his debut on the BBC !!! <br /> <br /> I notice that gags and lines that hilariously fall are not well transmitted by word of mouth. You have to see them in the context of the film. There are some flaws in the film; but even the faults are unique. For example: actors often repeat the same line again and again; and somehow it works. How many syllables does Mario? Putney says the Borman Six Girl must have a soul! etc ... <br /> <br /> Black and white photography is remarkable. The sound / score is even better! The editing is only blah. The game is above average. The script is invaluable. The jokes are as little-PC as you can get: Bad News said: "Sonny Williams has just been caught in a motel with a 13-year-old girl," Putney said. "At least he's not superstitious." The anti-establishment mentality of this film will take you right out of the room. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> There are many things in this movie that relate to today: NON-SMOKING !!! Inverse racism with African Americans dealing with Caucasion as garbage. The manipulation of the mass media on the masses; Madison Avenue, Deroit, Hollywood intentionally pedaling something that any 8 year old can say is bullshit; Internet, I speak of "the battery"; Interracial Encounter I could go on and on again .... <br /> <br /> I should also mention that there is about 8 minutes of this film shot in 16 mm in color. These are the commercials shot by the Putney agency. The spots work pretty well the first time. They are tired by repeated visits. The real magic is here in the N / B sections of the film. These are the non-picturesque lines they stay with you: "Rent a Schmuck order". "I love you, I love you, I love you ... did you take your pill?" "all I have to say is simply redundant". And a host of others. I also like the piece with the minnow mounted on the wall: "The gamekeeper wanted me to throw him back ... I organized such a fight, I decided to make it up!" <br /> <br /> Buddy Buttler is Putney's No.1 Bodyguard. He should have been a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as Arab. He became famous on television and in movies. Arnold Johnson has the good look as Putney Swoope. Robert Downey used his own voice instead, because Arnold did not remember some of his lines. In addition, Downey realized that he could later supplement any further dialogue / jokes if he doubled his lead actor. <br /> <br /> The film has some flaws. Short time is one. I wish the beginning with the white board members would have been extended. Stan Gotlieb and Allen Garfield are remarkable. The end seems to have been thrown together as if he could not think of more gags. Overall, it's one of the best low-budget independent films of its era. A time when very few indies were playing outside New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and L.A. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see it at least twice. Downey Putney Swoope is ahead of and beyond, it's time.
