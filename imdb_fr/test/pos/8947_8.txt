Hilarious end to end, it takes a lot of courage to approach the theme of death with a smile, especially when two funeral parlors compete for control of the market: a classic salon and a revolutionary salon where each burial is a show Christopher Walken, a feast in the role of the American Mortitic Visionary. But the rest of the cast is excellent too, and this one is another success that only the UK can do. Naomi Watts is another metamorphosis (accent included). Still wearing a smile on his face, it seems paradoxical to think that there could be so much comedy in a film that could be called "Four funerals and a wedding", but you'll understand when you see it.
