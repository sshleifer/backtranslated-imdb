This film was to be the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life. I laughed so much that I almost vomited. Once the film was finished, I laughed for about an hour thinking about the last movie I saw in the movie. It's 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I loved seeing them all together. If you are sensual or do not like silly childish humor, you will not like this movie. If you can enter with an open mind and do not take it so seriously, then you will laugh with laughter. It's amazing, nobody was killed in this movie. Every movie in this movie is so original and so different from the next that you will not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Webber
