I watch a lot of movies, but my number one genre right now is Asian horror. I just bought this DVD and I first found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" an intriguing but confused film, because I did not understand many elements of the story. But I saw in IMDb Board a message entitled "Explanation of a masterpiece (answer to all your questions), load faster", written by opiemar, and I was really impressed by the quality of the explanations provided by this user to viewers like me. Of the history. I would like to congratulate Opiemar for his excellent work and suggest that he write a good summary of this film in IMDb to help and guide other viewers. <br /> <br /> Finally, I agree that "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a great Korean film, but I do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than one Once, as this film requires, and without the great support of Opiemar, I could not understand. the story as a whole. I intend to see this film again in the near future. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")
