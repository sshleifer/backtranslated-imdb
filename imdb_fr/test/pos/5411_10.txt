Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best movie of the year. It was a complete and complete joy to watch. I was riveted. All the audience at the Sunset Five was riveted. At the end of the movie, nobody was moving, talking, anything. I think this film is a perfect example of the power of drama. Especially to the extent that this gives an example of the quality of the drama / work of this young generation. <br /> <br /> There were moments in your movie, many, like at least seven, where I was struck by such beauty, emotional beauty, that I really could not breathe for a moment . And for a junkie catharsis like me, this is the best censorship experience I can ask. It is the result of powerful and masterful narration and direction. Like heavy stuff, like Burtolucci and those guys. <br /> <br /> Each element of the film fits perfectly. There was no wrong step at all. The distribution was incredible. I've been a big fan of Emile and Ryan for a long time and I thought they'd never been so good. I am / am / will be continually stunned by this movie. And I promise I'll hang out every person I know to see him. This should be seen. He should win prizes.
