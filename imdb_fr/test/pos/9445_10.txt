I liked this movie so much. I am a big fan of Amanda Bynes' recently completed show. I admire him (aside from his body) for his ability to act. She is a good actress. <br /> <br /> The movie was great. This is a girl named Viola who wants to play football, but when her school separates from the girls' football team, she gets angry. His brother is ready to attend a prestigious school and he decides to go to England. Thus, Viola wants to make a good impression by playing in the football team of the boarding school. She goes to school and tests for the football team. She enters. She meets Duke, a sensitive guy who plays on the football team. He really loves Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who loves Sebastian - who is really viola. Sebastian goes out with Monique and suspects that Sebastian is not himself. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not a girls movie and I liked it a lot. It's so funny and kind. I do not think I saw AManda acting better.
