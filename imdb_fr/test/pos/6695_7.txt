I have it as a complete set of 9 episodes on 5 DVDs. I did not know anything about the story of the series. Season 1 of the series presents the pilot episode as episode 1, then 3 additional episodes for a total of 4. Season 2 lists 5 episodes, the last of which is Beyond Good and Evil with an original release date of 7 December 1998. The other 4 episodes in season 2 were broadcast from December 1997 to February 1998. So, Beyond Good and Evil looks like season 3, except for episode 1, except for season 3 there are no more episodes. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here. The two main characters of the first 8 episodes, Dr. Iain McCallum (John Hannah) and Dr. Angela Moloney (Zara Turner), are absent from this episode and are replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher (Nathaniel Parker) and Dr. Charley Fielding (Eva Pope). I recognized Nathaniel Parker from the series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, which started in 2001. So they had planned a season 3 but only one episode was aired. <br /> <br /> It seems strange to try to continue a series. named after the main character, McCallum, when the main character left the series. So, they might have anticipated a return of Dr. Iain McCallum, but when that failed, the series was canceled. I do not have any inside information on that, but I see that John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects in 1999. Does anyone have any information on this?
