This is an excellent Anderson production to compare with the best episodes of UFO or SPACE 1999 (first series). Of course, it's not an SFX extravaganza or a pseudo-mystical tripe festival of Star Wars, but a subtle slow-paced film, but one that reflects the scary, weird and strange atmosphere of the best Anderson productions: for the amateurs of 'brain' science fiction. Lynn Loring's voice is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. The special effects are good for this kind of product and acting is good too. Two astronauts visit a planet on the opposite side of the sun but collapse instead ... or do they? Ah, videophones! From time to time, it is touted as the next "gadget of all tastes of the next decade", but it still has to happen 40 years later. The device of the twin planet of the Earth, on the opposite side of the sun, also returns to Gamera tai daiakuju Giron (1969), so who copied who?
