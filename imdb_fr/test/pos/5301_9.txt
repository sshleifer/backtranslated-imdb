While Hayao Miyazaki's films have always been a success or mine with me regarding the story, they are absolutely beautiful to the eye, with characters of simple animation against a background of artistic images. Ponyo sticks to this formula, with such an adorable main character that I want a stuffed doll and a landscape so pretty that it would not look bad in its place, framed like an image on a wall. <br /> <br /> The story By cons, I did not appreciate as much as his last two theatrical releases, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. It was just a bit too juvenile, which seemed to be more for the kids and let the adults just to enjoy the entertainment. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed with the result obtained by Joe Hisaishi, who also achieved the scores above. - mentioned two movies, was not so memorable this time. Although I do not really remember howl's score, I still remember it was one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. Idem Spirited - although I only remember that it is very complementary to the film. Maybe it's because Ponyo is a juvenile food that the score is not so haunted. In any case, this film is always a must for fans of anime or Miyazaki.
