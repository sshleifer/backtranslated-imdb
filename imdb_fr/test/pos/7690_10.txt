I saw it on TV more years ago than I remember, but I never forgot about Sammy Davis, Jr.'s performance. I thought about looking for it on video. This interpretation of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I would love to see him again and introduce him to my son too. I just can not imagine why this was not presented as one of the greatest performances that Sammy Davis, Jr. has given. Anyone who is responsible for not showing this to the public should be ashamed of their ignorance. I will continue to search for it though. Maybe the executives responsible for such things will realize the forgotten work of so many African-American actors.
