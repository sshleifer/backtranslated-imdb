The musical remake of Ross Hunter's 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's persistent bestseller, was rejected almost immediately by critics and the public in 1973, evoking a backlash against the musicals that gave the like an unfortunate reputation in Hollywood for years. A group of British and American individuals disappear in an emergency flight from a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes into snow-covered mountain terrain; a relief team arrives and leads the group into an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun still shines and where most of the inhabitants are young and happy. Some of the performances of the class actors are not (the effervescent atmosphere of the play, the melodious melodies of Burt Bacharach-Hal David, as well as the light direction which compliments all the spectators to make the performers look a little ridiculous) . Peter Finch is the international peacekeeper who engages in a somewhat constipated relationship with resident Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman is angry that says: "I was tired of taking pictures of people with their heads torn off, so that people with their heads ALWAYS - and usually under a hair dryer - could have one last kick before to turn to the last recipe "; John Gieguld "As Chang", an Asian who learned English at Oxford while having fun with humor (but why no song for Chang?). The lyrics of Hal David's dopeyes are sometimes breathtaking ("On the good Lollipop boat / how did Christopher Columbus cross the sea?") And the pace gets bogged down with all these talk about the outside world and how nothing is more pitiful today. However, the production is lush and general handling has strange consequences. The characters in two dimensions are so serious that they become endearing and the stupidity of the film is contagious. It ends up being very fun. *** of ****
