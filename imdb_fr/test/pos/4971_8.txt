This is an excellent Italian film about sharks that is probably not a full action movie but tells the story of a Native American in the form of a killer shark attacking a small seaside community. the film has real scenes of real sharks, but not much, but the way they did it is pretty good. The actors are not very brilliant in this film but this film shows better roles in some other Italian shark movies, such as (for example, Cruel Jaws, last shark), they show very bad acting but the most of the Italian shark movies are good, which means it's the best Italian shark film ever seen, some scenes in this movie show violence / gore, which makes this movie a good movie. It's the best movie for all shark fans.
