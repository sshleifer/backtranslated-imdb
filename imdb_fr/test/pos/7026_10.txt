I must admit that before watching this movie, I thought it was one of those soppy love stories where everything was going well and that was going well. but I was wrong when I sat down to watch that. I found it was actually a very good story about a family going to a dance park for 3 weeks of vacation and the youngest daughter, baby, finds love but has trouble getting her to return there with her new love found because of disagreements with her father. But along the way, it helps another dance teacher and endangers the whole relationship ... A really comforting film, like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
