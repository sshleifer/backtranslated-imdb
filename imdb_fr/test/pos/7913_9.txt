Honestly, I can not believe that this movie is not rated better. Claude Chabrol could be described as a Frenchman, Alfred Hitchcock, and although this film is the second film I've seen (the first being The Butcher), I can already see that this guy is something special the strength of these two films. The film is a French and Canadian co-production and takes place in Canada. The cast is made up of British and Canadian stars and high-quality performances bode well for the rest of the film. most of which are of high quality as well. The film is a mystery of murder and begins when a girl covered in blood is brought to a police station. After being questioned by Inspector Carella, it appears that the girl, Patricia, and her sister Muriel were assaulted by a man who killed the sister and left Patricia to flee. However, as the investigation progresses, Patricia returns to the chain to present new evidence, which reveals a much more shocking identity to the murderer. <br /> <br /> The performances of this film are excellent. Donald Sutherland is moderated as usual, but he is very well suited to the role he has played here and I would not hesitate to name his performance in Blood Relatives as one of his best. The film also features British stars Donald Pleasance and David Hemmings, who play well. Pleasance in particular, which shows how much he can be an actor and stresses that it is a pity he has wasted in Halloween movies. The unknown Aude Landry also gives an excellent performance in her role as Patricia. The film is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked. When Inspector Carella discovers Muriel's diary, the film is transformed into a drama in which the girl's latest actions are shown. and although this section of the film is not as good as the one that preceded it, it is still interesting and leads to a beautiful turn in the end! Overall, Blood Relatives is a great movie that really deserves to be better seen. The Butcher is a better known effort Chabrol, but for my money, it's at least as good! Highly recommended viewing.
