Victor Sjöström was the master of this film, he had played, shot and even wrote the screenplay! It's pretty amazing. Although few people today know who Sjöström is, he may be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as a star in one of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> For this movie, it's a very contrasting film bag. On the one hand, it must be respected because for 1921, it is a very good film. The idea that the Reaper sits with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is quite imaginative. In addition, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is quite convincing and, technically, it is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it's an incredibly dated and predatory film, more like something you would expect to see in a Sunday school rather than an honest theater. In addition, some elements of the story simply do not make sense. Rather than becoming a devoted or good man, the dying Salvation Army worker looks like a sap - a very sad and confusing sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> So my recommendation is this: if you're madly in love with silences (like me), then watch for it. But, if you're not a silent fan, this movie may not convince you that this style movie is brilliant because the story is too melodramatic and out of date.
