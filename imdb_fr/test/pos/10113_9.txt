This film was an excellent acting, an excellent director and, overall, an excellent story. I had real experience with a boy like "Radio". In my city's football program, we had a mentally handicapped boy every year who was training, traveling and having fun with the football team. This film is really true and I can identify with 100%. A boy like 'Radio' just needs to feel that he belongs to something; they need to feel that their life is worth living. That's what "Radio" feels and that's why this type of program is set up in my high school. It's a very moving film that has been brought to the big screen. My dad and I loved it and I will always remember it for being a film that tells a captivating story of the goodness and kindness of the man!
