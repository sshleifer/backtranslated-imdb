"Live Together, Die Alone" is divided into three main lines, and each of them alone would have been enough for a big episode. So when you put them all together, you have a big episode. It was a daring move to give a flashback of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes so far, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch , both informative about the island's past and the Swan resort itself and frankly on the move. Desmond and Penny seem to be magically connected to each other, even when they are at the other end of the world, and the two characters are beautifully interpreted (it's hard not to cry when Desmond reads the letter from Penny). The action inside the hatch is a little tense, Locke being determined not to let the push button press again, convinced that it was only a psychological experience, Desmond gradually realizes the consequences of this decision and Eko is closed outside and desperately trying to get home. The cast of the clock and the story "I was wrong" Locke are unforgettable moments. The outside action captured Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and Hurley by the Others because of Michael's betrayal (after a disturbing discovery related to the Pearl) and the return of the game "Henry Gale" as a leader of the Others. Even the least important plot, Sayid, Jin and Sun, going to the beach where the others are supposed to camp, contains one of the greatest mythological mysteries of the show, the giant statue that is almost entirely missing except a foot to four toes. In short: emotion + story + mythology + adventure + suspense + threat of annihilation + ray of hope = an episode of classic LOST. *** 1/2 of 4.
