"Foxx won an Oscar for his moving interpretation of the artist Foxx brings heart and soul to film and humor, but this film offers many performances by major actors including Regina King, Clifton Powell, Bokeem Woodbine, Aunjaune Ellis, Warwick Davis, Terrence Howard, and Sharon Warren, Ray's mother, is probably THE best film of Hackford's career to date.The movie also contains many songs from Charles's best music. > <br /> The DVD offers a crisp, widescreen (1.33: 1) transfer and excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.The disc 1 contains an informative commentary from the director and the DVD also contains the original theatrical version and the extended version. May If you want to see these deleted scenes, you will be better off watching the theatrical version instead, because the bonus images are sometimes in a deplorable state and you have to click on a logo. Disc 2 has deleted scenes with optional comments from the director (which is seen in the extended version), featurettes and more. But the featurettes are disappointing for this DVD. Since the film is extraordinarily good. This film has been nominated for four Oscars, including the best costumes, the best director, the best editing and the best film. It's a true and amazing story well told, but of course, Charles's life was even more controversial and scandalous than the final film. Still, it's damn close. Scenario by James L. White. From a story by White and the director: Hackford. Oscar-winner for the best sound. Do not miss it. (**** Â½ / *****).
