I really liked this film, but the feeling that struck me the most is the memory of my love for the novel. The film features two of the best actresses working today - Jessica Lange, who is great here, and the divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does her best with the finely drawn character assigned to her - as well as a surprisingly excellent Michelle Pfeiffer and Jason Robards. The adaptation is basically faithful to the book, at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes. The film does not dazzle really, with the exception of some scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but it allows to visualize perfectly this marvelously tragic story. As for the movies adapted from novels, it was certainly among the best. If nothing else, it sent me back to my shelves to rediscover the favorite passages of Jane Smiley's great novel, and to King Lear to develop the minor characters to see just how much parallels disappear. It's definitely worth spending time as a movie, and I hope you'll have enough memory to remind you that reading good literature is also a joy.
