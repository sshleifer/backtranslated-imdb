I have been looking for this film for years. I keep an excellent memory of the game and the song of first order in this film. I never knew that the reason the movie was impossible to obtain was because of the actions of the Gershwin family - SHAME ON THE MEDICAL for trying to delete it at American Classic !! I can only hope that they will let go and let this film out and enjoy the American public. <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis, Jr. is at its best in this film. The only other performance of this film is its equal, is in "Anna Lucasta" - another fantastic film that I would like to see released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Porgy & Bess contains a first-class film, all-star throw. I hope that one day you will be able to see for yourself.
