I thought it was a very good movie. Someone said it was "sick" so they could not watch it. I think if you realize that his rating is R, you'll be ready for nudity and drug use. It's a good story and the acting is amazing. It's just not a prude to appreciate it! It is essentially a mother who uses drugs and wants to clean herself, so she calls a very rich old friend and transfers them to her domain. I guess it's a drama. I'm so fed up with people who do not like movies because of curses or nudity. This is the world in which we live. You are obviously not comfortable with yourself if you can not see things like this movie. And it's rated R. So that should tell you from the start that not all are happy rainbow peaches. I liked it. I think you also!
