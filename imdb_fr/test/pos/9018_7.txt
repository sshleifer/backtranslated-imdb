It's good enough, all things considered. A must for anyone who is perplexed about the opposite sex (that is, all of us!). The trailer reveals no plot FOR A GOOD REASON. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd; It's like someone from the BBC Children's Department has decided to make an adult film. This is not a bad thing at IMO. <br /> <br /> 7/10
