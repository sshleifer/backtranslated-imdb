Fata Morgana, the 1971 film by the German filmmaker Werner Herzog, which looks like a documentary, was shot for several years in the late 60s. This is one of the few DVDs to listen to with the comments . It is a visual feast of timeless North African (mainly Saharan) images. You just could not say it was over 35 years ago. The film's soundtrack, featuring classical German music (Mozart and Handel) and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also confers its timeless quality. The narrative by three different German narrators (the German historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid and Herzog continues to explain the important contribution of Eisner to this project, himself and the story but the English The speaker of the translation, James William Gledhill, has a voice that seems downright deific, which lends itself much better to this project, even if a large part of the text, in one or the other language, is rather superfluous. Yes, the false biblical sounds of the creative myth Popul Vuh Maya in the first part of the film, Creation, are interesting, but the text that Herzog wrote for the remaining two parts (Paradise and The Golden Age), as well as quotes of a German poet Herzog Manfred Eigendorf, seems almost a satire of the dark tone of the first part ??. The film, it seems, was reconstructed during the filming of several other Herzog projects - the fictional Even Dwarfs Started Small, and the documentaries The Land Of Silence And Darkness and The Flying Doctors Of East Africa, but the rejected content of these projects only add to the beauty of this film, such as the aerial scenes of a mating lake of flamingos that give a strange and supernatural meaning, a subject that Herzog cries in his commentary. This supernatural sensation is present from the beginning of the film when several planes landed on a desert track. Their images become increasingly blurred as the heat of the ground increases, and the deforming waves that cross it are amplified. That this film had an influence on the movies ?? Quatsi of Godfrey Reggio is a euphemism. But while Reggio is just throwing images at you, Herzog has an ability that only the American filmmaker Terrence Malick also possesses: to create a fully autonomous vocabulary from the juxtaposition of images and words, and to depend on an emotion - first push. The analysis may fail if it is brought to such efforts. Herzog often does not even understand why his art is great. The best he does often is totally unconscious and hypnotic. This is why his contempt for the lowest common denominator of Hollywood is clearly stated in the commentary. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best illustration is a scene that, in the commentary, was followed by Herzog drought in Cameroon. He shows the jerkied cattle carcasses, and Herzog describes the unbearable stench. However, the viewer can feel all this from the images, from the darkness of the parts of sun-dried animals and from the bleached bones. Yet even in this commentary, Herzog focuses on the stench, not on a deeper meaning. He just lets you soak up and interpret what you want and his work, like the almost erotic forms of feminized sand dunes, reminiscent of a scene from Ingmar Bergman's Hour Of The Wolf, where Max Von Sydow passes his hand. gorgeous curves of Ingrid Thulin's naked body. However, the archetypal image of this film, which symbolizes much of Herzog's career, is the mirage of a distant car moving on the surface of what appears to be a lake. He is profound, hypnotic, illusory, elusive, supernatural, but real, as is the believer Herzog, from a family of militant atheists. But then, like everything else, it ends.
