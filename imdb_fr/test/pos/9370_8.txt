"Crossfire" looks like an underdeveloped masterpiece - it's well played and beautifully filmed, but it's written too thinly and far too short. As it stands, it is only a decent police procedure, with allusions to the film noir (at its zenith of 1947) and comment social (also fashionable at the time). We are remembered today as one of the first two Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism and much better than the "Gentleman's Agreement" on the same theme. But his real subject is the difficulty faced by World War II soldiers, as skilled killers, in their transition to civilian life. (For a more distinguished take on this topic, try "The Best Years of Our Life.") A man is beaten to death in the very first footage of the film. We do not see his attacker. The film talks about investigating this murder, which is actually quite simple, but you have to take unnecessary detours, like when the main suspect, a depressed soldier, finds himself in the apartment of Gloria Grahame, a whore of the Dance hall with a strange pimp played by Paul Kelly. There is also a civic education conference midway through the movie that slows down the debate, and the end is pretty neat for a cop show. But otherwise, it's a pretty decent mystery. Yet what a beautiful black it could have been. Director Edward Dmytryk makes some hints about the original novel - homosexuality, not anti-Semitism - like when rampant sadist Monty sees an image of his friend Mitch talking to a strange man in a bar. And the casting is excellent. Robert Ryan makes a very believable moron, and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes, not very different from Peter Lorre in the role of the child assassin in "Mr." He deserved an Oscar but had lost to Edmund Gwenn that year (impossible to beat Santa Claus). Robert Mitchum is a soldier friend of the accused murderer. Was Mitchum a great actor or star? Someone else can understand this, but his sleepy eyes and amused half-smile work very well here because they imply that his character knows something that everyone ignores. (And he does.) And Robert Young, as a murderer detective, is surprisingly serious, giving up his usual affability, even when he has to deliver the mid-term Civil Rights Sermon. There is no doubt that Bogart or Tracy would have been brilliant in this role, but none of them were at the RKO in 1947, so you will have to stick with Dr. Welby. Young, however, is kind enough to want you to wish that someone has thrown him into a police drama instead of "Father Knows Best", which he hated and which led him to alcoholism and attempts to suicide. This man deserved better than Smarm and Sanka.
