I really enjoyed this movie, it certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well run. I think it was important that they show the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobby and show them as emotional people. As this film had to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person. <br /> <br /> I agree with another criticism: it was a sick love, not a true love. He did not need to kill to give a baby to his wife. He should have been honest with her and told him he was sterile and decided to adopt a baby together. Some critics say she was naive, I think it was the case during the adoption, but better actors of all time. Great movie to watch !!
