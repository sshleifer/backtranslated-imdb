Despite the title and unlike other stories of love and war, this film is not too sticky and pink, because love is like a rose: with thorns, it is. The four main actors define their characters in a realistic way, with a good sense and a good balance between tragic and down-to-earth. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of the cabaret / song-esquire songs (sung by Keira Knightley herself) draw the viewer deeper and deeper into the film, from one place to another Between brutal war and peaceful love Some people may find it too much like a biopic, but it's mostly a romantic story, even if it follows Dylan Thomas's life and the triangular relationship of joy and jealousy. . <br /> <br /> For once, London is visualized from another angle, the bohemian life of Dylan during the bombing of the Germans takes place in a floating atmosphere of small rooms, pubs and bars. Independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly immersed in feelings of love and anger. <br /> <br /> Maybe the end is too twisted and does not fit well with the rest of the movie, but overall, it's a beautiful, romantic story.
