This film is surprisingly good. The ninja fight sequences were incredible. I did not see all of Sho Kosugi's films, but it's probably the best of those I've seen. The most impressive fight sequence was probably at the beginning, when the ninja killed about 20 people, this was one of the most impressive ninja fight sequences I've ever seen. Another good fight sequence was at a police burial where the ninja provides more people to bury. The last fight was also very impressive. In addition, I liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja movie, in fact, it was a little different from other ninja movies. So, if you are a fan of ninja movies, you will probably like this one.
