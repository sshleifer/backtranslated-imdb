I was just looking for "who will love my kids" to buy, when I came across this site and on an entry made by a British compatriot !! I am a big fan of this movie and I would have recommended it to everyone. What comforted me was finding someone else who also found comfort in the goodwill of others. I also have a son with Aspergers (among other things) and it's one of my fears to think that if something happened to me and my husband, someone would not only want to take my "normal" daughter, my special and talented son too. Missing at home and being able to communicate with people raised with the same values ​​as me makes more sense than you know. Living here in the United States, I have not yet met anyone who has seen this film. So to all of you who are reading this, if you have not seen it, make an effort to do it. It is a very moving experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you just have a nice bone in your body, you will cry and beg. After that, you will count your blessings. And to all those who have already lived an experience similar or close to this one, my heart is addressed to you. I realize that no matter how difficult or stressful it may be, remember that there is always someone worse than you. An amazing film that makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story. Do not be put off by the sadness of this movie. At the same time, this film is comforting and makes you feel encouraged by the strength and kindness of humanity.
