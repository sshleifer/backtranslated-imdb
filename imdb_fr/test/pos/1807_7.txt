There were a lot of stupid teenagers getting sex movies in the 80s and a lot of slasher movies, but there were only a few that were made with thought, that made you laugh and that they did well captured the period of time; it was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, as is Forman who, from his bio-inferiority, has disappeared from the Hollywood scene. I would like to see this DVD released in a special version with the comments of Cage and Forman. Dream, I know. You always want to plan a real 80s movie weekend, rent this, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club. This will take you back to a "Totally Rad" time which, at the time, seemed a lot simpler. Note to the studios: It's time to release the DVD!
