The duke is a very stupid movie - a dog who becomes a duke! But it's a very funny movie. It has some of those nerdy pranks that a lot of children's movies have, but (thankfully!) No functional jokes like so many movies about animals feel compelled to have! Most of the time, they are just dogs who are dogs and people. . . well, people. The "good guys" are nice and attractive. The "bad guys" are ridiculous, and of course, the pun of many jokes. But there is something worthy about this movie, because even if it's silly, it's not for cheap laughs like "Home Alone" and others. <br /> <br /> Crocket, Simon and Copper do a great job playing Black and Tan Coonhound "Hubert" who becomes Duke after the death of his beloved owner, a true Duke. For the most part, they simply act like dogs, without "talking" or like human emotions and attitudes. However, they stereotype the poodles, and Hubert cracks for her, just because she is a poodle. Come on! They are dogs - they have a different vision of beauty !!! <br /> <br /> Overall, charming, fun and enjoyable.
