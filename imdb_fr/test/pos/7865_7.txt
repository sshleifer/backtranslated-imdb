This strange and hypnotic drama of Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood was abandoned in 1971 and what a pity. A fascinating character study to deal with great women. Geraldine Page was one of our supreme actresses and she is perfectly casted. The young Jo Ann Harris is a charming minx and Elizabeth Hartman (deceased too young) is undeniably repressed. <br /> <br /> A 7 out of 10. Best performance = C. Eastwood. Released the same year as DIRTY HARRY, it does not matter, except to get good reviews. Look for this unless you are only in "Explosion" movies. Very subtle and scary, this room will stay with you.
