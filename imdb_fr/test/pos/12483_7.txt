This film was created with such tenderness that you wanted to be part of it forever. The cops are straight but not without malice, the goods are transparent and the criminals are barely there. Even "cabarets" are so na√Øve that they will make you dream of nostalgia for everything that is available on television. Blier is fine, if a little on one side. Louis Jouvet is perfect, you can not have a better copper. He has the best sentence: "My father cleaned the dirt of others and I do the same". Susy Delair is unbearable, but I guess it's about songs, wardrobe and hairstyle. Simone Renant, on the contrary, makes a great femme fatale, although a little silent. I did not know she might be a lesbian because dbdumonteil, a user of IMDb, and others rightly suggest it.
