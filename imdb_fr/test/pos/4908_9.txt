Directed by Michael Curtiz, Four Daughters is composed of four musically talented sisters, their contenders and their father, a minor conductor. Mickey Borden plays sardonic and speaks fast. The role of the latter was also Claude. It's raining like Adam Lemp and the sisters Lane, Lola, Rosemary and Priscilla and Gale Page as his bouncy girls. His final scene takes place in the lounge of Lemps. Cigarette hanging on his lips, Borden plays one of his own compositions. Ann Lemp of Priscilla Lane tells him that the room is beautiful. But he says, "It stinks." He continues: "There is no beginning or end, but a medium." Ann urges him to create a beginning and an end. Borden replies, "For what purpose, fates are against me, they have thrown away a coin - I am poor, I am rich, but I am rich, but they have thrown a coin with two heads." Spectators liked the way Garfield, in his harsh voice, said it stinks. The scene created Garfield's screen personality as a foreigner from the outside. Four Girls is a part of Americana with Garfield, in a convincing performance, offering more than a hint of darkness. <br /> <br />
