I do not know what some people thought when they said that this movie was bad. It was great. Bruce Campbell classic, yes, it was a small budget and the special effect showed it, but that's not what you see in a Bruce movie. Look at him for Bruce. Ted Rami was also excellent. I found this film hilarious and entertaining. I still crack when I remember Bruce on this pink moped. Now, I'm going to admit that this movie is not for everyone if you do not like B-movies, you're probably not going to like this one if you want big-budget effects and the actors stand aside. But if you like sci-fi and off-the-wall sci-fi movies, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Hail The King Baby!
