A surprisingly beautiful movie. Beautifully designed, beautifully made, beautifully interpreted, beautifully interpreted and beautifully photographed ..... the cinematography is simply beautiful. It's an epic-themed war movie that mixes romance, tragedy and comedy in a story as painful as it is provocative.
