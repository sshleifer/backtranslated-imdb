Originally, I was a Tenacious D fan of their first album and I naturally listened to some of The P.O.D. and was rather disappointed. After watching the movie, my view has been changed. The movie is pretty funny from start to finish and I found myself engaged even though it was a stupid scenario because of the attitudes that KG and Jaybles describe in the film. <br /> <br /> Much more entertaining and enjoyable than the movies I've seen recently in theaters. ex. Saw III (dull and trailing), Casino Royale (way to become homo-erotic) that I really appreciated <br /> <br /> If you liked Borat, you will appreciate the history of the largest group on Earth
