You do not review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, you rate them according to how they meet expectations. There are certain things you can expect, even the demand for a Bond movie, and every individual effort gives results or not. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond movie a Bond movie. And while NEVER SAY NE JAM AGAIN is technically not part of Bond's official filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery, who returns in 007, makes him more than just an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it happens on a scale of 1 to 10. <br /> <br /> Title: NEVER SAY, NEVER AGAIN: The smart title has no apparent connection to the scenario , but rather a reference to a joke The promise of Sean Connery to never play OO7 after being attracted again to DIAMONDS ARE Ever. Anyway, it's a catchy title. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Teaser before credit: Perhaps to avoid any obvious parallel with the official series of Bond EON movies, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: another fake "oh-no, Bond was killed". 4 points. <br /> <br /> Opening Credits: Apart from a screen full of tiny 007 images, they did not even bother to try to brighten the credits with graphics, split screens or angles interesting camera. 1 points. <br /> <br /> Theme song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall, "Never Say Never Again" would be a perfectly enjoyable part of a particularly long ride in an elevator. As Bond's theme, everything is fine. 6 points. <br /> <br /> "Bond, James Bond": Precisely, since this film sees Connery being attracted again by Bond after a break of ten years, the story begins with 007 and asks the question of to know if Bond / Connery is still up to it. Fortunately, Connery proves he's ready for Bondage again. Although he is a little more gray, he has a little more strap and he wears a forelock a little more obvious, he does not seem to have any difficulty to get back to action. All in all, it's one of the best and most relaxed Connery turns into a character. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Babes: Even in Bond's best movies, female characters do not have much dimension; they exist largely as accessories necessary for the use of Bond. The future winner of an Oscar, Kim Basinger, has a lot of leeway to create his character Domino Petachi and the film benefits. She does a good job - and she is not bad to watch either. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Villain: With reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back - at least for now - showing that he has had more lives than his esteemed cat. Once Jesus becomes a stereotyped character, Max von Sydow does not have much to do in the role, but still remains a silky presence. But he is eclipsed by a magnificent performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a series of bad guys from Bond, it's very refreshing for Brandauer to give a subtle and colorful performance. Funny without being a camper, ruthless without looking like a cartoon; his Largo is among the best villains of Bond with Auric Goldfinger. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Bad Badies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? Like an interpretation of the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag-queen, Barbara Carrera scours the film, displaying a mixture of self-amused wickedness and more than a touch of pure psychotic madness. Bond came across several femme fatales, most of which were eliminated so easily that they existed more as a feast for the eyes than as characters. But few people have dared to show such zeal for such fierce and dramatic determination. Even his premature death is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Sinister: the plot is a remake of THUNDERBALL: the film seems a little passed for nothing: the nuclear missiles are stolen and the big real estate projects will go to kaboom if all the countries of the world do not pay not a ransom of several kazillions. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to be forced to redo one of Bond's weakest adventures. By comparison, this effort propels THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds alone. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Values ​​of production: the film begins with an uncomfortable style, like a TV movie that tries to be more than possible. But as the story progresses, the film gains momentum and meaning, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bonus Points: Several strange changes distinguish this James Bond movie from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly recognized; According to Edward Fox, "M" is a grumpy old man with no respect for the "Double Bone", prefiguring the way Judi Dench would later play the role; and "Q" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, for example replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number cleverly inserted into the story. And a great rescue to the end is on horseback, a tribute to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to Bond movies. 5 points. <br /> <br /> Summary: NEVER SAY, NEVER AGAIN, it's a mixed bag. In the most important areas, he is more than fighting because of the hero Connery, the wicked Brandauer, the murderer Carrera and the damsel in distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as apparently unimportant as the opening credits, the theme song, etc., the film is missing because of their absence. All this looks like a fake Bond movie; a very good substitute, but nevertheless a substitute. <br /> <br /> Bond-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.
