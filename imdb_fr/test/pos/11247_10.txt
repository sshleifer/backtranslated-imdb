I'm sure all Canadians on IMDb are very familiar with Canadian content and how much of it is ... well, let's say dull. Some Canadian programs are worth watching, but it's certainly one of them. <br /> <br /> Simple premise. Two guys picking up girls in a bar with some guidelines and rules, add some nifty and clever comments from a group of amazingly friendly and self-proclaimed "Alpha Males" and you have yourself a very entertaining lineup. Every episode is solid. If the "players" are below normal, there are difficult times to live, and there is a slight fun to stuff them. If the "players" are good, it leads to times when you just have to get up and applaud, and to the comical praise that is lavished on them. <br /> <br /> The premise is a little trashy, I know, and a guy who is generally proud of the fact that I am raised above the terrible and typical reality TV, I need a lot to admit that this show is really funny and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing that must be emphasized is how The Comedy Network did a terrible job in marketing this show. For a very long time, I did not even know the premise and all I knew was that there was somehow a shirtless guy who "likes cougars". However, after watching the show, I was surprised to see how surprisingly smooth Canadian content is (despite a rather weak sequence of opening credits). So give him a chance. I have not yet found a member of the target group (men aged 18 to 30) who watched the show (and not just annoying ads) who did not like it. <br /> <br /> Bring him back for a third season, Comedy Network. This is a good premise, unlike other Canadian programs you have had (girls who cough * will be girls * who are coughing). In general, I reserve 10/10 of "works of art", but I have so much fun watching this show and I think it was unfairly judged by many, that I had to do it.
