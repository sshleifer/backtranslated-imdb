to history. It is a mixed reality of American and very original. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage in New England. His shady boss suggests he leave the office and take some money from the register. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short trip, and his Ford Escort goes out. She then meets a senior couple, represented by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have a RV and graciously help her out - it's not safe for a girl to be alone on the road. Especially I-95. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is very realistic like Alice and initially lets the character of Judith Ivey help her; buy decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. At first, it's a good holiday for Alice, who hopes to meet her girlfriend, who is attending college in Miami. There is an interesting cinematography, while the trio drives the camper in Florida: the stops, the bland landscapes and the beautiful mountains of North Carolina. Stories made about her daughter, as well as about her husband, who now seems a little sinister. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to ruin the result of this film - but it ends positively while the audience is waiting in suspense- This film It reminded me a little of the "Duel" of Spielberg - even if at the beginning it was not so threatening - the moral of the story is - you never know what people think - especially if you drive across the country. You must beware!!. You will enjoy this movie.
