I remember the revival of skateboarding in the 70s. I begged my parents for money through a used skateboard from a friend. It was a piece of junk, with clay wheels and everything. I also remember reading Skateboarder Magazine and being both totally impressed and totally terrified by the Dogtown team. Skating has never become a way of life for me, but in a way, it has always been part of my life, whether it's using a board for transportation or having a group friends skating. <br /> <br /> This film is a brilliant documentary on the true birth of modern skating. Watching this crew go from a boring and flat pastime to the vertical lifestyle I'm sitting on now left me speechless for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that there are still enough footage from this era to have created this film, and thank you for that. The footage is brilliant. I had the feeling of looking at an old Buster Keaton movie: I saw some of the stuff that Keaton has repeated many times in other movies since, but when you come back to see the first person who performed this It's amazing, not only were they the first person to try it, but they experienced it and made it easy. It's the feeling that this film gave me. Yes, I've seen people skate in the pool before, but looking at FIRST people skating pools and inventing the tricks that have finally become the basis of modern skating is like watching the front of the house fall on Keaton, leaving him safe in a window. It's absolutely great to watch something that has not been tried before, but since then almost everyone has tried it. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautiful to watch and amazing to listen to. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a movie. It's a movie that will please people, whether they like to skate or not. I talked to one or two of my friends who forced their friends to watch the movie after a violent protest. They all declared that their friends were fascinated by the end of the film and that they loved her so much. <br /> <br /> Regarding the previous comments on this chart that complain that the film is too laudatory, I think it is an unfair denigration. I loved seeing these guys get excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. They have the right to congratulate themselves. They were stars to do what they liked to do. Most of these boys / girls have never achieved today's resounding success for Tony Hawk, but this kind of success was not within the reach of skaters at the time. While they were successful, but more importantly, they were able to live a life doing what they love, and, as we see in the end, almost all still surf, work or work in surf / skate industry. How many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have succeeded in breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? They can. I want to thank the Dogtown and Z-Boys for being themselves and for changing the world of skateboarding forever.
