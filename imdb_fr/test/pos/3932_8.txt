I saw a preview of Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a good time! After seeing peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10), I enjoyed it a lot! As we can see in the trailer, I had the impression to think that an entire city could be "forgotten", but it's a horror film with cheese popcorn, so I accept it for what it is. <br /> <br /> My only major complaint Do I suppose that Paris Hilton would touch wax or soak, etc.? and would moan "it's hot" but they did not do it (how could they resist ???). <br /> <br /> There is NO nudity in the 2 girls although Paris is superb in her lingerie! I'm surprised they did not put a 3rd "hot token victim" in the movie for a useless nudity that is the norm for this type of movie! I will not list detractors of death or intrigue BUT I will say that Paris and Eliza are both abused! <br /> <br /> The characters are developed properly and are a bit friendly (not like Cabin Fever where you wanted them to die) and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the first 30 minutes like most horror movies. I give him an 8/10 because he delivered good breaks and gore and I had little expectations getting into it. If you go with friends who like cheese horror movies, you'll have a good time. <br /> <br /> Noah
