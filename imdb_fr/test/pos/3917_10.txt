It was the biggest movie I've ever seen in my life, the action was awesome and I was so scared, there was a lot of gore that made it great, I would see it another 1,000 times, and Paris Hilton, D * MN she's doing well in this movie. Anyway, I would recommend it to anyone, even to kids (like me). Adults love him. You'd probably have nightmares at night, but next to that, IT'S IMPERATIVE, I CAN NOT STOP BRAGGING. ALWAYS SIN AUGEST WHEN I AGREED TO KNOW THIS I BRAGGED AND BRAGGED AND AT SCHOOL I gave a leaflet saying the May 6 wax house to see. I have my school in it. Anyway, I would certainly say that SEE IT 6 house of wax is here.
