I agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews. I saw this at the South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin. Of the 20 films I saw, 7 were really good and it was the best for me. I am a sucker for intriguing movies where characters undergo transformations that totally change their lives. The excellent acting was mainly done by people involved in television, or it was their first film. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. It was his debut as a director. Jay's day job is apparently a licensing administrator of many famous movies. Forgetting Franklins was a total delight and extremely funny in places. It's a movie where I would buy the DVD and watch it again, which is really a complement to me. Bravo Jay, yes ... give up your job!
