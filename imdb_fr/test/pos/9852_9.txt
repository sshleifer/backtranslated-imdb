I've heard about this documentary for so long that I knew I had to take the time to watch it. As a documentary, it's very well done, as it takes a neutral view of their experience. There is no voiceover or interview. It's honest, it's true. It's also humiliating. Two comments really stayed with me after the end of the movie. One of them was to tell the boys not to become like the American boys who wear baggy trousers, and that in Africa there is time but no money, but in America there is some money but no time. The most important impact was the boys' thirst for education and the way in which one of the boys totally moved to school. I watched this film with a high school sophomore who said it upset him to see how boys were brought into their new lives with no real focus on America. He also said he knew so many American teenagers who just can not understand how blessed their lives are in America. I agree with him on both accounts. A strong film that will let a person think of many things.
