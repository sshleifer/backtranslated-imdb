This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters does a fair job as a pirate and does decent work in his saber fights. (As long as it can have a double action, it's hard to say ... but Peters herself does a good part of it and does it well.) ++++ With a good, serious storyline, this could have been to be an excellent film. But it's essentially corny. Always fun though. ++++ Not at the height of a Jacques Tournier film, but far above a film by Jean Peters. The color is typical of this period of the 50s, namely. too loud and not realistic. The actors of Blackbeard, his first companion and the drunken doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a little weak. I do not think Debra Paget was right either. But certainly, Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two most beautiful female stars of the fifties.
