It was incredible. As a librarian and participant in the New York Library Association's "Vitality Fund" event on the evening of Thursday, October 18th, I had the privilege of attending the preliminary screening of the new movie The Kite Runner. The film's release was delayed due to concerns about the well-being of the children involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event has been allowed to proceed as planned. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, I feel that it is masterful. I think it has had as much impact as Stanley Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange, though it's a lot less graphic - MUCH less. There is no possible comparison between the horrendous and shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the low amount of violence shown in Kite Runner; only the subject and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. (I wrote more details about child abuse and rape and how it was treated on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this movie was fantastic; one of the best-made films I've seen. The depiction of Afghan boys flying kites has captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to the world. The subject is extremely serious and the film conveys the audience's emotions in this subject without a lot of "Hollywood touches" that have ruined other films. Although the inverted cart of grenades is an element of obvious symbolism (for me). <br /> <br /> Finally, I must mention the excellence of the soundtrack. Rumi's poetry recitation as the main characters fleeing the country during the Russian invasion - in terrifying circumstances - truly demonstrated the power of these poems. I urge all observers to ignore the subtitles of this scene as much as possible and listen only to the beauty of the language. I do not even know which language Amir quotes, if his Persian dari dialect is identical to that of Rumi. Also, please note the sound heard whenever a kite line is cut. I found the sound deep and distinct, although the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. I can not help but wonder if kites actually produce a sound of this type when they are "cut" or if it gives an idea of ​​the vibrations / sounds felt by the kite pilot during the competition .
