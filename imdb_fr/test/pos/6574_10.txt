Roopa (Kamalinee Mukherjee) loses his parents and other family members in a terrible car accident. She begins to live alone as an independent woman without any help from her relatives. She has a boyfriend named Rahul (Anuj) and is about to marry him, but she withdraws because of her future mother-in-law's behavior and her boyfriend's lack of confidence. Anand (Raja) joins his neighborhood. And he begins to make Roopa feel comfortable and safe. The rest of the story goes on to explain why Anand - the managing director of the richest AP company house - chose to reside as Roopa's neighbor and what follows thereafter. <br /> <br /> This film has a freshness that is rarely seen in Indian films. Although the story is moving slowly, you feel the sense of familiarity. Congratulations to the director shekhar kammula for such a direction! Brilliant music and score composed by K.M. Radhakrishnan adds to the quality. Kamalini mukherjee as Rupa gave a wonderful performance. I think she was the best choice for this role because of her non-glamorous appearance and incredible histrionics. Anand like Raja did well too. I watched this movie three times now and enjoyed it every time. This is a class outside of the daily dose of action movies that we receive here. Highly recommended !!
