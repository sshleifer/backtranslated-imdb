I loved this movie when I was a child. I saw him in theater. Randy Edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack. David Seville is the father and head of the Chipmunks registration. The Chipmunks are composed of Alvin, known for playing the harmonica, Simon, a brilliant and studious chipmunk, and Theodore, the youngest and always hungry. There is a lady known as Miss Miller, who deals with chipmunks, and has three daughters named Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor, all of whom have the same character as the Chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack are "Diamond Dolls", "The Girls of Rock & Roll" and the touching "My Mother." Alvin really wanted to see Europe while Dave had to go on business. World in 30 days of video game that brought them to face each other to do the real thing.
