I must admit that I did not expect it to be as good as it was. Nor did I expect Samuel L. Jackson to play on the slide and sing in blue either. <br /> <br /> Beaver County PA's Cinemark does this frequently. They advertise movies in the lobby, you are excited to see them, then you disappoint by not showing them ... <br /> <br /> I was expecting that with such a nice cast of Jackson and Ricci and even a former N'Syncer (Timberlake), that this movie would have at least shown for a week. But at that time, if I remember correctly, MI3 was projected on 3 screens (this one or another type of supposed blockbuster). <br /> <br /> Like Blues Brothers and Crossroads, this film takes up the mystique and the legend of what blues is about. Passion and difficult times. Religion and sex. Hell Hounds from the past. Redemption. I mean, so many elements go into the blues for it to work. <br /> <br /> It was just a good general story. Of course, not many people will see it because it does not have pirates or spiders that sway. But he has Samuel L. Jackson ... <br /> <br /> Think about what happens to the Pulp Fiction Jacksons character after traveling the Earth and settling in, which basically describes him as a "T ". /> <br /> Great and underrated, but all the good ones like that are not they anyway?
