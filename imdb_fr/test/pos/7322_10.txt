This is a short film by Stooge that uses satire in conjunction with slapstick, a rarity. As mentioned, the title and concept of this short film were "borrowed" from a feature film of the same year with Clark Gable entitled "Men In White". It is essentially the trials and tribulations of the interns and their sacred cause for "duty and humanity". I saw him recently and I almost treated him as the Stooge version because he takes himself a little too seriously. In any case, "Men In Black" is so well written, directed and not to mention the original, he did not borrow anything from Chaplin or any of the others, which the Motion Picture Academy named him for the best comedy short film of 1934. A stinking short film called "La Cucaracha" surpassed it and stole the prize. The brother-in-law of some producers must have been a member of the electoral committee of the Academy. "Men In Black" makes fun of the whole concept of the medical profession, just like the Marx Bros. have always done at this time. The comparison may not be right, but I can see the Marx Bros. in this short film. In fact, in their feature film "Un jour aux courses", there is a scene where there are "medical things" that cause anarchy as usual. I suppose this short film was judged in this sense and therefore why it was nominated in the first place. Try this in fact: watch this short film first, then watch "Duck Soup" or "Day at the Races" with the Marx, and see if there is not the same great comedy quality.
