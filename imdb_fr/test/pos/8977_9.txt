I stopped watching "The West Wing" after Aaron Sorkin stopped writing and producing. It was just not the same thing. Imagine my pleasure to see a movie he wrote again. It's been a long time - The American president, Some good men. His screenplay was a beautiful mix of humor and tragedy. He made a fascinating story credible and made me cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was amazing as a small Texas congressman whose constituents wanted lower taxes and kept their guns. It's not hard work, so he had plenty of time to have fun - and he did it. His office staff seemed to be at Playboy Mansion. As he would have said, "You can teach them to type, but you can not teach them how to grow breasts." Despite his sexist attitude, which accords perfectly with a Texas congressman, they were fiercely loyal, especially his help, Amy Adams (Junebug & Hooters old girl). <br /> <br /> Now add a rich Texas socialist who wants something done in Afghanistan, perfectly played by Julia Roberts; and a very painful CIA agent, beautifully directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie to watch absolutely. <br /> <br /> Exceptional writing, exceptional acting and a story that deserved to be said. What do you want more at the cinema?
