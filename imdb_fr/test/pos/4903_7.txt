Although this is a "woman's story", I found it quite interesting. It's unusual to see three real sisters playing the sisters in the movie! I am referring to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> Why did the national critics like this movie? It was the presence of John Garfield, the rebel of the bad boy. In their twisted, Liberal-dominated minds, the American characters are disgusting, but the bad-attitude and bad-minded types, like Garfield's, are people they can relate to. Despite this, this film still has a general feeling of kindness, which is why I liked it. Some characters may have done stupid things, but they have a good heart. Which heart was bigger than "Ann's" (Priscilla Lane) here? I agree with the comments of IMDb users who say that it is Priscilla's movie as much as Garfield's, my beloved (not by me). <br /> <br /> With a director of the caliber of Michael Curtiz, the film is better than it could have been under someone else. Curtiz has made sure that no scene, whether it is soapy or otherwise, lasts too long. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Lane and Garfield sisters, we have Claude Rains (who adds the necessary humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (The main love interest of girls), Gale Page, Dick Foran , Frank McHugh and Mae Robson. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this film had to be a success because it had several spinoffs, neither of them approaching this one in content and box office success.
