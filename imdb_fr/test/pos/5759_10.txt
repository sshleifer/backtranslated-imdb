I've been a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson since I remember his kids or his stockings. and I just have to say that I have never laughed so much in my life !!! parado guest house is really great! I know it will not be everyone's cup of tea (with vomiting, burlesque comedy, violence and foul language), but then do not look at it if it's not yours. it's not like nobody knows what Rik and Ade have to say sick and twisted things when they work together! I think it's unfair that this movie receives such a lot of criticism from critics because, and I do not think I'm the only one to think, this film is worth 10 out of 10! :)
