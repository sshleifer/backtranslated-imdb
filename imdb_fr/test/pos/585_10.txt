"Why are there so many songs on Rainbows, and what's on the other side?" Kermit poses this relatively simple interrogative double at the beginning of "The Muppet Movie" by singing his flagship song, "The Rainbow Connection". Over time, the question and the movie only get deeper. <br /> <br /> I will drop the criticism of this movie as a children's comedy, but rather as a classic for all generations. love with serious ideals and a comforting message that is gaining warmth with each passing year. <br /> <br /> As the milestones of my own life come to my head, I hear more and more of the evocative accents of this elemental song and realize that it suits the soundtrack of the life of everyone, because we all dream. And that's what this movie is about. It's not just a puppet group, it's a puppet group with the strength to pursue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> And while the humor and cheerfulness of the film always feel good, they are not a fair judge of the film. Only "The Rainbow Connection" and the powerful emotions he will achieve. And all this fits in: "Rainbow Connection" * is * the Muppet movie, and vice versa. Existentialism meets children's entertainment - there is no easier way to describe it.
