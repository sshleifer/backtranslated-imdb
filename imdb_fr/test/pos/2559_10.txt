Where do I start? Let me tell you that after watching all the film and special features of the DVD, my wife and I again watched the film in its entirety with the director's comments. I do not remember having endured more than 7 minutes of this kind of commentary for a movie. It's worth hearing. <br /> <br /> I'm not a boy from the South, but I spent some time in nearby Memphis a long time ago and I have an idea of ​​the area. This film feels almost south, it's so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my favorite actors of all time, is gorgeous like Lazarus, emotionally curved, and Christina Ricci interprets the role of her life as Rae, a woman who was seriously injured during her brief life. I always liked the work of Mrs. Ricci, but in this performance, she gives herself 137% of herself every second on the screen. Rewards and small statues are not enough to reward her for showing in front of the public in this film. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the essence of the story. So I only comment on the work. I had heard Justin Timberlake's name before seeing "BSM", but I did not know what he looked like, or even why he was famous. By knocking my head at 60, I'm out of his target population, to say the least. After seeing this movie, I will recognize it. He can act! He gives a substantial and credible performance as a soulmate of the county slut. <br /> <br /> The director comes from Memphis and shows respect for his region. He is also a storyteller of excellent stories. <br /> <br /> ..... and I have to mention the music. I love the blues and the soundtrack of Black Snake Moan is a feast for blues fans. <br /> <br /> I write less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this film exceeds my sentence structure. See this movie, and I mean now.
