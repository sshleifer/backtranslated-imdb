Crossfire (1947) <br /> <br /> Great message, great symbolism, very good movie <br /> <br /> It's hard to be totally wrong with Robert Mitchum, Robert Young and Robert Ryan, all three of you, the director, Edward Dmytryk, bringing together a complicated murder and a police wire. This is reason enough to look at it once and even twice. <br /> <br /> You may need a second look to understand the plot because it is explained (too) or displayed in the flashback (too much), because it's a bit complicated without good reason. But it makes sense overall, and we see early (too soon probably) who is the culprit and even why. <br /> <br /> Besides the drama, well played in a typical black lighting and filled with these little jokes that To make dramatic post-war movies, there is the social message, the anti-anti-Semitic point of all of this. It only comes close to preaching once or twice, and it's so obvious that we have to look at it with approval and wait for intrigue and dramatic play to take the lead. What they do, especially Young, who is a bright, laconic and patient detective, and Ryan, who is mean in a cruel and angry way (Ryan is good at that, his typography is reasonable). Mitchum plays mainly a diluted version of what he is famous for, and the fourth known actress force, Gloria Grahame, is a terrific and brief presence, even if it is slightly derisory. <br /> <br /> Although the film is dominated by the sequence of events and the message, both of which grow as time goes by, it is very easy to watch only the lighting, the camera work and acting, including the classic fight scene that opens the first few seconds of the movie, everything is done with shadows. <br /> <br /> The archetypes of the soldiers presented are very deliberate, and maybe it was something the people of the day knew very well and could relate as much as the thread of anti-Semitism. The soldier in shock, rendered helpless (but still intrinsically capable), the modest young man without trust (but also capable), and the exhausted veteran but able to act from outside are all present. And of course, the violent and angry soldier who is a product of the war too. This last aspect is also the responsibility of society: even the army is doing everything possible to remedy the injustices committed here, not only because they are criminal, but because they result from the wear and tear of a long time. and terrible war. <br /> <br /> The audience could really, but more than ever, appreciate.
