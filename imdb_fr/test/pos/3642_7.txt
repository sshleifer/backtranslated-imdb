The quality of the animation here is much lower than that of the IMO, regardless of the age of the FVO. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters do not do it. <br /> <br /> It may seem difficult, but since the city of Olympus is almost exclusively inhabited by living machines, would you feel comfortable as a human being? Would a machine so effectively imitate human arrogance, myopia and greed? I doubt. There are some indications about this in the film, but only when the team can be disturbed to integrate them, the "bioroids" (or what they are) are interchangeable with human characters. It seems to me cowardly. <br /> <br /> The main characters seem to have some sort of emotional entanglement, although nothing illuminates about it. There is little light on the background, a great pity. The short duration of the film, coupled with the focus on mecha and crime, means that we see no depth in the characters. The basic work is finished, but no finished product remains. A cropped version of this OAV would have been a big TV episode, once sub-plots of characters were established. <br /> <br /> The highlights of this short film are the mecha and the action / espionage. <BR/> <br /> The defects really start to show up once you've had the chance to digest everything that's going on, so I can not recommend it to an owner, but it's definitely worth a watch or two! Although this review is mostly negative, I really think it's worth looking at this, but it's not something to buy and buy. <br /> <br /> In short: a spoiled and watchable opportunity
