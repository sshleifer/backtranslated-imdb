The philosophical and meditative tone of this film makes it unique. I would give him 10 stars for that alone. That being said, what struck me with particular strength was what I mistakenly thought was his artistic direction. Most interior shots show a rich combination of color blends apparently based on very discreet Munsell color scheme progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the film probably unrealistic in the eyes of contemporaries, but, in my eyes, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself. I think this film is truly unique for this quality and it certainly deserves a complete, meticulous and digital restoration. Fox, are you listening to me?
