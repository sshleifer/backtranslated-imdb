This is a scary underestimated gem with scary performances and a fantastic finale! All the characters are great and the story was great. Besides, I thought the end was really cool! The plot was great, and it never bothered me. In addition, while the children actors were bad, they gave me goosebumps! Some time ago, it happened on the space channel. So I decided to check and register. I read good reviews from my fellow horror fans. Martin was fantastic in his role of worshiper of Satan. There are tons of scary atmosphere, and it stops you from guessing, all the characters were very friendly, and you really start to root for Ben and his family! There are many troubling moments and the film really upset me, besides, it is extremely well done with a small budget! This is a scary underestimated gem, with scary performances and a fantastic finale !, I highly recommend this one! The direction is very good! Bernard McEveety does a very good job here, with great camera work, creating a scary atmosphere and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! There is a little blood and blood. We have a severed leg, many bloody corpses, a slashed throat, sharp edges and dice, beheading and impaling. The game is excellent! Strother Martin is fantastic here! As a devotee of Satan, he is extremely terrifying, very convincing, very scary, extremely intense, seemed to have fun and did a fantastic job overall. Charles Bateman is great as a dad, he was very affectionate, very friendly and did a good show! I loved him very much. L.Q. Jones is great as a sheriff, he was funny, besides, looked very young, had a cool character and had just done a great job overall! Ahna Capri is good as a girlfriend and did very well what she had to do. Charles Robinson acted too much as a priest and did not convince me at all !, And that laugh was particularly bad. Geri Reischl is actually decent as a girl, she was rather nice and only pissed me off a few times, I liked her rather. Alvy Moore was clumsy, but very friendly in his role as Tobey, I searched it! The rest of the distribution is good. Overall, I highly recommend it! *** 1/2 out of 5
