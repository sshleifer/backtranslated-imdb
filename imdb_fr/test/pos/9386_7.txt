As Roger Corman said in an interview, producing low-budget films allows filmmakers to take risks with offbeat ideas. Well, you'd be hard-pressed to find a film as fulfilling as George Barry's "The Bed of Death: The Bed Eating". <br /> <br /> The film has a story, and it's an interesting one. I will not give up any kind of details so that you can hear them yourself if you take the risk of watching them. Suffice it to say that the furniture in title has an insatiable hunger and consumes the imprudent one with a bubbling yellow foam which dissolves its victims like an acid. <br /> <br /> "The bed of death" is a scary little film that haunts plays its absurd principle in such a way that it transcends the usual range of schlock tariffs. He occupies his dream world in such a way that I have been able to take it seriously. It's a really strange and unconventional horror film. There are entrepreneurial ingredients - there are delicious creations of feminine nudity - and it's also art, although art with a completely biased sensibility. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not so bad for a film with a microscopic budget and Barry gives the film a nice and atmospheric "midnight film" quality. The acting game is as devoid of inspiration as one can imagine, although Patrick Spence-Thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as an artist / narrator, and one of the points of interest is to see a familiar face: the future 'Boy Meets World' father William Russ! <br /> <br /> This film might not even have found the little cult that it would have been without the pirated copies; this must certainly be considered one of the cases where such a practice eventually ended up helping the film - even if the exhibition took years to materialize. <br /> <br /> If you have a taste for really odd dark objects, "Deathbed" may be what you have in mind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
