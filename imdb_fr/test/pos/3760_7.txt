Mark Blankfield (from the old late-night "Fridays" TV show) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a gentle-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that makes him a drugged party animal. It was not, of course, his intention, he had higher aspirations, but he follows the current. It's actually a pretty stupid movie, but it's also a lot of fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's no more proud than to redo everything and turns to Hollywood as a crazy sex machine with curly strings and golden chains. There are some subplots like Jekyll's fianc√©e, daughter of the chief doctor of Our Lady of Sufferings and Bread, the employer of Jekyll. And there is Tim Thomerson as a plastic surgeon with seemingly few "real" pieces and a taste for men, and a rich old man whose situation is a parody of Howard Hughes, and who will make several rich people with a full set of organ transplants, including testicles. Yes, the humor is fiery and silly, and all in all, the whole thing is rather tasteless, but if you're not above a quick whisper in the gutter, you'll probably like it very well. Now available on DVD too, for the first time! Woohoo! 7 out of 10
