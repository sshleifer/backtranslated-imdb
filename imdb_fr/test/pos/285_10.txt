My friends and I used to meet in a house to watch it on a Friday night before going to the pub. This is the only program that made us miss the opening time. It's one of the best comedies I've ever seen, if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and was compared many times to Buster Keaton with his smart stunts that were done in a credible way. I wish I could get the series on DVD to watch it again. He had an incredible ability to make stupid things believable and this show shows his talent in so many different directions. He is an accomplished "travel and fall guy" and I remember watching a trailer showing people how to do it professionally. He is certainly the one who teaches this art to people. He only showed a glimpse of it in programs other than himself. Pshaw, this program shows how talented he is. I do not know why David Jason vetoed the creation of another series. As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best things he's done and I've been one of his fans since its inception. They say he did not like it because it showed the brutality of his early career. In my opinion, it may have been the right decision when he took it, but now that his career has progressed so far, I think it would be a good time for him to do another show showing him in returning to his "secret life". "full of blunders that he does not see.
