While the final scene of the film froze to reveal the little details about Buddy Holly's death, I thought to myself that there are still people alive today in Clearlake, Iowa, who remember this scene. It must be a haunting memory, made even more poignant by the words of "American Pie", because it pays homage to the day when the music is dead. The world lost a huge talent that day, lives sliced ​​before their heyday, and one can only wonder what could have been if the trio of musicians who had died that day had survived to create a musical legacy even bigger. <br /> <I watched the movie today, about thirty years after its original release in theaters. Thirty years, I have trouble understanding. I had forgotten many things, while remembering little things, like the cricket in the wall that immortalized with the name of the group. But most of all, I remember the music. It's hard to sit around doing nothing and not start beating the beat of "Oh Boy" or "It's going to be the day," and you have to wonder where the threat to our morality might come from these tunes. I am with Buddy at least on this point. How could they be rhythms of the jungle if he invented them? It's funny to see that each successive decade has put its own threat on the social fabric - the Beatles, Motown, Disco and a host of other musical forms. We always listen and dance to the rhythm, so I guess they could not have been so bad. <br /> <br /> There was another conclusion of the movie that I had forgotten. That's where I learned to tap a phone on the table when the person on the other end did not see things in my own way. I have done it several times over the years, but I have now forgotten the source. Well, I should be good for another thirty years now. <br /> <br /> You must certainly pay tribute to Gary Busey for his interpretation of Buddy Holly. Seeing him today, you'll never imagine him as a tapered rocker with horn-rimmed glasses, but it's a tour de force that earned Busey an Oscar. Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith are competent as members of Buddy's band, even though their characters take a back seat in much of the story. I enjoyed the subtle ways in which other musical legends have been incorporated into the photo, names like Sam Cooke and King Curtis, without ever insisting on their presence. <br /> <br /> I will always be a fan and music fan of the '50s and' 60s - the "old hits" they call now. I guess that makes me a little old man too, but you can not replace the experience of growing up with the history of music that is now on the big screen. This only reinforces the idea that I will continue to enjoy music until the day of my death.
