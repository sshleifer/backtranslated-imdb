At first, I thought this movie was going to annoy me. It was as if I had already seen this movie somewhere. The disillusioned hero, the 9 year old father and sister, older and wiser than his years (see Gregory's daughter), but not 15 minutes later, it became a comic jewel of a movie. Dylan Moran (who I thought was going to bother me) was excellent. As were Mr. Gambon and the crazy Scottish hitman. Lena Headey was extremely sexy. During half of the movie, I tried to remember where I had seen it before. Parole Officer. She has the most amazing smile. But the real hero of this movie is clearly Mr. Caine. This man should do a lot more comedy. He ranks alongside some of his best roles in comedy (Without Index, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels). It is a pleasure to watch all his scenes, but especially the end. <br /> <br /> Nobody can really say what Michael can do. <br /> <br />
