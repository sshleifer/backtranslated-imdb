The priest, in deep love and suffering has not shown the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has the high beauty of the soul of man (or vampire?) . http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> And the femme fatale's love is not notorious, but it's nice to take responsible death in vampire . She did not continue to sink into the lost paradise, but decided to leave the man alone. Femme fatale fragile but adorable! This film made me think of the suffering between the man and the vampire, far beyond the priest, and the salvation. So I thought about love. Adam was not so much responsible for Eve but for that sacrificial Adam (priest) responsible for picking up Eve from the lost paradise, from the vampire world. Another symphonic poem by Adam & Eve, Paradise Lost.
