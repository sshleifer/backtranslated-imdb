It's a movie that really makes you think about your life, our culture, our family structures and our situational actions. I will not give the plot in this post, I think others have already beaten me. I hope that, despite the reviews you have read on this site, you will enjoy and you will see this movie. I went to see this film with my husband and a friend and I must say that after the movie, the silence was total at the theater. After a few minutes, I looked behind me and everyone in the theater stared at the screen, lost in thought. It will take you deep into your psychological abyss and reflect on many things: <br /> <br /> How does society affect my life and that of my generation? <br /> <br /> How long does someone have to pay for the mistakes they made? <br /> <br /> If there is a second chance given, does this happen? <br /> <br /> Is it better to live in a box or not live at all? <br /> <br /> My questions are not intended to show my approval or disapproval of Leland's actions. I do not want my opinion to dictate what you are going to remove from this film, so I do not give it. See for yourself. I am always lost in my thoughts, trying to answer my many questions from the movie. I really appreciated and I hope you too. This movie does not try to answer questions, approve an action or promote punishment. This film tries to get us to evaluate our lives and remove the pink glasses that most of us see around the world. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie. 9 out of 10 stars
