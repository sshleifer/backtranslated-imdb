I liked this film which deals entirely with an average family, it seems. Ben Travis (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of a father who is only interested in one son who is great at swimming and wins many trophies. However, he hates him a lot and even his father. Ben has very little to say to his other son, Tim (Emile Hirsh) and even his daughter Penny (Michelle Williams), who is fortunate enough to miss college. The mother, Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the family together and even her husband ignores her completely. A very tragic event occurs in the family and changes the personality of each. Young and old start to use drugs, smoke marijuana and drink all the time at parties. There is even a homosexual scene and at the same time, there is even room for comedy and of course, there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis finally revealed to her son Tim.
