I just received this movie for Christmas and I have already added it to my favorites list. A cute and simple story that makes a beautiful film. Who could not like Uncle Felix or not have mouth watering to the sound of all this food. Specific points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his performance of Alexander Yardley and Reginald Gardiner who played John Sloane, the incredibly boring fiancee. Really a jewel to watch every Christmas.
