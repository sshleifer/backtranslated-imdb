Perhaps the best role of John Travolta ever. Saturday Night Fever was a great movie and role, but a long time ago. I can not think of many of his films or roles that I even liked, and it's easy to think of rotten movies. He can do bad guys like in Pulp Fiction, but he's the perfect funky angel, and it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job (just as modest). Parcel summaries are available everywhere, but the plot is not the problem. Just go for a ride and enjoy the intelligence of small amusements along the way. There is nothing wrong with this movie unless you look for something deep. I wish there were more movies like this one. We need a break from deep or awesome or macabre or complex or hysterical.
