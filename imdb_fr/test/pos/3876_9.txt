Team A repeats every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 6 pm) and I watch it again! I do not like Team A ... I love them absolutely !! It's great to see Justin suing former A-Team members. Bring back memories of the good old days, when I was young and sweet. I would have given you a 10 for the excellent, but Justin seems to be chasing the former members of the A-Team alone. Of course, that's the only bad thing about this documentary. Too bad Justin is not looking for Melinda Culea ("Amy A. Allen"). But it's good to see Mr. T. back to action. Too bad for him, he does not show up at the party, at the end. But this holiday is too short to laugh again and see everyone in action.
