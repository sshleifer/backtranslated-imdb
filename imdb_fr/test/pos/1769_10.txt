Pavarotti and the cast are superb in this beautifully filmed opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the world's greatest opera composer. The soprano coloratura is particularly spectacular with its perfect height. The title role is well played and well sung. All production is as perfect as you would expect. <br /> <br /> A masterpiece of cinematography! <br /> <br />
