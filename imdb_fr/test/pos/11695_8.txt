Crackerjack is a blockbuster movie at the Cityside Australian Suburban PÃ©tanque Club. Mick Molloy plays a crook who has marked free parking spaces in Cityside. When the club is under pressure to set up poker machines on their premises, they must raise $ 8,000 to prevent this from happening. The club needs new members to help him and that's where the Mick Molloys character comes in and has to play to save the club. With many emerging and aging Australian actors, Crackerjack is a hidden gem. Be warned if most jokes are for those who have knowledge of lawn bowls, but there are many amusing sight gags that provide comic relief. Sam Johnson and Judith Lucy co-star. Overall, the film should be recommended to people who play petanque or have played, but there is enough material for a fun part if you have a slight understanding. If you like Australian humor, I suggest you bowling and going to the theater, because this is the first lawn bowling comedy of the year (also the only one).
