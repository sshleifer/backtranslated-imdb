I thought I was losing my precious 50 dollars to watch this movie. But at the sincere request of my friend Aparna Sen fan, I decided to participate in the film. Going to this cheap theater really bothered me, because I had seen King Kong for $ 50 in one of the best theaters in the city. Anywasy starts the movie and surprisingly I did not complain. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story and very beautiful actors in the role of Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma. Shabana Azmi is a divorced woman who has dedicated her life to the well-being of her mother and half-sister. Konkona Sen Sharma is a schizophrenic (spare me the spelling), who imagines all the time. Rahul Bose also gives a stellar performance. <br /> <br /> The story says that Mithi (Sen Sharma) is a schizophrenic and that after being brutally raped on her land, she really grew up, her fiancee leaving her for the person she became . In all his world falls on her. Shabana Azmi, her older half-sister, takes care of her and Mithi, in her imagination, thinks she has been married to her fiancée. She has 5 children and they stay at 15th Park Avenue (which is really a place in New York). The plot continues as Mithi becomes suicidal, thinking that no one believes her, and is held captive at home by her husband. As fate would have done, Mithi and her fiancée meet when they both go on a trip. 11 years after the brutal rape, her fiancée no longer exists in her real world, she can not recognize it. His fiancée, married with two children, feels it is his duty to repair the wrong he did 11 years ago and he promises to take him to Park Avenue. and he does. He takes her to a place in Calcutta that looks like her husband's house. Like Joydeep / Jojo (Rahul Bose), his fiancee speaks on the phone, he loses track of Mithi. Everyone comes looking for her but she can not be found. She finally gets what was denied her, to her family, to her own imaginative family in her own world at 15th Avenue du Parc. <br /> <br /> I must say that it touched my heart. I am a fan of Aparna Sen's management myself. The work of the camera is superb. And the quality of the performance is breathtaking. Konkona Sen Sharma gives a strong performance as a schizophrenic child. Shabana Azmi gives another amazing role as the divorced's older sister, responsible for keeping the family. Rahul Bose, another neat and discreet role (I do not know why this guy is not very lucky, he has so much potential). Finally, Aparna Sen still captivates the audience, even if she is neither in front of the camera nor behind her. <br /> <br /> A well deserved 8/10 ....
