In one way or another, this film has been buried in the heart of my heart. Do not ask me how it happened, but I guess the feature film Ed "I'll sponsor everything," McMahon, like a crack maniac, had a bit of a job to do. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was disappointed with Slaughter's first release in 1972. Nothing more than a quick shot to follow Shaft-mania. How does the next thing go? Big Jim Brown seems stronger as a Slaughter here than in the first. Maybe it's due to the fact that a year later, he had something to work on, instead of his simple motivation "Be like Shaft" before. <br /> <br /> The most notable part of the film is the soundtrack provided by pimp-dad number one, James Brown. Almost every scene is adorned with a touch of funk by the godfather. An excellent period film for music, wardrobe, vehicles, jargon and hair. I should also point out that this film is also an excellent period film to represent a time in the film's history where Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could actually COTE hair. <br /> <br /> Double the number of chicks, double the blow, triple the number of bodies, and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You'll be in a 70s action movie that will surpass its predecessor as well. For my money, Slaughter's Big Rip-Off can play with any Blaxploitation movie ever made. Even Shaft. Chances are you will disagree, but Slaughter's Big Rip-Off has its own distinct feel. Something was missing in the original.
