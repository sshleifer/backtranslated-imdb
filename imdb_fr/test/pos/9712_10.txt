The result is exactly what you expect. And it's good enough that anyone who wanted to watch this should leave him happy. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that will win an Academy Award. But what made the TV show Jackass and the original film a success is a step forward. It's funnier, more brutal and more disgusting than the original. And I loved every minute. <br /> <br /> The original had some notorious stunts, and there is at least one stuntman for whom we will remember this movie. You will grimace, grit your teeth, look away, and laugh very loudly. <br /> <br /> In any case, you probably do not need to read this review, or any other, to know if you will like this movie. unless you have never heard of Jackass.
