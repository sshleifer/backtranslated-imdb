In my opinion, the staging, editing, lighting and the game (less Franco) were very good. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by this film. I did not expect much, in terms of camera angles, sound, etc., but in these areas, the movie was not bad at all. <br /> <br /> After seeing the movie, I felt frustrated by both characters. because I wanted so much that these two characters are touching each other. And I felt like the character of Travis (Franco) was not really affected or changed in the end after Terri's suicide. Although this is probably due to the lack or inability of James Franco to express his emotions (of all kinds) in this film very well. I've seen some of Franco's other films, and for me, he just can not cope when a scene calls for real emotions or facial expressions. The only positive point he brings to the film is the possibility that more people watch this film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the performance of Terri by Rachel Miner was well done and she hopes to have a bright future. . I could really see and feel the sadness and emptiness in her character, and it made me feel for her. I only wish I could have more information about Terri's life before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> For a short film, this film was good, but it leaves you wanting more in the end. I just hope it could have been a little longer, to see the characters grow a bit more. Despite this, I hope to see more films from the director and the film crew in the future :)
