This is a great TV series, it's nice and for once realistic! the representation of lesbian women is delicately treated and well done. In addition to this, the staging is beautiful and the scenery sumptuous and rich, a real treat. If you missed the first, I advise you to watch the next few weeks, 9 pm, BBC 2
