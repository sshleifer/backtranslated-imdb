Sitting here, I laugh at certain moments of this film. Go see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you've been to a nightclub, check out this movie. <br /> <br /> If you've always wanted to go to a disco, check out this movie. <br /> <br /> My bet is that the film was born of an idea while it was going out in discotheque and it is the product of this chance on a million that someone remembers it the morning and had the application to follow. <br /> <br /> In summary, go see this movie. <br /> <br />
