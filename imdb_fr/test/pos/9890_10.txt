Checking Out will be released on Friday, September 15, 2006. The AMC theater chain will begin in New York. Times Square, 66th and 3rd Avenue, west of 84th Street. This film was one of the heart, for the heart. Mark Lane, Jon Karas, Richard Marcus, Jeff Hare, Dana Harrloe, Matt Jensen, Ed Abrams, Nick Pike, Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold, all players and the team knew from day one that this movie was something special. The need to comfort the elderly is expected, the closeness of the family is more apparent now than ever. I would recommend this movie to all ages and all races. This story rings the truth to anyone with or without family.
