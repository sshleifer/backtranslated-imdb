This movie was much better than I expected. After some movies of Will Smith that were not as great as me, Robot, he became nice and fun again in this one. Smith plays, Hitch, a date of love. Most of the films are centered around him and teach Albert how to be himself and have an appointment with Allegra Cole, a rich and famous celebrity with whom he works. Albert is a klutz and weak and always stumbles or what. All Hitch teaches him is to teach him more coolness and not be so nervous with Allegra. <br /> <br /> During all this, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip columnist who has knocked out men. The carriage charms it, so of course they come out. But, Hitch can teach other guys how to make the girl fall in love with them, he does not believe in love himself. He has never really had a girl since he was thrown to college. But, he loves Sara, so keep looking for her. Sara's friend is injured by a guy who she says has gone to the doctor. So Sara tracks down the doctor, only to learn his team. So of course, she thinks he's a pig. Then you have to explain to Sara and Allegra what he's doing, so they both end up forgiving. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Well, has some laughs and is fun. I recommand it.
