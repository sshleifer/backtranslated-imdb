I love that movie. At first, I did not expect much from this film because I did not hear anyone talk about it and it seemed that the film was recorded shortly after its opening in theaters. I did not think that David and Minnie would make a good couple on the screen. (I've been expecting a lot of couples on screen since I saw "You have got mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson should have played the role from Minnie and vice versa. I do not know, I just think Joely should have stayed longer in the movie with David. They seemed perfect for each other. But it's clear that in a movie, the girl next door always gets the guy. :) (as in "While you slept".) I was very wrong though. This movie was fantastic !!! Everything has been done brilliantly. Bonnie Hunt did a great staging job. The lines were perfect with cracks everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!! *** <br /> <br /> I like the way everything mixes with each other. For example, in the beginning, Elizabeth and Bob were talking about going to Italy and in the end Bob was meeting Grace in Italy. Sydney (the monkey) makes the hand with Grace as he did with Elizabeth is also an example. <br /> <br /> NOTICE ***: END OF SPOILERS !!! *** <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like in the movie was that it was a little unrealistic. Well, I do not think a man can defeat his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had ever been in all his life. You would think he would isolate himself from the world for years before even going out of his house to talk to someone. Instead, he goes blind a year later and instantly falls in love with a woman he has never seen in his life but with whom he feels connected. <br /> <br /> This film was on the whole a splendid film. It made me cry two or three times, and it made me laugh countless times (the scene at the restaurant with Bob's hard date for bottled water was hilarious!). He is really up to it with great romantic comedies such as "You Have a Mail", "Sliding Doors" and "While You Sleep". <br /> <br /> Go rent it today!
