eXistenZ combines the traditional love of director David Cronenberg with blood, blood and explosive heads with the most confused aspects of a David Lynch film. And it really works effectively. I will not bother trying to summarize here the synopsis of a plot because it would only create more confusion. All you need to know is that the movie is about a virtual reality computer game so incredibly realistic that it's hard to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. The film almost seems to give up its point of fear of technology in the end, but then it launches the last turn in the last line of dialogue. <br /> <br /> -ports' in the backs of the protagonists, as well as some very rude actors of Jude Law. It manages to sound naive, stupid and boring and any other boring habit you can think of. Jason Jennifer Leigh is doing a lot better, and everyone can be called a secondary character, including Willem Dafoe in a functional role, though not spectacular, as a crazy mechanic. Overall, eXistenZ is a very effective sci-fi film about the possibilities offered by technology and the possible consequences for it.
