There is not much to say about this film ... The plot is simple: two policemen (who are also lovers) use a brothel as a target to catch a criminal, with the help of the "Lady of the house ", played by the hardcore pornstar Chloe. As you might guess, there are some plot twists and fuzzy alliances, but the writing was awful, even for a softcore movie. <br /> <br /> I have already read some previous articles about Nicole Hilbig's accent (she plays the cop). Yes, it's hard to understand what she says sometimes, but I think I put it. I sniffed ... I think she comes from Germany, hence her strange accent. She impresses even without speaking, however ... she has a beautiful body. <br /> <br /> There were some "behind" sex scenes in this movie that were pretty graphic for a softcore movie. ... great job there. The scene at three towards the end was not bad either. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> I knew that the police officer was going to be a part-time call-girl at the end. She really enjoyed her trip to three. <br /> <br /> * END OF THE SPOILER * <br /> <br /> I will not worry too much about the story, since it is a small budget, direct softcore movie to the video. However, it seems that I have seen too many films of this genre with a similar scenario. <br /> <br /> Women: B (Chloe and Hilbig were good as good for nothing) Sex: B + (rather short scenes, but good) Story: C (a recycled plot, but all that works, huh ?) Overall: B-
