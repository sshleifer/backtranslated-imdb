I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it immensely. I thought it was one of the most captivating movies I had seen in a long time. One of the highlights of the film was to meet new faces and great actors behind them in beautiful places shot unexpectedly and brilliantly. The three heroes share a chemistry on the screen that runs through the film, making it so exciting. They are located in remarkable landscapes, spotted by an eye so original (the work of the DOP is just great), which gives you the impression to discover them for the first time. The atmosphere of the desert is omnipresent and even scenes filmed in the streets of Los Angeles or San Francisaco seem to be the natural extension. The story accompanies you gently in all these beautiful scenery to lead you to a sweet-bitter end, constituting the perfect culmination of this perfect trip. The construction of the film itself is a master job. The clever use of innovative resources (such as still images stitching Danny's memories in the film) will make it possible to compare these hand-made works, so rare and so enjoyable. Blind Spot manages to capture the essence of the desert and leads you to a common place where each of us can feel both discoverer and native.
