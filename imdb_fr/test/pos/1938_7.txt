"River's Edge" is one of the most troubling films of 1986. For a year, he also saw "Blue Velvet". You know it's saying something. Seen today, it has lost some of its power and remains much better than the overrated "Kids" The premieres of "Kids" have played as an expose of the deterioration of the country's youth. In reality, it was not much more than an exploitation film based mainly on the value of the shock. "River's Edge" was featured as a teenage exploitation movie, but it was actually a lot better. The only time it becomes disturbing is the constant image of the dead naked body. Apart from that, the film provokes reflection and, despite all its minor flaws, quite realistic. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves, known for being a particularly wood artist, gives her best performance as an exhausted teenager. Ione Skye is also friendly and friendly. Dennis Hopper (on the way back with this, "Blue Velvet" and "Hoosiers") gives an excellent performance as a remnant of the scary but pathetic hippie generation. Crispin Glover, while still fun to watch, seems a little out of place as a maniac stoner and group leader. The best performance is undoubtedly Daniel Roebuck. As murderer John, Roebuck is appallingly emotionless. It's a pity he did not become a bigger star, but a much better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> The film is overall fantastic and daring. Do not confuse this with another lame film nailed by John Hughes in high school such as "The Breakfast Club". It's a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this film are advised to watch a 1981 Canadian film titled "Out of the Blue," directed by Dennis Hopper. This is another shockingly shocking review of the generation gap and, despite its obscurity, it may have had an influence on "River's Edge". (7/10)
