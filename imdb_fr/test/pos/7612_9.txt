I really like this movie. It always makes me cry. If you like Drew Barrymore two times less than me, you'll love this movie. It contains everything I'm looking for in a movie. He has good actors, good characters, good humor ... a lot of comforting moments. Moments of flashback when we see Josie in high school make me cry anyway. Everytime. I'm sure you'll like this one, do not judge it because it looks like a teen movie, even if it's kind of like a teen movie. Of course, if you're a guy and you only watch hardcore special effects movies in the top 250 movies of all time, it's not for you. But if you like romantic comedies that you will not forget after seeing it, go get them in a video store and enjoy: Drew Barrymore is awesome in this one!
