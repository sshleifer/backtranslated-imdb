I lived in London most of my adult life before moving to the United States. This film was missed on its release and was only seen by HBO. I disagree with anyone who thinks it should have been a Hollywood production, the British team gave it a disheartening and disturbing atmosphere from the first day and I was on the edge of my seat for 30 minutes wondering what was going to arrive at my home. city. And of course, nine months after the release of the film, 7 days out of 7, this happens. Yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. Having lived in both countries, it is also clear that the likelihood of this happening in the UK is much greater than in the US, Muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the UK, while they assimilate much more easily.
