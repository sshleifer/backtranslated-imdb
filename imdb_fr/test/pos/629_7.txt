I liked playing in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me Janice about friends. I could never believe she was anything but odious. <br /> <br /> My main problems with the film were the anticlimatic end and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. The guy who falls from the exploding car? Maybe if his hand had been torn off and he had run to the mute, she kissed him and took him to the hospital, so maybe I could have tried the end. I think someone had to die in the execution scene. Mainly the brother-in-law. In any case, he was so painful. Or maybe the sister had to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute. I could even believe that the brother-in-law was killing the hero and that the two sisters were in snuff films. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at it again and, as I always say, it's much easier to be a critic instead of an author.
