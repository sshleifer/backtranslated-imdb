I'm not a filmmaker but I know it's hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into the character. The horses on Mars do it and more. When you watch a good movie, you do not want it to end. That's how I felt watching this movie. It is visually expansive and the microbe acquires human qualities such that you feel that you are traveling with it. <br /> <br /> We can not wait to see Mr. Anderson's exciting adventures in the future. Good game.
