Forget Donnie Darko. I start with that because it seems like a lot of the criticism I've read in The Box boils down to a simple but weak argument that it does not belong to Darko. It's not that I do not necessarily disagree with that, I just feel that this film is a totally different animal and deserves its own analysis. There are certainly points of comparison, but these are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each film is different. In Darko, the motor of the story is existential. In The Box, the driving force behind the story comes from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say that I understand the desire to compare the films of an innovative filmmaker by looking for trends and patterns, but for me, it is more important to approach each new film as an autonomous entity, then 'widen my gaze later. <br /> <br /> The Box is one of those films that arouses mixed feelings as it seems to be an identity crisis. It's not always sure what it wants to be. The twists are many, but easy to follow if not to predict. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a relatively credible couple of newlyweds struggling financially. A box containing a "button unit" comes to their door and they are informed by a horribly burned man that, if you press the button, you will cause the death of a person they do not know and that they will receive one million dollars. One of the things the box does is to bring up that unseen fear that our actions have some moral consequences somewhere. Before pressing the button, it has a disturbing and seductive quality, both seductive and sinister. Once this has been pushed, events are triggered that cause the two leaders to question their own morals and regret their fateful decision. <br /> <br /> The idea that the Box is an experience is interesting because it gives the film a paradox. If external beings develop a "coefficient of altruism" based on data collected by pushing couples and not on pimples, then, as the plot dissipates, we notice that it is ultimately altruism forced: be disinterested or the species would disappear. I suppose couples do not know the consequences of their actions when they have to make their decision, but they have no reason to think that The Box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when a problem of our life is presented to us? <br /> <br /> The psychological obstacles in this film are everywhere. Press the button or not, it is likely that someone is making fun of you. Take the money or not, no one gives anything for free. In search of the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your disappearance. <br /> <br /> I propose that The Box is an ironic job because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are locked in many metaphorical boxes. You can choose to be free only at the expense of another's life, is it freedom? No, it's just another box, because you are then trapped in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on earth and it is another box. It is precisely for this reason that the external beings of the film are finally antagonists. They demand that we conform to the moral standards that deprive us of our freedom. We managed to get to Mars, and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game. <br /> <br /> References to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point pretty well. "You can only enter the last free room, or not free." Of course, but whatever shape we enter the room, it's still a room. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemeth
