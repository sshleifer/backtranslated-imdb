I was lucky to see this sequel before the original because I'm not sure that I would have done everything I could to see it if the opposite had been true. I found "Mission Cleopatra" better than its predecessor for different reasons, but the main one is this: it was almost an adaptation to the word of a word of a book, not an amalgam like that of the first film. The physical resemblance of some characters with their animated personality was very funny, especially the villain (his name escapes me, but he is the other architect). I do not know how this movie was played in English. my mother tongue is French so I did not have this problem ... I guess some of the jokes were not easy to translate. I learned something with the years, it's better to watch a movie with subtitles than with dubbing. You may not understand what is being said, but you will not lose the pace and I think it's important too. I would recommend this movie to anyone who really likes "Asterix and Obelix".
