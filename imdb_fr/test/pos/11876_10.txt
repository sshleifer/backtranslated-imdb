Philip Larkin has brought to life a way worthy of the greatest performances of all time, not just those measured by popularity. He dramatically shows Larkins' life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his time - exactly what he wanted, such was his disdain for chancres and medallions. It dramatically exposes the raw beauty of the deep sadness of Philips' observations of our relationship with our own mortality, and the pose in a way that seems to have escaped even the greatest philosophers. for anyone who is interested in deep observations of our relationship with life, love and death, it is a must.
