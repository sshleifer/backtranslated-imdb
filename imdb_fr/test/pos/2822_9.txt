I am surprised by some reviews on this site because I really liked this movie. If you are looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. This is certainly not your typical foolish story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or another Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you really have to pay attention so that some people can be shocked. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on guard, it's a good choice. Warning to parents - there are fairly graphic sex scenes, so watch for them once the children are in bed. People who love Euro movies will love this one. The fans of Adam Sandler should ignore it because it will be above their heads and certainly NOT their style.
