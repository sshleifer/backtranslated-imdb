I just saw this movie and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds all your attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good movie, indeed, about the big and unconditional love. The character of Tom Wilkinson is a man who is not prepared for the test that is about to begin, but he takes the case as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the anguish and suffering of the character. The character of Emily Watson is very strong, she only has to take a quick look and you understand everything. I will not say more, because it is better to go down in history as it unfolds.
