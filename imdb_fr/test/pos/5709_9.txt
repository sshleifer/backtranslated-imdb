Four charming young nurses in their final year of nursing school experience all sorts of excitement and excitement in their lives: Sweet Susan (the beautiful brunette Elaine Giftos) tries to comfort Greg (a moving performance by Darrell Larson), terminally ill, but the neurotic Phred (the beautiful blond Karen Carlson) romance the beautiful gynecologist Jim Caspar (affable Lawrence Casey), the free spirit hippie Priscilla (the amazing gorgeous Barbara Leigh) is impregnated by the trafficker casual drug The (solid Richard Rust) and compassionate Lynn (well played by Brioni Farrell) helps the angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (the excellent Reni Santoni). Although this movie was shot for Roger Corman's legendary New World Pictures, it's all about your stupid soft-core schlock. Instead, it's a very pleasing, charming, and even often thought-out time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the early 70s groovy (the secondary plot involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is particularly powerful and provocative). The director, Stephanie Rothman, deserves special congratulations, which brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and a sensitivity to the material. In addition, the four attractive and attractive female leaders are all doing commendable and commendable work. Scottie MacGregor is also impressive as a savvy supervisor, Mrs. Boswell, and Ronald Gans, the type of trailer for the widespread 70s trailer, provides the voice of a psychiatrist. The refined cinematography of Stevan Larner, the fantastic soundtrack of rock and the folksy'n'funky score of Clancy B. Grass III are all at the rendezvous. A real sleeper.
