It seems that many Europeans and Americans see Indian films for the wrong reason; I see people complaining that this movie did not have a dance sequence! Different from their Hindi counterparts, Bengali movies tend to be more realistic. Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India. He is widely recognized for his choice of topics for film and the strength of his scripts. "Chokher Bali" is a perfect example. Faithful adaptation of Nobel laureate Tagore's novel, devoted to the search for the sexual pleasure of a Bengali widow, the director gives a new dimension to this highly acclaimed and controversial work.
