I'm a big fan of Gone With the Wind, and I read "Scarlett" before it was a miniserie and I love it. It's a sequel. As if you did not expect it with this ending "Frankly dear, I do not care". Timothy Dalton has been great as Rhett, although no one will ever replace Clark Gable. Joann Whaley-Kilmer, on his side, could give Vivien Leigh a chance to win his money (even if I feel almost guilty, even by saying that.) At the same time, that's what the portrait thinks most from Mrs. Leigh. The film is moving slowly, especially because it follows the book so closely and has not been broadcast as a feature film. Excellent choice from the producer. I think this film deserves some recognition for the great story, the revival of characters missing for almost 50 years and for something that even Margaret Mitchell could have been proud of.
