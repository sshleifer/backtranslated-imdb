Barbet Schroeder's "Murder by Numbers" starring Sandra Bullock is hard work, but not particularly convincing. I am a big fan of Sandra Bullock, and she is effective here as a forensic detective Cassie Mayweather, who is not very friendly and who is also broken. However, there is a sense of detachment inherent in the structure of the story. This is the perfect murder committed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers, Richard (Ryan Gusling), the awesome, and Justin (Michael Pitt), the friendly geek. Basically, Richard and Justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do on school evenings. They are very intelligent and very arrogant, which is not normally a bad thing, but it just does not work here. Tony Gayton's scenario does a great job detailing the investigation into a confusing murder, and it's really in numbers. We have these two punk kids showing their superiority, and we just want them to fall. <br /> <br /> This is not a great exploration of the dark side, like Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune" on Claus von Bulow. There are interesting turning points in "Numbers". The film is not really a thriller, but rather a study of Cassie's character. Sandra Bullock takes stock of Cassie's bravado, her fear of letting people join her and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. His partner and his kind of love interest, Sam (played by Ben Chaplin), is more of a plot than any of the real characters. Although Chaplin is stunning very beautifully. The other plus is that Richard and Justin had a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about "Numbers" are Pitt and Gusling. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of twists and turns throughout the movie. Everything is done with great skill. I saw the film about a week ago and, in retrospect, I like it a little more than when I saw it. However, it's just not an inspired job. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve a lot better, and so do we.
