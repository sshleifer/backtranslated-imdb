Here is a well-done, well-filmed and well-executed war story. The representation of the Italian and German occupation of the Greek island of Cephalonia is well done. John Hurt as father and doctor of the island is superb, Nicolas Cage does a good job as captain of the title, Penelope Cruz does a good job being beautiful and fluttering in front of Cage. There are heroes and humor, there is drama and romance, and everything takes place on an idyllic island. <br /> <br /> Curiously, a scenario very similar, or should I say almost identical, with the same characters The same series of events, is told in a novel of the same title, written by Louis de Bernières. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of the beautiful Pelagia, daughter of Dr. Iannis, and their life in Kefalonia during the Second World War. Pelagia's fiancée, local fisherman Mandras, enlisted when the Italian army invaded northern Greece from Albania on false pretenses. When the Axis finally won, with the help of the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers was stationed on the island and Captain Corelli played an important role in keeping the occupation calm. While Mandras joins the partisans, the charming Corelli and his mandolin are lodged with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes it a novel about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a narrative of the communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of Mussolini's madness and, above all, an ode to island life in Kefalonia. <br /> <br /> Some of these elements come back in the film, but in general, it's an impossible book to film. I'm glad no one has ever tried. <br /> <br /> However, the movie "Captain Corelli's Mandolin" is worth the detour. Just be sure to read the book * after * seeing the movie.
