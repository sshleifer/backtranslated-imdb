Alexander Nevsky (1938) is a brilliant cinematographic propaganda. The Russian people are threatened by two major enemies, the Mongols and the Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. In order to unite the rival and rival princes of the Russian kingdom, Nevsky takes charge of and fights the least of two evils (the Teutons). This influential film has been copied many times and is still valid. The soundtrack of composer Prokiev and the direction of Eisentstein are a sight to see and hear Several years later, John Milius used many scenes of films, sets and costumes of this film and integrated them in Conan. of my favorite lines of Conan was taken from this movie. "It's not the strength of the iron in a weapon, but the strength of the person who uses it is what matters." Comparisons are undeniable. The armor of James Earl Jones and the leader of the Teutonic Knights are virtually identical. A real tribute from one director to another. <br /> <br /> I give Alexander Nevsky one of my highest recommendations. The film plays as the final act of Richard III. The presence of Prince Alexander on the screen is really incredible.
