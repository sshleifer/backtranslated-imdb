I discovered this film accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas classic, it is also one of the beautiful comedies of the 40s. The story is simple: Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) earns her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas, his boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), asks him to invite a weak young sailor to the Connecticut farm she is talking about. The only problem is: she does not have a farm and she does not know how to cook. To get out of the jam, Elizabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner, who has a farm) and flies to Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix. <br /> <br /> Peter Godfrey has done a wise staging and the cast is really wonderful: Stanwyck has never been better than this woman at once spiritual and romantic. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall create hilarious and human characters. The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan. It starts well but as the film progresses, it becomes really boring. It's almost hard for Elisabeht Lane to be with him instead of Gary Cooper or David Niven, both of whom would have been more appropriate for the role. Anyway, it's a happy Christmas movie with a refreshing score and I recommend it to anyone who loves a fun and enjoyable vacation ... in Connecticut.
