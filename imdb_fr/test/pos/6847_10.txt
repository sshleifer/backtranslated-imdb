I found the movie Judas Kiss excellent. Carla Gugino's performance was extraordinary, probably the best of her career. His facial expressions were incredibly faithful to the character in many scenes and they were exploited at best by the director Gutierrez. All actors and actresses were very good in their performances. Emma Thompsom was, as usual, wonderful. Her acting abilities are well above what would be required for this character. She really improves it in the movie. <br /> <br /> The story, while sometimes too complex, remains entertaining and pointed towards the end. Very very good. A film not to be missed. A story well woven and brilliantly achieved. Quality of the film, excellent.
