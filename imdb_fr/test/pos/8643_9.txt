Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, "Mulholland Dr." was rejected. The following year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes so that the film could be screened in theaters. He did it - and created one of the biggest, most bizarre and nightmarish movies ever made. <br /> <br /> The film does not really have any main characters, but if there were any main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a happy blonde who stays in her aunt's apartment while she audition roles in movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita has lost her memory. She has no idea who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from a poster "Gilda" in the bathroom. The two men decided to find out who Rita really was. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is known for producing strange movies, but this film is the definition of what is strange. It's weird, nightmarish and indescribable. It's like a dream captured in a movie. After 100 minutes, the movie became extremely confusing - but if you watched carefully, it would be perfectly logical. After watching the movie and reading an article on the internet highlighting elements of the film, I now fully understand the film. <br /> <br /> The acting game is very good. Watts is awesome. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood filmmaker facing problems with the local crowd. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of his best scores. And the staging - ah! David Lynch is a filmmaker as talented as ever. <br /> <br /> Is this your type of film? Well, it depends. You should probably see more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You will have to be patient with the movie and probably watch it a second time to discover the many clues that Lynch has left throughout the film. For Lynch fans, it's a dream come true. <br /> <br /> "Dr. Mulholland" is a masterpiece. It's brilliant, enigmatic and masterfully filmed. I like that.
