My mother always told me to sit down and watch this movie because it's one of her favorite movies. I've never done it for years, until I spend an evening on television. This movie was great, I do not even know how to explain it. Not only is the cast excellent (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt), but the story is amazing. It's weird but not too scary and it makes you think. I was speechless after this film and amazed at how much the five actors are really good actors and actresses. Where did William Baldwin go, he's great. This film is a must for everyone, if you have not seen rent it, you will not regret it. Unbelievable!
