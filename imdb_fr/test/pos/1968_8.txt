A fantastic sci-fi and horror thriller about a famous video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), whose latest game - "eXistenZ" attracts not only the attention of those who have volunteered for try, but almost kill her (and her game too). Since she is forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), marketing trainee ("PR nerd") to be his bodyguard, even if he only has 'a flesh-and-blood firearm, and bullets are teeth. Director David Cronenberg has used excerpts from his previous films ("Videodrome", "Scanners", "The Fly", etc.) and placed it in some parts of the story with good timing. Law and Leigh are doing well here, as are some actors (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, etc.) who have an international twist. Dafoe is anything but diabolical like Gas, a deceptive garage mechanic. One of the best scenes in the film is where Ted eats (fish and frogs), builds a rifle and confesses to Allegra - "I can not help it." "eXistenZ" manages to show that he (Cronenberg) lives up to his old tricks and still works like a charm.
