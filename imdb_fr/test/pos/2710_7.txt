One of the best biopics for television, I just wish we'd heard more. I read many biographies and saw other things about carpenters, and this film did everything possible, depending on the constraints imposed by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a great job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was no more insight into Karen's anorexia. In my reading of the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention), anorexia seems to be a control disease. Karen saw her weight as something in her life that she could control. She felt she was controlled in every other aspect of her life. Do not get me wrong, I thought she really liked the music, but she felt she had little control over her career. She really loved her family, but she expressed it badly and she did not know how to make it understand to her family. The film could have touched a lot more on this subject. I cherish the music I have as carpenters and want her to be alive to contribute more to music today.
