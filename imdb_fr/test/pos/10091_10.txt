I must say that I am a horror film enthusiast and that I can not get enough of the foreign horror. Since American horror really depends too much on gore. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic. This film reminded me a lot of Mr. Night's SIXTH SENSE. The way the film was made was great. The director took his time to put everything in place. It took about 40 minutes to place the film in a horror movie. I thought the movie was just a drama. This film is just beginning and the return on investment is not excessive. <br /> <br /> I've never done this before, but that's the main reason I liked the movie .... I actually screamed out loud because a scene really surprised me ... which is a bit pathetic ... but for a movie, it's great.
