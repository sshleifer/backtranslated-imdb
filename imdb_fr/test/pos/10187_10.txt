It's not a film, but an experience! <br /> <br /> It's not what I thought was a candy to the usual eye. Too many things happen at the same time, your senses can hardly cope with it. A product of advanced technology (we were divided between the pleasure of watching the show and the wearing of our 3D glasses to decipher the magic), the music is excellent (it's a concert!), The Disney characters are there ( and you're part of their world), it's funny, it's magical, it's exciting - I know it's starting to look like an advertisement - but it's really great! Beats Christmas bringing out the child in you! <br /> <br /> This attraction alone is already making the trip to Disney worth it. ;)
