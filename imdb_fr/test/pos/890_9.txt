With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters, the S department will remain forever associated with Jason King of Peter Wyngarde. <br /> <br /> Most people remember him as this camp, flamboyant and debonair Austin Powers month but it would hurt the character: it is much more nuanced than that. <br /> <br /> Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stewart fight all the bad guys and gives only tokens at the end)), he's selfish (his appreciation of people is based on the fact that they have read his novels or not), much of his work as a detective is a speculation that is not supported by facts that corroborate him and he sulks whenever Annabelle is right ... and she is often. It's clear he's a midlife man and drinks, but ... Jason King is brilliant. If Wyngarde had only played him as a dashing hero, it would not have worked, but he often portrays King as a paper tiger, guided by his libido, his love of luxury and his predisposition to defeat (and that night at his detective work sometimes) but he has some of the best lines and poses in the history of television. And by not playing it whiter than white, the chemistry and interactions between the three main characters are all the better. <br /> <br /> By watching it again on DVD recently, you can see how deep Wyngarde put in Jason King.
