Liv Tayler in his sexiest movie! <br /> <br /> She amazingly embodies the role of "femme fatale", while managing to appear as a super sexy woman while maintaining the "sweet girl" without being too naughty like other similar films (by example "Femme Fatale" with Rebecca Romijn) <br /> <br /> Until this film, Lord of the Rings was the only movie I had ever seen (I'm addicted to LotR) <br /> <br /> Point: By LoTR, I thought the role of the sweet-gentle woman was the only role that Liv Tayler could interpret, but when I saw "One night at Mc Cool", I absolutely changed my mind . She is the sexiest woman in the world! <br /> <br /> That's why a movie is a mediocre average comedy with a "confusing" plot
