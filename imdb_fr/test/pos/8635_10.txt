I liked this movie since I was little. I remember the night my mother brought this film home. I loved it and I still do it. I think it's very funny and original. There are also very catchy tunes in this movie. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. The actors representing Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are doing well, but Abbott and Costello are the best. The former boxing sensation of heavyweight Buddy Baer, ​​also brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer, ​​is good in this film as the policeman and the giant. He's a better actor than the boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this film is hilarious. Lou Costello keeps getting the car down and in trouble with Buddy Baer. The slapstick in the house is good too. I particularly like comedy in the castle of the giants. My favorite parts are; the part where Lou climbs on the magic bean and they all sing like a farewell. Jack tells them he'll come back. Lou Costello knows how to sing very well. My other favorite part is where Jack is fighting with the giant. I love when Jack blows eggs and when he tries to make an omelette giant, they continue to explode. Abbott and Costello are hilarious and are the greatest comedians of all time. This is just one of their great movies that I will love and cherish. The critics for this film are not very good and I do not understand why. It's a very good movie from Abbott and Costello. I also like the way Lou Costello comes back to reality and thinks he's back in the dream when Bud hits him. He begins to sing his song and leaves with such an attitude that no one will push me. Very good movie.
