This film that I have seen many times. I read the book Englar Alheimsins, written by Einar Már Guðmundsson, winner of the Scandinavian Book Prize. The film does not begin in the same place as the book. This is happening in Reykjavík and in the main character, Páll is young and leads a good life with his girlfriend. But as she breaks with him, he begins to have headaches that make him angry and angry. And soon, he begins to have big mental problems and the movie begins. Soon, he is placed at the Icelandic psychiatric hospital called "Kleppur" and you can see great characters like Viktor who thinks Hitler and Óli who thinks to write all the songs of the "Beatles" and send them with spirit. transport Ingvar E Sigurðusson, who plays the role of the main character Páll performs, works so well that you are out of breath. Moreover, SIGURRÓS is crazy about music in this movie and you should see the movie just for the cost of the music. Overall, a good movie was meant to be seen.
