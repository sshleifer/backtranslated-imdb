Although this film looks like a Black Thriller Crime, the plot is actually a little simplistic and has very few surprise twists - and those that appear are not really shocking. <br /> <br /> However, if you go out of the "intense action thriller" mode to get into "crazy entertainment," then it's really a fun movie, with many hilarious moments. Most of them can be attributed to the spiritual dialogue between Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's characters - that being said, Sadie said everything in her hilarious hello to Friedman, and there was very little left to develop between these two characters. I could not find this esteemed version of British actors with southern accents (Ok, Thompson sounded like she was rolling logs in her mouth as she tried to speak south, but Rickman was surprisingly pretty good with very few minor failings to his usual English accent) - if you want to criticize the accents - let's discuss that of Coco - she spoke only periodically to the south! <br /> <br />
