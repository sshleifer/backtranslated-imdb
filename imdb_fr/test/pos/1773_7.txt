It is one of the son of the time of his time, which has the additional distinction (although not unique) of a smoker in its center. At first, the two leaders - Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan - may seem wrong, but they grow well in their roles later, no doubt thanks to the talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. Marshall's velvety voice is unconventionally presented as the obligatory philosophical phlegm of the ship, and Gomez is larger than life like the Blackbeard Pirate. <br /> <br /> The distribution is completed by Debra Paget as Jourdan's wife, who incurs the jealous rage of the missed main character of daydan in which Jourdan instils the first pains of love (which, however, does not spare him not occasional flogging or sword injury); This film was also the second exotic team of Jourdan and Paget in one year, after BIRD OF PARADISE Delmer Daves. The direct result of this unexpected softening of Anne's character is her quarrel with the Blackbeard crew and her unforeseen climatic sacrifice to save the lives of Jourdan, Paget and Marshall, who are stranded. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly remarkable example of this type, the energetic direction of Jacques Tourneur and the great score of Franz Waxman guarantee an effort above the average which is advancing at a steady pace; by the way, Turner had already served in the genre with Burt Lancaster's superior vehicle, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW (1950). As usual with Technicolor vintage productions, cinematography gives the film an invigorating sumptuousness. By the way, the times of this film are different (81 or 87 minutes) and, for the record, the version I watched was the shortest.
