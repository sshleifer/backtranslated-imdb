I use "Princess Raccoon" (to give the film its English title not precise enough) as a litmus test for the sense of humor of my friends. It leaves them cold and confused - as many other commentators have clearly done on this site - either with a double laugh, incredibly huge smiles and occasional hiccups of admiration. <br /> <br /> The laugh comes from the film mixture consumed parodies in a contemporary style. The targets include a cluster of Japanese and Western classical dramatic forms, ranging from Kabuki to the Christian fantasy of the Shakespearian and Late Spanish Renaissance; the stupid emptiness of American and modern European music, as evidenced by a host of random songs of tap and rap and very funny and mundane lyrics, all choreographed with an adorable "amateur" clich√©; Japanese anime and live action snaps of samurai; prodigious Buddhist ritual; and the irresistible sweetness of the Vienna operetta. I have not really laughed at this type of movie since the scandalous musical deconstruction of Ken Russell in "The Boyfriend". <br /> <br /> The smiles come from the intelligent textual subversion of the Japanese legend, told in a traditional 5-act structure reminiscent of the pieces of the 17th-century master Chikamatsu. As in his work, the narrative is advanced in a mixture of songs, recitatives, light poems and comic bas-reliefs - here is the mumbling of the incompetent ninja, Ostrich, by peasants under the illusion that he is a raccoon human appearance. All this is somewhat united, and more remarkable still, it arouses the emotions of the observer through many cultural references. <br /> <br /> In truth, "Princess Raccoon" wears her multicultural costume with seductive lightness, and this is where the shrugs of astonishment come in. Visually - again, as for the chef- - The film is a feast, a riot of color with its digitized backgrounds of classic Japanese images from screens and prints, extravagant costumes and set scenes, mixed with action sequences breathtaking in fields and summer shores. You will love it or hate it, but there is no point in making chalk to be a cheese; and "Princess Raccoon" is above all a naughty and affectionate attitude of our contemporary cultural emptiness, both in East and West. Bravo!
