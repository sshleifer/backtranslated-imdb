<br /> <br /> `<br /> <br /> 5 years ago, if you watched an Australian movie, you would expect to see crocodile hunters, war stories, drag-queens, kangaroos and koalas and Australians In general, the Australian film has evolved over the past two years and today is emerging as a classic loser. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Australian film has evolved over the past two years. classics such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People. <br /> <br /> In this evolution of the film, we also find Two Hands. <br /> <br /> Located in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the city's underprivileged neighborhood. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is a Sydney Mob boss. He is the king of organized crime, dressed in thongs, carrying a tiny man and helping his son with his origami. He is vicious, but real. Like his "crowd", holding the gun against someone's head in one scene and then playing board games in the next. They are well respected and if they ask you for a favor, you do not say no. <br /> <br /> Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Australian guy in his early twenties. He's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself, so when Pando asks Jimmy to give him $ 10,000, Jimmy agrees. <br /> <br /> Things start to get exciting when two teenagers manage to steal the money while Jimmy is at the beach. So now, Jimmy earns $ 10,000 from a big mafia boss. From there, we start seeing all the stories that interconnect with Jimmy and his bank robbery attempt to get the money back, Jimmy and Alex (love, played by Rose Byrne), Pando trying to find Jimmy and, of course, both teenagers and their newfound prosperity. The narrator, Michael, the deceased brother of Jimmy, who was killed by Pando and his gang years ago, deepened this concept. <br /> <br /> In the end, all the scenarios are really linked, with a surprise that surprises and shocks. the audience. I really appreciated. <br /> <br />
