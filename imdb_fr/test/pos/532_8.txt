I'm sorry, but "Star Wars Episode 1" did not do justice to Natalie Portman's talent (and undeniable kindness). She was completely underutilized as Queen Amidala and when she used it, her makeup was appallingly terrible. For "Anywhere But Here", she wears her makeup as a god and acts normally. And not only can she do well, but she looks good at doing it. I am a little older than she (she is only 18 years old) and I have little or no chance to meet her, but hey, a guy is allowed to dream, right? <br /> <br /> Even though Susan Sarandon does it well in this movie, the movie belongs entirely to Portman. I watch Portman from "Beautiful Girls" (she was younger but just as cute). There are great things for her in the future - I can see it.
