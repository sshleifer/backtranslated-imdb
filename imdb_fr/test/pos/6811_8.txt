The first in a new style of movies for Lamas - no tattoos, motorbikes or karate. For my part, I miss them. But it's a serious movie. He plays an FBI profiler who has been living so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. Gary Busey is either a great actor or a person I would not want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street. Kristen Cloke pursues Lamas as stubbornly as the serial killer. There is one surprise after another as the story unfolds, the end of which is not the least. It never seems to happen - there is always an extra layer in the story. Cloke and Lamas begin as the good ones, turn into villains and end up becoming heroes. But this is definitely worth the price of the rental. For maximum enjoyment, throw a candy, a bag of popcorn and a soft drink. You go to the cinema!
