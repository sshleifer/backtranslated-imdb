I have nothing but praise for this mini series. He's only a year and a half old, but I've seen him twice. with more pleasure the second time than the first. I seriously think of seeing him again soon because I find him spiritually uplifting. <br /> <br /> This is a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful shows, sets, costumes, music and scenes that has a resonance among the mini-series. <br /> <br /> Others commented on the difficulties of lesbian life in Britain in the 1890s. Nothing particularly difficult about this; It was only male homosexuality that was against the law, as poor Oscar Wilde had experienced, at his expense, and as a great loss to the literary world. Anyway, I move away from the subject. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is an essential television. It is perhaps one of the greatest tragic and romantic romantic dramas since Romeo and Juliet, but not in the classic sense of the word. <br /> <br /> At 10 out of 10 from me. <br /> <br /> VMY
