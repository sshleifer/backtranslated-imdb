I remember reading the original story of Balzac in French at the university. <br /> <br /> I remember Ken Nordine from WGN-TV in Chicago who read it as one of his late night shows. <br /> <br /> He has always loved history, but never believe they could or would make a film. To my surprise, they did it and did it VERY well. <br /> <br /> There are few Balzac stories that lend themselves to dramatization, which is unfortunate. a lot of Hollywood sexing up. It's as close to perfect conversion as it could be. <br /> <br /> The theater of the mind is always better than the eye can see, but it's as close as I think, it can come to let the imagination to read meet the reality to see.
