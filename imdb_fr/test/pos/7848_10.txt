Suppose for a moment that you have not experienced the psychotropic mushroom and that you are wondering about the alleged bad experience and how such a situation could play itself ?? Go ahead and insert a new copy of The Beguiled. You see, with the movie, you have your own travels (Solaris and all that is directed by Andrei Tarkovsky), your whack, that is to say the experience you never get back (Sweet Movie and El Topo) , and you're a bad organic producer trips, a category specifically reserved for a movie like The Beguiled, which is the kind of content that these Times passionate writers have made all the right decisions of their lives and have graduated from the Department of Harvard English, termed "hallucinogenic tone". In the third act of this film directed by Don Siegel, you can not observe exactly that your two heavy lead hands have narrowed and become all the characteristics of a burrowing insectivore mammal, and you will not fall under the suspicion that your column vertebral reached. the same sinuous shape and the knotty texture of a pom√© fruit revealing an incalculable age, but you will feel something. <br /> <br /> In 1970, when this film was shot, most Americans were looking for an innocence for their collective Pain, a movie like The Graduate perhaps, there was a lot of world endism and, of course, you had the nightmare of the war in Vietnam. What you get with The Beguiled, a banal metaphor for drugs, is a scenario from a guy's novel that, at least for the moment, wanted to be known as Grimes Grice, and the direction of the director who contributed to do the job and career of Sam Peckinpah. In The Beguiled, Donny Siegel, born in 12, Chicago, IL, less than 45 years after The Great Fire attempted to tackle all the contemporary cultural madness of the early 1970s in the form of a movie artifact classic. The Beguiled is an incredible film and an outstanding contribution to the cinematographic arts in almost every field: filming, editing, directing and storytelling are fantastic and you probably will not see it. Without a doubt, a sinister film, its effects, as I said, both dizzying and adulterous; frankly, it's hard to believe that Universal has ever given its name to this photo, but you'll see some of the camera's gentle, pleasurable movements, and the director of photography, Bruce Surtees, exploiting every black myth that you have in mind about the American Plantation South, mixing beauty and evil in all places. Needless to say, Clint Eastwood has never been that way. Old Clint, he instantly moves from livery to coy, his eyes resembling two Archimedean spirals in close-up. The rest of the cast is just as demanding and strange. <br /> <br /> This will never make the AFI 100 in my lifetime, but that does not stop me from claiming it's one of the best synchronized American sound movies. never done. While most people catalog it as a western, to include the people of The Western Channel, The Beguiled is a problem because you do not really know what it is: a kind of war movie? A drama? Psychological thriller? Maybe the answer to all those emotionally worked Black movies with Kirk Douglas? In fact, I call this piece a horror movie because, when my old man, who likes to relax with gratuitous and cheap violence projected into entertainment like The Wire, saw Geraldine's medium-high angle shot A page wrapping a tourniquet around Clint's bloody leg, Papa quickly suggested looking at something else, like the Outback Bowl, just before he fled to another room. My advice: look at this one and make sure it's on a very large screen, preferably on the DPL home theater projector you're considering. I would put The Beguiled in order with this important purchase, lay down overhead, throw some cinematic light on the big white wall and try not to lose your grip because, like Norman Bates, "we're all going crazy sometimes, "even seduces him.
