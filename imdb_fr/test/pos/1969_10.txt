It's a movie that I discovered by accident. I was flipping through and saw that there was Showtime, so I watched it. Now, I watch it at least once a month. This is a movie that is filled with symbols that could lead some people to throw it away. Do not listen to people who hate this movie. If they want an action movie with expensive f / x, they should have rented a movie that promises them. If you want a good science fiction, I highly recommend it. If you buy on DVD, I recommend the Alliance Atlantic edition of the movie, which contains many more extras than the edition of Dimension Films.
