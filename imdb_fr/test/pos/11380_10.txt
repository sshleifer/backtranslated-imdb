It's an absolutely brilliant stroke of genius by Paul Thomas Anderson, writer / director of this film. It really examines the pros and cons of the world of pornography and its consequences for your actions. You live in a world literally fueled by sex, drugs and rock n 'roll. Only the most beautiful actors brought together with Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle and Philip Baker Hall
