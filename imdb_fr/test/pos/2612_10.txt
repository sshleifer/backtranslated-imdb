Assy McGee is a show you really need to have a certain age to enjoy. Otherwise, you'll probably miss references to 80s cop movies and you'll just think it's a gag for a running rectum. You think it's infantile and brainless humor? Go watch the movie Stallone 'Cobra' and you'll see what I mean. This show actually has a very subtle humor, which speaks volumes, both for a show broadcast on adult swimming and for a show on a walking donkey. <br /> <br /> All standard shots are in place Movies like Dirt Harry and Cobra are so good and ripe for parody. Sanchez is Assy's partner, who is - by gender - weighted and constantly apologizes for the homicidal behavior of his partner. The chief of police is, of course, a hard-to-breathe case who lives to shout, "I want your badge on my desk tomorrow morning!" The exaggerated and sometimes completely absurd way of parodying the film "Renegade Cop" of the 80s is well suited to the subject treated. For example, by breaking a bus flight, one of the criminals stops to ask Assy: "Hey, where are you going, asshole !?" What the character of the title cuts the film: "I'll ... shoot you." <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for anyone who loves action movies from the 80s and has already seen enough to understand humor.
