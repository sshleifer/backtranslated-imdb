George Hilton never really took me like Franco Nero or Clint Eastwood, but it's a great outing for him. Essentially, give Django / man With No Name and do a great job. The opening sequence of this jewel is a classic, and the following mouse games are a pleasure to watch. Fans of the genre will be in paradise.
