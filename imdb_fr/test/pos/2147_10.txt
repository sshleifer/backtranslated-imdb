I saw Heaven's Gate during its opening week almost twenty years ago. The tickets were sold in advance because Cimino had long been waiting for his 1978 masterpiece, "The Deerhunter". Critics have arrived and critics have violated the film vehemently. An influential film critic from New York led the way and most critics followed, and the 3h. 40 min. the film was shot from the cast. United Artists asked Cimino to shorten the film by about an hour and it was republished several months later to equally horrendous criticism and a dismal undertaking. The film then cost about $ 40 million (now considered a small budget), making it one of the most expensive in history. Cimino has had the opportunity to repeat the project many times, although it is a third film. "The Deerhunter" had also received a negative reaction based on a perceived political ideology, which was not popular. I mention all this to present a possible bias against Cimino. At the time, I thought the film was very good and when I saw the short version, it was still very good but less. The film returned to a museum in the early 1990s. They were supposed to show the long version but they could not find an existing impression. Nevertheless, seeing the movie years later, I now thought Heaven's Gate was a masterpiece. Finally, the long version began to appear in a few selected cities. I saw her recently and it was worth the wait. Heaven's Gate begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we present some of the flaws of their characters from the beginning. Despite Joseph Cotton's mandate in his speech to graduates to use their education to enlighten and improve their country, many graduates behave as if they were part of an elite national club. The film is 20 years old in Johnson County, Wyoming. A livestock company called the "Stockholders Association" hired poor people to slaughter 125 poor immigrants claiming they are cattle thieves. Kristofferson is with the immigrants while John Hurt is part of the Association. Although Hurt is totally against this senseless action, he is a character too inefficient to do anything about it. A massacre takes place but the immigrants manage to defend themselves well. An American cavalry comes to the rescue of the association to stop it after most of the damage was done when it actually sanctioned the massacre. Kristofferson also suffers a great personal loss and the film ends with him years later in the elite of his life at Harvard. Married, bored, on a yacht, alive but dead inside. <br /> <br /> A very complex film that shines in all areas: themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, scenography and interpretation. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston and Cotton are all excellent, very complex characters. Some of the main complaints I've read about this film say it's ugly to watch, inconsistent, too long, that the characters have no meaning and that the words are often incomprehensible. In his defense, Heaven's Gate looks like photographs of this period, just like "McCabe & Mrs. Miller". Some scenes are smoky, suggesting the industrial revolution, or sometimes horses, carts, people on all sides create a sense of reality (the critic who called this film uglier has always liked to use his thumbs a lot.) But despite everything, the composition of each frame and the cinematography are impeccable. The film makes a lot of sense if you pay attention. Everything is not specified for the viewer and we must observe closely to understand the motivations of the characters or their themes. As for its length, it is a wonderfully structured piece, sometimes moving, poetic, exhilarating or devastating, with practically a large scene that succeeds one another. Sometimes, some words are incomprehensible, especially in some very animated scenes. But one could understand such a cinematographic film through its use of the cinematographic language, the looks between the characters or their actions. Soon, this film should be republished in its entirety so that critics and critics can give it a second chance. Do not let Michael Cimino become another Orson Welles - appreciated in his lifetime and unable to make the kind of great movies he is able to do.
