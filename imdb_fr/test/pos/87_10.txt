I have had the privilege of seeing this film on television for years. I only wish I could contact someone to see him again. I married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome. I did not realize it, but seeing this film allowed me to better understand their problems and to understand how I could love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My son-in-law is now 35 years old and, thanks to the Lord, he has blossomed wonderfully, but he still has many after the birth of an alcoholic mother. We talk to alcohol and drug addiction patients every month, and this sharing has dramatically changed their behavior and is trying to start a new life that is not addicted to drugs and alcohol. Please, let me know how I can get a VHS or DVD copy of this movie or when they will watch the movie again on TV. If you have not been in these shoes, you will probably never be able to understand its value. Thank you so much.
