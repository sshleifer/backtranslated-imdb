As a former submarine officer (nuclear), I must admit that it is my favorite underwater film (even if it exceeds Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about the submarines when they wrote the movie. OK - not realistic - but it's a comedy - and contains all the "jokes from within" the submarine force. A superb cast with submarine stereotypes stuck on "Orlando" and our heroes on the diesel boat. Certainly "DBF" about = that means forever the diesel boats. But they want ten lines to be able to post this - jees, is the Admiral in charge here? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
