I can understand why others reacted in a rather unpleasant way to the climax causing a difficult turn to be taken seriously. I think, however, that the preparation works pretty well. The music, quite menacing and stinging, really gives a spooky aura that corresponds to the ruthless sound of a phone that rings constantly and animates the English actress in difficulty, Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh). She borrows a nice apartment from a buddy trying to revive his career in New York (the buildings in front of the window are as realistic as that of David Letterman) and is greeted without ceremony by a loud phone that rings a little, followed by loud slams against the wall. In search of answers about the person responsible for this contempt for her mental health, Joan discovers that no one rents this room and that a former tenant has strangled. Without the help of the person in charge, Joan will decide to discover for herself who causes her such anguish. Joan discovers the empty room and the phone with a particular female voice that will haunt her. <br /> <br /> The episode, I think, is a tour de force for Jean Marsh, which is a women's show. She is the only visible actress and we follow her in the crisis that erodes slowly, the phone and the blows of this room causing him great distress that degenerates into fear. Instead of leaving, Joan remains, so shaken by the noise and the breaking point where she only wants the phone (or anyone who rings) to stop. The episode provides a possible answer to who plagues Joan and why. A character named Beth arrives quite late in the story, as Joan strives to find the female voice that knew her name on this dreaded phone she discovers in the room opposite her. Beth's fate may well explain to the viewer why Joan is traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in phantasmagoria rather than credibility: some did not particularly like it, but I certainly loved it. I'll admit that the phone, as a "creepy" physical threat to Joan, is hard to take seriously, let alone attack, but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes before that break was cold enough to compensate.
