I usually do not like watching movies while they're still in the room because of the high ticket prices, but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and thought, "This young actress has look smart and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper. So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie at the opening night. <br /> <br /> I must tell you that I was pleasantly surprised. I went to this film without expectations. I did not really know what it was, but Katie Boland's raw emotions and sincere adolescent experiences left me rather satisfied with my decision. Alberta Watson has also done a fantastic job as a mother affected by Tamara's disease and I must also add that the comical style of Megan Park, as a friend of Tamara, impressed me a lot. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully directed by Gail Harvey and was collected in the kitsch style of the 50s that leaves you warm and happy, even though the story tends to not be so uplifting. I also thought that the film was well shot, many beautiful images of a campaign of the 50s will remain etched in my memory for weeks. <br /> <br /> This film as a whole was original and awesome. I found this unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open way, I was always satisfied. Whether you're looking for a fun and powerful young age story, or just want to remember the life of the 1950s, I guarantee you this movie is for you. Even if you have no expectations, it is likely that you will be most impressed. Give it a shot!
