I am a big fan of this movie and I found the mini TV series "Children of The Dust", which fans of the version should look for. At least 20 minutes or more are cut off on the DVD version of this movie. <br /> <br /> I would also like to suggest to the viewers who enjoyed this film to consult the book. There is a more complete scenario with Corby / Whitewolf and Rachel. , more about the history of Blacks and Buffalo Solders. There were two stories for the series or this movie. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier only shows that he improves with age, the talent is growing, the chemistry between his character Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor has been wonderful. I also enjoyed the story of Billy Wirth / Joanna Going, they seem to be playing each other well. <br /> <br /> Billy Wirth is of course the "model of Indian vision". The look, the attitude, the dream of every woman who wanted to be carried away in one of these romances of love by an indigenous hero. It worked for me too. <br /> <br /> Much more could have been done with this scenario, but it gave the viewer a brief overview of racial issues in the 1880s, support for Aboriginal education, lack of black pioneers. to install cities in the west. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell), as always a great actor, appears as a teacher very attentive and confused, not knowing if the "Whites" should interfere in the indigenous culture. <br /> <br /> For anyone who loves characters and looks at them. change this movie is for you. I thought that the chemistry between the character of Poitier and that of the orphan Whitewolf was very moving and that Wirth and Poitier worked very well together. Billy Wirth did some of his best scenes when he worked with Poitier. <br /> <br /> I'm sometimes pissed off when you just want to stop and shake her or give her a call "Wake up and grow up". But overall, it was a great evening of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Look for the two-band version of this mini-series. If you are a fan, you will really see the difference.
