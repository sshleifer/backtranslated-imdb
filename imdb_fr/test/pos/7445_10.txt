You did not play the game? Do not bother yourself. It's for fans of Final Fantasy VII who beat the game, and no one else will appreciate this rare gem of a movie. Do you want to look and like? Buy the game, beat it and watch it. When did you see an excellent movie based on a video game? Well, that's it. <br /> <br /> The story takes place two years after the match and no summary is given to refresh your memory (although I doubt that many people would forget it), and get right to the point. Forty-one minute adventure. <br /> <br /> All your favorite characters are present, even Cait Sith. The dubbing is superb in the Japanese version, each character is perfectly molded. Cloud sounds hard and lean, Tifa looks nice but strong ... Aeris is also perfect, it sounds exactly as I imagined. Cait Sith seems less cute than I imagined, but worked very well. <br /> <br /> The character models are spectacular, with excellent textures and lighting. The environments are breathtaking and the fights are choreographed to make The Matrix blush. The excellent work of the camera is felt in bike chases, for example, where your eyes scream with satisfaction and your lungs breathe loudly without consent. <br /> <br /> The music is of the typical quality of Uematsu, which means its excellent. Familiar tunes are redone to accompany Advent Children's graphic leap, which mixes well with the visual aspects. There is even an inner joke for fans that involves music, it will surely make you smile. <br /> <br /> I did not watch it with subtitles since I'm half Japanese, so I can not say that. the subtitles are good. In Japanese, however, the dialogue is very good and each word sounds like coming from real living beings, not just actors. Impressive. I will see this one day with subtitles to see the differences since I played both the Japanese and American versions of Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, buy this movie the day it comes out or pre-order. If you have not played the game yet, but want to see this movie very badly, do not waste your time: buy the game, beat it, then come back for this DVD. I will not tell you not to watch it, but to play the game. This will make the experience a lot more enjoyable and will not let you in the dust scratch your head. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends, it's time to go on an adventure with your brave comrades!
