My local PBS WHYY Philadelphia station recently showed "The Elegant Universe". After three hours of watching, in addition to having brain pain, I learned everything about wormholes, quantum mechanics, parallel realities and alternate universes. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the show was devoted to string physics, a semi-new branch of physics that makes possible many of the ideas of science fiction not only, but PROBABLE. With "string theory", it looks like wormholes, realities and different timelines are possible and it may be only a matter of time before we have the knowledge to use them. <br /> <br /> Although this may not have given new information to a person familiar with the subject, I found the show VERY interesting and informative. It was very understandable for anyone familiar with this subject.
