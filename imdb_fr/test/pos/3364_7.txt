The 1970s are often considered the golden age of the British television comedy, a period that has seen many classic sitcoms come out as well as skits such as "The Flying Circus of Monty Python". The period, however, was not a golden age for British film comedy, and what worked well on television rarely came to the big screen. The most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the Pythons, but their best films ("Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Brian's Life") had a very different design from that of their television show. <br /> <br /> The main problem of adapting sitcom to the cinema is that the concepts designed for the 30 minutes of the BBC (25 minutes on ITV, which must find room for commercials) do not work always as well when they are developed in feature film three or four. once as long. Few people will remember film versions of, for example, "Up Pompeii!" or "Steptoe and Son" with the same affection as the TV versions. In the case of many classic television shows ("Some Mothers Do 'Ave' Em", "Yes, Minister", "Fawlty Towers", "The Goodies"), no attempt was made to film them, which is possible. be grateful. Characters such as Frank Spencer by Michael Crawford or Basil Fawlty by John Cleese can be hilarious in half-hour shots, but I doubt they'll be as funny for two hours. A comedy program (which could have been a dramatization of a comic novel rather than a sitcom in the usual sense of the term) could have been effective in the cinema: "The fall and rise of Reginald Perrin", but the hopes of a movie were tragically destroyed. death of his star, Leonard Rossiter. <br /> <br /> "Dad's Army" is one of the few TV sitcoms of the day that has been turned into a decent movie. (The only other I could think of was "Porridge"). This may be because he had an exceptionally large number of well-developed characters and he drew most of his humor from the interactions that united them. The original sitcom took place between 1968 and 1977 and told of the mishaps of a Home Guard squad in the small seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The Home Guard, initially known as Local Defense Volunteers, was an auxiliary militia formed during the Second World War and composed mostly of men too old to serve in the regular forces). The version of the film is a drama in three acts. Act I deals with the formation of the platoon and the recruitment of its members. In Act II, they wreak havoc in a training exercise of the army. In Act III, they managed to capture a group of Nazi airmen whose plane was shot down. <br /> <br /> The three key players in this drama are the platoon commander, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe), and his two subordinate sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, who in civil life is the director of the local bank, is a capricious little man, peering through the world through a pair of thick glasses. He takes the initiative to form the Home Guard unit and designates the commander. He is pompous, unofficial, with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and his own powers of direction, the kind of man who does not support idiots with joy. (And in George Mainwaring's worldview, the term "fool" covers most of the rest of the human race). He has good qualities, however. He is motivated by a true patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage, as evidenced by his meeting with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Wilson is Mainwaring's deputy at the bank. The two men are very different, accentuated by a difference in appearance, Wilson is tall and thin, while Mainwaring is small and corpulent. He seems to be both smarter and more educated than his boss. (His accent suggests that he may be a former public schoolboy). Nevertheless, he ended up playing a second role in civilian and military life, probably because he has a passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeatism and an inability to take everything seriously. Jones is an old soldier who now runs the local butcher shop. (His promotion to corporal is mainly due to his ability to bribe Mainwaring with black market sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role is matched only by his incompetence and his ability to cause chaos. Although his motto is "Do not panic!" he tends to panic at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> Several other members of the peloton are featured. Private Fraser, the Scottish undertaker, is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Catchphrase: "We are doomed, man, DOOMED!"). Private Godfrey is a gentle old man whose main concern is to locate the nearest sink. Private Walker is a great cockney lover and Private Pike (another bank clerk) a spoiled mom boy. (Pike's mother is Wilson's mistress, though Wilson tries to keep this link secret from Mainwaring's disapproval). The gentle-mannered priest and the guardian of the ARP, the hated enemy of Mainwaring and his equal in pomp and excess. <br /> <br /> From time to time there are bawdy double senses ("Protect yourself from my belongings" - Mainwaring apparently refers to soldiers who hold this rank), more than in the television show that was surprisingly free from innuendo. (Its creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, will later create comedy series such as "Are You Being Served?" And "Hi-de-hi", famous for their suggestive humor). However, the film retains much of the blend of tender wit, nostalgia and precise characterization that made the television series so successful. 7/10
