Nowadays, you rarely come to a children's show that does not feature 1) a preteen / teen pop star that's as fun as watching it dry, 2) involves a plot to find the perfect date with a guy / a different girl each time 3) revolves around screaming and unintelligible wandering humor. About 95% of Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network shows meet these criteria. For simplicity, they all lack good acting, originality and good stories. It's as if producers and writers thought that children were not smart enough to understand the character's development and the details of the plot. They could not be more oblivious. Of course, kids love to laugh and behave erratically (if it's conservative and well done), but they also want to enjoy a story, see dramas and see people challenged. They do not want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want. They know that this world is not just fun and games, they know it's not perfect. Everyone has problems and we must all learn to solve them. This show revolves around this kind of thing. Alex Mack is an average teenager who seems to have everything for her great sister, Annie. Her mother works in an office, but is sometimes a stay-at-home mom. His father, George, is a leading scientist at the plant, a chemical company that employs most of the city where they live, Paradise Valley. Alex is unpopular and seduced by most of his peers. Her only friend is Ray (but she has more and more friends as the show progresses). The first day of his high school, Alex goes home not very happy with his school, but a truck carrying chemicals from the factory crashes into a fire hydrant trying to avoid spilling it, spilling a strange chemical called GC-161, where the chemical mixes with water, covering Alex. Shortly after, she begins to develop strange powers such as turning into a puddle of water, firing lasers from her hand and moving objects with her mind. She also shines constantly when she is nervous (even if you never see much later). In addition to his sister Annie and his friend Ray, Alex decides to keep these secret powers for everyone, even his parents for fear of being kidnapped by Plant, whose corrupt owner, Danielle Atron, heads the Security , Vince, looking for the mysterious. GC161 child. Each episode then addresses Alex trying to lead a normal life as he learns to live with his strange powers. The series may seem like a girls show, but it is not. As a boy, I loved watching this show because of its impressive effects and drama. Producers have successfully added science fiction elements to teen drama. In fact, some episodes were very violent and a bit strange. The factory's unsuccessful directors, Atron and Vince, are good antagonists in the series, as the writers really set them up as a threat and give you that dreadful feeling every time they go on screen. In addition, the smart move is to add David, the truck driver who overflowed the GC-161, as Vince's embarrassing assistant looking for a comic effect, but also to love him at the end . It was interesting to see little Alex trying to live like a normal child but struggling to perfect his powers. Sometimes you forget that children are fighting in a giant adult-run institution because you are drawn to history. The series does a good job of bonding with the kids by showing Alex that she can have great powers, but that she is still a child and she has to be careful. Even some episodes, you will be helpless against the calamities of Alex. My favorite episode where Alex wishes she was never born really demonstrates most of these elements. As I said, the producers have never hesitated to add bursts of laughter, whether they come from one of Ray's dubbers, George's or David's strange habits trying to be a good guy. Of course, you're having silly moments and an entire episode that really has nothing to do with the plot of the series, but what good series does not? Overall, great show. 9/10
