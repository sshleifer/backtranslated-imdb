I think it's a brilliant show with cool talking heads and a very cool action. 2 guys who claim to be masters of female seduction demonstrate their talents in different nightclubs and 4 experts (collecting artists themselves) comment, choosing the winner. Their jokes are fun and some participants are really fun to watch. Even more, this show really teaches men how to get in touch with women, so many expert comments are helpful to let you see how it works in the field. In fact, I think this is one of the best TV series and I recommend it to all men who love women. <br /> <br /> ps / sorry for my broken love.
