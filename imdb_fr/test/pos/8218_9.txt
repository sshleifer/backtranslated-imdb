If you really read this advice, I give you a lot. You care enough to watch this movie, which most people have forgotten and read before reading beyond the first review! So, for your reading pleasure ... <br /> <br /> I guess you already know the plot, so I will not waste time grabbing it. I will mention that Sandra Bullock did an amazing job with this movie. She really brought a lot of sympathy to the role of computer programmer, which is often difficult to do. I can say it because I am a programmer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found the basic plot very good. You can easily create subplots on your main computer and turn it into a very nice movie. The premise is also extremely realistic in the sense that all this can really happen if the correct preconditions are not taken. <br /> <br /> Make a long criticism ... in short, phew! Too late! If you like to play a role in the life of Sandra Bullock and want to see a film very well done for the time, take a look at this little gem. You will not be disappointed. :-)
