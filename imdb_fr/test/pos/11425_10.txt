When I saw this film for the first time, I did not believe my own eyes. In front of me, there was a great parody of Valentino - and well done - seeing the bullfighting Stan Laurel is like seeing a great shooter in action! It's a very good parody, rich in ideas, with a smart and charming Stan ... old and good like whiskey. (or alcohol after that)
