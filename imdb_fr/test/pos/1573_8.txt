Screenwriter-director Dean Bell has offered many surprises and captivating moments in this modest yet compelling film. His dialogue was lively and his use of very short flashback sequences was particularly effective in the narrative structure of the film. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film is the character of Alice, who fled her New England. spent in a desperate effort to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a pair of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who are incredibly trying to prepare Alice to prostitute and earn money during truck stops. <br /> <br /> As a newcomer playing her first role on the screen, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational. There is no wrong note in his character choices. But the film is especially worth watching by the character both clever and sensitive Sandra, masterfully created by Judith Ivey. There is a particularly devious subtext in almost every moment Ivey is on camera. As a spectator, I found myself stopping the band, going back and watching his scenes to try to discern the psychological subtleties. <br /> <br /> The film raises the following question about the characters: Are Bill and Sandra good Samaritans, or are they a pair of evil diabolical predators attacking young Alice? One of the highlights of the film is that it never completely answers this question. Alice seems to have more confidence in her than she started after her experiences with Bill and Sandra. But is she really a better person? <br /> <br /> Half comedy, roadmap and transition to adulthood, this carefully crafted film manages to get us involved on many levels.
