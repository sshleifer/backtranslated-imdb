I watch a lot of movies about vampires. I know vampire movies. Hammer Films have always been my favorite. Christopher Lee will always be the best Dracula. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is a fun movie from start to finish. Dubbing is not great, but I also like Godzilla movies, so I'm used to badly doubling movies. Anyway, I really liked this movie. The SFX are great. Although the role of Jackie Chans in the film has nothing to do with the plot and seems to be added to sell the film, it is enjoyable to play. Fang's work is excellent. The acting is not great, but it could be related to the bad dubbing. Maybe the real language would sound better with the movie if I could understand it. I'm sure the film Gone With The Wind sounds worse in another language. <br /> <br /> I own this on DVD and I would not like to part with it. I have it on my library next to my Hammer Films DVDs.
