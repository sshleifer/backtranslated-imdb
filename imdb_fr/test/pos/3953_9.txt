James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not only beautiful and charismatic, but truly open and sincerely vulnerable. At Tristan's screening, some people were on his back for pouting, being sullen and doing everything for James Dean, but I do not think that's true. Blind Spot is proof of his immense talent. In this film, he wears entirely different weight. It's a unique performance. Sweet bitter and very moving. The lines of his newspaper cut you like a knife. You feel a lively intelligence behind his words. The tone is everything. He carries it through action and suspense as well as sad pieces of humor. I really like the other two actors too. The blonde girl is totally gorgeous and the man is hysterical in his hard twisted stoicism. Some of the hooligans seemed a little gloomy but it's really a mini-point. The film is totally solid and Franco is really cool all around.
