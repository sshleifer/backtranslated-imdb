I can not believe it's not a huge cult hit. Maybe in 1968, people, considering the Monkees as a stupid group of pop made by factories, stole Beatles, refused to see him. This cynicism has probably hidden it ever since. Do not make this mistake. Head is an amazing movie that the most open-minded will appreciate. It's very funny and very intelligent (and very exciting).
