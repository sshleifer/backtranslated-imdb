I just saw the last episode, # 32 (although the site says that 30 episodes have been made) and I must say that this series is really very good and I highly recommend it to all those who love the stories of policeman / police officer. All 32 were supposed to be based on facts containing information at the end of each episode of court sentences for the perpetrators, sometimes a serious, well-done, credible and daring series. The fact that the Danish powers decided to dissolve the unit was almost unbelievable, because they worked so well and, at least in the series, they never failed to "be had". It is a 10/10 final for me.
