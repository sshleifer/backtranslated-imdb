Many people give this movie a lot of bullshit, and all of this is really undeserved. People give this film a hard time, either because it's such a sick subject or because they insist on a technical aspect of the film that no one else watches as they watch it. If, just by looking at the cover, you think this movie will make you feel uncomfortable ... DO NOT LOOK! However, you would miss one of the best cinematic experiences of the late 1990s, despite what other people are saying. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider is wonderful here as Captain Howdy, he is immersed in the depths of madness. Playing this character must be beyond words, and is much further than any of us should be willing to go. Playing here is wonderful. The film itself has been beautifully shot. The subject may be a little hard for many to swallow, but it's still worth it. If you have not seen this movie, watch it.
