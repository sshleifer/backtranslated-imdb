Not the movie to see if you want to be stimulated intellectually. If you want to have a lot of fun in the theater, this is it. Many lively jokes (and some really lame jokes too). Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny like the comic relief. Exciting and creative cages and chase scenes. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexy) are attractive tracks. And Donald Sutherland!
