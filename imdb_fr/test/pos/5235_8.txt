One of the myths of the beginning of the era of sound is that they could not create a western because they had trouble recording sound on the spot. In fact, it is the financial restrictions of the depression that have temporarily killed the genre, at least in the "A" budget. However, in the period 1929-1931, before the economic downturn actually came into effect, the western "A" flourished, notably with The Virginian, Billy the Kid and Cimarron. The Big Trail was perhaps the biggest of all ?? a gargantuan pioneering Westerner in an early wide-screen process titled magnificently greatness. Thanks to a recent DVD, we now see the widescreen and full screen versions that were shot simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in vast open-air panoramas, and therefore in many ways a perfect choice. He uses the wider frame a lot to show the breathtaking western landscape. A number of early shots, such as when a woman cuts firewood, is very typical of Walsh. Most of the screen is tightly filled by carts and other cluttered objects, but in one corner we see the desert expanding in an inviting way. When the train of cars starts, the open plain is gradually revealed to us, with wagons withdrawing like theater curtains. These shots are not as effective in the full-screen version, but on a larger canvas, Walsh's expression of the outdoors has never been better. <br /> <br /> But there is an unfortunate setback to that. With regard to dialogue scenes, Walsh tends to place actors in the center of the stage, as if they were in an imaginary full-screen box. The extra width becomes just that ?? additional. This may seem logical at first, because it means that we see as many players in height as in a full-screen image. However, this gives the players a small and insignificant aspect in the frame, while the whole bottom case dominates the shot ?? and there is a lot of background activity in the Big Trail. When the widescreen formats reappeared in the 50s, many filmmakers made the same mistake, before realizing that in talkie scenes, it was better to frame the actors of the chest, losing part of their height but allowing them to fill the screen. <br /> <br /> Too bad, because The Big Trail is a particularly well balanced and well written effort. The secondary intrigues of romance and revenge are simple but well defined and do not threaten to sway each other or tell the story of the pioneers. It could have been a big, intimate epic, but it loses a lot of weight, because every time people start talking to each other, we're distracted by cattle herds, drifting cars and stuff that fill every inch of frame available . Nevertheless, Walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still visible and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also nice comic touches, largely thanks to the "Swedish comedian" El Brendel. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is also known for being the lead role of John Wayne. Although Wayne is another victim of the distant framing in the dialogue scenes, we see at least his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive vocal performance. It betrays its lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. Unfortunately, this potential was not widely exploited at the time and he spent the rest of the decade blurring it into B-pictures before finally becoming famous. Wayne's boyfriend (and later the prolific actor), Ward Bond, also appears on this picture. He is not credited, but you can see him in several scenes, especially around the 80 minutes he is to the left of Tyrone Power. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a glorious epic that manages to break down like a drama. And it was this prodigious ladder that would put the West (and its widescreen) in bed for a while. And although the 40s and 50s are now considered the golden age of the West, it was a changed genre, with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established West? ? neither better nor worse, but of a different form. The first period of talkie was the end of an era in which westerns could be truly gigantic.
