If you know the Manhattan project, you will find "Fat Man and Little Boy" at least one interesting description of the events surrounding this story. The film is in all respects a very realistic representation of these events, and in many ways it is almost too real (like some scenes involving radiation poisoning). Paul Newman, as usual, is brilliant in his role and always manages to appear as a real person on the screen. Core actors such as John Cusack, Laura Dern, Bonnie Bedelia and Natasha Richardson are also pretty good. This film is not, however, one of the best examples of transforming a true story into a film. Great movies are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic license to keep their audience engaged throughout the movie. This one, however, tends to hang around and some scenes (like the love story of John Cusack and Natasha Richardson) could have been completely eliminated without causing much loss to the film. Nevertheless, there are enough interesting facts and tiny humorous elements to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the entire movie. It's not always fun, but for the big performances, it's very precise, fascinating, and will give the audience time to think. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
