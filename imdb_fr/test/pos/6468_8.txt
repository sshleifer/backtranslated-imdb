A film skillfully directed by Martin Ritt, where John Cassevetes, a hero of the scene and anti-hero, lands in New York to escape a tragic incident of his life, where he killed his brother in a car accident and he is excluded from the army. <Br /> <br /> Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows courage in his film portrait. I'm surprised that Montgomery Clift does not know this part. <br /> <br /> Ruth White is her mother and works remarkably well in two scenes over the phone. <br /> <br /> Once in New York, he befriends Sidney Poitier while both work on the docks. Immediately, Jack Warden, a tyrant and a villain in this film, takes it in horror and the tragedy ensues when Poitier tries to defend his friend. <br /> <br /> Ruby Dee plays Poitier's wife in this film and is brilliant in a scene where she exhorts Cassavetes to reveal her husband's murderer. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly an interesting film about moral values ​​and solitary in society. With the backdrop of housing, the good atmosphere is described in the film.
