It's a TV movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid-1970s. It's hard to say how true it is. He is certainly based on Mark Fuhrman's book. In any case, the film describes the crime in flashback and its consequences, including the arrest of a suspect, about 25 years later, who had never been considered a suspect at the time. In the film, Fuhram is of course largely responsible for arresting and closing the case for Martha's surviving family, especially her mother. The story of the film is inspired by the ghost of Martha Moxley, who speaks at the premiere This is a very effective feature in this film. To me, it adds more impact to the film, and puts a human face on the victim of the murder (if only an actress plays the role) Maggie Grace embodies Martha and she really impressed me. of a sense of justice and maybe he cared really.or maybe he just s A dollar sign of a future bestseller book. Anyway, this makes it an interesting movie. He is well played and fast enough. I do not think there was a lot of useless stuff in the movie, just enough to tell the story. We could say that they left out things that would have lit up the procedure a little more, and we would be right. Moreover, we can argue that the end was sudden and again, we would be right. I said, for me, I think they told the story with at least the essentials. Anything else would probably have required a miniseries. In addition, there is a miniseries called "A Season in Purgatory" which was released 6 years earlier (1996), to which this film has some parallels, even if only weakly. However, if you like this movie, "Then you may be interested in" A Season in Purgatory. "I am convinced that" a season in Purgatory "is in fact a fictional account of the same crime. , the murder in Greenwich "is an 8/10
