This thriller is one of the few surprises (film) I've had for a long time. Everyone - and I mean EVERYONE - to whom I spoke when it was in theaters said it was awful ... but then I started to think ... none of these people do not really understand horror / thriller movies or rock metal - so WHY DO I listen to them in the first place ????? This film has failures, but ONLY if you are able to understand and enjoy this type of entertainment. In short (too late) - see it with an open mind and it may open your mind. ... the great soundtracks too ...
