First of all, you should watch this show only if the lack of subtitles, pornography, disgusting sex and total depravity, horrible and really shocking, do not bother you. I mentioned perverted sex, but to qualify as sex in the second half of the "perverse" movie would be a big understatement. It's more like a punch in the face if you're not prepared for this kind of disease. That said, I can come back to this morbid piece of pseudo-snuff that was introduced to us by our Japanese compatriots. <br /> <br /> The plot seems pretty basic, almost non-existent: a girl is hired to perform in the amateur porn movie. Do not expect much in the first 30 to 40 minutes. There is a dialogue - if you do not speak Japanese, it will not mean much to you - it seems like an occasional conversation between the girl and the team / performer, then there is some porn (straight sex) After the scene is over, the performers and the team take a break. And then ... it starts to happen. <br /> <br /> It seems that the girl is brought to play one more scene - this time tied with a rope. The abuse begins: lashes, slaps, hot wax ... Finally, the girl collapses and cries. They detach her. <br /> <br /> Then we see interpreters and team members sitting at the table as if nothing had happened, except for the girl. She is visibly shaken and she looks like she wants to leave. She goes to the door, sits down on the floor to put on her shoes ... and that's when hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> She is hit on the head with the baseball bat, her wound is neat, she is tied to the bed. What follows can be described briefly (I will not ruin everything for you) as a rape during the dismemberment. Think of "Flower of flesh and blood", mix it with porn and you will have the idea. It will take about 20 minutes. SFX is very good, makeup too. Everything is shown, without mercy for the spectator. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I thought "Visitor Q" was a very sick movie. After watching "Niku daruma", it looked like a fairy tale. This film is so sick, so depraved, so twisted, so sickening that the hardest words pale in comparison to its end. Too bad it is only available on VHS, no subtitle is available. But the film still works without them. So, if you like the ultra disease, extreme sadism and other beauties of this kind beloved, go see that. I hope you will not have nightmares.
