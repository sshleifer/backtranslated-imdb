Although often regarded as Peter Sellers' worst film, it is actually an excellent introduction to corruption in the medical sector and abuse of power. Often misunderstood, the film is actually a break with the type of film on which Sellers was best known; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (from Happy Days and Karate Kid movies), but was marked by its flagrant, irreverent and total demolition of the medical industry of the time. He was ahead of his time (1972) by taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python team would follow at the movies a little later. As such, it was unacceptable to Peter Sellers' traditional supporters, who found that the sharpest beards of this humor were something they were not used to. Currently, Peter Sellers's films are in great demand by fans, but this effort, Where Does It Hurt ?, has become, by nature, almost impossible to find.
