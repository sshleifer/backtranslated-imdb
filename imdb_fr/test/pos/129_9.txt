This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study of how people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels). <br /> <br /> The characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are supposed to assume and look for a way to live within these roles rather than rejecting them completely. But as the story develops, the two wives, trapped in marriages without love, come closer. Relying on the strength of their friendship and love, they give each other the courage to give up their roles. <br /> <br /> They discovered that living according to their traditions was not a life, but a kind of living death. : without passion, without real connection with others, without accomplishment. Although they know that their rebellion and their freedom will have a price to pay, it is a much cheaper price than the sacrifice claimed by a comfortable and predictable existence. <br /> <br /> The scenario is wonderful, acting wonderfully. Almost perfect!
