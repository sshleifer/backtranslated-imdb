I found the film very interesting. I really enjoyed the movie the actors were great. It was an entertainment. Benny the uncle was wonderful. He was real in his character. The end took a wonderful turn. I would recommend you to see him. Eddie Mores girlfriend reminded me a bit of Sandra Bullock, she was strong as a nail. I also like little girls who play in the movie, she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of one of my friends who really lives his life growing up in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pan because most people cook lol. In fact, I watched the movie 2 times and learned more about it the second time.
