The influences of other films and science fiction and thriller stories are evident throughout this film. The movies that immediately come to mind are Alien, Aliens and Starship Troopers. The story itself is quite simple and not entirely original, traveling in hibernation, landing on a seemingly lifeless planet and an "abandoned" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together to achieve their goals. mutual survival, while the number of bodies goes up. This kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well. I think Pitch Black has been well done. The characters are interesting and you will want to know more as the movie progresses, and I think people will be surprised to know who does it and who does not. <br /> <br /> Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the stereotypical convict who has a murderous past, physical prowess, great tolerance for pain and a convenient vision in the dark. You know he will end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because throughout the movie, he hinted that he might be aware of things. <br /> <br /> Cole House plays the role of the bounty hunter addict who is probably in many ways a real villain compared to Riddick, as his character is revealed throughout the film. It is very likely that he will be the bravest when the chances and firepower are favorable to him. A very selfish character who ends up getting what he deserves. <br /> <br /> Radha Mitchell plays the role of co-pilot on the doomed ship, which came out of a deep sleep because the ship passed through a cloud of meteors or the end of a comment. Finding the dead pilot in her bedroom, she tries to land aboard the ship, which allows us to discover the potentially fatal flaw of this character - the fear of responsibility, responsibility and leadership. Her character in the short film of the story probably grows the most, as she acquires a certain conviction, takes things in hand and does not sit waiting to be swallowed up at night to track aliens. She has strange connections to the human side that is always distant from Riddick, who, in turn, respects her for her choices and sticks to them. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds sometimes in the following cases: you expect it, but I think you will be slightly surprised to know which characters will survive this painful experience. This movie is a fun train wreck to watch. Go watch it! <br /> <br />
