DO NOT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This forgotten gem occupies a special place in my heart and on the list of video Nasties. The soundtrack of the flute, sitar and rattle is classic. The main character, although much hotter than most low-budget starlets, is a very pretty low-budget lead. The character of Doctor Masters is well written and well played. Some of the less important characters are a bit silly but add to the nostalgia of the movie. It's Campy. I'm not trying to lie. The character who makes the difference is a man-child named Faulknarian, Sam, one of the patients of this film for sanitarium. The blood is pretty standard although I think the blood color is great. It's so ..Red. I think this film was badly received because of its advertising project. A small advertising frame without soul has got hold of it and said to himself: "Let's stop the AD campaign of Last House on the Left, it's going well". Small shocks like this have ruined the film world. All bullets and no brain. In addition, the publisher may or may not have been an alcoholic. Maybe he's all drunk. You will see what I mean. Another little note. Do not buy it at the Wally-Mart purse. They cut it to an unassailable level. Try to find the longest cut possible.
