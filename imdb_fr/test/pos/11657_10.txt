The greatest effort and the best cast ever in a film by director Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn in the front row. Someone said that this film is good because directed and written by Tim Robbins but I convince you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon had given me a really superb performance that made me cry my heart. Their game is so real! No doubt about it that this film is rated 4 and 3/4 of 5!
