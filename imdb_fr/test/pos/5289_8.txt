For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top shape and has had another rewarding experience. Okay, you do not have to read any further now. <br /> <br /> I already assume that most readers are older than the two protagonists in this picture. So I must say that Ponyo is not really a family film chance to remind you of the feeling of being a small child: discover the world as you wish, establish your own rules and boast of an exuberant enthusiasm to do things for yourself for the first time. Ponyo is moving away from many of the issues facing movies for all ages. It never condescends, all characters have a sincere good heart and credible problems. <br /> <br /> The two main characters can be two of the most credible children I have ever seen put on the screen. They are not simple-minded, arrogant or naive, they are simply curious, enthusiastic and learn the customs of the world. They are so easy to love, but even easier to identify. Many films consider children from outside, like the adult who looks in a world that only a child could enter. Ponyo brings everyone back to this world. In Ponyo, this is the first time you will learn and choose what matters most to you, values ​​that the film values ​​with great respect. It's worth remembering, feeling it again.
