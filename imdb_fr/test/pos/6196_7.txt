Intelligently written, well played, intense and full of suspense. This show lives in the real world, not as fantastic as "24" (and I'm a big fan of 24, incidentally). He has credible characters and in many ways is a lot smarter than most people like him. He tries to present both sides of Islam. So far, I have watched the first 4 episodes and found the story more balanced. Terrorists are more complex and not one-dimensional. And as a result of this balance, terrorists become more frightening than typical villains described in movies and on television. Finally, the hero is really heroic without being a cartoon. I recommend this show to all fans aged 24 and over.
