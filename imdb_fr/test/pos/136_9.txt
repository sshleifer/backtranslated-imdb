I did not expect much because of the harsh reviews, so I really enjoyed the movie. Smoother colors and less amazing shooting compositions than some of his previous films have, in my opinion, allowed the storytelling to focus. Although the religious conflict in a vampire movie was a banality, I felt that many other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how her powers were often revealed by her interaction with her. <br /> <br /> love scenes very strong and well played. <br /> <br /> the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other separated them even more. <br /> <br /> Their major differences as to what it means to be a "vampire" created by their previous life experiences. <br /> <br /> the absence of many other vampires appearing or being created in the film. <br /> <br /> I've heard and read a lot about "tips used in other movies". Of course. However, I think the tricks are used to emphasize what is going on in the scene and I think he does it well. I do not need a director to use new tricks. I prefer that the tips used are well used, which, in my opinion, is the case with this film. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
