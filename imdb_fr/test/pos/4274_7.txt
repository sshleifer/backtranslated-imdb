This show is really Broadway American Idol. He sang, the British guy, a guy who is sometimes kind and a super nice lady. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's different because there is a song, it just does not see some of the actors). <br /> <br /> I gave this show a 7 because there are some changes that I know many people (including me) would do if they worked for the show. The first thing to change is the judges who decide who goes home. I know they want to find the right Danny and Sandy, but the United States should have the power to decide who will go home. There is really no point in singing. In any case, the person who gets the least votes goes home. Another thing I would change is to see them actually play on the series. What is Broadway without the role of actor? The last thing to change is the song that the eliminated people sing at the end. Eliminated Danny always sings the same song and Eliminated Sandy still sings the same song on the way out. Since they sing it every week, these songs end up becoming annoying. <br /> <br /> I confess I'm not a fan of the movie, Grease, but for some reason, I'm hooked. This show is very underrated. There are so many performances and memorable moments.
