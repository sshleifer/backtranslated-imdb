This was one of the most moving films I've seen. Passion, pleasure, pain, despair, sorrow, healing, purification and love. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was mesmerizing. Everything was so well done; the adaptation of the book, the actors, the sets, the shots. <br /> <br /> This film deeply touched me in many ways. It reminded me of the hopelessness of losing your love and the time it takes to heal that wound. You may still like it, but you will always risk the pain that accompanies the separation. <br /> <br /> Is not this one of the most important issues of our time? <br /> <br /> "Is it better to have love and be lost? <br /> <br /> What have you ever loved before?" <br /> <br /> -Ascension
