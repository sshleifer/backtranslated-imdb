This film is a jewel! This is the story of Juliet, a very ordinary maid who works in the big office of a yoghurt company, and Romuald, her president. He does not pay attention, he does not pay attention to anyone before several plots to tear his company, all struck at the same time. He is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliet. As a housekeeper, no one pays attention to her, so she says and does incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to grab and use to help her defenseless and defenseless boss. > It's been years since I kept an eye on the DVD and see a previous comment about its release in September 2007 raised my hopes. Alas, I can not find a DVD, does anyone know if there is / if he had one?
