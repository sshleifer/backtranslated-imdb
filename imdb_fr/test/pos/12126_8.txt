a very surprisingly underrated movie. very realistic. and authentic .with a great dialogue. Being Italian, I can certainly understand the situations and expressions used. I thought Joe Cortese was great. like a crazy cowboy guy, and pesci and Vincent were great too. I liked the actor Criscuolo who played the role of the leader. He was very authentic. I think director Ralph Devito was about to do great things, but he was cut too early, perhaps because he knew too much. I thought it was great. he deserved more dissemination and recognition. it was a sleeper movie. awesome. very good. it really had a good authenticity. it was well done.
