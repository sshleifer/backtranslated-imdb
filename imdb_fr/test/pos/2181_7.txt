This cheap remake of the formidable final of the 5 stars suffers from a bad interpretation. Humphrey Bogart plays the role of director of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to lower its ratings. The owner decides to write a series of pieces of morality on a famous murder case of 20 years ago. So they hired the false preacher (Harry Hayden) to find the murderer, who was acquitted and lives quietly under a false name. The preacher arrives on the day of the girl's wedding, but the ruthless radio refuses to expose the mother and ruin their lives. <br /> <br /> Bogart is always good. Hayden is good googly preacher and Henry O'Neill is good as a father. Everyone is just horrible. Helen McKeller does not win any sympathy (crucial for the role), Linda Perry is a lousy actress, Beverly Roberts is OK but still looks old, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh have no roles, Carlyle Moore is a dude like the boyfriend, Virginia Brissac is Robert Middlemas superimposed as the owner of the station. <br /> <br /> This one arrives in less than an hour, but is a pale copy of the original that has praised the dynamic performances of Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon, Frances Starr and Boris Karloff. But it's always worth watching Boagrt.
