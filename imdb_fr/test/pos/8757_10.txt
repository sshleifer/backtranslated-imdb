I had been very curious to see the original six-hour miniseries on which Steven Soderbergh's latest film was based, and now that I have it, I'm happy to say that one is no better than the one other. They are intelligent, catchy and extremely entertaining. The only real benefit of the miniserie compared to the movie is that it lasts three and a half hours longer. We will therefore better know the characters. <br /> <br /> There is no wrong note to be. There was some in that production, one thing you should definitely take time when PBS rebroadcast this miniseries at some point in 2001. You will not regret it.
