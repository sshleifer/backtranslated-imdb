Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak) - his third feature film (his first film was a 1997 black and white video, The Small Town-Kasaba) - is a significant step forward from his good but defective film from 1999, Mays Sikintisi. The first film had potential, but stunk a small budget and improvised in the worst way: theater holes and wooden game amateurs. That Clouds Of May has succeeded at all levels is testament to Ceylon's talent as an aspiring filmmaker. Distant however marks the arrival of Ceylon on the international scene as a great artist, endowed with many qualities identical to those of other great film-makers like Ingmar Bergman (although his scenario is less dense in dialogues, it is just as much, and he lacks a penchant for close-ups - his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating contemplative scenes reconfigure Ceylon). Most of the film takes place in a snowy winter Istanbul (the fact that it snows in Turkey will probably surprise some), which gives the film an impression of Bergen and recalls some of the snowy urban images of Krzysztof Kieslowski. The Decalogue. Natural images invoke the best of Werner Herzog - because they tend to beat faster than classical film theory - making them even more memorable, while the cityscapes are in the almost precise compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni. At Woody Allen's cultural hagiography, a bench shot overlooking the water is a direct quotation (read fly) from Manhattan, with the exception of the absence of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan quotes in the same way a famous shot of a ship in the port pulled from Tokyo Story. Yet, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his appropriations his own art, by modifying them slightly and keeping them to the measure of the needs of his own film? Distant is a film whose title permeates the characterization inside the film and the feeling that some viewers will have vis-Ã -vis them, but does not describe the film itself, because the scenes remain with it long after the end of the film. The scene and the image of the film are perhaps the most memorable when Mahmut harasses his ex-wife at the Istanbul airport and watches her with her new husband as they board the plane that will take him away from his life. As he watches her from afar, we see her just catching a glimpse of him. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He withdraws behind a column and Nazan just turns his head towards his future. Mahmut is her past and she knows how to go about it: keep moving forward. Mahmut will never get it. Most often, they have such moments of understanding of life. The fact that some viewers get the film and that Ceylon has its own creative power shows that ignorance can teach, as long as it moves. Distant does, although it's just the right length.
