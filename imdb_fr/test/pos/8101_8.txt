From the beginning of the film, I started to laugh while trying to remain silent, so I did not wake anyone in the house, it did not continue so much throughout the film, I did not find everything completely "laugh out loud". It's funny, but I still found some pretty funny things. At first I had to stop laughing when he dropped the very cunning Hand Grenade in his sleeve. Then there are scenes where you will only smile, as when the barber falls from an apartment to someone, I see that it's quite funny, but nowadays, time has often been done, but it did not seem original. at the time, I'm sure it was. I loved the bursts of Hynkels (Hitlerites) raging in German with the beautiful and subtle English translation. <br /> <br /> The final scene is hotly debated because it's absolutely true and so intelligently constructed. Although the film is sixty-eight, the final scene is still relevant, if it does not show how Chaplin is a great writer, then I do not know what will happen. The acting in this particular scene was pretty good, the Barber has perfectly transcended the message and makes you realize the seriousness of the film, while enjoying the humorous side. <br /> <br /> Another element of this film is the fact that this film was so brave, that one feels almost ahead of its time. Of course, Chaplin did not know what was going to happen after 1940, he was not aware of the Holocaust (obviously), he also said he did not know if he would make this movie. The fact that this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting, but even more interesting: it was not very anti-Germany, which would be very easy to do at the time, but Chaplin could easily make a propaganda film . plus, he made an honest movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who is interested in this film to see it, as well as to those who studied or studied Hitler and World War II to watch this film. It's funny to say it at least, it does not have the boring and outdated feel that some movies of the time had. Unlike most "comedies," this movie actually has a message that it tries to convey to you: watch this movie, you will be better off having seen it.
