The Late Shift is an excellent book. I read the book several years ago and was shocked by the bitter riot that occurred when Johnny Carson retired and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson attempted to take over his place. When the movie came out, I took a VHS copy of the movie and, after reviewing the book recently, it's hard to say what I like the most, because the amount of information transmitted is quite equal. The two main actors, John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, two actors I had never heard of before and which I had not heard of since, play convincingly Leno and Letterman, despite the rejection of Letterman's portrait poor. They play the roles pretty well, despite the fact that many people are looking for an imitation of both. I was not so interested in that. History is what matters. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, playing Helen Kushnick, is this movie. She plays this nasty bitch so threatening that you realize how much this woman can control, let alone a national television show. Yuck! There should be a sequel !!
