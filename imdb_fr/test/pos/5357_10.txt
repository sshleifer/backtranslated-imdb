When Wallace and Gromit made their debut in the award-winning short "A Grand Day Out", they created a new look at Claymation. After two other short films, Aardman's dynamic duo returned for this very entertaining and entertaining film. He has an excellent cast of voices, humorous jokes and a good animation as only Aardman could do! <br /> <br /> In this film, Wallace and Gromit lead "Anti-Pesto", a rabbits moving company. When one learns that a "garbage rabbit" eats all the vegetables of the city, a frenzy ensues. Of course, Victor Quartermaine, the beautiful hunter of the city, wielding toupees, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the charming Lady Tottington ... but our Aardman's favorite duo can save the day before the chaos does it follow? <br /> The jokes, I should say, were hilarious. One point, the villain, Victor Quartermaine, was showing booty-crack, pushing a character to shout, "Beware ... THE MOON !!!" Vintage Aardman! <br /> <br /> The characters are clear and hilarious. Our favorite Man and Dog team at Aardman entertained us as they could do it themselves, allowing them to win their second Oscar (remember "A Grand Day Out?"). Helena Bonham Carter was great as a charming Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was particularly funny and foreboding as a valiant hunter, Victor Quartermaine. But the one who really stole the show is the priest, whose antics turned out to be comical and hilarious relief. <br /> <br /> Hat at Aardman for the creation of another Wallace and Gromit masterpiece!
