one of the best movies of all time ... Fire ... it's not a sociological description of India today ... but the breathtaking use of light that is not never stops, never becomes ... normal ... even when ... in this sense, the film is almost unique ... the two films are of very good quality ... Das is a good street artist known. Her performance is a superb "cammeo" ... but light ... I have watched and watched, again and again ... always breathtaking after centuries ... nothing hot in history ... rather "pure" way of dealing with the subject ... it is unfortunate that, in the strange world we live in today, a major work of art is generally referred to as a film about the genre ... Fire can confront Joan of Arc of Dryer or Biruma no Tategoto of Ichikawa or some of Kurosawa's main films, to name only "some". I hope that my contribution can help this film to become a deserved success.
