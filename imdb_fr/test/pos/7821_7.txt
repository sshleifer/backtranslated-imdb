I watched this movie because of Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I loved them together on the palisades, so it was a pleasure to see them together again. It was not the best movie of all time, but it was cute. Very predictable, but sometimes funny, movies are just what I need. <br /> <br /> The desserts were beautiful and I wanted to eat them all. I loved it when it collapsed though. I bet it always tastes good. <br /> <br /> Costas and Lauren still had the good chemistry they had on the palisades, and I fainted as they kissed in this movie. <br /> <br /> I would not see it again, but it was a great fill for one night.
