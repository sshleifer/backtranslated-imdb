I was not born in the 80s, unlike most critics. I was born on May 14, 1994. Despite that, my life was very much like the 80s style. When other kids had play stations, I played Zelda on my NES, and so on. Now, this film already occupies a special place in my heart when I was only 15 at the time of writing this review. Because of my childhood of the 80s, I watched many TV shows and watched a lot of movies that other kids did not see. This film was one of those and one of the best. <br /> <br /> It starts in Los Angeles with Alvin Sevilla, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the adoptive father of the Chipmunk, is in a hurry to get to the airport as he leaves for a business trip to Europe. His taxi is almost there and the Chipmunks help him pack. As they discuss, Alvin expresses his willingness to come with Dave and see the world (even though, technically, Dave only goes to Europe for Alvin, apparently only America and Europe qualify as "the world"). David leaves the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller, much to the chagrin of the boys. Soon Dave is at the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller. Later, at a local caf√©, the Chipmunks will play a part of the world tour in 30 days against the Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the match against Britain after eating his crocodile in the ball, Hot Air Balloon, Alvin argues with Brittany to know who would really win a race around the world. Klaus and Claudia Furschtien, two diamond traffickers sitting at a nearby table, hear their argument and, needing a safe way to transport their diamonds around the world, decide to trick children into delivering them. They organize a race around the world, where each team will have to drop a doll in their image (secretly filled with diamonds) at the depots around the world and receive a doll in the image of the opposing team (secretly filled with the diamonds ) to "vary that they were there". The winning team would then receive a $ 100,000 reward. They do so because they believe that Jamal (an Interpol agent who has been hounding them for ages) would never suspect them because they are only children (this seems superfluous, however, because during their travels, children no need to pass security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither Klaus nor Claudia would have taken the diamonds there personally.) This is the beginning of a great adventure. This movie is a classic and I do not see why anyone would like it. It offers excellent animation and excellent vocal performance, not to mention the music of Kick-ass (Pardon my french: P). My favorite song is undoubtedly '' Rock and Roll Girls and Boys '' An incredible rock song that can not be completed. It's also my favorite moment in the movie. Other notable songs include "Getting Lucky" (a little suggestive for a children's movie, huh?), "My Mother", and "Wooly Bully" and "Discovering the World". the main theme of the film heard at the opening credits of the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with '' My mother '' still brings a tear to my eye. Regarding the song '' Getting Lucky '', I did not think about it at all, but when I grew up and got to know life, it became obvious that this song was a little suggestive . This song, as well as the fact that the animators insist that the public knows the color of the pants of Chipettes. This is particularly evident in the scene in Egypt when the Arab prince's men set off in pursuit of the Chipettes, when Eleanor leans over the edge of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. Although it has nothing to do with the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things, like why no one in the world seems to care about the fact that 4-foot-tall Chipmunks are walking around and talking with people. Incredibly sharp voices and treat them just as they would any human child. Anyway, a little after this scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to pick up the Chipmunks and go home. Janice Karman's management is perfecting this film because she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr., know the characters better than anyone else. They even make the voices of Chipmunks and Chipettes. Ross is the voice for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice is the voice for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this film while talking about male characters played by female actresses. She plays the role of the Prince of Arabia, a very small but important role. The end is of course happy. The scammers were caught, the ends are tied and the movie ends when the kids, Dave and Miss Miller arrive at sunset, Alvin complaining that he did not receive his $ 100,000 reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he screams "ALVIN! '' And the screen goes black <br /> <br /> A classic ending, by the way. I hope you have found my review of this film useful, and if you have not seen this movie, give it a watch, it's worth it. This nostalgic classic of the 80s gets a solid score of 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> '' Headin '' for the top, you do not know! we never stop believing now ''
