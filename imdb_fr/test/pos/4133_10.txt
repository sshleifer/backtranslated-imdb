Gary Busey played very well rock'n'roll legend Buddy Holly (1936-1959). He has a spitting image for the man. Being a garage group in the 50s is certainly different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple at the time. I bet Buddy Holly (Busey) was a better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was a quiet little town. His parents were Christians, although his mother was a strong supporter of his son's work. That's one of the reasons he did not act like Elvis. He stuck to his kindest manners. It makes it really good! When he went to Tennessee, he saw how bad the producers were. They hated rock-n-roll, which greatly disappointed Holly. Getting used to this different atmosphere was a challenge for Holly and her friends. He did the tour with Sam Cooke, went to the famous Apollo, that the whole African American public quickly accepted, and I liked it! And Sam Cooke made sure that Holly and her group receive services. That's what I call tolerance. It is sad that he, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson have seen their musical career interrupted by a plane crash in 1959, at least their memories will remain etched in our hearts. I do not understand the inaccuracies contained in the film. All that matters to me is that Buddy Holly overcame the obstacles of music and politics at that time and that the music is almost perfect. For Gary Busey, he was perfect in the role and making music. GOD BLESS YOU GARY BUSEY! 5 STARS!
