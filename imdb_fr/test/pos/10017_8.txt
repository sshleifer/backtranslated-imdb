I went to "Night of the Hunted" not knowing what to expect at all. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> This is essentially a thriller / mystery where this girl who does not remember anything is "rescued" by a guy at the wheel. The two become friends and fast lovers and together they try to understand what is happening with her. Through flashback flashbacks and sinister memories, they finally get to the bottom of things and the end is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I really liked the decor of this one: a sorry and post-modern Paris is the backdrop with lots of gray skies and tall buildings. Very metropolitan. Groovy soundtrack and lots of nudity. <br /> <br /> Surprising, it was done in 1980; seems a little ahead of time. <br /> <br /> 8 children out of 10, children.
