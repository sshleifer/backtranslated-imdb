One of the best war movies I've ever seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about such films because it is very difficult to report a movie error. The "problem" is that it looks too real and takes you to the ruins of Stalingrad and makes you suffer on both sides. It is for the reason that this film unlike most Hollywood movies does not glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters. Instead, the film makes them heroes only to be human and hence is anti-war as much as reason can offer. Extremely convincing scenes of war and impressive acting, most of the scenes are like isolated plays. In addition, the German army is played by Germans, which is also convincing. The film is produced and directed by Germans where you can see their love of details to perfection. That's why "Stalingrad" is one of the movies I can watch millions of times without ever feeling bored. I watched the movie with my father who fought in World War II and the first thing he said was, "It's like it's the reality, here's what the war against the Germans looked like." . This is the place where you can see what a soldier looked like in the worst war nightmare in the history of mankind and at the turn of the Second World War: Stalingrad.
