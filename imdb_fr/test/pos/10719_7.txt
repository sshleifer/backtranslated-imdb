I saw this film on three different occasions. The first time, I was shocked by this movie. He appeared as a very nice movie with me. I hated this film as a sentimental trash bin during my second viewing. However, my third viewing reaffirmed my belief that it is a good movie. There is a lot of emotional power in this movie, especially scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr. Kramer and Ms. Kramer. There are certain scenes in which Meryl Streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she has a beauty in real life.Dustin Hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to tackle the recent task of guarding his child.There was even a controversy on the trays of this According to the master cameraman Nestor Almendros there was a shot in which he just escaped hurt when the character of Mr. Kramer, to show the intensity of his anger, decides to break a glass glass . Fortunately nothing has happened to Nestor. Kramer vs. Kramer shows the destruction of a family structure. He also tells how fa mily should be maintained if children are involved.
