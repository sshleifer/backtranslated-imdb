What troupe of actors and actresses in this episode of Columbo, next to Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle mysteriously dies and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fianc√©e, Julie Newmar, who plays this role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the governess proud of her talents and reprimands the careless and often typical behavior of Columbo with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Everyone accuses the other of murdering his uncle for money. Well, you'll just have to watch and see the result, but I can assure you that it's always worth looking at this one for the cast and the team.
