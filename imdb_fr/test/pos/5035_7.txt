I caught this movie on TV and watched it again. I thought, I have not watched this movie for a long time, so why not? And again, this film delighted me. It's so easy, so attractive and so human that I do not know why some people do not like it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta shines like Michael (his dance and every movement), an angel who can hardly be connected to this word. He smokes, drinks and eats like a savage, but he has a big heart. Along the way, Michael helps everyone he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) sings and finds a righteous man. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) has developed into a good and decent man. Michael even helped dear old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - this last scene is beautiful when they dance in the street. <br /> <br /> Travolta helped a lot the other actors. Andie MacDowell is so beautiful and friendly, William Hurt is great as usual, the late Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Jean Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good, but my favorite actor in this movie is Bob Hoskins as the owner of the tabloid. <br /> <br /> So here we have a solid film about people with a warm and attractive casting story. Do not take this film seriously and I can guarantee you that you will have fun.
