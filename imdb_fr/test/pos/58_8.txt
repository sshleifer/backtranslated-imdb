Superb editing, exceptional actor, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and extremely enjoyable soundtrack. This film dates back to the 1940s to comment on racial lifestyle differences and some desegregation effects while telling the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic woman. <br /> <br /> The actor representing the young character of Terrence Howard a wonderful work reflecting the life and times of his education in the small town of upstate New York. The audience laughed, cried and burst into applause for the film and its director. <br /> <br /> Soon on HBO (February 7, I believe) - launch TIVO and enjoy a great story!
