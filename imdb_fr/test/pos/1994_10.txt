David Cronenberg, like his colleague David Lynch, is an acquired taste. A director who plays with themes such as reality, perversion, sex, madness and death will inevitably get the most extreme reactions from the audience. He proved it with films such as The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (capital X, capital Z) and more recently, Spider. It is best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read too much on the plot, otherwise it will be ruined for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg takes you into the world of video games as a metaphor for any kind of escape behavior. Living fantasies is something people always dream about, but how far can we go, before reality is blurred and fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare? These are the topics discussed in eXistenZ, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies invaded by disease, and most importantly, reality itself. <br /> <br /> The story and the realization are excellent. Cronenberg is very knowledgeable about his craft and gives life to an artificial world by avoiding the usual pitfalls and clich√©s associated with such stories. The film shows some pretty disgusting stuff, but it's unusually unobtrusive in the gore department compared to Cronenberg's other works. The shock effects on which he plays are never excessive and the progression of the plot is very intelligent and creative. It's not the most intellectual movie of all time, but it will leave you thinking about it, amazed and confused. <br /> <br /> The acting game is also welcomed. The two protagonists, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their roles to perfection and intelligently describe the changing moods and identities of their characters. The dialogue may seem a little bland and sometimes clinical, but that's part of Cronenberg's desired effect: to create a disaffected and alien atmosphere that makes you very uncomfortable. Actors like Ian Holm, Don McKellar and Willem Dafoe, a particularly terrifying character, raise the film even higher with their disturbing interpretations. <br /> <br /> This film is a habit, but if you can appreciate its dark tone, bloody images and a distorted story existentially, you will love it.
