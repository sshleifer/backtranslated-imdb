I think this movie version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is actually quite good. It's certainly fun. Well, this is not a masterpiece like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (95), but it contains some very good things ... especially the setting of the city of Bath !!! ..The Royal Crescent, the Roman baths, the fascinating Georgian atmosphere .. It's excellent. If you're a fan of Bath like me, you'll love watching this movie! The performances may sound a little too "melodramatic", but I have the impression that this film, like the novel itself, deliberately mocks popular stories of romance and terror and the society of that time. The only drawback is probably the main female role, because I personally have another idea of ​​the physical appearance of Catherine Morland. The music is also a little "unusual" .. but strangely, I find it acceptable although it has nothing to do with the historical period described. I wonder what our dear old Jane would think ... :)
