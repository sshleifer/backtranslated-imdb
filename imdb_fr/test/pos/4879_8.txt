For those who have problems with naughty, crazy or annoying children, this is an essential program to watch. It's simply the best documentary program on behavior, not only for advice, but also for transformations. The very attractive Jo Frost is Supernanny. After fifteen years of experience in the nanny field, she now has a program where she shows a family where children behave very badly. Frost is the nanny who does not let children win. Every episode they have young kids who are crazy and very, very mean, for example. throwing objects, constantly swearing, hitting parents and relatives, and many other horrific experiences. But every episode at the end of the show, the kids are transformed by the parents (with the help of Frost) of little monsters into adorable kids. It's wonderful when the transformations are successful, Jo Frost is a great Supernanny. He has been named (twice) the National Television Award for the most popular reporting program. It was number 15 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. All right!
