We bought the DVD "Walking with Dinosaurs" and we are almost ecstatic about what we do so well. <br /> <br /> Many DVDs today offer the bare minimum ... the functionality itself, and perhaps another language (which will not help the viewer at all, but will allow the to see the DVD more easily in several markets). <br /> <br /> Not the case in the case of WWD. There are so many wonderful supplements and thoughtful thumbnails that even looking at the * navigation menu * is interesting. The intros of each chapter of the DVD "The Making Of" are funny to laugh. The quality of the sound and the video is excellent. And of course the story and the content ... what more can a dinosaur lover ask for? <br /> <br /> I watched most of the TDC version (commented by Avery Brooks), then watched about half of the DVD. (reported by Kenneth Branaugh). As far as I know, the broadcast version slipped into a number of terms mainly in American slang (ie, in a section on T. Rex's mating, Branugh says that "the woman is tired of "Men's Attention" and Brooks, "The Honeymoon is Over") and cut out some of the closest puppet work. I prefer the Branugh version simply because it is more complete. <br /> <br /> Overall, excellent value for money and exceptional production. Congratulations to the BBC and the crew who created this jewel.
