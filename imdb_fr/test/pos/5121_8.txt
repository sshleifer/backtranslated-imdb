This movie was not a good movie, but a good movie to do with your family, especially kids from 10 to 15 years old. There are good topics for discussion raised in this film, such as bullies, the environment and work to get things right. Jimmy Buffet's music was a plus, and the scenery was beautiful ... The young actors were excellent, and this is a movie I would expect to see on Family Channel or Hallmark Channel. Apart from a few words in the dialogue, a college could show this film to start class discussions. Hopefully this will be released this summer in Drive-ins so more people can see it. This followed Carl Hiassen's book well, and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance.
