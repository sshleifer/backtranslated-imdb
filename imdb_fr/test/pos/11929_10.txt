These movies just do not get the credit they deserve. This is my second favorite movie of all time, (Stand By Me being 1st.) The reason I watched this movie was because Wil Wheaton was there and he is my favorite character around the world and I think he did an amazing job this movie and Sean Astin too. In fact, I watched it last night and it just amazed me. Everything in the film is very exceptional. The script, the actors' game, the scenario. I was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mother was not in the room, I would be absolutely right every time Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I did not see it coming !! At all!! I was really surprised to learn that it was not really popular in the '90s. I was born a few years after it was released, so of course I did not go to theaters, but I would surely have if I had been alive. If one of my friends was watching this, he would say "uh okay?" but it's just because they're not cool enough to enjoy a job like this. If you have not seen this movie, or if you want to watch something that is the bomb, it's the movie you can watch.
