UNCONDITIONAL LOVE is surprisingly entertaining. Although the plot may unfold in too many directions, making it a movie too long, it never fails to seduce and to please. The many intrigues, one of which is warmly reminiscent of SHIRLEY VALENTINE, offer many smiles, laughter, wisdom and tenderness. All of this should not work, and sometimes it certainly goes ahead, but forgive its inconsistencies, sit back and have a good time. It's a charmer!
