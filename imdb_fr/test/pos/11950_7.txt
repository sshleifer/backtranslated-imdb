This is the next creation of Better Off Dead. In a competition, Better Off Dead would win hands down. But for the power of the stars, One Crazy Summer surpasses the best scenario of Savage Steve. Problems with One Crazy Summer (OCS): casting. Better Off Dead (BOD) was so much better presented. Friendship: OCS shows that Cusack casts a hateful look at Bill Murray's younger brother. Problem on the board ?? More scandalous friends in OCS, but more sincere friends in BOD. Land was good. You predict some of it, but even the predictable parts go further than you think. So, even if it's the ugly sister-in-law of Better Off Dead, it's worth a look. See Demi Moore before plastic surgery if for no other reason. John Cusack fans, you have to see it, just to say that you have it. If you do not like Bobcat Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I do not like it either, but you can not escape it in this one. At least he does a great job in the movie by paying tribute to another movie monster. The fixture needed some help on the beach, but in most cases there is not much to complain about. Overall, it's good and fun. But try not to compare it to BOD or you'll find it missing. *sigh*
