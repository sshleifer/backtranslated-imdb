I saw this film for the first time on IFC. Which is an excellent network to see underground movies. I watched this film and thought it would be pure drama and a story that does not hold water. But it was really worth watching. The main character is in such a rough shape, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you can not hate him. His dedication to the Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and helplessness. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film is also excellent. Sometimes, we feel like we see what he sees, feel what he feels in certain situations. This movie does not leave you wanting to know more, or not liking a flaw in the plot. There is no escape (in my opinion). I have always been a fan of foreign films, especially now that movies are poorly made in America. I really enjoy foreign environments because I feel like it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand a different culture. This movie made me all these things and more. Please watch this movie and if you are new to foreign films, it's a good start.
