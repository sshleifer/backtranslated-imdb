This documentary is as unique as its subject. And while D'Amato's movie was erotic, the film manages to show some decent clips of movies you may remember from the end of the night, Cinemax ... A problem ... Joe was doing hardcore porn sometimes mixed with softcore eroticism, even mixed in his gore movies. The gore movies are cult classics, costing around US $ 20 for a dubbed copy on the net (no peanuts for 20-year-old movies, people.) I want to see why these are cult classics. Also, as nice as Joe seems (he seemed more stylish than you'd expect), the guy liked to shock. "Caligula: The Untold Story" and "Emanuelle in America" ​​show us hardcore rape, snuff and bestiality (in both cases, you'd be surprised how far it goes in "Caligula II" with this one, if you can locate an uncut copy.) While these scenes may be disturbing in a documentary about a people's career, hey, he did it ... Also, I would have liked to see more of interviews of people that Joe worked with ... Maybe that's just what I want to see what Laura Gemser looks like these days ... I still think she's a goddess and the one of the sexiest women of all time.
