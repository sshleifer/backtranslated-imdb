"The wind and the lion" is a very good adventure movie taking place in the deserts of Africa. <br /> <br /> El Raisuli (Sean Connery), head of an Arab tribe kidnapped An American woman (Candice Bergen) and her two children will get concessions for her country from US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). John Milius gets a very complete and nice film in the genre. <br /> <br /> The outdoor dessert locations, an impressive color photograph, very well-managed action sequences and perfect settings make the epic film with an undeniable sense of grandeur. The score is also remarkable. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is very good as an Arab leader and proves that he can handle almost all types of roles. This is the case of Candice Bergen as a woman who shows strength in dangerous circumstances but who is afraid deep down and has weaknesses; she can admire Connery and even understand her totally different interest in life, which stems from their completely different cultures. Brian Keith plays one of the best roles he has ever had as US President Teddy Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> This is a very good cinematographic sample of the genre. Give it a chance, you will not regret it.
