An excellent thriller thriller whose role is first-rate and intrigue prevents you from guessing. This well-interpreted and directed film is based on a true story and is worthwhile while Joe Penny is extremely well-up and Ann Gillian is convincing as a worried and terrified sister. Joe proves once again that he is good at playing and that his end is well done. It is worth watching. I hope they will repeat it soon on any channel. I will definitely save it. For fans of Penny and Gillian, it's worth it. Rent it if you can even better try to buy it. Perfect thriller for the early 90's, watch this movie <br /> <br /> it's great.
