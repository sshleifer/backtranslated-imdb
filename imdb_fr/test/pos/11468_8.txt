I found this film enjoyable and interesting to watch, and I'm surprised it's so low. In fact, I can see why. I guess it's the fans of Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano who gave most of the 1s and 2s, because if you put the tape in the machine hoping to look at something with one or the other of both, you may be a little disappointed. Eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the film and Alyssa about 5 scenes in the second half. In these, she speaks little and wears less (although never naked if that's what you're looking for, stay with the vampire's hug). Even if they are still a pleasure, it is a pity that she, or Eric, does not get much time in front of the screen but I'm still a 8. <br /> <br />
