It looks like a Czech version of Pearl Harbor. He has the same story, the two guys fall in love with the same woman. And add to the twist, the woman is actually a married woman whose husband has been missing for a year. I do not think the scenario is too strong. The young man is pretty naughty, it's cute. It made me watch because of emotional music and pleasant scenes one after the other. It also has strong visual special effects. Better yet, love stories are perfectly integrated into the story. <br /> <br /> I think if it were in English, it would be such a big blow in all states. It is unfortunate that few people are open to foreign cinema.
