This film sets the standard for all rock biopics to follow. He achieved this through the energetic performances of the main actors, the regularity of the work of the camera (avoiding the "video rock" clich√©s invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as a human being rather than a symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot and incidental details that are a bit useless, and there will always be a debate between the families of those personally involved with the details. But the problem here, as in the much more recent film "I walk the Line" or the famous Elpent biopic on TV Elvis of Carpenter, is whether the meaning of the artist's life, in his day and his Instead, as a catalyst of fan ideals and appreciation, is manifested in performance, and this is clearly the case here. We leave this film not only understanding how Buddy Holly became a star, but also why. I do not see what we could expect from the film.
