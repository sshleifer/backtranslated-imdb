I saw it when it came out for the first time and have seen it many times since. I have the DVD This is one of the best works by Drew Barrymore, which deserves to be seen more than once. <br /> <br /> Not being popular in high school was one of the things I could talk about in the movie. I was not as tortured as Josie (at the time of his high school) or as Aldys, but I've never been one to party. The graduation party scene was one of the three popular girls who were victims of their own joke while Josie pushed Aldys (the intended victim) as my favorite scene and I applauded her for the first time. <br /> <br /> I can still watch this movie today. it's excellent.
