I was impressed by the story. There was the "typical" gay male predator and the "typical" Mormon missionary. But they also have friends and family members who have balanced their lives well. There are a number of characters, some nice and some less, each with their own personality. And most reminded me of people in my life. <br /> <br /> The story begins with several humorous moments and slowly evolves into a relationship film that warms the heart. The story progresses without obvious plot and never speaks to you. This makes you think a little while waiting to see what happens. Even when I thought I could plan something, I was surprised how it happened. <br /> <br /> Few movies make me laugh knowingly during a real gay dialogue, then make me cry the pain of the characters. I watched the movie on DVD and could not stop watching until it was over. (Usually, I watch a movie in pieces for several days.) It's nice to see a movie with homosexual characters edifying, but not a preacher. I highly recommend this movie! And not only for the gay public. Relationships transcend sexuality.
