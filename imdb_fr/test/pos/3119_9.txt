Most of us, children who grew up in the 40s or 50s, were Western devotees, but it was a man who had escaped me until I saw the Movies for Men channel today . I loved the film's history, the cinematography, as well as the superb cast of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. in the lead roles, as well as Ward Bond, still reliable. Apparently, this film was the inspiration of the last TV series 'Wagon Train', in which Bond once again represented the role of the boss of wagon trains heading west. Johnson steals the movie with his riding skills and it's nice to see an actor doing his own stunts as Ben does in this movie. Other notable personalities include the charming Joanne Dru as Denver and the first non-English speaking role of James Arness, later known for his role as Marshal Matt Dillon in "Gunsmoke". If you like movies like this, you can not not like this one.
