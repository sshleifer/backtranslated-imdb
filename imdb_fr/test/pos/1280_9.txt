It is an interesting exercise to attend the first works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision of hindsight, you can see the wheels and wheels that make these people what they are. Below, one of those looks at Christopher Nolan's past, one of today's biggest storytellers. <br /> <br /> The style of realization of Christopher Nolan puts a lot of emphasis on the production of the story. Although people may complain that it's too much of a lag, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses this technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most complicated story I've ever seen. Reduce the hardened cynics who say it's an old piece of meat wrapped in an elegant salad dressing. Memento shows how even the simplest stories can be turned into uncontrollable thoughts. The Prestige, which was considerably reduced in comparison, was still creative in the way its three stories were intertwined. Even in a company as jaded as the Batman series, Christopher Nolan sprinkled some of his remarkable weaving threads, breathing new life into the Dark Knight. see a dilettante writer, who becomes a reluctant voyeur, who becomes an unconscious accomplice of various minor crimes and finally sees an end that no one could have expected. Having never heard of the rest, I did not know what to expect. At every moment, the film let me guess where he was leading me. Since the angle of the mystery was clear, I was constantly trying to understand what would happen next. And that's where I think the film was so successful. The film contains many elements that led me to many pursuits in wild goose hunting. <br /> <br /> The film is entirely black and white and is articulated in several times, both considered fanciful nowadays. Follow all this in the least formulated or artificial way possible. There does not seem to be any reason for the story to be told as it is, but you do not feel like you're driving. It is this lack of pretension or self-conscious arrogance that makes this style of storytelling work. Highly recommended!
