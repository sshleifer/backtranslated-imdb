I must admit that at first I was worried about Farscape. The opening segment was not very strong and I started to worry about what was coming. However, once settled on Henson's territory, he mastered the sense of humor, the unique and persistent characters and the fascinating story, to create an excellent science fiction article. The story follows John Crichton (played by Ben Browder), a scientist who has developed a spacecraft and a theory based on sling propulsion. However, during the first test, his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field and he is propelled into an unknown galaxy, where he finds himself in the middle of a fight between fleeing prisoners (on the Moya ship) and the Peacekeepers (forces of the order). . He is literally dragged into the prisoners' ship and finds himself after many twists (Ka D'argo, warrior of Luxom, Pa'U Zhaan, a priestess of Delvian, Rygel XVI, a fallen ruler, and Aeryn Sun, a soldier of the peace that joined the crew reluctantly). With excellent special effects, moderate makeup, puppets and robots that exceed the Henson perfection standard; In addition to a well-written storyline and character-centric plot, FarScape seems to be an incredibly original, creative and intelligent science fiction series.
