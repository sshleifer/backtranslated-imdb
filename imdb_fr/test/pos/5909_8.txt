Billy Wilder has created a somewhat conventional biopic on the Charles Lindberg flight. He structures the film using flashbacks to tell the story of Lindberg leading to the famous flight across the Atlantic, which is currently happening in the film. Flying in an airplane hour after hour is not an excitement, and Wilder is not going to deviate from his Lindberg theme as a hero of the common man, so things are predictable. However, James Stewart is well interpreted and quite credible as Lindberg, and the many obstacles he has to overcome to get his plane in the air make us watched. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds very well when Wilder assembles the parts of the story in such a way as to create a tension, then a relief, then a new tension. The cinematography is pretty good, the Franz Waxman score enhances the scenes and Stewart seems to really give life to Lindberg, making him think he could be Lindberg. There is a bit of religious schmaltz from the 1950s to the end, but overall, the direction, the actors and the high production values ​​exceed the predictability of the story (would anyone REALLY see this image and can not it be that Lindberg has crossed the Atlantic?) a pleasant film that has aged better than most films of that time. Billy Wilder has shot a wide variety of films, and this film is representative of his best craftsman.
