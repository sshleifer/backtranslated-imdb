What do you get when you have a seasoned French police inspector named Maurice Martineau called to solve a murder case? Well, just a very fun and funny movie. The reshaped black and white film "Quai des Orfevres" delivers the goods despite the romanticism, jealousy and marriage that seem to stand in the way of the truth about "who did it?" <br /> <br /> Step by step, technical after technique seasoned with experience and intuition, the patience of this master-inspector has remained etched in the truth - but of course, with the help of a bag filled with police interrogation tricks. <br /> <br /> Martineau is the centerpiece of this film. The use by Henri-Georges Clouzot of the hoarse background music to intensify the drama in the style of the big black films gives a wonderful rendering to the visual experience. <br /> <br /> Martineau ends up solving the mystery and stops the culprit. Hey, he's good !! But alas, Martineau can also keep a dark secret in his past. Who is this boy who may not be his son? <br /> <br /> Some things can never be solved - even beyond the end credits.
