I have watched this film countless times and have never failed to be charmed by its simplicity, sincerity and kindness. Great interpretations by all the actors and the charming little steam trains that play such an important support role. I admit that I fell in love with Roberta in 1970 and that she still touches me today. Presented on TV in New Zealand on Christmas Day, the best gift I could have had.
