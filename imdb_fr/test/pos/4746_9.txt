Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood, but who is it? The Seven-Ups is one of the best cop movies, even today, and is only preceded by McQueen's Bullitt and Dirty Harry series, which is not a bad company. There are three things that seem to make a good cop movie: a credible storyline with great acting, great car chase scenes and heavy action scenes. This film has all three and the scene of the car chase is better than that of Dirty Harry. Scheider heads a group of police officers to get the bad guys in New York to be sentenced to seven years or more; hence the name Seven-Ups. Overall, not quite up to Dirty Harry or Bullitt but much better than all the cop movies since the Dirty Harry series. 9/10.
