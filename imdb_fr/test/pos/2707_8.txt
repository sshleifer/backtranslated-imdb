The story of Karen Carpenter shows a little more about the complex life of singer Karen Carpenter. Cynthia Gibb (Karen interpreter) was not a good election. She's a good actress, but she plays a very naughty and silly Karen Carpenter. I think the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. <br /> <br /> The role of Agnes Carpenter in Louise Fletcher is fantastic, she does a great job as Karen's mother. <br /> <br /> It contains great songs that could have been included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately, this was not the case, even though this film was at the top of the list in the United States and several other countries.
