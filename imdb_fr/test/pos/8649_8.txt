At first, with its neat and remote location and its sweeking metal sound, I was thinking of the opening scene of "Once Upon a Time in the West". When he arrives at the city, then he begins to feel like "cooking stories", or "drifting clouds", possibly even "Grimm". <br /> <br /> Then it turns out that it looks more like "Joe Versus the Volcano" in the theme (no style). And the movie runs from beginning to end with the same discreet style. Allow you to observe and perceive the steel, the greyish blue of the suites, the dresses, the color of the walls, the furniture, the sheets, the mirrors, the cars, the music, the background noise and even the expression of people. Then, towards the end, you'll see a completely different tone: warm orange-yellow, soft music and splashing ocean, kids and laughs. <br /> <br /> But the observation may be too long for me. much more to see the alternative side or what happens to the character after the final shot. Still beautifully done.
