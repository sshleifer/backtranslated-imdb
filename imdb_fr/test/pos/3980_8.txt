That's what films should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without all the women in the cast show her breasts, biting without resorting to "bombs" all the lines. I have seen Justin Long appear in many movies in recent years. I thought with the role he could play. (Mac commercials do not hold up.) This movie might put it on a fast track to list A. The other cast members have also done their job perfectly. It's an excellent little movie with a beautiful message. (But you do not need to buy the message to have a good time.) Lewis Black is, as usual, hilarious, and Blake Lively is a new beauty. <br /> <br /> Take a few hours and watch this movie, they will not have been wasted.
