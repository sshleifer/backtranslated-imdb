Four friends were first announced at HBO in '82 as a sleep success. Having heard about "sleeper" at age 14, at the time, I was eager to see one. (!) Boy - I was surprised! This film! Apart from TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, I did not really fall in love with a special effects movie - let alone a hippie movie ... but I grew up with two hippies - I understood the power of Mr Penn's film. FOUR FRIENDS is truly unique. The script is so nice - and this casting !!! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor SO as well! He simply personifies the "type of writer" on a T-shirt - both intelligent and clumsy (the scene at the window ...) and strong but yet very vulnerable. For me, it captures what it's like to be caught with agirl and it lasts more than a decade ... and I've always found solace in the character - and in the movie. During the 1980s, FOUR FRIENDS was a criminal partner for me - and I caught the movie whenever I could on HBO - even though I had to stay awake until 5am! And always, always in the end - there is a sense of loss when all these wonderful characters separate from the viewers on the beach. Jodi Thelen personifies "this girl" thoroughly - it's so hard not to be charmed by her. This film really stands the test of time. From time to time, I watch my video ... or I show a friend ... and this still causes a strong reaction. I have known women who fall in love with Georgia! So many levels ..! Just an incredible little piece of humanity from the 60s. Very special, very magical. I recently discovered Robert Grossbach's FOUR FRIEND NOVELIZATION - and it's even more detailed than the movie! Current dates of events, etc. A real find! And what's more - haha ​​- I found the novel flipping through a used bookstore ... in Omaha, NE of ALL places !!! I guess you must have an eye for her! When I was in Los Angeles in '92, I was working as an extra - I walked into a memorabilia shop - and there was a ton of film stills !!! Unfortunately - I was broke and I could not give myself up ... but damn it, those photos of Georgia and all the guys are coming through me! I met director Joe Sergant on the set of SKYLARK in Emporia, KS in the summer of '92 ... and we talked about FOUR FRIENDS - very cool! Also ... working in a video store in Omaha in '98 - was waiting for a woman who was a relative of Jim Metzler ..! She told him to let people know that there was a child in Omaha who was just fanatical about the film - and who had made the most of it. Once again - the film captures everything that is in the heart of Danilo's character ... excellent, excellent work - one of the most beautiful efforts of MM. Tesich and Penn. Steve Tesich we miss a lot. An incredible writer. "Isadora Duncan !!!" <br /> <br /> - C.
