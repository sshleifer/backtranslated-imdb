To speak relatively, if only we could now see now "Pixote" by Hector Babenco (1981, Brazil, pronounced as "pi-shot"), after seeing a lot of films about street children, young delinquents, children in difficulty (Truffaut's "Les 400 coups", Bunuel's "Los Olvidados", De Sica's "Shoeshine", "Salaam, Bombay! De Nair", "Mouchette" by Bresson, "Sheet on a pillow", etc.) it might be feared that the tragic fate of the boy described in the film could no longer affect one, because it had already been "demetallized" after crossing the emotional roller coaster ride set by the aforementioned films. <br /> <br /> Fortunately. , This will not be the case. Because Babenco tells his film in such a practical way ("without artifice", as a film critic says, in a positive light) and that his principal interpreter, Fernando Ramos da Silva (13 years at the time) and a child of the street itself), gives such a no-nonsense, hurt, crude performance in its simplicity (that hardened face, those solitary, eager eyes) that it's hard not to be pierced in any way. (Such a feeling can reach such realism when one learns that the child has lived only a short life, after being involved in street crimes after the film and then murdered.) <br /> < Towards the first half of the film, Pixote and his fellow street children and delinquents spend their time in a state-run repressive reform school, where brutality and humiliation, rape and murder are the norm and culture, where they are forced to confess their "crimes", on the weak notion that under Brazilian law, juvenile criminals are not "punishable" for their offenses. For these children, the dubious freedom offered by the streets is preferable to the harsh rehabilitations provided by these supposedly well-intentioned authorities. In the walls of this so-called protective establishment, these young souls will soon discover that the love and attention of the parental figures are also untraceable, if not to a worse degree. <br /> <br /> (For Pixote, the only form of escape comes from the blown grass and glue secretly enclosed inside the reformer.) <br /> <br /> When children rush into a small-scale "revolt" to finally express and realize their collective desire to return to the outside world - their "home" - the intensity and form are of such a nature that we can not prevent thinking of the revolt of schoolchildren in Jean Vigo's influential "Zero for Conduct". Only in "Pixote", the "uprising" should appear at the level of the gutters. <br /> <br /> Once Pixote and his small group are back on the street (second half of the movie), they launch into theft, pimping and drug trafficking to fend for themselves, along where they meet Sueli, a whore, but benevolent prostitute. Sueli readily welcomes the four lost souls, so that she leaves her clients stolen and provides more than maternal care (at least to one of the children). <br /> <br /> thought that the street children had finally found the person who could provide them with the love and warmth they so badly needed. But, however doubtful the freedom these streets give to the streets, this new "maternal figure" found again can not remain forever. <br /> <br /> Jealousy, quarrels, differences and murder only differentiated children - and for good. And during this defining scene where Pixote, driven by the circumstances, must shoot not only at Sueli's arrogant American client, but also at his street mate Ditto (more than a son of Sueli), he then literally returns to "childhood". aspires from the right breast of the disoriented woman, and then materializes her persistent desire for parental affection, the image itself both sad and disturbing. <br /> <br /> It is so that Sueli, in a probable return to his "senses", repel lamentably Pixote of his "nurturing" position and rejects it, for good. Thus, in a gently heartbreaking moment, Pixote, with his young and old face and his sullen eyes (not entirely different, though in a different context, from the young boy's face in the terrible "Come and See" of Elem Klimov) , get up, put on his coat and take his weapon (yes, a weapon!), and leave for nowhere, walking along the railway and with morning light starting to appear. With this scene, Babenco could well pay tribute (among many others in different movies!) To the final iconoclastic scene of "The 400 moves" of Truffaut. <br /> <br /> But as we learned to know what happened to Antoine Doinel three years later in the short film "Antoine et Colette" (as well as in three other feature films the following years), we are left in the dark about the future of Pixote after his final disappearance from the last image, this is the last time we will see this street child of real life (notwithstanding the fate that will finally be reserved). <br /> <br /> "Pixote" may not be nearly as fanciful as "Les 400 coups" or as hallucinatory as "Los Olvidados", but it still stands out among themed films and similar texture because of its simple and crude power.
