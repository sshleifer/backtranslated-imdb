I have to admit it's one of the few Lou Costello films I've seen at the theater. Most have already been seen on T.V. and I must admit that Lou is really nice and he has the girl too. It was the first time I saw Dorothy Provine play and of course, I fell in love with her like so many others that day. I saw most of the work she did and appreciated each one. His performance in The Great Race is one of the reasons I bought the record in the first place! <br /> <br /> Every commentary on this film tells that it is the film that Lou Costello did with Bud Abbott, It's true, but if Lou had lived, he would have done a lot more. He does a really good job and does not have to rely on his old routines to laugh. I'm sorry Patterson's little man, N.J. I did not have a chance to do it. <br /> <br /> I hope this will be released on DVD a little longer so I can add it to my comedy / science fiction collection.
