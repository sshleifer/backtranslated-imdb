Although it may seem a bit odd to see a 32-year-old woman play the role of a 12-year-old, Mary Pickford soon makes you forget the incongruities and simply enjoy the fun. <br /> <br /> Mary is a street kid in New York, with her adorable gang of mistreators, whose attention is held by the oldest, William Haines (he was 25 years old at the time and was just about to become his own star.) <br /> Giving too much of the plot would not be right. It goes without saying that Mary is very entertaining to watch and amply shows why she was the first and most expensive Hollywood superstar. The production values ​​are very good, with many extras making the New York street scenes quite believable.
