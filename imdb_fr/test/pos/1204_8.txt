The first time I saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving him and everything. 13 years later, I'm now 17 and I decided to watch it about a month ago because I'm taking a 1960s class at school. I did not really know what to expect because it had been 13 years since I last saw it, but it really blew me away. The actors were incredible, the music was so much fun, and now I find myself singing with each song. Treat Williams is awesome like Berger, the "leader" of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants, one way or another (except at the very end, of course). John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, the recruited from Oklahoma fell in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is adorable as a primitive and rich girl who rebels against her education and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just adorable as Jeannie, the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good like Woof and Hud, the other two band members, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays the role of Hud's fianc√©e, has an incredible voice. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie, though, is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are almost never shown together, and when they are, they fight (do you remember the lean diving scene?). It looks like their relationship is very weak and at the end of the film, we are supposed to believe that they are madly in love, only on the basis of the few meetings they had. I also see that many people who write reviews here are upset by the PG rating of this movie. Personally, I would increase the score to a PG-13, only because there is drug use ... but remember that in 1979, PG-13 did not exist. I do not think that nudity is bad, that it is not sexual (in fact, there is no real sex in this film), and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains . In most European countries, nudity is not considered bad and I do not see why it is here in the United States. Anyway, I give a high rating to this film, and I'm glad it was done at the time, because in today's incredibly "politically correct" world, they would not even think to do it, and even if they did, would be a very "diluted" version, and I'm sure you will not get the full effect. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it's a very underrated film that really deserves to be watched.
