Maybe people like to have the devil more than God. Maybe we like this safety net of a reason; to make a mistake only to blame the devil for the pain and suffering in the world. There are so many difficulties spreading among the masses that it is difficult not to see the sadness on the faces of all those you pass. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all of this. he knows that maybe everything will not go well and that maybe helping someone to leave this Earth to avoid the pain their life has to wait for him is a risk he has to take for someone he loves. Director / scriptwriter / director Matthew Ryan Hoge has the merit of creating a lyrical prose on two suburban families that have crossed between good and bad weather. Just watching the cast of almost every actor on the A and B lists shows that the material really resonates with its audience. Emotions do not need to be worn on the sleeve to exist. Sometimes all we want to do is put an end to the suffering. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling brings a discrete performance to the table that encompasses the inner emotions of his character, Leland. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man who goes through the BS of life, knows what he sees and accepts the worst with the best. The film is a catharsis for the souls of those who were touched by the terrible event where Leland killed the brother of his ex-girlfriend suffering from mental disorders. In the confused mind of this teenager, he enters the incident, knowing very well what he was going to do, he was going to stop the pain he sees everywhere, but especially on the face of the young Ryan Pollard. Almost immediately, he realizes that he has made a mistake, that playing God may not be a job for which he was put on Earth. Whether true or not, it will soon be debated as the assassination begins a series of events that will finally give meaning to the lives of many people as they realize the tangential fragility of life. This boy opened his eyes to grief and rebirth. <br /> <br /> The haunted ballads sung by former Sunny Day Real Estate leader Jeremy Enigk, the film describes a journey of small vignettes of the lives of two families in the aftermath of tragedy. The acting is superb with a special mention for a few. For those who play the na√Øve leg in most movies, Chris Klein is doing well with the same material here, but also with an evolution in a man of words. His distant attitude is effective when used in the right wing, similar to his success in the elections, and I am interested to see if the directors will allow him to expand his talents and to cling to something more substantial . Jena Malone is effective to the same extent, playing the role of troubled youth as in Donnie Darko and The House Life; Don Cheadle is a pillar of professionalism that gives us a different look at the compassionate therapist from the one he did at Manic; and Martin Donovan is brilliant as a grieving father trying to keep his mind healthy and finally realizing that he needs to prevent his family from falling apart as well. It's also a pleasure to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn in a small but important role. <br /> <br /> When tragedy strikes, people gather to get through. As Leland astutely pointed out at one point, you see men and women helping others and hugging them when they see the pain and suffering around them, but after two days everything is back to normal . The character of Cheadle takes up the optimistic view that we have at least a glimpse of the true nature of people who want to help and be good to each other, only to be blamed with the reply, "at least we do during a tragedy. " Maybe we do not want to think that we are in a good mood, because it gives us the feeling that we should be good all the time, and that when they are bad, they should be supposed to be good. By being defective, we allow ourselves to bounce back and try again. Leland's mistake allows him to see the love he has for his loved ones and open the eyes of others so that they wake up and do not allow their loved ones to move further away from them. We can not focus on the sadness of others when they first have to take charge. Hoge has designed a parable for this and a really effective movie production with, hopefully, many more to come.
