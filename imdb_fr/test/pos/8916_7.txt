If you are looking for an erotic masterpiece, that's not it. If you're looking for a comic masterpiece, that's not it. If you're looking for something hardcore, that's not it. <br /> <br /> That said, if you are looking for an example of the art of European erotic comedy from the early 1970s, that's it. <br /> <br /> I see a lot of people complaining about the quality, thank you for understanding that it was made in 1974. Yes, women do not comply with the modern ideal of attractiveness. They are not ugly women, but they do not have the same looks as those idealized in our silicone culture. Yes, the dubbing is not great, but they speak German and anyone who speaks German will understand that it is quite difficult to double a word of 12 syllables. <br /> <br /> If you have already seen the DVD before the last release, it is marketed with 2 covers of adult stars of the 80s and recently 90s. The film is a type R movie, so those who complain hardcore should be aware, the film is edited from the original movie BUT it was also mounted before its passage in the drive-in parks of the late 1970s. <br /> <br /> J I saw this film for the first time as a young man and judging by some of the comments, there are many in the same boat who had a glimpse of Cinemax. Many people get angry when later in life, this does not correspond to their previous memories. This is understandable considering the noise and nudity in today's eroticism. <br /> <br /> If you compare 2069 to a modern erotic comedy, you might be disappointed. The film, though bizarre, is actually quite fluid and the jokes, usually implied and two-way, still hold and can still make you laugh. If you compare it to a hardcore movie, you will be even more disappointed than today, you see very little. <br /> <br /> It's still one of the best examples with European Erotic Bottoms Up and The Other Cinderella from the 1970s.
