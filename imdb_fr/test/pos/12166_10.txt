This little court fascinates me absolutely. <br /> <br /> The only thing I've seen so far is part of the work of Sam Brakhage, the creator of Dog Star Man. However, where Brakhage tries to get excited by "making us relearn to see" and exposing us to an affront of headaches inducing bright colors and lightning (which I continue to dig and embrace like a great art ... I would call it a very relaxing and mesmerizing movie. Man Ray's general use of spinning objects / cameras does not create so much a stunned feeling, but a flow of warm sensations that mingle and go hand in hand with the gravity of the moving world around us. <br /> An interesting idea. During this very short work, the objects become more and more recognizable until we find ourselves on a naked torso (which I feel is the least female feminine breast I know). The circles and spirals of shadow and light on the torso make it an object of surreal beauty, something you can hang on your wall and search forever. It was because of this and other images of this film that I had to watch it again and again (seven times in total) just because it fascinated me quite. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
