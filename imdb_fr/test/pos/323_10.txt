It pays to watch Reader's Digest. Or Time, if it's the original source of the article that served as Mani Ratnam's alleged inspiration for making this masterpiece. Based on the true story of an adoptive girl who searches for her biological parents, Ratnam draws a classic that rivals as much as he chides, cherishes as much as he punishes and preaches as much as it is practiced. <br /> <br /> Where do we start? The threatening gloom that precedes new conflicts in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family led by an engineer-author in embers and 3 adorably naughty children? Or this troubled region where reality does not allow a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredulous and sinister events and ideologies? No matter how you look at it, this film deserves to be in your collection, if you like the fascinating dramas of Mani Ratnam. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ratnam is a former master who has mixed fictional stories with real incidents. In this film, he is classy by adapting two stories of real life into one. I will not go into history because it is better seen than read. But what I'm going to insist on is the impact it has had on me and the reason why, despite all the climate of war that is unfolding in this world, it can not destroy this simple yet inexhaustible force. called hope. <br /> <br /> Innocence, in its purity, can not understand the complex desires of adult decadence and greed. Neither does he recognize the perils when he is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what he wants. It is an innocence of this nature that drives Amudha to seek out her biological parents, despite warnings that they might be lost in the cauldron of civil war. After surviving a terrorizing experience of conversing with a man with a physical disability to realize that he is a more deadly disguised entity, Amudha focuses on his cause in a way that destroys the resistance of his supporters. And finally, when the two men meet, mother and daughter, the meeting is so tense that even the capricious adoptive father is reduced to tears. The following scene, helped by a coruscating partition of A R Rahman, is moving to melt even the hearts of hearts: list of questions that Amudha must ask his biological mother. It is a culmination as dramatic as the series of incidents that led to it: a child discovers his mother, alive in her body but lost in spirit. Realizing overwhelmingly that she has no hope of staying with the one who is bothering her, Amudha makes her adoptive mother what the title of this film means: a kiss on the cheek. <br /> <br /> Regarding the cast, the brilliant PS Keerthana paved the way. Mr. Ratnam has the gift of extracting spectacular performances from little-known child artists, but that should not take away from Keerthana for an award-winning performance. Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and the formidable Nandita Das (Shyama), she embellishes the scene in almost every frame where she is. The music may not be as memorable as Rahman's other offerings, but that does not stop him from winning another national award for best musical direction. "Vellai Pookal" is as much an ode to the need to cherish human life as it is to nature. The dialogues are first class (example of the moving exchange that Amudha and Indira have on the swing, shortly after the revelation that she is not the biological daughter of Indira) and cinematography, superb. <br /> <br /> This film is clear statement to drop the weapons as much as to respect life and human expressions. Do not judge it as a movie lesson; you will only lose the experience of one of the best in Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman.
