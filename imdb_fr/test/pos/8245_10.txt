In my opinion, the film is an excellent example of the realities of war and a tribute to the soldiers of all the nations who fought and bled in the ground, Gallipoli. The absence of violence in no way affected the scale of the story. He is honest, true and courageous, just like the men who fought and died at the Hellespont. The absence of brutal representations of violence is fair and appropriate. These men have suffered enough for freedom, the right to self-determination in a free and better world. They never wanted to see such a scene again. This is the legacy of the Gallipoli event. It is better not to show the scenes of free pyro-techniques, blood and blood to preserve the respect of the fighters of this crucible of the nation. <br /> <br /> This film pays tribute to the magnificence of men fighting for their lives, with honor, courage, dignity and irrepressible spirit and humor in the face of terrible adversity. This movie is not interested in making a show for fools to cheer them on. The brutal results resulting from these men's personal fights are not one thing that those who have survived have always wanted to see on an entertainment screen. They saw enough at the time and would have preferred never to have seen it at first and never want to see such scenes on a screen called "entertainment". The brutal horrors of the reality of Gallipoli's fierce struggles were scenes that haunted their hours of sleep and sleep for the rest of their lives. It was the painful internal scars they carried inside their graves, men of all those nations who had fought. They all fought and many died despite everything. In one way or another, these men with powerful hearts managed to laugh under the blows of the constant fear of death, because they did not want to insult their companions if they were not ready to die. The game is Australasian for the brave, but it applies to a greater or lesser degree to all the fighters, but the boy has learned that Johhny Turk was a player as brave, as brave as you would wish for a soldier. be. <br /> <br /> The ANZAC and the Turks were fighting for a place on the world stage and, from 25/04/15, their respective demands for equality in the nation became known and are undeniable for this world. The director has created a masterpiece that truly honors the spirit and memory of these soldiers and reminds future generations of all ages. Children can be taken without fear of frightening them in the name of visual "horror". It's morbid and useless. And children should watch this film to learn what happened on this sacred shore before they were born. So that they can remember. For it is the nature of men, whom they soon forget.
