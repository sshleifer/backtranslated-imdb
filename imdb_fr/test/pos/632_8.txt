I do not know how this movie has gone so long unnoticed. <br /> <br /> I saw this film on television, I flipped through the channels and I came across this amazingly well done movie. I missed the first, probably, 10 minutes, but it does not matter. This film literally grabbed me, it's a real thrill. The presence of well-known actors in the film adds to the effect, you do not know what to expect actors because they are new. You never know when they will be killed or what they will do. it is therefore all the more tense. Although there are many new faces, their performances were first class. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers are playing with your mind, revealing just enough gore to make the rest imagine. Shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also highlighted by the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Well-written situations, fast camera movements, dressed-up edits and superb direction make it an excellent thriller thriller. This film in fact switches between genres - thriller of horror and suspense, leaving the viewer indifferent and energized. No doubt comparable to Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I could not even move from the TV, even during commercial breaks. I was the helpless witness to this wonderful movie.
