This film about low budget crocodiles really delivers the goods. The fact that it is inspired by real events would make little sense if you ended up with a fake crocodile, a bad C.G.I. or an obvious studio setting. Fortunately, none of the above is involved in this fantastic and very realistic film. The crocodile is real, there is no IGC, and the shooting takes place in a real Australian marsh. The actors were obviously inspired to create the most realism possible in their performances, and they succeeded. You can put yourself in their difficult situation, which proves how "black water" realistically translates into entertainment. Highly recommended. - MERK
