The film, although not faithful to the original novels, manages to create a modern Gothic vision of vampires. Someone tried to insult QotD by calling him a one-and-a-half hour video clip. In fact it is a complement. The omnipresent gothic music combined with music video-like sequences have made the movie so depressing - and "Queen of the Damned" is a mood-inspired story. <br /> <br /> I do not understand hardcore fans who complain about the changes in the story. The plot has been changed to be less confusing for viewers who do not know novels. The number of characters has been reduced and I have no problem changing creators or skipping the character of Mekare. The biggest change - the romance of Lestat and Jesse - seemed to me a very nice addition. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow, dark atmosphere, perfect for nineteenth-century New Orleans and Louis' anguish, would not match the rebellion of Lestat and his music. And although the book can be slow, descriptive and combining many elements while transmitting it well, the film just can not do it without becoming chaotic. "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Damned" can be divided into at least three films - the creators had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some of the special effects, like flying or going out of flames were the only thing I did not really like in this movie. But Akasha's death was very beautiful. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was convincing as Lestat, especially at the show, but I preferred Banderas to Armand. I loved Jesse, Maharet and Marius though. And of course, Aaliyah was perfect with her almost ancient Egyptian accent. <br /> <br /> So, if you like gothic music and vampiric bouquets of loneliness and eternity (and you do not consider books like movie scripts) "Queen of the Damned" is the one of the few movies that shows vampires as more than blood-sucking monsters. But please do not compare that to the movie "Interview". His style is completely different, as well as Louis and Lestat. Personally, I find it exciting first to see the existence of a vampire from the point of view of Louis' "bottle hunger", then to move on to a life devoid of all morality but surprisingly sociable for a vampire, Lestat. <br /> <br /> I 'd give "Reine" 8 out of 10 because it had some technical flaws, but I decided to give it 9 because it is largely underestimated by the people who hate it simply because it does not match their vision of books, which can be clearly seen by looking at the distribution of votes.
