All you can hope for if you are a fan of Jackass. As always, Knoxville and his team risk their lives for the pleasure of our spectators. If you are a fan of the series and the first film, you will not be disappointed, as the suites often do. The jokes they run against each other are twice as funny, cruel and brutal as ever. The stunts and challenges are twice as tough as all the Jackass episodes you've seen. If you are a fan, do not waste time, go check it out for yourself, because by Jackaass standards, this film is a 10 easy on 10 just for the opening credits. You have to see it to believe it.
