Shtrafbat - Penal Battalion is a moving and generally honest group examining the lives and deaths of Soviet soldiers who were sentenced to bleed their crimes during the Second World War. It can almost be said that this is the Russian equivalent of the highly acclaimed mini-series "Band of Brothers". <br /> <br /> Formed in July 1942 on the eve of the Battle of Stalingrad, the criminal battalions were considered expendable units and made terrible victims. (sometimes up to 90%). The GULAG prisoners (political jails / concentration camps), the deserters, the soldiers captured by the Germans but able to escape, the soldiers accused of breaking the protocol, all had the opportunity to join the Shtrafbat and to prove that there were no "traitors of the fatherland" with their lives, those who suffered injuries and those who died in combat were considered rehabilitated and reinstated in the eyes of the law. This mini-series presents a glimpse of one of these Shtrafbat, under the command of Tverdokhlebov - an honorable officer who was captured by the Germans, shot dead and left for dead. a colorful and diverse group of people, immersed in an impossible situation to escape Antip "Kulak" (The Fist), authoritative and honorable crime leader, and his small band of unreformed criminals, a young Jewish intellectual who has struck his anti-Semitic officer, father (Orthodox priest) Mikhail, joins the battalion when his parish is destroyed door-to-door fighting, the political prisoners who hate the regime that sentenced them to GULAG but who are nevertheless willing to fight a last time for their people and their country, must all find their courage and their reasons to continue to live, and continue to fight. <br /> <br /> Even if they take place during a war, each episode does not necessarily include combat scenes. In fact, the fight scenes that it exists are often chaotic, sporadic and short, which was probably the intention of the director. . In the meantime, the miniseries focuses on various relationships between actors, their origins, their thoughts and their tragedies. The rape of a young woman by a soldier of Shtrafbat, then his execution, his execution for supposed AWOL, periods of boredom on the march, the celebration (and subsequent consequences) of the search for a German bunker garnished with food (and champagne), the dilemma of officers unable to save their men from their own superiors, deceiving a spouse and other situations figure prominently. The camera is unshakable - it does not turn away from the ugliness of war and ugliness of human nature, nor from raw human emotions. Similarly, dialogue does not censure swear words. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb and deep, and the script is well written. Everything, from rage to fatigue, to resignation, to the search for a piece of joy that clings to, is almost irreproachable. One could complain that some Russian linguistic and cultural idiosyncrasies may not always be understood by someone who is unfamiliar with the language and culture. Because it is a historical drama in a sense, certain terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, some historical references) may be lost for some viewers. This understanding is not necessary to take advantage of Shtrafbat, but these references bring a nice touch of authenticity. Another grievance that could be perceived is an occasional anachronism and a plot-by-plot storyline, but frankly, this is a miniseries so captivating that it is likely that these minor incidents will be forgiven. .
