This is the best version of Gypsy that has been filmed. Bette Midler is simply superb as Rose Mama. She has voice, gestures, look and, most importantly, a supreme comedian ability her character comes to life. His singing is, simply: MAGNIFICENT! It shines especially in two figures- "Everything is coming Roses" and "Rose's Turn". The other actors are also very good, especially Christine Ebersoll in the role of Tessie.She also Peter Riegert; his interpretation of Herbie is interpreted with great style and credibility. This film is a clear improvement over Roz Russell's 1962 version. Since replay, I can say that the three biggest Mama Roses are: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler and Angela Lansbury. See this film. You will be happy to have done it.
