Animated shorts are just not better than this wonderful Canadian film. This short film is full of Canadian references. This film will probably be appreciated by Canadians. But the basic story is universal and it is told with love by the writer Roch Carrier. It's a hilarious story I've known for a long time, and I recently had the chance to see it again. So I just had to write a warm recommendation about it. It is a masterpiece and a must to know if you are Canadian or not.
