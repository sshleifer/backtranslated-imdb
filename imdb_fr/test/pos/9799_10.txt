This story is an excellent story of two boys doing everything they can to get away from their abusive drunken father. The star of "Lord of the Rings", Elijah Wood, is remarkable in this unforgettable role. This film is one of the main reasons I have not touched any beer and will never do it as long as I live. It might make me look like a nerd, but that's what I have to say. It's a wonder why it's not heard as a classic American tale.
