It is interesting to note that someone compared the "fifth missile" to the Star Trek episode. It should be noted that the original episode of Star Trek TV in which the crew of the Enterprise undergoes a space madness while the planet orbiting the planet Si 2000 is titled "The Naked Time", and not " Naked Now ". The term "Naked Now" refers to the first regular episode of Star Trek, the next generation, in which Enterprise-D encounters a science ship. This episode, however, refers to and is based on that of the original "Naked Time" series. <br /> <br /> Now, for the Firth missile. While crew reactions during the Star Trek episodes were similar to those of alcoholic intoxication, his condition aboard Montana was due to a much more serious situation, namely the paint fumes emitted by the poor finish partitions. There are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than a crew with such serious responsibilities as a crew on a ballistic missile submarine, and of course that is what makes the film so exciting and exciting. The plot is very believable. At the same time, this film, with "Crimson Tide", "The Day After", "From dawn", "The hunt in the month of October", "Ice Station Zebra", and many other similar films we give a lot of insight into how easily things could go wrong and how easily a nuclear holocaust could begin. Fortunately, such an event did not take place and (God willing) such an event will not happen.
