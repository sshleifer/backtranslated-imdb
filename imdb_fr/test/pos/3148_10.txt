I saw "The Reader" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart like few shorts have done. In about ten minutes, he tells a poignant story with two characters that resonated deeply in me. Duncan Rogers has done a remarkable job capturing very real and tender moments on film. What I really admire in this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. They are really interesting characters, and their story is told in perfect time. This is an exploit. Have not we all seen short films that are simply longer tight stories to fit the format, or theater stories that have not been properly adapted to the screen? I applaud "The Reader" for doing things really well, and I encourage everyone who is interested in the film and the story to look at it seriously. Worth every moment!
