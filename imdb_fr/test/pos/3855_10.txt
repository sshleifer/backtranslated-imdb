This is one of my favorite Disney movies. It contains everything you can expect in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where the Duchess aristocat and his three kittens live with their mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until Edgar, the diabolical butler of the Mistress, discovers that she intends to leave all her fortune to the cats. He realizes that even if he has a chance to claim the fortune, the cats will be away. An excellent masterpiece often forgotten in the 1970s - a time when the Disney studio did little animation - with songs such as the title "The Aristocats" and "Ev'rybody wants to be a cat", will enchant young and old spectators with its lasting jazzness.
