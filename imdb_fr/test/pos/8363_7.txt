The Kid Power Hour featured two segments: Hero High and Shazam. Let's start with Hero High. <br /> <br /> Hero High was to be a new cartoon by Archies, with their superhero identities: Pureheart the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superteen (Betty) and Evilheart. (Reggie). However, Filmation could not get the right to do it, so they slightly modified it and proposed that. Here's the cast of the characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Weatherman (Jughead), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Principal Samson (Mr weatherbee) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grundy). The show featured live action skits and cartoon adventures. Humor was typical of Filmation's lame jokes, but at least it amused him. It was quite fun for the kids, but not quite up to scratch. <br /> <br /> The other segment was Shazam !, who was very loyal to comics, unlike the previous action show. All the main villains have made appearances, as well as the entire Marvel family (including Freckles Marvel, in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the good voice and dirty character of WC Fields, as well as his perpetual "Shazambago". Burr Middleton, a veteran of the TV series of the 70s, like Fish, voiced the Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudy Wells in the first episodes of 6 Million Dollar Man and Skeletor's voice in He-Man) was entrusted to Dr. Sivana. <BR /> <br /> Since wonders had always had the sense of fantasy, they needed few modifications to make their adventures conform to the norms and practices of diffusion (the censors). As such, the stories were very imaginative and inventive. Among the villains who appeared were: Dr. Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibac and crocodile creatures. Mr. Tawky Tawny also made his screen debut. <br /> <br /> Hero High must leave BCI, but Shazam! is still in limbo, as well as live-action. Hopefully the proposed movie will help shake them up on DVD. It is worth watching and deserve a DVD treatment.
