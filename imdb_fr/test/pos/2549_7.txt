I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart and this film is just as good. This slice of life is almost a documentary on how life on the edges is lived. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do a great job as a 12 year old brother and 16 year old sister who live in a small room in front of a car shop. There are no parents; they survive alone. Ali supplements his income by stealing car parts, selling pirated DVDs and selling sweets on the subway. Izzie supplements her income by working in a food truck selling herself. They are trying to make money with their own truck. <br /> <br /> We are tempted to express our indignation at the fact that these two children are left to fend for themselves, and we can certainly be very sorry that Izzie sells her body to volunteer truckers, but the The fact is that it exists today in the richest country in the world and not in underdeveloped lands. Save indignation and do something.
