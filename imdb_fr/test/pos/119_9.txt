I finally watched the third film in Mehta's trilogy: "Fire". To begin, I would say that "water" was the undisputed masterpiece at all levels. The fire comes next, followed by the Earth in order of quality. Fire: there are so many things in this movie that I'm going to need some extra viewing to drink everything. The writing is superb, the script creates friction that triggers the whole process of "heat" from beginning to end. when there really is a fire, conflicts turn into a complete breakdown of relationships. <br /> <br /> Mehta is a brave woman: she sees with a clear eye many things that are jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she comes. India is changing rapidly in recent times, but it is largely an economic change. The fact that she met such fierce opposition to the creation of "Water" after having had the scenario erased shows that there are still many taboo subjects that the Indians can no longer look at in the face, can not review or discuss. Worse, if a person like Mehta has the courage to be a mirror of these problems, she faces death threats. Thus, as much as India sees itself as a pluralistic and tolerant society, the facts are not always so. While "Earth" was only a historical record of the carnage of the civil war that followed India's independence, Fire and Water highlights personal, social and religious issues that, as I say, are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that artistic dialogue is still several years away. At the time of writing, "water" is expected to be introduced in India later this year. I will believe it when I see it. <br /> <br /> The fire comes up against a sexual and emotional enigma similar to the one I saw in "A price higher than the rubies". Whether they were arranged marriages (as was the case with Jews about 150 years ago, or as with many modern Indians), they risk a bad marriage to men at the same time. and to women; or, simply, marriages without love ..... However, this is not the real problem. Mehta is clearly impatient for the totally rigid religious attitudes that keep widows in misery (Water) or keep women in bondage to loveless marriages (Fire). I am not an expert on secular or Hindu divorce laws. The movie seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce) is almost as serious as the sad marriage. In any case, Mehta's film is a very moving and powerful attempt at sexual discourse that keeps relations between modern Indians under close scrutiny. The fact that these three films made themselves felt in India as an unjustified attack on their culture seems to me to be the predictable clamor of a repressive state of mind. Mehta forces to examine problems, no matter how many flack. I admire his work and I can not recommend his films too much. Superb, disturbing, provocative, upsetting taboo.
