The true story of a Spanish paraplegic, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized. This film, along with Million Dollar Baby, winner of the Best Film Award of the same year, caused a sensation that year with their portrayals of people with disabilities wanting death. Conservative advocacy groups protested both films, as well as their Oscar nominations. The nominations were also held during the Terry Schiavo debacle, to put it in a historical perspective. Protests, especially groups of disabled people, against Million Dollar Baby make sense ?? the film clearly described, without hesitation, the life of a worthless paraplegic. The central character of the film, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes a paraplegic, seems to have no advice, no help, and wants to die immediately. Honestly, the movie is pretty stupid and uncomplicated. The Sea Inside, based on the true story, is certainly much more thoughtful about it. It is likely that Million Dollar Baby is in the same category as the protesters without even seeing it, an incredibly common phenomenon. The film gives time to many facets of the argumentation. And he immediately declares that the desire to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone. He is, however, guilty of some crimes and I would always understand why groups of people with disabilities might have a problem with that. First and foremost, there is the meeting of the protagonist with a paraplegic bishop. I do not look nicely at the way it is described. His wheelchair with an oral command is described as absurd, and there is almost a comic sequence where his effeminate servants and lads drag him, in his chair, down the stairs. He can not even reach the room in which Ramón is and one of the boys' toys is obliged to conduct the conversation between them. Maybe if Ramón lived in a slightly more wheelchair-accessible house, he would not spend his whole life in bed and could find life more fulfilling (who knows if the movie is a close description of reality). Director Amenábar (The Others) also includes ludicrous scenes that attempt to make this film about suicide more invigorating, such as a cross sequence in which Ramón looks thoughtful and his advocate's baby is born. But apart from some ugly moments, the film is very good. It hurts that someone may want to die when he is able to bring so much joy and discernment into the lives of others. However, in the end, our lives belong to us. Should not we have the right to choose? The most important asset of the film lies in its secondary characters and the actors who play them. He describes how Ramón's combat and decisions affect those around him with great precision. The family members in particular are great and the final departure of Ramón is heartbreaking and makes me cry. My favorite performance in the film comes from Lola Dueñas, who, in my opinion, also gave the best performance, or at least certainly the most underrated, in Volod Almodóvar last year.
