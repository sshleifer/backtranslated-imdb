Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting film in which praise goes to the main actor, John Malkovich. His assassination attempts against the president were of first quality and credible. <br /> <br /> This should not diminish the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, nor even Fred Dalton Thompson, who plays the role of a real idiot. Chief of Staff. Eastwood was great and I love all the movies Russo is in. <br /> <br /> The film presents an original music of the winner of five Oscars (Mal√®na, Bugsy, The Incorruptibles, The Mission, Heaven in Heaven), Ennio Morricone. That alone is worth it.
