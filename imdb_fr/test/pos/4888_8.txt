Whether you are a fan of the series that inspired it or not, it is clear that this work is fragmentary. But in the best possible sense. Pemberton, Dyson, Shearmsith and Gatiss, eager to get away from the traps of the old sitcoms that were making a difficult transition to the big screen, have taken a different path. inevitably, while dwelling on some of their most beloved characters. Too bad, they were not content with a more consistent film of the League of Gents, because as inventive as included in the scenario is weakened the final film. Well worth it to rent though.
