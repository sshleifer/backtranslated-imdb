I am not a big fan of music videos. I think music videos dispel personal feelings about a particular song. Any song. In other words, creative thinking goes through the window. Similarly, personal feelings set aside about MJ are set aside. It was the best music video of all time. Simply wonderful. It was a movie. Yes guys it was. Brilliant! You had great acting, great choreography and great singing. It was spectacular. Just the plot of a beautiful young woman coming out with a man, but was he a man or something sinister. Vincent Price added his thing to the song and the video. MJ was MJ, enough of that. This song was a video, what are the Jaguars for cars. Top of the range, PERFECTO. What was even better was that we got the real GM without the thousand facings. Ironically, makeup and costumes were enough. People are going on Youtube. Take 14 minutes. Get out of your life and see for yourself how beautiful this video is.
