I saw this film on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 "x 10". So I really was not going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the middle, so I thought I'd watch for a few minutes. The next thing I know is that I am sucked in, have a good time, and enjoy the quality of his work and the speed with which he seemed to spend time. I agree that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the oldest boomers, I was also delighted to see Lee Majors play a role in the film, like some other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) "Yesterday" but who do not are not in the spotlight today are making fun of themselves. <br /> <br /> This is your basic principle "the kid gets hurt, the kid takes revenge (and even more), and everyone has fun doing it". No heavy thinking, no big analysis needed. Just a good fun way to pass the time. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5
