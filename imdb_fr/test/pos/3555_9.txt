After reviewing 3 of the 4 sitcoms Perry and Croft, I thought I could finish them all now. Dads Army, is my favorite sitcom of all time. It's not half warm. Mom is also a classic, just like You Rank M'Lord. I do not consider Hi De Hi as a classic, but it's funny. <br /> <br /> This is a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is directed by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well-meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. The staff includes the director of entertainment, Ted, his sidekick Spike (he was thrown into the pool almost every episode), his yellow coat Gladys, the careless maid Peggy who aspired to be a yellow coat and Mr. Punch and Judy, Mr. Partridge, who hates kids. Most situations took place around the pool, where someone would be thrown at each episode (with his clothes of course). <br /> <br /> Not a classic, but always funny. Jeffery Fairbrother left halfway, which means that just like Only Fools and Horses, it was better than his home. Jimmy Perry was actually a red cloak at Butlins. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Peggy's Big Chance, Series 2, Episode 2.
