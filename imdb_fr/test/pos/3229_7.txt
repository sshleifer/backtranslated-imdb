Fuckland is an interesting movie. Personally, I like the Dogma movement. I wish it lasted longer. He seems to be already dead. Many critics have tried to do everything to close it. I do not know why. This is the most interesting movement that has occurred in the film world since the new French wave. Besides Fuckland, I saw the first three of the series, Festen, Idioterne and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland is not up to the others. I was just fascinated by the filming. This is played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to pose it. At a few moments in the film, it becomes obvious that it is a complete work of fiction, but this illusion lasted very long. I would have liked the filmmakers to propose something a little more interesting to stage. It's basically this guy, Fabian, an Argentinian visiting the Faulkland Islands. The Argentineans have been allowed to enter the islands only in the last two months and Fabian plans to imbue women with Argentinean children. He looks at one and most of the film is devoted to his seduction. Both actors are very natural. Camilla Heany only indicates that she is an actress. Fabian Stratas seems completely real. The politics of the film confuse me somewhat, because I have only a small idea of ​​the situation of the island and its recent history. I think I was 3 when the Faulklands were invaded. The last part of the movie does not work at all. I do not understand what the filmmakers wanted. Yet, Fuckland is an interesting Dogma experience. This, however, violates certain rules of dogma, including the rule of music without extra-diagetic. There are many. 7/10.
