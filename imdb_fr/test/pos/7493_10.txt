This film is hard to hit. It is part of the tradition of Pulp Fiction, but succeeds even more by entering his own style. The casting is great, the script is great - and things like odd time sequences (Pulp Fiction-esque) are done brilliantly. I particularly like the way the images provided in Flash Back vary greatly depending on who is telling the story at the time. When it's one of the indoctrinated criminals, everything is bright and cool, but when you remember the hero, everything is cursed and disgusting. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie - and I'm extremely bored to find it I can not buy it anywhere!
