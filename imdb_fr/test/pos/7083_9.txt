I loved One True Thing since I first watched it at the theater and cried. I bought it as soon as it was available and I forgot how many times I had watched it. <br /> <br /> For me, One True Thing is the film about family relationships par excellence. I like watching relationships in the family evolve and evolve to become what they are. I can tell a lot of details in the film. My mother died of bone cancer, so it really touches me at home. Maybe that's why I love him so much. <br /> <br /> I like the relationship between children and their parents, as well as the relationship between brother and sister, but especially the relationship between husband and wife. For me, it's really beautiful. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this move to anyone who loves this kind of movie.
