I loved this film. Not as good as "50 First Dates", but it's really a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. Yes, the plot was "cute" and maybe even amazing, but what's wrong with feeling good. Drew made sure that Josie and her relationship with the teacher were so sweet and that her brother, the baseball avenger, added to the feeling of the movie. With all the bazaar that is dormant, what is wrong in a good movie that the whole family can enjoy? Without being embarrassed while watching with your children! Drew is a great actress who seems to be underrated for the most part. It's certainly one of his best roles!
