This film is superb, it has the same feeling of low-budget film as that of "Pi" and "Clerks", but has the style of "Memento" (also of the author / director Christopher Nolan). The score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost 'Memento' prototypes, and history shows that Christopher Nolan is the best for writing and directing. Do not be put off by the look and play of low-budget actors, or even the short duration of the film, and watch it!
