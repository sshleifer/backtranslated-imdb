I saw this film for the first time in the night program of one of my favorite TV channels ... I became addicted from the first minute. Nothing is as it seems at first sight, a lot of suspense, excellent role-playing by Mr. van Dien, and the "heat" that prevails does not bother me at all ;-) ... and, the best of all: you are surprised late !!!
