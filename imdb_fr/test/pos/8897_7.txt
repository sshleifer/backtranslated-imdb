It's a pity that Ast√©rix and his friend Obelix are not recognized worldwide by other comic characters. <br /> <br /> This is another amusing cartoon of Asterix. The animation is excellent and the characterization of the voice is good, even if the timing is a little blurry. The music and the score fit well into the story and the insertion of some modern musical numbers is a nice touch. <br /> <br /> Runtime seems short and, even if it's not the best story of Asterix or the most developed cartoon, it's good clean fun. Modern animation (similar to that of Disney) will captivate children, fans of Asterix and newcomers ... Enjoy the adventure Gallic!
