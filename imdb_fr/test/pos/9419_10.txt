A brilliant adventure of Sherlock Holmes with the brilliant Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Despite many other actors who brilliantly play Holmes and Watson and do a great job - Rathbone and Bruce will always be the two best. <br /> <br /> Holmes takes a Tobell professor from Switzerland to London. Tobell is wanted by the Nazis. He has a bomb vision that could win the second world war. His bomb site was divided into four parts, each hidden in books. Tobell agrees to give his bomb site to the British government. On the night of his arrival, Tobell goes to his girlfriend's house. He drew figures of men, if Tobell were to disappear, the lady had to give the drawings to Holmes. Returning home, he is attacked, but a policeman stops him and the attacker fled. Tobell is glad the British government is using its bomb site but refuses to give it to them, Tobell wants to take care of it. The bomb site is divided into four parts, each part being completely useless without the other. He gives part of each bomb site to one of his science friends. Then the greatest fear of Holmes occurs, Tobell disappears. Holmes visits the young woman that Tobell was with the night he was attacked. She tells him about the drawings. The drawings were stolen. She says only one man came in during the time when Tobell left to fix the bulb. The man she describes is Professor Moriarty. He works for the Nazis. Saw as he has the drawings, Holmes is finished. But he finds the notepad he used and uses Science, he manages to see what Tobell drew by looking at the next page of the notebook. He sees that it's code. He sees that it's the name of four scientists. The first three for which he elaborates the code, but he can not solve the fourth. The three scientists he worked on were murdered and the bomb site was taken. Holmes can not work on the fourth scientist, but no more than Moriarty. Disguised as a sailor, Holmes manages to enter the office of Moriarty. Moriarty immediately sees it as Holmes, puts it in a box and throws it into the sea. But Watson and Lestrade insist that they search the box and find Holmes there. It is now obvious that Moriarty is on the run. Holmes manages to develop the fourth code, a Frederick Hoffner. Holmes immediately goes home and recovers Hoffner and the fourth crucial part of the security. Holmes now needs Moriarty to be accused of working with the Nazis. He claims to be Hoffner. Moriarty develops the fourth code and asks two men to pick up Hoffner. They take him back and he finds himself face to face with Moriarty. Meanwhile, Tobell is not on the right track, he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist. Moriarty had with Holmes now, he had it and his death must be long for Holmes. The idea is to put him in the hospital, put a needle in his vein and watch him die of blood loss, drip. Watson enters and saves the day. Moriarty gets away with it, but Holmes is careless enough to leave Moriarty's hatch open. Moriarty plunges sixty feet. <br /> <br /> Moriarty is dead. No. He makes his last appearance in the movie 'The Woman in Green', but in 'Green', he is definitely dead, a suicide, he jumps from the roof. It was the second of three Moriarty appearances in the Rathbone series, a different actor playing it on every occasion. George Zucco played his first appearance in "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", his second in this film, he was performed by Lionell Atwill and Henry Daniels plays it in his last appearance in "The Woman in Green" The first three films of Holmes made by Universal were put into the war as Holmes triumphed over the Nazis. 'The Voice of Terror' was the first film, then this film and then 'Sherlock Holmes In Washington'. It was Victorian, with well-defined relationships with Edwardian and Georgian (George, fifth and sixth time). This film was closely related to Sherlock Holmes' "The Men Who Dance" story in "The Return of Sherlock Holmes". A great film, although obviously propaganda, it was a brilliant exit to Holmes.
