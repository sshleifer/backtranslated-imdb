A memorable comedy. It's fun to see the many situations develop and finally converge, after a long journey, to the largest collection of eclectic humanity (and with the world's largest honky-tonk), the great American Freeway. Like "... a crazy world, a crazy world", it contains tons of contemporary talent, an old boy's politics, a good comic action and a dialogue. Unlike this one, it is the target that is sought after, not the unintentional seekers - they have no idea what they really want as they take the high road to America. Nor does it carry the weight of having a good fall guy who is saved in the end by a belly laugh. But the final sequence of cascades is spectacular with its excellent film editing, humor and timing. The scene of big banking cities is hilarious, with a very original game played by a very talented character in particular. The total confidence of city dwellers in the face of chaos leaves a proverbial fly feeling on the ceiling. The slapstick is funny, but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and watched closely, as it is surprisingly full of nuances and character reactions that are easily missed. Overall, we had a very entertaining reflection on who we were and what it was, good or bad, and the crazy situations we find ourselves in. It was just meant to be funny and it's true!
