Ramin Bahrani first staged a scene in Chop Shop in which I immediately identified with the character of Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend. The two of them take the subway, and as soon as the doors close, they ask if they could get everyone's attention for a moment, and they sell chocolate bars or M & M or something like that, and then they sell a few bars. If you (like me) have been on a subway in New York at any time, this is the kind of situation that happens so often that you hardly notice it. Often, people in the subway will see children like these or minorities selling or advertising and talking about something in a metro without paying them the slightest attention. The goal of Bahrani does not necessarily only concern children who sell items for sale in the subway, but the survival and state of being one in the lower class in America. He is eventually in his hands thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually at one time. <br /> <br /> To compare it to Pixote or the bicycle thief is not too far from a jump (actually in this one at least the father and his son get along), although Bahrani be specific in his intentions in his documentary style. We are concerned about this character Ali, under the age of eleven, working in a car shop, cleaning cars and helping to dismount others, as well as his sister who comes from outside to stay with him. But it's not just because we feed all the clich√©s by force, except, you know, a brother and a sister (more so the brother) who try to take care of one another. Bahrani makes history accessible by the simple aspiration of Ali, the type of goal that can be achieved in his situation: save enough to buy a used food truck that Ali and Isamar can exploit themselves . <br /> <br /> All that Ali works, but what Bahrani brutally shows us is this work, what Ali needs to do to make it happen, even if it tastes unpleasant such as removing wheelcovers from Shea Stadium cars or a purse in a desperate time. The problem is all the more serious when Ale sees what his sister does to make money at night, by sex with men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. He does not talk about it and sets it aside, but it's always something that adds to the tension, something that Ale wants to protect his sister. This adds to the tragedy when Ale discovers the real cost of what it will take to turn the food truck into a profit generator, a cost that only reinforces the anguish he has just internalized. <br /> <br /> We could immediately look at the fact that Ale is an orphan in a neighborhood like Queens where the film was shot naturally, as in a work of neo-neo realism (call it simply realism) , featuring virtually all non-professional actors in the areas of mechanics, workers and people on the street - but Bahrani is more focused on the present and the present, and that's what makes Chop Shop so immediate and sincere . No trace of melodrama is found in the film, hardly even a musical accompaniment apart from live Latino music from cars and radios. Sometimes, Bahrani focuses on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in later scenes, as Ale is awake but acts as if he were sleeping the first night after witnessing Isamar's nightly night, and we see that she lies down in bed, she probably knows he is awake but no one can say a word. Or, in many other scenes, poetic touches that seem homogeneous, as when the man shows Ale how to feed the pigeons works. <br /> <br /> It's rough and grainy, as you'd expect, and it does not happen. gives hope to his main characters despite the few moments of happiness that spread. It's also a beautiful hand-held film, where the technique, like many films made in a tone and an urban approach, informs and completes the on-screen topics and what they do, but it's never foolhardy shot or too flashy. The filmmaker has a superb "real" distribution (Ale has been gathered without experience in a public school in New York) and knows how to not lose sight while achieving a brutal art by showing only what it shows. This is not the City of God or Pixote; it's his own little masterpiece on one or more characters that we would not usually have to take a second look at (or just a first) on our way to a city like New York. If Ale and her daily struggles do not affect you, I do not know what to do for you.
