Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as "The Fox" in "Whistling in the Dark", also starring Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virgina Gray and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, aka "The Fox", finds his plan to marry his fiancee Carol (Rutherford) upset by his kidnapping by the head of a fake cult (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, does not receive the promised legacy because of the existence of the old woman's nephew, who will live on this interest. He wants Wally to devise a perfect assassination plot so that the man can be killed on the plane before meeting his lawyer. For the backup, and because he does not know which is Wally's fiance, Jones kidnaps Carol and the daughter of the radio sponsor (Gray). <br /> <br /> This is, in my eyes, a movie superior to the second entry in this series, "Whistling in Dixie." The plot is better, the distribution is better, there is less burlesque and less jokes. Skelton, when he does not wince and roll his eyes, is very kind, and Rutherford is very good. Veidt has always played these evil men to perfection. Eve Arden is Wally's agent, who gives him a date with Gray to make sure his contract is renewed. I had only seen Gray in movies from the 1950s. She was always an attractive woman, but who knew she was so talented in the '30s and' 40s? It's a fun movie with a neat distribution.
