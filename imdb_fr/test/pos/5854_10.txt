It's an excellent suspense-murder-mystery movie. Not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue, but you have the chance to see the superb Ryan Gosling for a few hours, which is not to love! In addition, Sandra Bullock is good in this movie - I've always been a fan of her (I just wish she did not decide to be part of "The Lake House", which was horrible, but This is an other story). Obviously, since there are thousands of other murder / horror movies, there are bound to be similarities between them. No need to criticize this film for having similarities with at least some already realized. Anyway, it's a great movie for those who like "scary" movies, it's a bit dark and twisted, but overall, it's a great movie !!!
