------ Spoilers ----- Spoilers ----- Spoilers -------- just a few small <br /> <br /> Saw this on the Satilite channel, missed the first 30 min of the film, this commentary will be brief and informative. <br /> <br /> The film contains about 5 characters. The acting is very bad for some characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people but she turns against her and the other 3 kidnap 2. This is one of those types of movies where screenwriters try to be provocative or philosophical , mysterious and ... you get the point; but make their own, personal lack of thinking, they fall terribly short. As one of the captives who is supposed to be a nerd guy in psychology - look at the party but his tongue can not speak it. The authors think that if the nerd uses a lot of 8-letter words in an amateur way - without knowing it, I believe - the viewers will be ignorant enough to believe it. I wish I could give an example, but I do not remember anything - exactly as it was said. The end was so bad. But the captive woman played her role as old and relatively wise, although she, like the others, had a lot of clich√©s. <br /> <br /> So why give this movie to 7 stars if I thought all the above? Simple, I give the seven stars to LISA KELLER - a sexy granny and $$. SHE is good lol. I am a lover of beauty, and she is exactly that. But do not confuse me because I'm not a pervert and this film is by no means a porn. theirs is something about it, I can not explain, but I love it. I remember the scene where a prisoner escaped and, as he searches for a way out, falls on Keller. She tries to make her way but she has no chance. He throws her on the ground, kneeling on the stairs and pulls her pants, no panties;). Now, even if she has an amazing ass - and the shot of this movie leaves little imagination for 30 seconds, I think - it's her facial expression that got me. she wanted it, and that look made me think that I was behind it. I would have torn this loot! After this expression, I could not look at her objectively, I was in love. lol. I'm happy to have seen this movie, but if Lisa Keller did not play the main role, I would have changed channels ... well ... after seeing the scene I mentioned above. I am a fan of LISA KELLER, but it seems that she is not a coherent actor, since this 2003 film is her last. But I can not wait to see another movie with her.
