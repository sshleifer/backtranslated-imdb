I did something a little daring tonight watching this movie. I tried to wean myself off silent movie music. Of course, when this film was originally distributed, a piano score was probably played with it. Often, the director himself chose the score (Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his last silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes on silent movies is by no means the same music that was supposed to be played on the first release of the movie. And, again, there were a lot of silent movies that were played without scoring. I do not know the story of Potemkin's score, so I decided to look at it for the medium in which this piece of art was produced - the film. <br /> <br /> Shortly after turning off the music, unaided (or should I say unhindered) because of the musical interpretation of the emotions on the screen, I became completely attached to the film. Visually, it's easily one of the most stunning movies. Eisenstein was a master of composition. The editing, probably the film technique for which Eisenstein is the most famous (editing), is extraordinary. The atmosphere of this film is anger and it has aroused my passions with violence. <br /> <br /> Enjoying a silent movie, especially a drama, takes a lot of effort, but films like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is worth it. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this movie! Your education is incomplete without it.
