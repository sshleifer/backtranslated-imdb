Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred days later, Carl is very depressed and leaves her, hoping to "clean up the fog" in their lives. Joline sees her marriage as an important commitment for the end of her life and decides to look for Carl in Texas. She is very supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her on the Mexican border. There, Joline meets the confused Carl and realizes that she can not change her decision, while Jay knows Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) and starts going out with her, and in the end "life goes on". This film is very unpredictable, having a very different story. I think it's an independent production. In some parts, it's a bit slow and boring, but some dialogues make this movie worth it. I liked it and my vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Rebeldes At√© o Fim ("The rebels to the end") <br /> <br />
