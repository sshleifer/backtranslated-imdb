Of course, there are things here that the Coens and Elmore Leonard did before, but then what? If you want to entertain, vigorous and intelligent - "Judas Kiss" is almost perfect. Prudes offended by senseless porn do not get it (Talk about how your sex and violence will be solved - keep your investors happy - it's an independent movie 101). As for the British who make a package, I doubt it very much. This film is clearly a work of love and the budget probably does not represent half of Mr. Tarantino's salary. Maybe guys do not like it as much as women do. I thought it rocked. Come on Coco!
