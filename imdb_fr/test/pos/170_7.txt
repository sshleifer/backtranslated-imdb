Sorry for the summary sentence "extremely intelligent". I do not really know what I thought, but I really could not help it. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see 'The bloody birthday' for a long time and I must say that it was a good surprise to find a copy of this film by chance and for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small village in South America and it is very unlikely to happen. It is a pity that some of these "jewels" of the 80s are now almost completely forgotten. "Bloody Birthday" is one of those movies that, surprisingly, is aging enough to be watched today. It's not a masterpiece, but entertaining and guess what? ... there are not really funny scenes. I know it's shocking if we keep in mind that this is a low-budget film from the early eighties about a group of evil kids who kill people. But believe me, the film manages to stay respectable and watch for most. <br /> <br /> In "Blood Birthday", the story revolves around three children who were born during a total eclipse. According to astrology, during eclipses, the sun and moon block Saturn, which controls emotions. As a result, the three children who were born that day end up becoming indifferent and mean. Since they feel no remorse, these 10-year-olds gang up against virtually everyone who opposes them, including their own parents and siblings ... and kill them! The number of corpses is increasing day by day and police authorities believe that there is a psychopath in the area. Meanwhile, Debbie, Curtis and Steven do not hesitate to continue killing people, because nobody seems to suspect these sweet faces of angels (?) <br /> <br /> As I said before, "Anniversary Bloody "is surprisingly not funny. I know I've said it before, but it really surprises me. I was expecting hilarious scenes, but the film proved the opposite. Certainly, this is not exactly what most people consider a "serious" horror film, but if I have to be fair, I would say that the story is decently executed. One of the most important reasons why laughay situations are normally expected (as I did) is that in this kind of movie where the main bad guys are kids, the young actors tend to be just terrible and make it all laughable. Let's face it: children tend to be horrible actors, which is understandable and we can not blame them. But to my surprise, the three young actors who played the ruthless killers in this movie seemed very disturbing and not at all funny. The rest of the actors are also good and if you're a fan of George Clooney, you can see his uncle playing doctor in this movie. Yeah, I know? ... who cares? In addition, Julie Brown, the great actress, singer, actress and gay icon, gives a strong performance as a naughty older sister and in case someone is interested in nudity: she also undresses in one of the scenes and she is very naked. Too bad she did not have more time on the screen! Julie is "absolutely fabulous": P <br /> <br /> So, basically, this film is good if you want a modest horror of the 80s. My only objection to "Bloody Birthday" would be the way to justify the motivations of the children. This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film. Let's see: If children born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers, why is it that these three people are the only ones who have actually murdered people? I'm sure there were other children who were born the same day ... and other days of total eclipse too, oh well! Overall, it does not matter, it's just a simple observation, that's all. I have seen worse, believe me. Take "The Children" (1980), for example, in which the early killer gets hurt after being turned into zombies by a toxic cloud. No, believe me, "Bloody Birthday" is more suitable and if you like simple slashers, you will really love this one. <br /> <br /> You now know that you are invited to the children's birthday party ... and the guests will serve you a delicious poison cake for you and the rest of the guests. Come on, you can not miss it;)
