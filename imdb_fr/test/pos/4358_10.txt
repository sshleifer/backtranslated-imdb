This film is one of the most amazing examples of captivating and artistic filming I have ever seen. Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter's story, as well as his endearing personal character. At the end of the film, I wanted to have the opportunity to meet Dieter before his death. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, cinematography is intimate and surprisingly beautiful. The story is woven in a complex way, with a great awareness of the subject and his ability to relive and reconstruct traumatic events. Few documentary filmmakers have such a strong ability to invest the public in the character. This film is to see absolutely !!!
