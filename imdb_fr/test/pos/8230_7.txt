I am a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. While some of them are surprisingly clich√© (as most westerners of this time are), its ease of delivery and style really elevate the films to the status of classic and quasi-classic. While this film presents yet another example of the real life of Western heroes exploited after their death by Hollywood (in this case, Bat Masterson), the film works well thanks to him, as well as excellent support characters. The first is Robert Ryan's still strong acting - an excellent actor who is sadly almost forgotten today. The other is the ubiquitous Gabby Hayes, who has one of the best roles as a crisp and colorful MP. He is more agreeable here than in his many minor roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne - mainly because his role is better written and gives him more to do. <br /> <br /> The plot is about half the plot the westerns have ever made. There are villains who have hired a gang of thugs to punish the locals and it is up to a brave (Scott) to restore peace and kill the bad guys. However, the plot is much better than the average and, as such, the movie is still fun to watch. Do not expect an innovation or uniqueness unless you want to see what might be Gabby Hayes' best performance.
