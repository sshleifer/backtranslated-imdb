Once again, I'm surprised that Thomas Gibson was not at the front of the pack earlier in his career. In this film, Gibson demonstrates once again his ability to capture a character regardless of sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay male from the late 20th century. Gibson tender but not effeminate, fearing the basic principles of love, touches a variety of emotions. Cameron Bancroft's performance is also commendable. His need to be the heterosexual winner as opposed to the "homosexual conquests" of his best friend is a dynamic for the relationship that is in many ways unexpected. The chemistry of Bancroft and Gibson is apparent from the first scene in which they appear together. There are many "signs" in this quilt. Homosexual relationships to heterosexual relationships; heterosexual relationships to the exploration of lesbian love; This film travels the broad spectrum of sexuality while having the story of a serial killer. My only regret is that it took 6 years since its release before discovering this movie! I can not wait to see him again and highly recommend him to all fans of Bancroft, Gibson or director Denys Arcand.
