Good, boring or bad? Its good. Worth your money? If you can save it for a ticket, of course. Better than the trailer seems? Yes, curiously. <br /> <br /> The scenario is not that complicated: the guards working for an armored truck business move large amounts of money. The guards see an opportunity to retire as millionaires, one of them is too honest to accept all this, and a well-prepared plan goes to hell. <br /> <br /> It could have been a poorly executed Reservoir Dogs scam, but the cast's skill and the director's ability to create tension in any context pull him out of that realm and put him on solid foundations.
