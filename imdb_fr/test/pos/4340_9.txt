This movie was great. There was everything a real fan of action could desire. Many people are shot and / or maimed, a minimal romance involving sex, a hero to whom we can associate, violence at several intervals instead of a useless plot that stores only one scene at the end, and wicked people who ask for it. Bronson seems to be at its lowest level of tolerance in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter is an excellent cop and has been integrated into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie does not have such a boring or overly consuming plot that you watch this movie once and never again. Rather, you want to see Kersey in action and the plot takes over. It's awesome.
