I liked this film. That's about all I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a good job, although I am still very disappointed with him after all Iron Eagle movies. And even though I was smiling inside when the first major teenager died (I will not let go), it was done in an elegant and appropriate way. Almost everyone in this movie does a good job, so take a look! This is another one of those movies that I found really cheap, so I bought it and recommend it.
