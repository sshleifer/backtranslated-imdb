This documentary on dinosaurs was without a doubt fascinating and very well done. However, I found myself watching a lot of songs with discomfort. The film generally took a fairly confident stance on everything it said and showed, but inevitably much of the animals' behavior, their interactions, their appearance, the way they moved, what they had eaten, etc. guess - sometimes with reasonable confidence, sometimes with uncontrollable guesses. But the viewer is never aware of this, the film claims to observe real dinosaurs and their real behavior, etc. This probably makes viewing better than confronting the public with mountains of blame, but it just makes it a little too populist in my opinion. .
