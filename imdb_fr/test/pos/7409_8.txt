This is one of my personal favorites, a rare gem that seems to be unknown to the general population. Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson form the heart of the play in a well-chosen cast. Few films have ever captured the true hostilities that underpinned the American Civil War, but this one seems to capture all the right tones and moods. If you are a fan of the book, Cold Mountain, try this movie and see if you do not think it will be a good companion.
