I saw this movie when I was a child and fell in love with it. He has a sweet, sensitive story. Something that children can enjoy. I loved my childhood so much that I had to find it for my daughter. It's really a movie that I would watch with children. It reminds me a lot of stories of a Disney nature like Pete's Dragon and Mary Poppins. Both because of the live action and cartoon features, but on its principle. It's also a good story to show children that if they tell the truth, we can trust them and adults will listen to them. I think all children should see it and enjoy it. It's a break with the bad movies that so many kids are watching today. It has all the charming qualities that many of today's movies do not have.
