Edward Dmytryk's "Crossfire" is a rare movie from Hollywood in the 1940s. It was a ground for Dmytryk and the studio because of what the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to do with the novel on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie yet, stop reading now. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks's novel was about the murder of a gay soldier. In the film, the subject was turned into prejudices against the Jews, a theme that was taboo at that time in American cinema. Mr. Dmytryk has the merit of having the courage to get involved in this film project. <br /> <br /> The film is an exceptional achievement because of the way the director presents it. Visibly influenced by the style of the film noir, we are led to Washington after the war. The opening scene of Samuels' brutal murder shows such an unusual cruelty inflicted on an honest man, whom we do not yet know, or why this assassination was killed, but who did not deserve to die so horribly. <Br /> <br /> Murder is based on pure prejudice. We realize that in the mind of an ignorant man, the mere fact of having success and being different plays in the mind of the murderer. Samuels presents himself as the sacrificial lamb, in the same way that the gay soldier is the victim of the novel. The parallels are well drawn. <br /> <br /> This film makes the viewing captivating because of Robert Ryan's brilliant star trick, in the role of Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played interesting roles, but never as well as in "Crossfire". Gloria Grahame also made a beautiful appearance in the role of Ginny, the prostitute in the right place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the distribution is in the form of a set. As an investigating police detective, Robert Young is an honest man, who has been prejudiced in his own family and speaks out loudly. Robert Mitchum plays a cool Sgt. Keeley is deeply touched by the crime when one of his men is accused of having committed it. Sam Levene is excellent in his small role of Samuels. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to watch because it is probably the first to have spoken aloud against ignorance.
