I liked it better than House Party 2 & 3. The cast was hilarious and cool at the same time. Chris Stokes, who directed the film, has a very humorous attitude as a car repairer; look for his mother who plays the main character, John John's grandmother. And you can hear his title "Down to the Last Minute" at the end of the film while the credits roll. She is very funny and a very good actress. The young actors who play it (the main trio) and who, in fact, are part of the IMx music group, have done a remarkable job. Before this film, I had not paid much attention to this group of r & b. Now I am a fan. The music number in the House Party scene alone is worth checking the movie. I was pleasantly surprised. I liked it.
