If you do not like subtitles, if you like comedy and really interesting characters, as well as the taste of something different from traditional American cinema, then try your luck and rent this movie. <br /> <br /> Two contrasting friends, (a very neurotic sweater, the other strong and lonely guy) working for a butcher butcher in a small Danish town, decide to blame themselves and open a slaughter. Not successful at first, they incorporate something new in their recipe and become an instant hit with the village. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting story in itself, this cleverly humorous film is even more crowded (friendship, romance, crime, death, personal tragedy) make this film a funny film that is intelligent many interests subtle that make it so interesting but warm and fuzzy. <br /> <br /> We must mention the characters created and the actors making them credible. You can have the best scenario, but if the characters are not credible, a film can flow and with that, the staging, the acting, the credibility of the characters and the story mix so much that they make a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood to let go of something, you want to see something very good but that's done a little differently, so I suggest you rent this movie while I'm about to look for more, from author-director Anders Thomas Jensen.
