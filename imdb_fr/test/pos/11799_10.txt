I'm so happy to have HBO right now. I did not plan to watch a movie today, but when I got home and saw that the next movie on HBO was this one, I decided (depending on the description) to take it at least. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this movie just took me at a vulnerable moment (I'm a little stressed, I have to undergo a huge test for which to study), but it certainly gave me a whole perspective on friendship, not to mention to have taught me a precious lesson in empathy. I am currently in a year of pharmacy graduates and the whole scene involving the doctor and the nurse was definitely a learning point for me! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I just wanted to post to inform the whole world it's an incredible movie and not to be missed. There is definitely something for everyone in this movie!
