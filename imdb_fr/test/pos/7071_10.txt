Excuse me if I'm wrong, but "Cronica para un desayuno" could be one of the most wonderful films in Mexican film history for many reasons. We can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect middle-class Mexican family breakfast: a cup of Buñuel surrealistic patterns with a little drop of Ripstenian's sorry scenes; a book of phallic symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than Todd Solondz's films Happiness and the Dogma. Sordidness, black humor, repressed dreams (dream of Teodoro), lack of incestual control (the relationship between Marcos and Luzma), parallel stories without meaning, discreet violence, anachronisms and a small sign of hope (highlighted in Luzma, the return of the husband and "A poco Mas" used for the leit-motif). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is a charming character (I think in the manner of Bukoskian), a king without a crown waiting for nothing but broken noses. Luzma (Maria Rojo), the adorable woman, has many faces, but the only thing that worries her is that her sons have their breakfast; she is a loser in many ways and sensual in a few moments, but you will fall in love. The trail of the soundtrack (too much wood) feeds the lack of technical merit, intentional, of course: fuzzy shots, close-ups (in introspective scenes), vertiginous panoramas and sudden editing cuts. "Crónica" is something difficult to digest, it stays stuck in the throat and everything allows it. It tastes bitter, like rotten orange juice, and acidic, like stale milk, but you want to enjoy it. I recommend taking a little Melox before the show, because after all, you will not go hungry.
