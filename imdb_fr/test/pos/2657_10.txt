This film is not just good, it's amazing. In addition to offering us good performances, an original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and many other things, it was a world that until then was totally invisible to the public. This is the first sci-fi film that takes us into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and a mind-blowing reality that the audience finds itself speechless. I'm only 16 years old and I grew up in a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the cinema. Nevertheless, even after almost 40 years, I was really blown away by the quality of these effects. The visual effects were only one of the merits of this film. The camera was in a real incredible and enchanting Kubrick style. It's as if you were engrossed in the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the size of this movie caught me by my guards, even if I had already seen the classification before having bought it. But this movie has more than that. The meaning of this film can also be interpreted to your liking, although I think there are clear points about humanity (also the true Kubrick style). How is humanity at the peak of its evolution only maintenance on board, and therefore not necessary for the computer, one of the tools of the human sciences. We look like babies in space, learn to walk again, lose control of our tools in weightlessness, breathe through equipment like fish out of the water. At the peak of evolution, we have embarked on the never ending adventure as mere primates. Many might think that the length and slowness of this movie are boring? ridiculous? or just a waste of time. But before you can come to these conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with quiet music and a spaceship in the middle of the space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, in many cases, the respect legitimate it is not granted. Kubrick wants to show us the beauty, and if we do not succumb to her and relax, we will not be able to enjoy this movie as planned. It's not a regular film, we can not sit and watch as we can with other movies, it takes time, thoughts and especially commitment and feelings to watch. All of this together makes it one of the world's greatest achievements in moving images. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
