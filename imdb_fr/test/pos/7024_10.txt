One of the greatest movies of the 80s, Dirty Dancing is a low-budget movie that pays a lot. With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance, a love story that we all want to live (at least if you're a woman), it's a movie you want to see over and over again. <br /> <br /> The music, which is the driving force of the film, is optimistic and flows well with the emotions aroused by the spectator. Classic hits from the 60s such as Otis Redding's "Love Man" and Frankie Valli's "Big Girls Do not Cry" to the hits of the 80s such as Eric Carmen's "Hungry Eyes" and Frank's "Overload" Zappacosta, Dirty Dancing is a fun and sensual, showing the transformation of a shy adolescent girl into a blooming femininity, all in the beautiful setting of a summer romance that we hope and wish to turn into more. <br /> <br /> Dancing in "Dirty Dancing" should not be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer able to challenge the most fluid and flexible gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than just a fantastic job and shows more and more his talents, not only as an actor, but also as a dancer and singer. And Jennifer Gray shines as a baby, while her transformation into dance also illustrates her transformation. <br /> <br /> Overall, Dirty Dancing is one of the best movies of all time and deserves to be watched at least once. It's doubtful that Ronette's first "Be My Baby" beats in the opening title will not attract your attention and draw you into a magical world of sensual dance and musical enchantment.
