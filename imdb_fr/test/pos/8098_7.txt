Being a big fan of Charlie Chaplin following a good wave after seeing "The Gold Rush" and then "City Lights", I was eager to see "The Great Dictator" because I was told he was undoubtedly acted from his best film. I was also intrigued by the fact that it was a walkie-talkie; my first, regarding Chaplin. <br /> <br /> The beginning is typical of Chaplin and a blatant proof that in terms of sound, Chaplain can cut it while not relying solely on music to create the mood and talk; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling from an anti-aircraft gun are well related to the jokes. It was good to attract the viewer with this opening "classic Chaplin" while launching the story of characters who get to know each other. What was also well done is how Hitler is usurped. Any scene involving Hitler or "Hynkel" in this film was funny and even now; makes you think that you know exactly who is usurping and creating an internal reaction. The way in which English is mixed with the simulacrum of German during dialogue scenes is further evidence of how Chaplin has managed to adapt to the era of walkie-talkie. My favorite joke was Hynkel's five-minute speech, with the exception of the English translator who translated it in a few words; remembering pictures of Hitler, you may have already seen a speech in your life and you make fun of him. <br /> <br /> Historically, the film has also got some features. We see Hynkel being photographed with children; something that Hitler did to be recognized by manipulating the media, but here we see Hynkel yawning and bored; He stabbed Hitler's sneaky technique of convincing the German public by sympathy (oh, he kisses and kisses children, he must be OK!). The film also has the fantastic setting that a Jewish civilian was reinstalled in the ghetto among all the transvestites that take place, but with the hold that he is unconscious. Movies such as "The Pianist" and "Come and See" are two good examples of Nazi cruelty to "inferior people". Today, we can all look back and shake our heads, whereas at the end of the 1930s, when this film was filmed, the fact that it was cruel and exploited makes it an even greater feat. amazing. Chaplin has succeeded in replacing pistols and batons for tomatoes and pans and continues to remove it. <br /> <br /> What I did not like in the film was the fact that it turned into a real story after the opening. . This slowed the film and this is very visible since the foot has been slightly removed from the gas. The film began to refer to stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the neighbor falling in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace when none of them had been developed. The gags "shaving a woman" and "those who have money in the pudding act of bravo" alluded to these paths of intrigue, but in the end they only materialized by excuses for disguised gags and not funny that were disappointing. <br /> <br /> During the final stretch, The Great Dictator is encouraged by the fact that the Italian dictator is introduced, which adds to the film a bit of life and a well-deserved excuse for comedy. It works well as we see them arguing and the more underhand tactics are exploited when Hynkel tries to "control" his Italian counterpart by a series of devious tricks (although they are frustrated with humor). Despite some weaknesses in rhythm during the middle segment and the fact that I felt that the message at the end was a bit forced into my throat, The Great Dictator resists today's viewing, but it's only because he took the risk of exploiting things really knew were there.
