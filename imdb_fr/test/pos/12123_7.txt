I do not know if it's just for me to see that again. I am not a fan of gratuitous violence. I never understood that the film industry makes heroes out of members of the crowd and cold-blooded killers. When The Godfather came out, I thought they had broken the mold, but the decades have produced a series of popular movies well played by stars and major filmmakers. It is obviously small budget, but it is certainly well done. At some point, I want to take a shower. If such characters really exist, it is difficult for the soul. I still intellectualize that the human race will go beyond that kind of thing. This kind of crud must be stopped. I hope people who go in movies like this are more voyeuristic and less vicarious. I feel a little bit the same for slasher movies. Why do we have a fascination for death and dismemberment? To be fair, I judge this about acting and the director, and for what it is, it seems to work pretty well.
