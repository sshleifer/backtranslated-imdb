NOROI follows a documentary filmmaker, Masafumi Kobayashi, who slowly discovers something mysterious and evil that leaves a trail of corpses in his wake. After questioning a woman who claims to be screaming from the next house (where there is no baby), Kobayashi goes to the neighbor. He is greeted with hostility by the disheveled, disheveled woman (Maria Takagi) who opens the door (and slaps her face) and sees her 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely, the woman and her son disappear just a few days after her visit (leaving behind a pile of dead pigeons on the back porch), and the woman who first complained about the noises, as well as her daughter, are both killed in a mysterious accident shortly after. It stings Kobayashi's interest and he goes on a quest to find out what's going on. He soon discovers that those with psychic abilities and extra-sensory perception seem to agree on something sinister, inexplicable, and perhaps even apocalyptic. Kana (Rio Kanno), a well-known 10-year-old clairvoyant and television personality, seems to think that we are all destined to fail, but she mysteriously disappears before she can be very useful to her. Another psychic actress / actress (Marika Matsumoto) is involved, as is Nori, a mentally unstable psychopath who wears a hat and jacket made of aluminum foil and thinks people are devoured by what he calls " to ectoplasmic ". Clues finally bring us back to the site of a small village covered with a lake and the legend of an ancient demon called Kagutaba ... <br /> <br /> Unlike many other horror films held in the hand, it depends as much on intrigue as reactionary fear in the first person. Fortunately, there is some kind of scenario here, a very interesting and complex scenario, so it does not rely on glimpses of horrible things through spasmodic photographic work from time to time to keep your interest. Masafumi's way through the following tracks in search of truth - with well-placed shocks along the way - made me think of THE OMEN. In addition, the film is not only filmed by the documentary filmmaker, but weaves in television reports and variety shows as if what we are watching is a documentary already finished. This helps to break the monotony usually associated with movies shot in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to interfere with the realism of the "real" sequence. All in all, it's a well done horror movie, with a lot of plot changes, a bit of suspense and some really scary moments, well worth it. My only complaint is that he could have used a little trimming here and there and he seems to be going a little too long. Otherwise, good things.
