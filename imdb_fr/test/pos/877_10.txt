This film has been extremely well marketed. When he was released in '97, in the midst of the glory and success of Master P, anything and everything bearing his name was selling on the shelves. That's why it's no wonder this underground urban drama has sold more than 250,000 copies and continues to work. <br /> <br /> If you're a No Limit fan at the time or even now, take a look. He has some phatty old school videos and does not get me started with the weird strippers at the Ice Cream Party bonuses. So what I have to say to all people who do not like Master P or No Limit Records is not watching it because it's not for you and does not give you the trouble to vote for it because you only go to discourage TRU No limit fans to rent or buy this video with your votes low.
