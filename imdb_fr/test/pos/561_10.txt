Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated in the D.A. in this dramatic and thrilling documentary that plays more like a fact-made-done and how it happened. The sometimes reluctant authenticity and honesty of individuals makes it a fascinating story on many levels. Although racism is one of the topics discussed, other elements such as work ethic, integrity and grief management bring me back to watching and re-reading this film. The music is catchy but not invasive; the rhythm and the images are such that there is no doubt that they are real people who live an authentic experience.
