After seeing this movie, I realized that Drew Barrymore was a great actress. This movie would not have been viewed without Drew. The fact that someone as attractive as Drew can really get me fat, and she did it when she was "Josie Grossie". Her "transition" attempts, as the cool girls called her, were hilarious, especially if she was trying to dance in a nightclub. <br /> <br /> We also had Molly Shannon, SNL's favorite, who played an important role as Anita, Josie's best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the film was Anita who was trying to teach sex education in class. It was one of the best performances of Mollys. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski also had an important role to play and I really appreciated her presence because I know people like her who have been tortured in this way. <br /> <br /> This film is a must for fans of Drew Barrymore because Drew is making the film.
