The Kid is a very good family film about a muddy picture consultant, Russ Duritz, who has a lot of money, a good job, a nice house, etc. The only problem is that he does not have a lot of social life as no one seems to do. like him, he is not always very kind. One day, although things are about to change when an eight-year-old version of himself appears as if by magic. This gives Russ a second chance to do things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a very good performance. The Kid is a nice and comforting film for everyone.
