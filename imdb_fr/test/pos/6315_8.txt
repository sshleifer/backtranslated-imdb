The consequences of love: This film is really something special, but it is very difficult to put your finger on it. It's kind of a love story, but not really the one I saw before. There are several love themes throughout the movie. A men's love for a younger woman, a younger man's love for his older brother, mafia love of money at all costs. These are just a few examples that intertwine in a story that you guess or rather that you do not know where and how it will end. The actors are all superb, Sophia, the waitress teases, head right titta, the central character of the film. The simple and emotional work of the camera has bounced off an ever-changing soundtrack that blends a low-fi trip-trip with lush orchestral pieces. The style of the film changes beautifully using several styles without ever being cluttered. Love has never been so diverse and powerful as the stories told to us are rumbling to various conclusions. The director has married the old and new in a rich Italian classic.
