I tried to reconcile why so many bad critics of this film, while the vast majority of critics are rated 7 to 10. The reason may be that this film is difficult to describe in a positive criticism, well few have done it well enough. This film is confusing, depressing and has no happy ending. I still attributed to Pola X the note 10, because it is essentially for me literature and art combined on film. It's really my favorite kind of realization. I only saw two Carax films: this one and Mauvis Sang. As with this movie, I'm a little pretentious when I call this one of Carax's best movies, but I am. Carax has a minimalist style. If this type of movie does not interest you and is boring, it would be better not to watch it. But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang, so he had a lot of intensity for a thriller - at least for my taste. I found it quite interesting and absorbing. The two main roles did a great job in the interim. (I mean the main role and the young woman he thought was his half-sister.) Catherine D. is always great, but her role was not very important or significant in the story. But everyone did a good job. I thought the worship was great. It may not have been very credible, but that is because it is rather abstract. There is a lot going on between the lines of this movie. It is a very Freudian psychological thriller.
