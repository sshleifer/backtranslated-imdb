I loved catching it in rye, it turns out it's my favorite book. JD Salinger, the author of Catcher, has the rights to the book and made it so that no one can make a film with his permission. <br /> <br /> That said, here is "Leland's USA." Beautiful movie with a lot of meaning and depth in emotions. but a lot of that reminded me of Catcher, almost too much reminded me of Catcher. The few stories told by Leland in the film, such as visiting New York and his adventures, were very similar to those of Holden in Catcher. The way Leland considers people and emotions is also similar to other Holden. the best actor game credited with don cheadle and Kevin spacy. super editing, everything falls together perfectly, and loved the story all together. recommend as a purchase or at least a rent. good movie. <br /> <br /> it's the only thing he drags at times but offsets it in the long run. give him time and enjoy a good movie.
