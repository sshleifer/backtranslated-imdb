Deep Water (2006) **** <br /> <br /> "It's indifferent ... that's where you expect an error." These (paraphrased) words are perhaps the best summary of the nature of the ocean I've ever heard whispering. His furies are boundless, and especially his loneliness. These words come from the documentary Deep Water, fascinating and heartbreaking. This is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who competed in the 1969 Sunday Times race around the world. If you do not know his story, it may be better to stop reading now. Do not read this or any other information about Crowhurst or the race. Find the movie and watch it. <br /> <br /> After the first solo circumnavigation of the ocean in 1967, adventurers and adventurer observers began looking for the next one-up. This time, the trip should be done without touching the ground or stopping en route. Having had a difficult time, Crowhurst saw in the race an excellent opportunity to get his family back on his feet. As a child, he had experienced financial difficulties and wanted to participate in the return to such a life. So he went looking for sponsors and soon did with Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. The two men spelled the potential cash cow and granted a boat to Crowhurst, provided that if he were to withdraw from the race, he would be obliged to pay the fees. However, his boat was in dire need of repairs and he feared he would not be ready in time for the last day of departure. However, he was informed by his godfather that he was just leaving? after all, they covered the dough and waited for it many times. <br /> <br /> The details of the story are infamous: the Crowhurst boat began to take the water, and its progress was slowed down. Faced with the decision to try to get around the Horn of Africa (certain death in such a boat) or turn around (financial devastation and misery), he looked for a third option. He chose to hide, alone on his yacht, waiting for other competitors to cross Cape Horn in South America. From there, he would join the race. He reported false positions and record speeds. Then he stopped all communication for fear that his position was abandoned. He also had to carefully build fake logbooks for each day of a trip he did not undertake. Finally, loneliness, guilt and the realization that he would probably be trapped weigh on Crowhurst too much. His latest entries in the diary make Kurtz's thoughts wholesome. Only a few weeks away from home, he turned around and jumped by the sea shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst's odyssey is fascinating and its end is heartbreaking, but its inevitability. Our dreams often turn into fears and the consequences of our actions often leave us with so few options for a happy ending. This is the story of a descent into madness, teased by the infinite abyss of cruel seas. Filmmakers do a great job telling this story. It contains hearty audio and video recordings by Crowhurst, as well as stories of his increasingly exasperating journal notes. The story begins slowly and can distract some viewers, but the rewards of the story are quite valid as it progresses. <br /> <br /> There are also investigations of some other competitors, such as the Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who was about to win the speed competition, but who retired and began a second round of the world. Robin Knox-Johnston, who won the competition, is also part of the film. He donated his prize to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> Read briefly on the Crowhurst saga simply does not do justice. It's interesting of course, but a quick overview bypasses the raw emotions and strangeness presented here. The last moments of Deep Water are truly heartbreaking, listening to the thoughts of his widowed family, the adoration and understanding of his friends. It's a fascinating story, and it's the one that carries the documentary in such big channels.
