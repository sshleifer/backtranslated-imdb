Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are both notable in Johnny To's perfectly directed crime thriller, which shames Western efforts. Think of it as the "heat" of Hong Kong, but better! Everything about the movie screams class; performance to the soundtrack, from cinematography to script. The tone remains serious, but the film has a beautiful line of black humor, friendship and romance in the heart. Of course, it becomes a bit absurd later, but it would be a hard-core viewer who would not have found something to like in this movie. Thank God, Hollywood has not (yet) redone and ruined a classic. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!
