After the widespread success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television has allowed Barbra to create even more sophisticated follow-up on his second special. Streisand wisely knew, to follow the unprecedented success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, that his second special would need to raise even more the bar in matters of inventiveness and spectacle. Unsurprisingly, she has once again succeeded. Even more impressive, Streisand has managed to mount this great production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA. <br /> <br /> Once again, the special stage is divided into three separate acts. The shooting at Bergdorf Goodman department stores was so successful that Streisand and his company decided to film again for the first act of this second special. The chosen venue was the Philadelphia Art Museum, which would allow Barbra countless opportunities "to enter" into different works of art that would match the songs performed. In addition to the many artistic possibilities made possible by this place, the museum would offer the ideal opportunity to take advantage of the color shoot. <br /> <br /> After the recording of "Draw me a circle", it is against the opening credits, Barbra then walks in the museum in maid costume with the accents of "Yesterdays" from Kern and Harbach. She stops to admire various paintings and statues, often becoming the featured character and singing a thematically appropriate song. Streisand plays Hammerstein and Romberg's "One Kiss" in the role of Thomas Eakin's CONCERT SINGER and hilariously plays Chopin's "Minute Waltz" as Marie Antoinette, embracing the frenzied abstract art of "Gotta Move" by Peter Matz strikingly interprets "No It's Nothing" as a helpless Modigliani girl. However, the highlight of Act I is when Streisand compares the profiles to the bust sculpture of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti, while singing a tour de force interpretation of "Where or When" by Rogers and Hart. The Act II circus medley allows Streisand to interact with a variety of farm and circus animals, while singing various songs about the farm, circus and animals. Barbra sings "Were Thine That Special Face" to a baby elephant, interpreting "I got used to that face" like a serenade to a piglet, the campy "Sam, you made the pants too long" sang group of baby penguins and Barbra comparing their profiles with an anteater while humming "We have so much in common". Streisand also jumps from a trapeze and jumps from a trampoline to the chorus of "Spring Again", then slows things down by running a haunting version of "I stayed too long at the fair" while sitting alone on stage. Barbra also has the chance to show his house poodle Sadie in this segment and even speak a little French. <br /> <br /> The concert of Act III is once again the highlight of the hour. Dressed in a sleek white wool dress, the concert segment is presented on a stage with a unique design with a partial staircase that leads nowhere. Streisand opens the act with a sensual interpretation of "Any Place, My Home Is My Home" by Harold Arlen, before embarking on sincere versions of the well-known standard "It must be you" and the rarely heard " It is so good". So good). "Streisand then really surprises the audience with a breathtaking performance and breathtaking octave power from Sweet Charity's" Where Am I Going "ballad, of which Streisand delivers the definitive interpretation Streisand also presents Richard Maltby's "Starting Here, Starting Now" ballad, Jr.-David Shire, which contains a passionate voice of Streisand which ranks among the best vocal performances of his long career. <br /> <More than Everything else, Color Me Barbra was a showcase for Streisand's steadily increasing power.Despite the presence of even more intense visual glare, Streisand herself is still the main attraction.His voice is as beautiful as ever and this special stage was the first to show how strikingly she's photographing in color, as with MY NAME IS BARBRA, COLOR ME BARBRA was another album that was all the rage was born another album of soundtrack ranking among the five best, which was selling well. In simple terms, COLOR ME BARBRA defies tradition and presents itself as a continuation almost on par with a classic original.
