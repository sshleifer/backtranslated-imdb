Since in 1976, there was no CGI, I had the impression that the film could be viewed. The studio productions were very good and very elaborate. The background effects were very credible and always appeared as if they were part of the whole. The actors accepted the principle that the film would take place in a type of Jules Vern atmosphere where imagination and possibilities for future exploration were at most improbable. If I had watched this movie in 1976, I would have probably been impressed by man's ability to build a machine that can reach the heart of the Earth. I still wonder today why we are not all flying in our cars, but I am moving away from the subject. McClure and Cushing live fun times, mostly due to their reciprocal facial expressions, which of course makes the film a little campy that I loved. The "monsters" left something to be desired, but the story had a good base, although I feel as if another kind of "thing" could have been more credible in these circumstances. Overall, he is quite visible for his time and pleasure.
