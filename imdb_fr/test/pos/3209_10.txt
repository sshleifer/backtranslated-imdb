The best drama / comedy show on television. A carefully written show about a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter exploring life and discovering things not only about the world, but about themselves. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) finds it difficult to find a way to stay in close contact with her daughter but to guide her in the right direction, which becomes more and more difficult throughout the show. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), caught up in a world of books and learning, is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebellion, which surprises both of them. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St.James (Melissa McCarthy) and a huge variety of other hilarious characters, this show is easily one of my favorites. What really puts the series in the lead is the complex and yet incredible and witty writing that often uses references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.
