It's a nice gift for Valentine's Day. A gorgeous guy and a pretty girl fall in love trying to beat the competition in a pastry contest. Very romantic. I have been a fan of Costas Mandylor since his time at Picket Fences and he has not lost his appeal. Lauren Holly is still beautiful and adorable and both still have good chemistry together. The support cast was good too. Seeing all these wonderful desserts being prepared was a delightful sight in itself. I loved that Costas and Lauren team up to win in the pastry contest and in love. This is the kind of film that satisfies all palates, romantic and others. Hallmark always shows excellence in its programming and this is no exception. The whole family can see this movie. It also shows that love sometimes triumphs over all trials. I found myself sighing and wishing more for this film and also wanting wonderful desserts. I highly recommend this movie for all ages. A treat for all.
