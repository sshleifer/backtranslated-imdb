"Campfire Tales" is basically three spooky stories told by a group of friends after their car accident in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic story of "Crochet", then we present the group of friends returning home after the concert. They crush their car, extinguish flares and light a fire in a small abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to come in with help as they warm up by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrorized newlyweds, a girl victim of an Internet predator and a motorist in a haunted house. As they tell strange stories, each story becomes more and more terrifying, but the real shock that awaits them is coming ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the last story that they tell is probably the most scary and has some authentic and scary effects. The first story was going well, and the sequence of campers at the end was a bit scary. The second story created a lot of suspense, more than either, but his non-original plot was the fall. I remember watching this movie a long time ago, when I was eight years old on HBO, and the third story frightened me, although it does not scare me now. You will probably recognize some actors, especially Amy Smart from the first story of the interlude "hook" and Christine Taylor as one of the main actresses of the film. The twisting end was pretty interesting too, I know I did not see it coming, I thought everything was smartly restored. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you are looking for a horror movie that is worth it, praise this, you should be happy. It's an excellent anthology of classic urban legends, and the entire movie was perfectly assembled. It's much better than you would expect. 7/10.
