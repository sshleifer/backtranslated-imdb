Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictional story surrounding a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard-working, hard-working police officer at the head of a plain-clothes criminal squad that is making a name for itself by killing dangerous criminals at organized police encounters rather than locking them up in jail. His loyal officers undoubtedly obey him, but a fracture is formed when one of his officers, Imtiaz, is frustrated by Sadhu's high status and secretly competes for his killings and status. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead in his first case. A new police commissioner disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and everyone is involved in domestic politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see a thriller as well directed in India. The work of the camera is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is great when the drama unfolds. Actor play, rhythm and political subterfuge persuade the viewer that they are a fly on the wall, witnesses to the blood, sweat and tears of a close and personal view and that the events are based on the This is certainly why it is not at the beginning of the film, although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, took liberties with factual stories. Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely refined film.
