Farscape - is one of the sci-fi shows that gave me an interest in science fiction. <br /> <br /> But Farscape is more than pure science fiction. Comedy, drama and much more :) The acting is very good. Fortunately, Farscape also survived its cancellation and showed Peacekeeper Wars that it was not dead yet :) I hope there is a future for Farscape :) In my opinion, it is not no more problematic than some characters in the show are muppets. You have to look behind and you will see what beauty is Farscape. <br /> <br /> Farscape has set a new standard in television and I think it will be really hard for the new series to prove they can be equal or equal. better than Farscape. I love this show :) <br /> <br /> SaphirJD
