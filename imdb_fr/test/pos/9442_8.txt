If you really want to terrify people, choose the devil as the subject. After all, a good part of the population believes that it is real. As a result, you connect to a variety of pre-existing religious and mythological images. And you will surely have a lot of nightmares in your young audience. <br /> <br /> This episode had the appearance of a Hollywood blockbuster. In fact, having finished watching the movie, I went on another channel that was showing a recent movie Bond and I could not really cut my hair between the differences of SFX. With a minimal distribution, limited by its location on a space station; complete with overwhelming panoramic views of an imploded universe, he was as claustrophobic and intense as Alien or Event Horison. The black hole on the outside gave the impression that the black matter weight of the black hole supported the station on the planet and all that was sealed inside. And as the horror intensifies, knowing that Dr. and Rose are stuck, the sinister Ood begins to channel a disembodied voice, and then the characters begin to be removed one by one ... <br /> <br /> > the best qualities of the cream of this new company Dr Who; Girl in the fireplace and empty child. Emotionally engaging, scary and humorous, all without looking corny. It's a lot more scary than any amount of flying Daleks. But you have to wonder if this view is really suitable for children. This is not a family episode. Pity the poor parent who has to put their children to bed after this one. I'm not even sure I want to see what happens next!
