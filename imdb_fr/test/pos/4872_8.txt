It's more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular ..... but who complains? It is always fun to see the poor coyote trying different gear to get the Road Runner, then get sprayed by each of these inventions. <br /> <br /> The pursuit in the underground cave was different from the normal rate and was smart. This gave us an aerial view of the hunt in a labyrinth-like structure. I did not say it was hilarious; just different from normal surface antics. <br /> <br /> This, along with other Road Runner shorts, is featured in the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 and the transfers they offer are spectacular. The colors are beautiful.
