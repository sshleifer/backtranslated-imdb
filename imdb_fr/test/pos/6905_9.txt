This movie was really a breath of fresh air from the Hollywood crappy load I saw recently. The acting is superb and the characters are endearing and endearing. There is really not much in the story, it's simple and it works well. An easy movie to sit and enjoy. The atmosphere was fantastic and the sets really helped to advance the film and offered beautiful visuals. The film obviously has horror aspects, but is a bit more humorous about things. You will not be laughing hysterically with this one, but you will smile all the way through. The humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting does not hurt. I really watched this movie based on the fact that Ron Perlman was there. His role is a little smaller than expected, but it does not matter. the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged. If you like horror, look at this. If you like comedies, look at this. Go ahead, look anyway, it's really excellent.
