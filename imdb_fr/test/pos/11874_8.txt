One Night at McCool's is a very fun movie, smarter than it should be. Its shape is more sophisticated than I expected and its randomness was superb. The thoughts behind the film (mystery, sadism, stupid men) are infantile. That's what I have to say about this movie is that not only does he hate women, but he hates men. He really has no sympathy for any of the men. This seems to be the case because of the form, but the end says it all. Nobody cares. <br /> <br /> The first three thirds of the film are told in flashback by three characters: Dillon, the stupid bartender; Reiser, the stupid mysogenistic advocate; and Goodman, the stupid policeman, holier than you. The story is therefore always perverted by their own modified images and realities. The fantasy of Reiser's barbecue is a great idea. In the end, we never really know the truth and nothing is what it seems. Dillon has never been so innocent, etc. <br /> <br /> In fact, the rest of the movie is funny too. From the randomness of the last 5 seconds of the film to the obvious manipulation of Tyler, the film seems to have its own energy. Everything is unexpected and nothing seems to make sense. Do we really care? No. <br /> <br /> It's also a very dark comedy, but its presentation is shallow. Think Nurse Betty or Jawbreaker. Very sweet coated on the outside, dark and fluffy on the inside. If you like your random, dark or just nasty movies, see this movie. This will satisfy your cravings for the strangeness that reigns in One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> 8/10
