This film was great, I do not understand the lack of respect it provides. The first time I filmed this movie in 87-88, it was really scary. If you're a horror movie fan of the '80s, you should not have a problem with this movie. I met some of the actors and they were cool. Which is not great in a scary old house, demons, a crazy party and young handsome and horny. The dialogue and the special effect made this film a classic. This film also dealt with one of those classic horror rumors that the black man does not always have to die at the end. Even if this film was great, there is one thing that remains to discover for me what really happened to the old The end was it on purpose or not this little side story always intrigued me.
