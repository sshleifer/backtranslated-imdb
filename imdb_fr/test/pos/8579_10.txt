It's a good movie. When two people of different origins and social status think that they have nothing to offer and that they ultimately need what the other needs, it shows what the heart knows. Sometimes we wonder why a man is with a woman or vice versa and external appearances say something to us, but what they offer each other from the inside that we can not see is incredible and inexplicable. When Nimi thought that Matthew had nothing to offer him and that Matthew was only looking for an adventure (because he had an open marriage with his wife Jenny), they finally realized that they could not and would not want to exist without other. It was worth it for them to resist what their family and friends thought and society just said to be together. This film restores my faith in love.
