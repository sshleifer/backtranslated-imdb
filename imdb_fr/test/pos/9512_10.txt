I do not know what Dick Steel was talking about, but I found that this movie was one of the most exciting epics of Japan to date. Regarding Armageddon or Deep Impact, or something else The next day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. For what I know of movies, most of the disasters in movies are basically asteroid movies or one of those of Global Warming. However, it has never had a different path. A natural course means that the earth's crust begins to erode to such an extent that it will carry another piece of land. What the scientific teams had to do was to create a way to prevent erosion from eroding and sinking Japan. In most cases, this would simply be called a tectonic shift on steroids. I found the characters rather appealing from every point of view, from the child who lost his mother only to face his own disappearance among unknown friends. Or the rescue girl who does everything in her power to save lives in the face of disaster. Or a man who thought he could change his mind not to be a daring devil and go with him safely, but only to become the hero and save his homeland. And let's not forget how the rest of the world simply sent them away so as not to be forgotten, leaving the world to turn their backs on Japanese citizens who have asked for help. It was a good movie in every way. What Dick is trying to say is that this film was not shot in Hollywood, that it was made in Japan, that it had characters that compete with other actors around the world, that effects are very beautiful as he mentioned, but that's all he expected. , and nothing else. It lacks the vision of what is important to everyone and why this film had all the elements of feeling, greatness and humanity. I thought this film was great and I saw a lot of disaster movies, knowing that Japan Sinks was perhaps one of the most original and thoughtful projects I've ever seen. I really hope that Shinji Higuchi will do another of these films. Oh, and by the way, I'm not Japanese, although I would like to be in many ways. I am Canadian, born and raised. And an avid moviegoer in all aspects. Prejudicial visions are bitter and are not worthy of recognition as an opinion. Dick, you should look at it with your heart and mind more open, do not just look at the candy in the eye that makes the content of a film, look for what is most important, and understand it. They may not be American, but the Japanese have grabbed the market lately for some of the most breathtaking movies to date. That's why $ 25,000,000 is exactly what the doctor ordered. You heard right, 25 million to make this movie. Now you tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because the American actors were not there?
