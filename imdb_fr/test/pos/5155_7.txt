The big bell of a bar rings intermittently for the last orders and the inevitable haste to queue at the counter? Do we want what we need only when it is too late? Or is the irony of Cassandra's opening scenes a more eloquent reflection of our perceptions of individual existence? Director and screenwriter Roy Andersson is fascinated by his fourth feature, "You, The Living". With fifty vignettes semi-linked by a penchant for tragicomic hyper-reality, his sly interpretations and symbolic examples of life that bind us all in this great and great cosmic battle of Sisyphus. The very simplicity of these vignettes makes it possible to highlight the tenacity and the immense preciousness of being outside of the symbiotic relations that we maintain with each other. Andersson may be able to negate the complexity of the human condition by a severe and rapid cynicism, but it also reminds us of the inherent and reassuring glory of waking up each morning to a new tomorrow, when we are all aware of our own forms stopped development.
