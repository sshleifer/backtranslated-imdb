... The world might never know it. (The film that won the "best animated short" that year, "Anna and Bella", is very good, but it's not "Big Snit." Both films are available on the compilation " World's Greatest Animation "from Expanded Entertainment, in case I'd like to compare.) <br /> <br />" Snit "and his director, Richard Condie, have drawn so much attention that I do not have much to add. However, I would like to note that the film contains one of my favorite "shots" in an animated short film, the one where the man opens the door to let the cat out. I do not want to reveal the actual events described here, but the first time I saw the shot, I went from one mood to another, and a few seconds later, from another. This shot has never failed to affect me in this way since. For this shot, and for the way Condie has progressed well, "The Big Snit" deserves the title of "masterpiece".
