"The Feather River Charge" is a Western routine on the American cavalry against the Cheyenne Indians ... The film was carrying an ever-increasing tension with a pleasant diversion ... <br /> <br /> Guy Madison and Frank Lovejoy play the officers who saved Helen Westcott and Vera Miles from the Indians ... <br /> <br /> The outdoor scenes are well photographed, especially the exciting Indian Feather River load at the peak of the movie with the rain of spears, the fight to the death between Madison and Thunderhawk, the sketches of the guards brigade, even a mouthful of tobacco juice used against a rattlesnake, and the romantic interludes between our hero and Helen Westcott ... All are here, entertaining in 3-D images and Technicolor ...
