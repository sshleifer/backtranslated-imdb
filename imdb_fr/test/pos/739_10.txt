Although this is not mentioned very often, "Do not look in the basement" is a very interesting film and really worth the detour. The story tells the story of a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, recruited by Stephen's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens, after the murder of a patient. Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, acts as if she is hiding something ... <br /> <br /> sympathy for during the climax, which does not happen very often in horror movies. The score is great and reminds "Dark Shadows". The performances of Rosie Holotik, Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee are all excellent, the story is very intriguing and ends with a great twist. This film exudes a country atmosphere that no other film I have ever seen was able to capture. Many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film, which is really unfortunate because it was a classic horror. "Do not look in the basement" is definitely worth watching by all the fans of the movies proper 1970s.
