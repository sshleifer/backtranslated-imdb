I still have not read a single book by Dan Brown, but I have watched all his adaptations to the movies. I will not fall into the game to rate this one with the previous one because the scope is not really the same: in fact, this one is a thriller, a race against the clock full of puzzles. <br /> <br /> The plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I have never been a big fan of Hanks but he delivers well. I noticed her shirt in jeans (the one who shed blood) because I'm looking for one in vain! The Italian researcher is a brilliant newcomer to me, but I really applauded the portrait of Ewan MacGregor: his faith and calm are truly impressive. <br /> <br /> I really like the debate between science and religion. The action taking place in the Vatican was like a vacation. Finally, I'm not sure it helps to add new converts to Christianity. With all the gold and the human presence, everyone would wonder what charity means and why women are so far removed from the life of the church when they represent half or more of the believers.
