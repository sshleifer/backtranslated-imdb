This movie was hilarious! Sometimes it went too far, but is not that what we expect from them? The theater burst out laughing and played all those incredibly crazy stunts. It's rude, raw, and sometimes frightfully intense. The whole gang is back and even more out of their minds, which in turn provides excellent entertainment. I do not want to reveal anything, but the little snippets of clips that go around the network are nothing compared to what comes next. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie to do with friends. Try to see it with a large crowd. You will not be disappointed. But do not go with someone who can not take it (see above). It will not go well, you can be sure. But it's pretty obvious in the first place. If you enjoyed the first, you will love this one.
