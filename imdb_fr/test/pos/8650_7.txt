The whole film made me think of the first circle of Dante's Hell, where souls who are supposed to be happy are going. They never realize that they are really in a hell, but nothing is pleasant, they advance without emotion. In this sense, Dante thought they were in the worst part because they would never actively seek to change their situation. Nobody can die here, but trying to do it hurts. I do not know if the author based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the resemblance is absolutely striking. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy the movie when I watched it, I was expecting a climax that never came. Nevertheless, it made me think after and now, I actually think it's a good movie - it sure sticks.
