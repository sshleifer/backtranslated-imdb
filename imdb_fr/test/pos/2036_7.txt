ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" is the story of a person who is propelled into the glory, realize that living his dream is not as he imagined. We have seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story captures the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. He is collecting a recommendation because of his visualization of the atmosphere. The script, from the director of "Crazy / Beautiful" John Stockwell, describes the hard universe with memorable images - it does not explain what it is, it shows us. <br /> <br /> "Rock Star," originally titled "Metal God", interprets Mark Wahlberg as Chris "Izzy" Cole, a Pittsburgh office supplies salesman who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers , the fiery singer of heavy metal rock band Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings for his tribute rock band, Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on interpreting only those of Steel Dragon, and only in the exact way they are performed. His group gets angry at Chris's obsessions and gives him the shoe. <br /> <br /> It devastates Chris, as well as his parents and his faithful girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston from "Friends" on TV). He then receives a phone call. This is the Steel Dragon group. They saw Chris's recordings and want him to replace the recently sidelined lead singer. In an instant, Chris enters the vertiginous world of sudden celebrity - from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it is not as rewarding as expected. <br /> <br /> A true story inspired the concept "Rock Star". Tim "Ripper" Owens, a supply seller from Ohio, has truly replaced Rob Halford, the lead singer of Judas Priest, after singing for a tribute band. The rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what is happening must represent the experiences of many other groups. The film details the different events of being a rock star. He explores aspects of the tour, personality differences, the danger of addiction and violence, difficult relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty and extreme measures of producers to satisfy fans and maintain high popularity. <br /> <br /> I saw all the films of Mark Wahlberg, and it is the first one that has earned me the affection of all. Wahlberg, a former singer / model, has directed films such as "Fear", "Boogie Nights", "Three Kings", and most recently, Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" remake. I start to admire more and more the young actor. Although he did not play in many successful films, he took a lot of risk and played various roles. "Rock Star" is his best film to date. I can not think of many actors who could have convincingly represented the struggles and aspirations of Chris Cole. Wahlberg really does "rock star" rock. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston also illuminates the screen. She creates with Chris a rich relationship in chemistry that encourages the public to participate. It's tragic of what happens to their relationship. We care a lot about these characters. <br /> <br /> During the concert stages, director Stephen Herek (who also directed "Holy Man" and the live version of "101 Dalmatians") creates a captivating atmosphere. He captures the scenes with intense urgency and raw and undeniable energy. The musical numbers provide the film with the best and most engaging scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Herek can not maintain energy and joie de vivre. At the mark of three quarters, he loses the spark because the film becomes dull and unpleasant. I understand where the story has to go to describe the negative side of the glory, but this movie loses everything it had before. In "Almost Famous", a much better movie about rock and roll, there is some interest and life in the most painful scenes. Here, we have the impression that filmmakers lose their passion. <br /> <br /> The message comes a little too late and suddenly in the story. The film turns into a story of morality that wants to provide us with a sinister destination. The filmmakers could just as well stop everything, appear on the screen and say: "Now public, the moral of the story is ??" We understand the theme, but it's too instantaneous. Chris's personal discovery must be progressive. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, barely enough to completely destroy the eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good movie. functionality. "Rock Star" is not a great movie - "Almost Famous" if you want a great movie about rock and roll - but Marky Mark is a turning point in his career. <br /> <br />
