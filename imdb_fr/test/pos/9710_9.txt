Yes. Bam cried a few times and Englund too. And most likely you too. The whole cast is back and Knoxville has taken the lead to become the true leader of this band of retarded (I say it in the best possible way). I thought at first that Bam or Steve-O were perhaps the privileged men ... no, the main man is now Johnny. Do not get me wrong, everyone, and I mean everyone is great in this movie! From the start, you laugh and trust me, do not expect to rest that smile. Personally, I think the film definitely has better moments than the first one. You know that when you go to the theater, you do not want to have high expectations for it ..... well, this film sweeps all the expectations. If you like Jackass, you can get into huge expectations. No matter what you are going to laugh your ass. If you do not laugh, it's probably because someone has a gun in the face that tells you if you're laughing you're dying or maybe you're embarrassed by the sound of your laugh or the greater likelihood is that you ate Jack Sh! T for breakfast and Jack left the city. All I have to say is: get ready to have a sore face after the movie. :)
