I rented Boogie Nights last week and I could tell you that when I watched the movie, I had a blast. If you think that by watching the movie, you will be sick of porn. I mean yes, if you're not porn and you can not handle that, then it's not the movie to watch. But the problem is that the whole movie is not really about porn. Well in the middle of the film, it is about the porn industry, but the other half concerns the development of the character and the bad situations that live these characters. The actors played perfect roles, including Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. The sex scenes, of course, are fantastic but mostly focus on the hype of the character in the pornographic movies until there are difficulties. Excellent movie, one of the best! <br /> <br /> Hedeen Prospects: 10/10 **** A +
