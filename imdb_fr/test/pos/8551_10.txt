I was excited to see that many other people also enjoyed this movie. First looked when I was in my early teens and then again several times late at night, many times after. Unfortunately, no more. I am now almost 49 years old and wish it to be available on DVD. Why not? The best role of Anthony Quinn, no one could have been more appropriate for the part or parts he plays - I mentioned it to other moviegoers the same age and, alas, no one, to my knowledge, remember it. As a daughter of a generation that went through the Second World War and its aftermath (and myself deeply fascinated by the suffering endured by this generation), I guess this film of the day offered me a great overview cinematographic of some of the heartbreaking problems of the day. For the classic final scenes, this film stands out.
