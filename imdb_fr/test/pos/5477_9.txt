This is one of the few films of this type that I commented on and appreciated. Although Clint Eastwood is as usual, the general story works well, even within the limits of Washington DC <br /> <br /> The theme: A murderer suing the president, and only one person can save him. <br /> <br /> It's hard to make a film that will appeal to the public these days and this arena. This film succeeds on many levels. Eastwood is his usual underrated hero, wanting to save the president since the Kennedy era. He does well in this role, just like his foil, Reneee Russo (an FBI agent) overall well done and suspenseful with additional stars for Malkovich. 9/10.
