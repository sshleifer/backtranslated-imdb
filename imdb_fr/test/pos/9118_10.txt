I saw The D's new movie tonight during a special screening, and I was so blown away by its immense size that I felt I had to access IMDb and spread the word. Admittedly, I was already a big fan of D's work - I loved the HBO series and listened to their music every week (nothing better than singing), but that appreciation made me even more fearful when tonight's screening (for us, we were all disappointed one time or another by something we like when he tried to go to the big screen). With Tenacious D, "The Pick of Destiny", this is not the case. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, this movie is harder than anything I've seen and it's funnier and more majestic than any other. Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell together could produce. It tells the story of the D's before we know them, drawing intriguing stories from Kage and Jables editions, their connections and how they were inspired to write songs on topics such as Lee, Sasquatch and Dio. More importantly, they reveal the true inspiration of the world's greatest song, "Tribute", and the way it was born (different from the HBO series version). Once you have witnessed it, you will probably not be able to remember it (hence the tribute), but your mind will always be transformed by its genius. <br /> <br /> I do not go to the movies often. more because of the high price of the ticket and the difficulty of getting parking, paying exorbitant concession prices, etc., but I usually make exceptions when it comes to someone I really like or about something of the same variety. "The Pick of Destiny" was so good that I have no qualms about seeing him again when he comes out nationally, and I intend to convince all my friends to go there too. Last week we saw "Borat" and we loved it, but it's honest, GOD BETTER. For all those who really love rock and the comedy genius, see this movie. The talent of these guys is so great that you should not hesitate to support their cause. You will not be disappointed and Rock Lords will smile for you.
