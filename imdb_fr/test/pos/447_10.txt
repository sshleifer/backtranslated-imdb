The "big screen" is freshly tweaked with this beautiful film about aging well and enjoying the rainbows of life. There is a lot of silver hair on this silver screen, but the name of the film is more like 85-pass-25 with its energy, humor and thirst for life. The story of the extraordinary artist Uncle Frank, his devoted wife, aunt Tillie, and the trendy residents of local nursing homes encourages us to "live every day as if it were your last" and brings a glow of hope for those dreaded golden years. A great movie for the young and old audience!
