When I started looking at "Surface" for the first time, I was hooked. There was everything I wanted in a suspenseful show, action, mystery, intrigue and great characters. My whole family loved watching the show.It seems when there is a good show on TV, the network usually cancels it as they seemed to do with this show.They go through the Nielson rating system, which seems stupid to me, because there is a lot of junk that they seem to watch and whose networks continue the air.If only there was a way for everyone to vote on a show, then maybe the good shows will not be canceled.When I watch TV now, I only watch good shows, so for now, it's not watching a lot of TV.I hope the network will bring back the show, but when they will decide by a stupid decision, they will seem to stick to it. I hope there are many people who share the same feeling.
