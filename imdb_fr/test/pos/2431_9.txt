Anastasia: Anna's Mystery was a two-star historical film composed of V., based on Peter Kurth's book Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. Historically, it does not hurt, the names are changed, etc. But it fits very well with the real story. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom are doing rather well than the Russian royals, Tsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexandra. What kept me in mind was the too short representations of Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all, it was a pretty classy production with nice roles. I was very amazed by the values ​​of the production when it aired for the first time on NBC at the end of 1986. The German actor Jan Niklas, who had already played in Peter's other Russian epic "The Great ", was also on view. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that the second part had omitted some important details of Anna Anderson's trip to America. It is also important to know that in 1986, less was known about the story of Anna Anderson. At the time, it was still unclear whether his claim to be Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. At the end of the 1990s, we knew more and Anna Anderson is now considered a fraud. <br /> <br /> Too bad the networks no longer produce such films made for television.
