I watched this film with high expectations but I was a little disappointed. Although I like this film and I am absorbed by the story, I did not find it moved and I think the end falls flat. <br /> <br /> The story consists of a friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic cop. The location is a picturesque Korean village. <br /> <br /> This film is in some respects realistic, because it has a tragic element and yet it is not melodramatic. However, I was finally not moved by a film featuring a man who is so loved by a woman, but does not even give him the choice to enter his life. In my mind, he is a sweet and noble loser. <br /> <br /> Good points - Excellent play of the two main roles, nice snapshot of village life <br /> <br /> Disadvantages - Flat end <br /> <br /> Overall - Well, but I prefer the films before sunrise and after sunset (or is it before or after sunrise)
