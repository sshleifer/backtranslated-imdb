Seriously, people need to lighten up and accept that funny is funny, and that movie is hilarious f ** king. Better than the first and Knoxville really grew up in a pair for this movie and did stunts much crazier than the first. If Ebert and Roper (who do not say I'm a big fan of them) can look far enough than the sheer nonsense of this movie to give it 2 inches, then I think others can I did not know Too much to expect, but I was floored and it is rare that a suite is better than the original. I believe that this new past the first great time. so do what I did, just relax by trying not to mess around and laughing.
