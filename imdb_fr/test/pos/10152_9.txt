This film is the one you fall in love with. Alfred Hitchcock must always remain above the administrators of his time. The most influential aspects of his films are pure simplicity and captivating drama. Another better thing about Hitchcock's films is a definitive and striking ending. <br /> <br /> All that is said about "The man who knew too much" is less. Cinematography, role play, dialogue and camera work are beautiful in this film. The song "Que Sera Sera" at the end will remain in our memories for life. The film is so nice from start to finish that we never know when it will end. Hitchcock would rarely include humor in his films, this movie contains comic scenes that fit the film. <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely brilliant and as good as Vertigo.
