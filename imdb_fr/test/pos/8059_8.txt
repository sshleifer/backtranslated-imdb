After the Second World War, the crime in the city of Phenix, Alabama, encouraged by money from an army base on the other side of the river in Georgia, became even worse. . Gambling, prostitution, usurers, etc. helped an organized crime machine in the city. Soon it was too serious and violent to even tolerate anymore. This film is based on the true story of this fight. <br /> <br /> According to the norms of the 50s, he was scandalously explicit. Although small budget, this same small budget has contributed to the realism that requires shooting outdoors. A very hard film. Richard Kiley was wonderful, as always, and John McIntire was stupid. <br /> <br /> Why this good movie is not on video is a real headache!
