George Saunders is a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing a guard during the process. A few months later, one of his associates sells counterfeits of the book for large sums of money. One of the fake is sold to a man working for the Nazis. Not content to be caught, the Nazi leader insists on getting his money back. At the same time, an investigator working for one of the other scam clients shows up. The middle woman, anxious to protect herself, begins to play the game from all sides and organizes a meeting at the New York Public Library between the different parties. However, as people begin to die, the library is locked and more and more murders (and perhaps a few petty books) seem to be about to happen. A mystery of complex murder is a good little thriller with a big cast (Richard Denning and Richard Denning join Saunders). If there is a flaw, the film is almost too complicated with intrigues and everyone is doing well. . The layers of robbery, forgery, murder and war (it was in 1942) are almost too numerous for the brief 70-minute period. It's still a nice little film with darkness and inevitable sadness for some of the characters who clearly call it one of the first black movies. Until Denning shows up, we are among charming thieves, whom we perhaps love more than the hero, but it is clear from the act and gesture that this will not end with a happy ending, and they know it, even if they fight it. A good little movie to discover.
