Boogie Nights is one of the best movies of the 90s and I would go so far as to say that it should be in the top 250 of IMDb. I can really understand why many would not like it because of the subject matter. Personally, however, I feel a lot, judging by the claim of this film received by viewers and critics, which qualifies it as a first-rate film. This film is not surprising in this film. Individual characters touch and touch you. Since this is a film about the porn industry, we can not imagine that sex scenes can be treated with such sensitivity, but it is the case. The staging is among the best I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> The film does not deal with the story of one individual, but several. It's a character study of people who have multiple layers and who, perhaps, in an industry, would find extraterrestrials, but who still dream of the same dreams and have both advantages and disadvantages. Boogie Nights takes you through their story from the beginning, and although the film is long (almost 3 hours, I think), honestly, you do not even notice it. And when that ends, you do not want to do it too much .... <br /> <br /> I'm not easy to impress, which means there are not many movies that I would give 10 out of 10. but here is one. Beyond the multi-character study, the use of music in the film. During all my years in the cinema, the music seen tells a story as well as in this film. She was so perfect, you know it's not something you'll see every day. <br /> <br /> Burt reynold's The performance is perhaps the best I've ever seen, and Mark Wahlberg is amazing (I'm surprised, there are still people who say he's not doing well. do not know how those who would look at it might think so), but the person who really surprised me is Heather Grahem (Rollergirl), who is absolutely fantastic in her role, especially the memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in Limo, towards the end. <br /> <br /> Echo other critics of IMDb saying that this movie is not for everyone. But I still think it was topnotch.10 out of 10.
