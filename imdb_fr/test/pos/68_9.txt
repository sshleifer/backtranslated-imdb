Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this film / musical. Mrs. Andrews' opening song, "Whistling Away the Dark", will always be behind the scenes of my mind. The plot of the plot during the First World War is big and full of suspense. If you are romantic, you will love this movie. It's a film that I always like to see again and again.
