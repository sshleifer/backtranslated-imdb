One of the things I love about PT Anderson is that he has the courage to take the talent that most people put aside or put aside and make them stars. A typical example, a washed out ... Burt Reynolds delivers an excellent performance in this film. And if proving that Adam Sander can be a great actor (Punch Drunk Love) was not enough ... here is Mark Whalburg ... like you've never seen him before. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people pass up "Boogie Nights" because they are anti-porn or outright hate the adult industry and can not ignore this aspect of this movie. But below, it's a beautiful story of characters who lose everything and who fight to recover. There is a beautiful film ... and it's a shame that enough people see it.
