The 90s movie with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger is justifiably full of praise, and I enjoyed it, but this TV original is just as good and, in some respects, more appropriate. Claire Bloom is not a joyous furious, but she remains confident and throws her hat to her favorite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of his best performances). <br /> <br /> Quiet, calm and less emotional than the movie Attenborough it can be, but it does justice to what is a wonderful piece full of meaningful dialogue. You will continue to cry at this version, but perhaps you will not have the musical prompts to stand out. <br /> <br /> There is room for both. After seeing this on stage, I would say that the Ackland / Bloom one is a little more faithful. But they are both excellent.
