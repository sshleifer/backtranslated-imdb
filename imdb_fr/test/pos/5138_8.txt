I read the book in a summer reading club and we all loved it. My friends at this club have agreed not to watch the film, lest the book be ruined. I did not agree and looked at it recently with my younger brother and my parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very faithful to the book, without losing its spirit. The "new kid" theme has been shown enough for us to get an idea, but that's not what the story is about. <br /> <br /> The acting game is not the best I have ever seen, was always good and especially the kids had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting and the plot was cute and not too exaggerated. It was a children's movie that would suit adults as well as teenagers. <br /> <br /> I would like Beatrice's attitude to be a little harder, but he's still a great character. Mullet Fingers was a bit like I had imagined, except that his hair was a little visibly dyed, with blond hair and dark eyebrows. Roy worked very well as a little boy and new kid, especially when it comes to interactions with his parents and friends. <br /> <br /> make a good cheer-up movie for a rainy day. All in all, it was a great movie that you can watch again and again every time you need to remember that the world is not a horrible place after all.
