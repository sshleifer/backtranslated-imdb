In "Lassie Come Home", "National Velvet" and "Lassie's Courage", Elizabeth Taylor was eleven years old ?? Nevertheless, her charm and beauty were extraordinary, and what she lacked in talent and experience was well hidden in a beautiful production nominated for five Oscars ?? <br /> <br /> As a horse trainer or dog owner, as a despised wife or mistress, Liz is a woman who is absorbed in the gift and reception of love: the devotion to the object of passion is at the center of his life ?? Little Liz lavishes love on horses and dogs with remarkable intensity ?? Ecstatic; Dreamy to the turbulent, persistent emotional life, the young Liz devotes herself to the award-winning horse as she will devote herself later to men ?? <br /> <br /> Anticipating her subsequent images of the young sex goddess, Liz as Velvet is both holy and mature ?? Howard Barnes, in the New York Herald Tribune, described her as a child who "lights up the integrity of a great passion." <br /> <br /> Directed by Clarence Brown with special attention to detail, the movie that makes her a star is a big hit from another era's bookstore in Sussex, England, where Velvet Brown, a Butcher's Daughter, Teams Up with a Rover A teenage girl named Mi Taylo (Mickey Rooney) trains for the competition with a horse she won in the draw. <br /> <br /> From the coastal plains with its beaches, rolling hills, cottages and miles of walks, the "National Velvet" is the product of a bygone era in the making of movies ?? <br /> <br /> Closely following the structure of the popular novel Enid Bagnold, the film is both a horse story and a family portrait: workout and driving scenes are balanced by warm family scenes , thumbnails on young love and mother's sermons on the virtues of courage and endurance ?? <br /> <br /> The Browns are a noble version of the rustic Hollywood ?? Dedicated to a sober work ethic, they lead a quiet and exemplary life ?? Mrs. Brown (Anne Revere) is the very spirit of popular wisdom; the spokeswoman of common sense and fair play, she knows well enough not to silence the semi-hysterical energy of her crazy horse girl, and she lets her dream? <br /> Anne Revere won an Oscar as Velvet's mother, just like the editor-in-chief Robert J. Kern ??
