I loved this film! Yes, it's pretty cheap and I'm sure many critics will make it suspicious. But my god, they cash a lot of money. I remembered the first works of Sam Raimi. Yes, it's rough, but has good energy and a lot of fun. The actors go from very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser to less good in some smaller parts. Is it a cult movie? Well, that grew on me. The first time, I liked it, but at the 3rd session, I liked it a lot. The film is probably a 7 out of 10 but I give it 8 for pure cheek. Anyone who can get 8 dollars is worth a look. It almost makes me want to visit Scotland!
