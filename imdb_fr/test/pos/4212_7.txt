It's always a good feeling that a movie delivers the goods when you're not expecting it. The Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys have found themselves in many uneven films and have generally performed better in a supportive role, such as in "Angels With Dirty Faces". Here, their presence as a backdrop to the story of a boxer accused of murder leaves them plenty of time in front of the screen without interfering with the main action. <br /> <br /> John Garfield is the light heavyweight champion, Johnny Bradfield, a paw rapper from the South who is very different from the image he portrays in the world of sports and the press. When a journalist inadvertently learns that Johnny is a party fan, his intention to reverse this information in a column is interrupted by a bottle of whiskey from Johnny's director, Doc Ward (Robert Gleckler). In turn, Doc asks Johnny's girlfriend, Goldie (Ann Sheridan), to run with him to avoid the legal hassle of the journalist's death. As the two flee, a police chase ends in a burning car wreck. Doc's body is mistakenly identified as Johnny in the gold watch he was wearing. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains takes a sneer from Edward G. Robinson who does not. It's a detective job that was reassigned to the morgue after a bad arrest a few years ago. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a very good idea that the body in the car accident was not Johnny. He harasses his boss to give him the closed file, and is given the mandate to remove him from the city. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Johnny is asking his lawyer for advice and getting even worse when he gets stuffed for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. Johnny goes to the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona, owned by a crusty Granny Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is the legacy of Granny's brother, a deceased priest in Brooklyn, and now houses a group of street boys (The Dead End Kids) working on the farm. Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this one, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dickson) becomes Johnny's romantic interest, now she is named Jack Dorney. <br /> <br /> I get fired. from the historical perspective offered in these pre-war films. When Johnny and the boys walk in the farm truck, they fill up at a gas station for $ 1.28! Tommy (Halop) has the idea that a farm gas station would be a great way to earn extra money, and with that thought, Jack Dorney decides to hire a barn boxer who offers $ 500 a turn anyone who can stay in the ring with him. The clich√© premise is a bit off when Jack is eliminated in the fifth round, but at that point he won enough to give the farm a chance to fight. Maybe Grandma Rafferty should have been in the ring, she almost took everyone around her from the ring. As Johnny / Jack arrives in the locker room, Inspector Phelan is on hand to put him in custody. Knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this necklace, one has to wonder if Phelan will follow up on his arrest - you will have to watch the movie to find out. <br /> <br /> I love Dead End. Movies where Leo Gorcey is in charge, but he does not have much to do in this one. However, he makes an excellent movie about the ticket taker at the door of the boxing match. Another thought - would not it have been great that the picture still on the priest's wall was Pat O'Brien's? <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good entry in both cases. the filmography of John Garfield and Dead End Kids, and a fun way to spend an hour and a half. If there is a problem, it's not enough time in front of pretty Ann Sheridan. The film could have been even more satisfying if the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson were reversed, as the on-screen chemistry between Peggy and Dickson's Dick seemed more forced than natural.
