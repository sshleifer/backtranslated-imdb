This film could be likened to a "comfort food" for the soul. Anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a relationship might have a connection with this movie. So many parts of it are so hilarious and so much so terribly true. It's not perfect in its production or even in its dialogue, but the story is unique, which says a lot for modern comedies "romantic". Luke Wilson is at best bland, but Heather Graham does an outstanding job in my opinion. Try it - despite the jacket of the DVD. The character of Joline raises many problems in our culture of self-service. She asks us if the commitment is really for the other person or for ourselves. Really, it's ourselves. Accomplishing promises (from marriage to running for a friend) is a great feeling. Moreover, our word is nothing but a puff of smoke that changes shape. Joline is like an alarm clock. We must be aware of our words and commitments, they mean more than we think. At the same time, we must not commit ourselves to someone who is unable to do the same thing.
