I have a completely biased point of view mainly because I live and enjoy the lifestyle of club culture. As a DJ and used to clubs, I see the honesty of this film and I like it a lot. If you do not know the club / rave culture, it will be a good foray into this culture for all those who do not know it first hand. The honest portrayal of human emotion and the problems of the Jip Party that I loved. The characters were well built and I really enjoyed this movie. I really do not like the fact that you have to write ten lines on this website. I will write at least 6 or 7 but I feel that I can describe my point with less than ten. Here are some additional lines to make the IMDb gods happy.
