probably the best horror movie in five years ... there have been lame remakes, attempts to scare you (when they just make you out of the theater) and movies that just should not have been shot. but this one is worth it. The only reason I did not give a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but its death scene makes up for that, believe me). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS of all the scenes of death in the movie .. <br /> <br /> 1. my favorite death scene - Paris Hilton's! After finding his boyfriend Blake lying on the floor with a knife pulled from his neck, Paige starts to run. well, brisk walking is more respectable. she thinks it's like a garage with all those cars in it. then one of the killers cuts her ankle down (all the time holding a huge metal spike) so that she drops it and hides behind that car. the killer takes it and as he looks out the window, he throws it through the window and throws a bullet into his forehead. I have never been so excited or sneered in my life. <br /> <br /> 2. Paige's boyfriend, Blake, gets his neck stabbed, then the murderer walks over to him (while he is on the floor) and walks on, pushing him further down his throat ... then he dies. <br /> <br /> 3. Elisha Cuthbert (Carly) (one of the hottest girls of all time) does not die PHEW but her lips are super sticky, her fist in her face and part of her index finger sliced ​​(yeah, I wanted to lift myself 4. Carly's twin brother also survives, but not without being kicked and injured in the leg with a stab. <br /> <br /> 5. The best friend of pseudo, Dalton, is thrown on a staircase, then decapitated. his body is dragged and we see his eyes blink ... then he covers himself with wax. <br /> <br /> 6. wade (Carly's boyfriend) has the Achilles tendon cut by a massive pair of scissors, then attacked by the same scissors. he does not die, but is covered with wax and, twice, his skin is accidentally removed, thus revealing his bloody and unpleasant flesh. Yum. <br /> <br /> Really VALUE YOUR MONEY.
