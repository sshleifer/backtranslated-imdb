When the new outer limits began, the episodes were rather optimistic and stimulating. As the series began to weaken, most episodes simply became ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the best and the worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Since The Outer Limits always preaches a morality. I would like to offer mine. Starting with the most entertaining chess. <br /> <br /> 1. Afterlife: As an institution, the US military-industrial complex is both perverse and paranoid, not to mention stupidity. However, individuals with great integrity serve our country, and they will obey their conscience even at a staggering cost! In the end, extraterrestrials do not need to say a word. Those who have no conscience are fools who must be the object of total contempt! <br /> <br /> A truly subversive episode! A film that should be broadcast on television in prime time for everyone to see! This could be a revelation for some, but people without conscience should not be allowed to serve in our armed forces! The ends do not justify the means either! <br /> <br /> 2. Theory of relativity: a good person can be forced to take a split second between good and evil in order to save the lives of helpless intelligent beings and at a high cost for self. What makes this decision even more difficult is the tricky choice: to be stuck with foreign exotic strangers with whom we can not even communicate, except by gestures, or to get along with a group of people who, at his notice, will protect you from unknown dangers, even if they are unforgiving and devoid of compassion! <br /> <br /> This episode is great! What fuels this depravity is good old cupidity. This episode is one of the most scathing indictments against capitalism, transnational corporations and environmental rape I've ever seen in my life! Unlike real life, justice is served here - and quickly! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable phrases is where the ruthless corporate thug has said something about it: "We did the same thing in the Amazon rainforest war." Alluding to the killing of Amazonian Indians who were trying to protect their rainforests from bare mining, as a justification for the massacre again in the name of "survival of the fittest". Something that Darwin never wanted to take literally! <br /> <br /> 3. Alien Shop: Huge power can be used for good, even by an exotic stranger. This power can be used to heal rather than destroy. Simple mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if he can. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it takes a strong medicine, but we can all wake up and change our self-destructive ways! <br /> <br /> 4. The Grell: An alien can be a Christlike figure! In the distant future, slavery can be justified, again, in the name of opportunity! Basically, the right people can be corrupt. Sometimes a person has to experience great shame in order to see the harm they are doing. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Those who hold political power have enormous responsibilities! Another work of genius! As a species, "Do human beings learn from history?" <br /> <br /> Flop number 1: Quality of mercy: loose lips, sunken ships! In times of war, keep quiet about important military projects. Gee, did I really need to watch a one hour drama to understand that? !! I wonder if the designers of The Outer Limits had run out of ideas or if the companies had unplugged the plug? Dark and ugly, serving no purpose, but in despair! <br /> <br /> Flop Number 2: Beyond the Veil: Too bad, there is no morality other than this one: When you are locked up in a psychiatric hospital, use common sense, s 'please! This episode is so bad that it disgusts. What a scam X-Files! Do not waste your time on this one! You'll thank me later! <br /> <br /> It's a sad comment that The Outer Limits dropped into the tubes late in the race. Subversive episodes, like the first four, could not last forever! It was a miracle that they were done at all! Let's hope that one day, other courageous souls will follow the subversive tradition of Outer Limits on a new territory! <br /> <br /> If you're such a daring person, a one-of-a-kind book: "Anatomy Of Wonder: An Essential Guide To Science Fiction", edited by Neil Barron! As far as I'm concerned, the most comprehensive book ever written on the subject.
