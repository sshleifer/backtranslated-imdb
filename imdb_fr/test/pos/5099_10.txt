Peter O'Toole is Arthur Chipping, a Latin teacher who scrupulously respects details and helps young minds understand the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is perceived as being cold and unfair and not in tune with his time. But after meeting singer Katherine Briskit (Petula Clark), a theater actress, not only at a late dinner after a London performance in London, but also in an amphitheater in Greece, her closed world begins to open. <br /> <br /> Goodbye, Mr. Chips is a musical remake of MGM from the 1939 film, also from MGM. Meanwhile, the musicals were over and the Hollywood studio system was completely upset. At the premieres in New York, Los Angeles and London, the musical numbers were left intact, but when it came to major street theaters around the world, there were no songs, which made the film is shorter and gagged to the maximum. <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA Home Video under Ted Turner in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when VHS and Laser Disc were the main video formats for the home, the music numbers were been restored and gaps filled. However, Laserdisc was the only format chosen to display Goodbye Mr. Chips in the widescreen Letterbox format. <br /> <br /> For a while, the soundtrack of the film was only available on the original vinyl and cassette. We still find it today on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the great people of Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the soundtrack was remastered digitally and remixed in a set of 3 CDs including the fully rebuilt score, the one from 1969. album general release , and narrated sequences of music source and interviews an abundance. You also get an unused song that is a real lost gem, "Tomorrow with Me" by Petula Clark, who would have been chosen instead of "You and me" before. <br /> <br /> This film is both a classic musical and a true tribute to educators around the world. I would definitely buy this movie if Warner Bros. MGM and Sony were putting their money where it was and restoring it from all sources and putting it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells put back in place. Place with all the extras you can find and stuff in one version.
