This film, with all its complexity and subtlety, is one of the most stimulating short films I have ever seen. The topics are ugly, cynical and sometimes even macabre, but the film is beautiful in its language, clever with its angles of view and beautiful in its style, skilfully recreating the news of the same name written by a news editor, Tobias Wolff. <br /> <br /> Do not want to spoil the film, I will not go into any detail, except to say that this film is beautiful in itself. He is proud of what he does and does it well. It shows the most important memories of life, all of which can be overcome by the most elusive feeling: unexpected happiness. This film, of its own free will, created in me the same feelings that the main character (Tom Noonan) felt when the words transformed his very existence, which is an impressive feat.
