Here is another 1940 western that I watch every time it goes on TCM or FMC, because although it may have flaws in the story, it is extremely entertaining and well played, in addition to Randolph Scott, my actor preferred, second to Gary Cooper, OK, fourth behind COOP, Charlton Heston and Gregory Peck. Anyway, the film itself, anyway, is historically quite accurate and, as I said before, played well and "flows" very well - I bet I saw it 50 or 60 times and that each viewing is more pleasant than the one before. I have it on tape of TCM, but I would buy it in a minute if it came out on DVD. See if you have not done it, I guarantee you will love it!
