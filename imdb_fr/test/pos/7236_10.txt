Tromeo and Juliet (1996) is another jewel in the film archive of Troma Studios. Like The Toxic Avenger, Troma's War, Nuke's High class, the firmer terrorist and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. This film is an instant classic of Troma. James Gunn updates Romeo and Juliet taking a medieval tragedy and reinventing it as a modern street punk drama. If you have seen or read the piece before little change, except that it has been "tromatised". <br /> <br /> Lloyd Kaufman adds his own twisted vision to the screenplay and makes it an extremely enjoyable film. The actors manage the scenario very well. I was surprised by the quality of the dialogue, much better than that of some big budget Hollywood actors using a monstrous budget and expensive sets. I really enjoyed this film. Lloyd Kaufman does not disappoint because you know what to expect from his films and other productions Troma. I would rather watch one of his films and amuse myself than watching an expensive and boring movie with pampered actors, lame scenes, lazy filmmakers and those terrible C.G.I. special effects. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. If you like fun movies with nerdy special effects, both powerful and inspired, this movie is for you!
