Without a doubt one of the best Indian movies of all time. Of course, it does not say much (I drew this conclusion after 15 minutes of observation). But I can really say that Fire is also one of the most beautiful and brilliant films I've seen. <br /> <br /> Beautiful because of his images. The best example I can give is the parallelism between the two main female characters (Radha and Sita) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology. Sita, for example, is the wife of the venerable Lord Ram. According to legend, Ram subjugates his wife by making her cross a fire to prove her "purity". Sita, in response, cries and leaves him, finding his mother (Earth). This story has all kinds of crazy connections with the stories of the two Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word "fire" suddenly has several meanings: marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood and probably some others that I did not understand. <br /> <br /> Brilliant because of its social connotations. Many who have been offended by the premise of this film should actually be the first to see Fire (for example, my mother, who really loved her). Why? Because if fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, it's his strength, NOT his weakness. Traditional conservative social mores (Indian, Canadian, American, etc.) are useless if they enslave you. Gender roles and self-denial can do that. <br /> <br /> That's what I took with me after seeing Fire. Hat in Deepa Mehta ??
