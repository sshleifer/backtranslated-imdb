Certainly, this proves without a shadow of a doubt that Patricia Arquette is what she is promoted: a ACTRESS! This is undoubtedly his best time to act and it certainly deserves the credit for his work. Never in any of her other films, with the possible exception of Holy Matrimony, she was totally credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Plot: A young woman finds herself in Southeast Asia and is suddenly thrown into the political ravages of the countryside. She witnesses mass murders, totalitarianism and escapes. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you MUST see or have not seen all the best Hollywood movies. I rank it 58 in the 100 best movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Thank you Bob
