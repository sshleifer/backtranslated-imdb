For those of you who have no idea what Bug Juice was or was, it was a reality TV show for kids about real kids living at the summer camp. Bug Juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp. It was full of romance, friendships, fights, overcoming your fears and coping with the difficulties of living away from home for 2 months. It was an amazing show that is no longer broadcast on TV regularly, but is amazing not-the-less. The show was never boring and always attracted my attention. It's really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it is before leaving. In addition, Disney has done a very good job in selecting camps to present because those who want to see a show presented in a camp only last a week. The length of the camps was perfect for this show and the environment in which they were was fantastic. They housed camps throughout the United States, each offering unique activities to campers. It was a really amazing show, without script.
