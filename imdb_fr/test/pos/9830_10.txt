Random Hearts is a very well directed actor, perfectly scripted and perfectly interpreted for the main roles. I found it so intense that you have to stop and ask yourself, in almost every scene, that Harrison and Kristin are together, how their characters handle this horrible situation in which they find themselves. A very talented actor. I think that many people who do not like the film for what it is, did not understand the purpose of the film or could not even imagine a situation similar to theirs. <br /> <br /> you have not seen the movie yet) <br /> <br /> I loved the end, which was a very nice surprise and that tied the film. It was a relief to see how these two good people can really get along in the end. <br /> <br />
