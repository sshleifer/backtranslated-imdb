The film ignored by Jay Craven's crime is a breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic world and derived from the independent film. First of all, photography is pure aesthetic pleasure, capturing all the gloomy beauty of northern New England in the late fall (director of photography Paul Ryan directed the second unit of Days of Paradise in Malick). Secondly, the performances are uniformly excellent - Noel Lourdes by Rip Torn is irresistibly charming and Bangor by Tantoo Cardinal is both sensitive and exuberant, to say nothing of a beautiful cast. But overall, it is a tribute to the narrative strength of the film that the story retains a strong and lively rhythm while unfolding at its own pace, and that the film reaches a conclusion, natural and authentic, that does not seems not expected yet. It is one of the few dignity cells in the world of independent film, a film that explores a small piece of the intersection between man and history.
