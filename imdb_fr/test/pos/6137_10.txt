I agree with many other commentators here. It was an excellent film and an even better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I think the author died before he could see this movie. The performances are all first class, the three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross and Veronica Hamel) seem well designed for their roles. The exteriors, both in Europe and Israel, seem very authentic, and the duration of the 4-hour mini-series was perfect for telling this story. Fortunately, I filmed this on television and I have enjoyed watching it ever since. I can say without hesitation that it still holds today. I gave it a score of 10. If you have not read the book, you should really find a copy. It would be an exceptional film to be released on DVD with extras that could easily include interviews of the cast.
