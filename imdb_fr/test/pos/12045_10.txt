Watch this movie just to see Shahrukh Khan say "I love you, K-k-Kiran ..." It's both heartbreaking and scary to say, from start to finish. This film made it famous and I totally recommend it: D It's very entertaining, the music is bad and you're going to laugh with Shahrukh here ... You're really going to be scared for the hero and the heroine and Strangely you will identify with at least one of the characters. You will feel sad and happy, relieved and scared at the same time. Go see this classic Bollywood movie with your good friends and good food and spend a day. And after seeing the movie, let the songs and landscapes re-emerge in your mind ... forever.
