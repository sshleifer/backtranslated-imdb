This film was a masterpiece of emotions and human experiences. I think a lot of people are involved in Leland's apparent mental illness as a scenario, but I was drawn to the relationships of many characters and what they reveal about the strength of human emotions. A big part of the movie's message is that we never know the good without the harm, which is a bit of a clich√©, but what makes this film so good and original is that it very eloquently describes the overwhelming force and devastating that evil can have. that you see evil everywhere like Leland, or that you feel the absolute helplessness of an unrequited love or a relationship that will not work, no matter how much you want it. This film shows how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie I've seen, and it's as depressing as a good movie.
