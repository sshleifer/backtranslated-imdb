I queued this movie on a whim after a recent trip to New York, and I could not believe I had never heard of it anywhere! It has all the ingredients of a cult classic, starting with the characters. These are archetypal roles that we recognize in all areas of daily life, but have been very nuanced and fully realized by the actors who play them (the performances of Peter Stormare and Bai Ling were particularly strong). Their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time a subtle and offbeat humor that is (unfortunately) far too rare in American films nowadays. Screenwriter / director Ramin Niami does a wonderful job weaving these scenes into a fun and moving portrait of a city from the past. Highly recommended!
