Fascinating and fun, Lights of New York is the first feature that is fully spoken and almost never seen the light of day. <br /> <br /> Two naive barbers (Eddie and Gene) from outside go into smugglers and make a speech. When a policeman is shot by a cop, the police begin to approach him and the Hawk (who shot the officer) decides to assign the murder to Eddie, ordering his henchman to take a ride. But it is the Hawk himself who shoots the ball and who will surprise little. <br /> <br /> Shot in a week at a cost of $ 23,000, "Lights" was originally designed as a two-wheeled, but Foy took advantage. The absence of Jack Warner to extend it to six. When Warner discovered it, he ordered Foy to reduce it to the original short film. Warners really only watched the film with an independent operator who offered him $ 25,000, which cost him $ 1.3 million. <br /> <br /> At the moment, this is an extremely crazy piece. From passable (Eugene Pallette) to trance (Eddie's Granny in a particularly ludicrous scene) and much of the game is at the vaudeville level. Since this is a first walkie (preceded by 4 parts), that's about all the characters do, and very slowly. The scenario seems improvised, the visual style is non-existent (except for the shooting scene in silhouette) and the scenes are lost without end. Title cards intertwine and redundantly announce characters and places. <br /> <br /> Still, "Lights" is a captivating experience, as we watch actors and teams struggle with extraterrestrial technology and change the cinema forever. <Br /> <br /> Catch him if you can
