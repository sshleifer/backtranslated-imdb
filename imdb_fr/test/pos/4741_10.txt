After watching "Waco: rules of engagement," I sat in disbelief of what I witnessed. A big concealment by the FBI, a massacre by government agents gung-ho / trigger happy? I remember very well the impasse of Waco, I was 17 at the time and I watched all this on CNN. I remembered thinking about all the children as I watched the Mount Camel compound burn in April 1993. I remember being sorry for the children, but I clearly felt it was the fault of their perverse leader David Koresh and other Davidians. Gazecki's film shows clearly and without doubt, even if it is biased, that the FBI lied again and again. I think this film contributed a lot to the reopening of a new investigation into the incident in 1999. The results of this new investigation were predictable, the ruling being based on a fact as gray as the facts that the Davidians presented. The verdict really disappointed me because, as far as I know, he did not take into account all the lies, misinformation and concealment of evidence by the FBI and other officials. Why is nobody being prosecuted for obstructing the work of Texas Rangers investigators? Why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and bulldoze the complex shortly after the incident? These are questions that the government has not answered. More importantly, what about children? In this new investigation, I did not know who was responsible for spraying the flammable CS tear gas in a compound with many risks of igniting this gas, and I found no answer as to whether the muscles of the children were contracted under these effects. gas while they were alive. If they did, I would think that Janet Reno or the leader of the raid should be charged with mass homicide or manslaughter. The question that was raised by Gazecki but not mentioned is; Was a direct plan for the managers and their tanks to drill holes and set fire to the building? (a plan that would have been accomplished with an efficiency of 112%) or were the officials in charge so incompetent that they did not know that their actions had consequences? Both are equally scary. Even though the Davidians set fire to the complex, the responsible officials surely gave them the opportunity to do the work. If the officials knew, as they claimed, that the Davidians would fire the complex, why the f? Did the tanks pierce every hole in the building to make a furnace and why did not they plan to deal with the fire that they thought would happen? Dark questions that are still not going to disappear The last and most important of this film is the way the Davidians are demonized by the government through the media, which simply pass it on to the public. I clearly remember the resentment I felt for the devilish Davidians I saw on CNN in 1993. Now that I'm older, I can see a clear line of communication coming out of government every time it prepares for a massacre of civilians along with the targeted targets. Demonize people with words like; "they have different illegal values, so we", "they do not enjoy freedom" and "they pose a threat to our freedoms and our way of life" makes them so much easier to kill ????
