Adorable cartoonist Hoops McCann (a wonderfully engaging performance by John Cusack) and his best friend George (the delightfully impassive Joel Murray) travel to Nantucket for the summer after graduating from high school. Hoops, George and several new friends come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore, the most charming of the two), a singer whose family home is threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer / director Savage Steve Holland offers a barrage without stopping, often hilarious, wacky and spicy, jokes certainly wide and silly, but always very amusing. The constant madness of madness has a vertiginous, joyful and infectious vitality that can not be disliked or resisted. In addition, the lively and enthusiastic play of excellent distribution adds enormously to the zany joy: Bobcat Goldthwait in Spastic Stork, Tom Villard in his imbecile Clay, Curtis Armstrong in Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf in Fantasy Jerk Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern in the role of the nasty Teddy, Kimberly Foster in the biscuit, Joe Flaherty in the awesome Raymond, William Hickey in the grumpy old man, Jeremy Piven in the role of the bully tyrant Ty, and John Matuszak in the role of the biker,. Isidore Mankofsky's sleek cinematography, the thrashy hip soundtrack, the cool Cory Lerios rock score and the brilliant animation are all consistently excellent. The most amusing scene: an egg in Godzilla costume terrorizing a chic dinner. An absolute hoot.
