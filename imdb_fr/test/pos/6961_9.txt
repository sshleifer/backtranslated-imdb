If there is one theme of this film, it is that people can face the difficulties by having a good imagination. This family is poor, their father works in a cemetery and their mother works as a double team. Peter is constantly chosen for a variety of reasons and is increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl. He's just starting to get close to that age of 10 or 11 when your perceptions start to change and he thinks your appearance is beginning to count. This story is set against the backdrop of the 1967 World Exposition and Canada's centennial. The greatest moments of the film occur during the various fantastic sequences where we see how they manage. Look at the flim, and if you've ever had a childhood friend with whom you dreamed and then lost for some reason, you'll really love this movie. Children may like this film, but only adults will really appreciate it, including references to the Bolshevik and what parents will do for their children.
