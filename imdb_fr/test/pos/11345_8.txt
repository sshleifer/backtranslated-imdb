In Hong Kong, in 1962, publisher Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, as well as secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband moved to an old building at the same time. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments located on the same floor. Their wives and husbands stay away from home most of the time. Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they love the stories of kung-fu, noodles and soap from a restaurant near the building. Their close contact becomes a friendship and a kind of platonic and repressed love. Later, they realize that their classmates have an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and her probably repressed state of married woman keep her at a platonic level. 'In the Mood for Love' is a very slow, beautiful, melancholy and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film did not have a script and the actors were not sure what they were going to shoot. Later, the director published his story on the basis of footages. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of several years in history until 1966, when his conclusion is intentionally open and ill-defined, leaving questions such as: who is the boy with Li-Zhen? My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Amor To Flor da Pele" ("Love on the surface of the skin")
