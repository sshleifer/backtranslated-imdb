The whole series, not just The Blue Planet, is not surprising. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode about the depths looks like a trip into space! We observed this with our 10- and 7-year-old boys, and not all four managed to escape. We read a negative comment about it and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned at school. It's also the best view we've ever seen of television or a film about the delicate balance of our ecological system. The time and effort spent capturing these shots is obvious when you sit down to watch this series. <br /> <br /> A must for everyone.
