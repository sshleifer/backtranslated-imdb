In the '60s and' 70s, David Jason was known for his many roles in TV comedies such as "Do not set your stage!", "Hark At Barker" and the "Doctor" series. In 1974 he landed his first lead role in London Weekend Television's "The Secret Life of Edgar Briggs," written by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna. <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs is a secret agent of the "SIS" ("Secret Intelligence Service"). He is sincerely trying to do his job well but still seems to be doing stupid things. Surprisingly, however, he still manages to get to the bottom of the business, much to the surprise of his colleagues - "Buxton" (Michael Stainton), "Spencer" (Mark Eden) and "Cathy" (the charming Elizabeth Counsell), All these responses to the "Commander" (Noel Coleman). <br /> <br /> Briggs is married to "Jennifer" (Barbara Angell), a woman who looks a lot like Michele Dotrice's "Betty" in "Some Mother's Do 'Ave' Em! ', to the patience of a holy and remains faithful to her smart (but well-intentioned) husband. <br /> <br /> Like 'Some Mother's Do' Ave 'Em' and 'The Baldy Man', 'TTSLOEB' was completely laced with a slap. each episode, Jason performed stunts like falling from a high window sill or falling off a ladder while decorating his apartment - it was really "cream cake in the face". /> <br /> "Edgar Briggs" did not have much success, because of the bad programming of ITV Dommage because it was a funny and amusing show, well served by its star and its excellent casting. The main man, however, did not seem to like the experience of the show.Jason Jason vetoed the rehearsal of screenings because he had the impres that his role in this film was not refined. Admittedly, the David Jason who played the roles "Del Boy", "Inspector Frost" and "Pop Larkin" is very different from the one who played Briggs, but his role was not purely refined. Most of the actors would have turned Briggs into a ridiculous caricature, but Jason's performance made it a believable and realistic figure. Bizarre maybe, but not unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Jason's next vehicle was "Lucky Feller", in which he played "Shorty Mempstead", Mom's boy. He also failed to do the assessments. His stroke of luck came in the form of A. Sharp's "A Sharp Intake Of Breath", in which he played Peter Barnes in the disaster area for four series between 1977-1981. So, although not exceptional as such, "Briggs" is an easy and useful watch. Beautiful "James Bond" theme, too!
