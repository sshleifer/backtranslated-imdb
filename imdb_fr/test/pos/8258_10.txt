please, why not put this fantastic movie on DVD, I look for years, as the previous author, what is the problem, or I show it on TV. It's so underrated that it's one of the most romantic and beautiful books I've ever read, and I think I've read a few. I seem to believe that it was read on radio 4, but I do not find it either. Why not try to do it again, I promise you it will be the first source of income, people love this kind of stories. So, please release him and get out of our misery or rework it, although I doubt it can be improved. Has anyone read the same author or seen the film with Jennifer Jones, it's superb, but not to the same extent.
