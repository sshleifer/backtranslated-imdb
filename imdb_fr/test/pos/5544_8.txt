Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are a joy to watch in this dumpling comedy. Alec Baldwin, who was a rising star at the time the film was shot, is funny. Dean Stockwell, in a John Gotti post, is hysterical. But Mercedes Ruehl, as a paranoid and higher than Connie steals the film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme, previously known for his wacky comedies like "Something Wild" and "Melvin and Howard", proves once again that he is a genius. I was not surprised at all when he won the Oscar for leading "Silence of The Lambs". The performances evoked by her actors in "Married" are inspired and the audience is taken on a wild and woolly excursion. <br /> <br /> One of the cutest and most endearing films of the 80s, it stands out and shoulders above many satires of its era.
