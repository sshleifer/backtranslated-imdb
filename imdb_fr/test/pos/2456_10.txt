Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrait of a veteran Vietnam war veteran but haunted by it. Bates plays a helpless mother who just wants the family to be a "family". Sheen is great as a father who tries to understand what his son is going through, but who is too principled to really empathize. The setting is Thanksgiving day and the parents come for dinner. Estevez, who plays the veterinarian back, does not want to be part of the family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues at dinner, explaining: "That's what I wore last Thanksgiving." Quarrels and family disputes are invaluable, especially the "peanut crisis", but the end is both gripping and terrifying. It must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best movies I have ever seen.
