I give this a 10 out of 10, not because the plot was hard to discover because it was not ... but because it leaves a lot of care for the characters. The acting is superb, especially Joan Hickson, and it's a wonderful episode because of her heart. <br /> <br /> Following Jason Rafiel's last request, Miss Marple is asked to investigate and resolve a murder committed seven or eight years ago and she must find out who, why and when. Mr. Rafiel is the same Rafiel as in A Caribbean Mystery. So there is a sense of connection here. <br /> <br /> Nemesis is definitely one of the amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who are happy with lots of blood, guts and heart-wrenching action sequences, you will not like this. But if you are like me, someone who likes to know people and find out what motivates them, Nemesis is for you.
