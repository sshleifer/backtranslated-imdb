this movement was intriguing and absorbing; However, the story was a bit hectic and hard to follow sometimes. Although the two main actors did a great job, just watching Senn Penn play with every fiber of his being and stealing all the images made it a memorable film. More recent films have revealed him as an actor not playing a role: he has also shown a comical flair in Sweet and Lowdown. Amazingly talented and not the light weight that I thought before. /
