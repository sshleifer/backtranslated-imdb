With boundless energy and uncompromising vision, Talk Radio brilliantly explores the public's passion for reducing the private problems of strangers in entertainment via radio. <br /> <br /> Eric Bogosian is sensational like Barry Champlaine, a radio host on your face. It is natural for this kind of role and interprets one of the most impressive and interesting radio personalities I have ever seen on screen. The timing and injunctions of his insults towards his various interlocutors are geniuses. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin also shines as Barry's boss. He shows the same explosive cynicism that he would later expose the Glengarry Glen Ross of 1992. But the supporting role that really stands out is that of Michael Wincott, a teenager apparently dead and stunned. You must see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone and Robert Richardson do a great job with photography, which is almost entirely confined to a single broadcast room. The claustrophobic feeling of the film perfectly reflects his tone. After all, one of the main goals of the film is to exploit people's personal moments to attract an audience. Stone demonstrates that these moments are often too intimate for the whole world to experience. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is a film with a strong emotional and cerebral impact - as we rarely see it nowadays.
