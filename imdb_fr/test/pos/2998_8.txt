I do not do so many "heist" comedies, and I might not be worried about it if there were not actors, when it was done, and when I first SEEN it (several years later). It's almost too similar to "The Happening" (although it's obviously a far less serious comedy than this one) - a mafia character picks up his own kidnapping, or rather, turns it in a totally different direction. Of course, Raquel Welch did not interpret the kind of sharp character played by Faye Dunaway in The Happening, but that does not make it a sexist movie either - she practically played a serial character, almost SA version of a "moll"! But, I'm completely biased: it's one of the first movies I've ever seen with her, and at the time I could not turn around without seeing a poster of her (thankfully) . I think Robert Wagner was really just as a leader neither really friendly nor unpleasant of the band, just like Edward G. Robinson (of course) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who has always managed to be funny.
