Yes, I felt as if I had been eviscerated after seeing it. But it was not until the next day that I began to see the true brilliance of this creation. I will not repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is a new area that I would like to address ... ** SPOILERS ** Why did the teacher put exactly the broken glass in that of the student? poached? Most critics noted that this only reflected his cruelty and reaction to unsatisfactory performance. I must disagree. Look at the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears as she watches her pupil perform on stage. The student is a very expressive girl (she cries and expresses her fears), quite the opposite of the character of Huppert. There is a scene later in the film, after the girl is hurt, when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly upset, says, "We gave up everything so she could study the piano," and Huppert immediately snapped, "You mean she gave up, did not you?" <br /> <br /> I thought that Huppert would simply save this young, expressive student from his own destiny. She did not want the girl to finish like SHE, repressed and hardened, condemned to a life of recitals ... gradually killing the soul in search of perfection. Maybe she saw herself on stage years ago, before the situation degenerated. Maybe she would have liked to have escaped when she was that age. Does she ruin the life of the student or does she simply free her? <br /> <br /> For me, this awareness made all the difference in what I lived through this film. Brilliant.
