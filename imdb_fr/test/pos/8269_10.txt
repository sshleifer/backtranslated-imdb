Just reading the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini-series reminded me how much I enjoyed this show when it first aired many years ago. At the time, I remember waiting impatiently for the next episode and falling in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer, two talented actors we do not see enough on television or in movies these days. <br /> <br /> I tried unsuccessfully to get many of the BBC's fantastic drama, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne of Green Gables, all marvelous classic stories and timeless the BBC does not seem to intend to publish on video or DVD. If someone learns otherwise, I would like to hear from them. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we will have to settle for our memories of their wonderful.
