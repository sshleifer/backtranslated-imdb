Better than the original, "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" manages to make a funny comedy with a good acting, beautiful special effects and a comedy that transcends the knowledge base of the "player" and this, with a small budget. I have seen a lot of low budget movies that have been terrible and almost none that have been as good as their high budget counterparts. This film blows most mainstream movies! The parts are a little weak (the side with the pirates and the ninjas - although funny - continues a little long without explanation and makes you leave the film a little) but, on the whole, it is about a movie very strong. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy to say that I bought this movie as soon as I saw it and brought it home. <br /> <br /> Do you have a chance to see another Gamers feature from these guys? :)
