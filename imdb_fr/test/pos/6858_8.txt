He is a great German slasher, often quite suspensive and creative, with a funny story and solid performances. All the characters are nice and Benno Fürmann is great as a psycho killer, plus Franka Potente gives a fantastic performance as the main. It took a while to get started, but it was never boring, and there were good death scenes too, and the music is wonderfully scary. I was lucky enough to get the subtitled version, instead of the dubbed one, and I thought all the characters were nice enough, besides, it's very well written and well done. It also has very good twists, and the effects are extremely well done, and the end is great. The final is particularly suspensive, and Franka Potente was the ideal casting choice in my opinion. In addition, I wish Andy Schwering-Sohnrey (David) was not killed so early, because he was a really cool character. In fact, there were a few moments when I felt uncomfortable, but in the good sense of the word, and I must say that this film deserved all its praise. In addition, even if it has holes in the plot, it is not enough to hinder the film. This is an excellent German slasher, which is often quite suspensive, creative, with a fun story and solid performance, I highly recommend it! The management is great! Stefan Ruzowitzky does a great job! Work here with great camera work, great angles, great close-ups (see the opening sex scene), great work to create a scary atmosphere and keep the movie going very fast. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of blood and blood. We have dead corpses, lots of very bloody surgery scenes, lots of bloody stab wounds, dissected people while staying conscious, cut fingers, self mutilation, rips, bloody throats, many frozen corpses, a lot of blood, etc. . . <br /> <br /> The acting game is very solid! Franka Potente is fantastic as the main principal, she was very friendly, she remained cold under pressure, she was vulnerable, she has soft eyes, and we are able to take care of her character. The only time she seemed to suffer was to throw some bad dialogs here and there, but it was not very often, she was wonderful! Benno Fürmann is excellent as a psycho killer, he was just scary, and wonderfully OTT, he really gave me goose bumps and was an effective killer! Anna Loos played very well as a clever slut, I dug it. Sebastian Blomberg was great here as Caspar, he was very friendly and had a mysterious character, his chemistry with Potente was also active and there were great twists involving him in the end. Holger Speckhahn was good as Phil Idiot and did his job well. Traugott Buhre is good as Professor Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey was great like David, he had a really great character and I wish he was not killed so soon. The rest of the cast is doing very well. <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend this superb German slasher! *** 1/2 out of 5
