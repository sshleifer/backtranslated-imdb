it's a good movie for the whole family. I do not think many people have seen it because I ask them questions and they say they have never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister-in-law. my favorite scene is the whole movie, I can not even choose a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny but intelligent dog. if anyone has not seen it, it misses a beautiful adventure. I only saw it because my aunt is related to Sophie and she has received a copy. If anyone reads this, I suggest buying the film and I have the guarantee that it will not be a bad decision. I have seen this film about five times and every time he gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people give them a chance.
