Hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as lepers. In condemning homosexuality, the film industry reflected only what the repressive society of its day married as an ideology. For example, in the Otto Preminger melodrama of 1962, entitled "Counseling and giving consent," the pure actor Don Murray was portrayed as a congressman who committed suicide rather than confessing his other lifestyle. Gay movie characters have come a long way since "Counselor and Consent." In the 1997 film "In & Out" (** 1/2 on ****), straight-haired actor Kevin Kline is portrayed as a homosexual teacher coming out of the closet on his wedding day. While the conservative Hollywood of yesteryear stipulated that the congressional homosexual in "Advise and Consent" should commit suicide, today's liberal Hollywood dictates that the homosexual English teacher be adopted rather than mutated. <br /> <br /> "In & Out" preaches civility in a politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and screenwriter Scott Rudnick argue that honesty is the best policy because honesty always guarantees happiness. High School teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline of "The Big Chill") will not be happy until he comes out of the closet, just like his once fat but now slim fiancée Emily (Joan Cusack) will not feel happy that she can give up his diet. In the end, the film claims that the society of heterosexuals will accept homosexuals when homosexuals can behave more frankly and frankly. The gay tabloid journalist cheerfully portrayed by actor Tom Selleck here dramatizes this open-minded commentary effectively. <br /> <br /> Rudnick's ultra-light scenario illustrates the true incident of Oscar life when Tom Hanks paid tribute to a teacher at the school. In "In & Out", Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a Brad Pitt-style blond bimbo actor, wins the Oscar for imitating a fruity infantryman. Drake pays tribute to his mentor Howard Brackett in his thank you speech. Do not just stay there, candid Cameron reveals to a live audience on television that Howard is gay! Suspicion, paranoia, and horror set in as the media hit the sleepy town of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When will the sexual deviance of an unnamed high school English teacher cause such concern in the media?) Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck of "High Road to China") hides among these reporters, and wishes to make an exclusive week on Howard Howard, however, does not want anything to do with the witch-hunting media, especially the pesky Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's gay accusations against everyone, including his fiancée and his mother. Malloy lingers because he feels the scoop. The revelation upset Green Leaf. High School Principal Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) is nervous about all the media coverage. Halliwell warns Howard that if his marriage is not imminent, he should give him a pink slip. Meanwhile, Peter is betting on Howard that his marriage with Emily will fail at the last moment and he will be there to record the result on camera. <br /> <br /> Howard uses audio cassettes on macho men. He has trouble reforming. But Howard's efforts are futile. Guilt swells in him. And then there is Peter Malloy, who prevents him from revealing his homosexuality. Finally, at the altar in the eyes of God, Howard breaks out. Of course, the future wife Emily Montgomery is disappointed by Howard's gay confession. Predictably, the school fires Howard, but he shows up to graduate. Drake also arrives and rushes to Brackett's defense. Not only did the school dismiss Howard from his job, but they also awarded him the teacher of the year award to someone else. Drake makes an appeal to the principal and gives Howard the unanimous support of the community. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in Rudnick's artificial scenario is Howard himself. Rudnick has created a character too chaste to be true, whether in gray or straight standards. Howard Brackett appears more like a saint than a sinner. He helps a student to enter university and trains the athletics team. How many times have you heard of an English teacher dubbed as a coach? Everyone at his high school loves Howard. He has no nasty bone in his body. In addition, Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that no one else in Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howard's gay friends? Are they too scared to take his defense? No, "In & Out" does not strictly target the homosexual public. Oz, whose on-screen credits include pretty comedies like "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and "House Sitter", as well as Rudnick teetering on a politically correct tightrope. "In & Out" is not a gay recruitment film. The filmmakers show no interest in pushing Howard or Peter Malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are interested only in reinforcing a thin premise: is he gay or not? They develop the response of the community to the answer. Finally, when Howard admits he's gay, the filmmakers devote the rest of the films to showing how a conservative city, at the Norman Rockwell, can accept it despite its difference. <br /> <br /> The most shocking scenes of "In & Out" is probably when tabloid journalist Malloy applies to Howard. Heterosexuals kissing in a film about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are wrong. Kline and Selleck merge their faces into what appears to be more of a frontal collision than a closed-mouth kiss. Nothing like the controversial British film "Priest" of 1994, "In & Out", appears as an engaging but difficult social propaganda, with its message "we can play well." If "Ellen" was not the equivalent of television, "In & Out" would probably head to television as a new sitcom. Watching "In & Out" is not so much about the problem of homosexuality as about sexuality, but about being an honest person in the last days of the 20th century. What makes "In & Out" a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance, is its equality of opportunity for all those who please and make fun of fags.
