This is a love story in the background of TV news. The three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle while working for the Washington office of a television network. <br /> <br /> Tom Grunick (Hurt) is the beautiful journalist who wants to be a star.Jane (Hunter) is the producer who recognizes that Tom does not have the intellectual gravity to be a real journalist but who falls in love with him anyway.Aaron Altman (Brooks) is the man who shares his convictions about journalistic standards that really love him. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!). She was stolen! This is Hunter's movie. Her character, Jane, is intelligent, ruthless and totally driven. She is also hilarious neurotic. His performance is perfect. Look at her face as she watches the recording of Tom's interview with a rape victim. The scales are literally falling on him. <br /> <br /> Wiliam Hurt's performances are less impressive.He plays a man who is well aware of the fact that he is a himbo and a fraudster, but who is smart enough to know that his rise to be guided by people like Jane.He gives a hint to an extremely calculating man. <br /> <br /> The film comments on celebrity, journalism, integrity and commercial pressures on the press in a bottom-line media. He predicted that news would be shattered, that trade standards would be slowly lowered due to trade pressures. <br /> <br /> Think about it: this film was released before the end of the cold war and before the rise of reality TV. The release of Paris Hilton prison was treated as a major story! To see how prophetic this movie is, just watch your evening news and jot down the scenery, graphics, and presenters. Tom Grunick and his clones are alive and well!
