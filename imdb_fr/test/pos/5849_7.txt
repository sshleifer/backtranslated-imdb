This thriller has so many twists that it put me on the edge of my seat. I saw it in video, some of the landscapes of "The Bluff" could have been a little more spectacular on big screen. Cast to Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin (from "The Truth About Cats and Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker in "Dawson's Creek") and Ryan Gosling (???).
