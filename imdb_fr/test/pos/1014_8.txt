I finally saw LAURE and I must say that I liked it too and was appalled by that. What's great is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the magnificent distribution. The story is certainly nonexistent, but with these films, it does not really matter. The rhythm is languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot to offer. Unfortunately, there are also some negatives. The first thing to do is that the beautiful Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry. Because both play a couple and are on screen for most of the movie, the lack of chemistry between the two is a definite responsibility. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they filmed this movie. They have kept their reciprocal attraction to show on the screen. <br /> <br /> The other problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are simply ineffective, even ridiculous. There is a sex scene that stands out as one of the most idiotic I've ever seen in a soft porn movie: our young blonde couple is challenged by a helicopter pilot who happens to be a transvestite! The pilot flies over the city to recover his girlfriend (!) And they have an orgy in the helicopter, in full flight. And Al Cliver films all this with his 16mm camera! I am not joking. Ridiculous. We will see later that 16 mm sequences are edited on a moviola. As the images rotate, Al and Annie start to get noticed. This scene is actually good but the images on the screen behind them were sometimes too much. Looking at the images of the transvestite doing it with his bimbo while flying the helicopter, I almost rolled on the ground laughing loudly. Is it supposed to be erotic or credible? The last thing I want to see is a woman who gives pleasure to a man in a trail, certainly when this man in the trail makes such an ugly woman flying a helicopter, no less. Al and Annie, it was cool like music throughout the scene. I only wish the images on the editing screen are not so stupid. <br /> <br /> Talking about drag, another dull plot point in LAURE who really drags the spin film are all those moments with the great Orso Maria Guerrini and her two women. A married trio is an interesting idea, but it is not very interesting here. The two women are kind of boring and we rarely see the three having sex. In fact, Orso keeps his clothes for most of the movie, even though he is with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there is nudity but it's not as much as other movies of the same era. He just needed more skin to put it back on. <br /> <br /> Except for these minor complaints and drag-drag moments, LAURE is actually very observable. I love this kind of softcore movies from the 1970s, where the focus was on the mood and the atmosphere, not on the raw things we see today. <br /> <br /> ps: be sure to watch Emanuelle in Egypt, with Annie & Al but also another famous screen couple, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music of this film is also excellent.
