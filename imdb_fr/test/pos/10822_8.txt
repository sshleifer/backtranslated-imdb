Even if it will not give you more than the previous posts (like the very good article of Ruby Liang), I wanted to share my own point of view. I hope my english is understandable. <br /> <br /> Bon voyage is a rhythmic, light but profound presentation of the French unorganized descent, but also of courage and charm. Always in a brilliantly reconstructed France of 1940 with many details (Bordeaux luxury hotel occupied by the seat of the government and attacked by useless classy French, Parisian cafes near the Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and cars of the 1930s), Gérard Depardieu and Yvan Attal give their second role a brilliant taste;) Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very credible in their radically different roles, and Grégori Derangère makes a haunting performance :) <br /> <br /> Many lighter than average (American, for example) war movies, and focused On civilians, Bon voyage shows a lot about French issues (even for a Frenchman like me), some very deep.
