Just before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it being a horror adventure far less horrible than I expected. Instead, director Jeff Lieberman creates a wonderfully evocative and disturbing atmosphere for large parts of the film, building suspense constantly until I'm really sure what's going to happen, but pull myself together like a spring. 'waits. The lack of action in many areas has given it a very Deliverance atmosphere, mixed with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre atmosphere, and when the action really begins, it's really shocking and dramatic, without even really needing to be bloody. The characters are tied for this kind of movie, although more likeable than some, and the nasty freaky villain. Photography and suspense are the real winners of this movie and keep it from being boring (as suggested). I strongly recommend this one to serious horror fans. Do not expect to be gore, expect a terrifying tale with several incredible moments and a dream atmosphere.
