This is, without a doubt, the best result ever for Jackass, damn he even throws Jackass out of the water. <br /> <br /> Picture this: You have a group of guys who simply did not want to grow up, inject a ton of money and some really cool stunts, and you have Viva La Bam. <br /> <br /> This show is so family-friendly, and it's not just "gang" running to be complete jerks (as in Jackass). For example, Bam's parents, April and Phil, are present in every episode, with appearances from his obese uncle, Don Vito, and more! The reason why the Margera family makes us laugh is simple: a member of our family can tell. April: The woman who wants to live life at the pound and follow the tradition. Phil: The guy trying to be a good father and finally Bam: This son who never left high school. <br /> <br /> The jokes and jokes of each episode will give you a guaranteed laugh, and buying DVDs is highly recommended! Another thing that is surprising to see is Margera's flippancy. He said in interviews that for the majority of episodes he was not acting and acting simply by instinct. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most about all this, however, is the amount of Margera's influence. has more MTV. He wanted Slayer to play in his yard, MTV did it. He wanted to be with Dani Filth for a day and have a Cradle Of Filth concert in his garden, it happened. <br /> <br /> Add to that his passion for the Hormone of Love group (and debated as an emo) and the garage group of his brother CKY, and there are many puzzles. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass, you will fall in love with them. Last year, I borrowed season 1 from a friend and gave up my legs to meet Viva La Bam crew. You will not be disappointed, and I can promise you that you will be in the stitches at the end!
