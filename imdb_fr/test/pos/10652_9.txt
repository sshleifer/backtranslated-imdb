The photography and editing of the film are exceptional for the period. Eisenstein builds on each scene of the film leading to the revolt of the sailor and the massacre of the city. Although the film is a pinnacle in cinema, it is also an example of socialist realism. In 1925, the Soviet government actively used the arts, including the cinema, to spread the message of the revolution. The portrait of the Eisensteins revolt on the Potempkin battleship offers the viewer a glimpse of the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and the prospects of the class struggle are demonstrated as seamen representing oppressed workers and officers representing the elite of society. Much of the film shows the message of the Communist Party and shows how the film was used as a propaganda tool.
