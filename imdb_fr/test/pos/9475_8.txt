This is James Cagney's first film I've ever really watched. I had never been interested in his films before because I thought that I would not like anything about this style of cinema and that I had heard that most of Cagney's films were identical. I must say that I really liked that. According to the current standards for movies, it was not special, but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Cagney did not look like a tough guy, but he played the role very well.
