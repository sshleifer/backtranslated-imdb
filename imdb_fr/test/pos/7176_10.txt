It's a documentary like no other. It has so many layers and shows us so much that it is almost impossible to analyze all of this at the same time. The documentary William Greaves shows us the process of making a film from a different angle. We see the struggles of the actors, the director, the sound team and all those who are trying to stay and make this film a success. If it were a film, it would be ordinary. What Greaves does is that it complicates things by using a team that will film the actors, then the film will be filmed by another team, and then filmed by another team. Three cameras, each with a different purpose. This has an almost dizzying effect on you, but at the same time, it's exciting. I like the parts where the crew organizes together and discusses what is going on. Even they do not know what Greaves is trying to do. Half sees this as an experience while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confusing failure. Regardless of which side you choose, you can not say that Greaves does not involve you in this process.
