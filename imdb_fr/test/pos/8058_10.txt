In the preface by Clete Roberts, I began to think it was a production of Ed Wood. However, what happens here is things that hit hard. The story of crime and corruption in a southern city is told through a cast chosen in Poverty Row in Hollywood, which makes the film all the more realistic. There are no punches shot here, and the film sometimes recalls "The Well" (1951). The black and white texture gives a quality similar to that of a news movie. For some, young viewers will be reminded of the "Blair Witch Project", but this one is based on real events!
