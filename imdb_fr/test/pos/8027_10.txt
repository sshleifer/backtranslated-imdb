"The Jackal" (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), released the same year, eclipsed this film. After seeing both films, I can honestly say that it is the top movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the production value of "The Jackal" was very good, its budget was probably much larger. However, "The Assignment" is well written and has a fascinating history. Aiden Quinn is flawless in two roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay have managed to establish a deep and multi-level relationship between the main character and his family. I particularly liked the end. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of Jack Ryan's character in Tom Clancy's films. The two naval officers are invested in incredibly dangerous roles while secretly working for national security. And yet, Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn reveal their respective characters as heroes who manage to be both manly and sweet. They have real tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. <br /> <br /> What I do not understand is how the opinion of all who posted on this movie (including myself) can be so much more positive than the warm reception that the movie received. It is a film that has enough complexity and subtlety to remain convincing after several views. If you are a fan of spy movies, I highly recommend "The Assignment".
