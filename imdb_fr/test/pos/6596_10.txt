When the bicentennial struck, I was in Hershey, Pennsylvania, on the Middletown skating team. We did nothing but skate to try to learn what we read on the pages of Skateboarder magazine. A couple of local hills provided all the speed swings that you can handle. At the time, Mike Weed was hot, with Russ Whats-his-name, with the hot Z-boys. I had a GT plastic board (GrenTech) with Power Paw urethane wheels. <br /> <br /> My parents told me that we would move to California later that year and go on a hunting trip. I was a very good son this summer and was asked if I would not be rewarded with a TRUE California skateboard. They delivered. It was a fiberglass bridge with the logo of the Surfer magazine. Large trucks and big red wheels (precision bearings, you do not know). They had it at Oak Street, a surf shop in Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I arrived in California (all 13), Anaheim had the Concrete Wave and Carlsbad also had a beautiful park. The Odyssey skateboard arrived at Mission Viejo. A covered park with all imaginable scenarios. While I was reading about Stacy, Shogu, Tony and Jay. This movie was just about money and a wonderful experience to watch.
