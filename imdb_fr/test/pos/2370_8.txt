It's a film that needs to be taken in context. It should not be seen unless you've seen the first two movies, but the kind of people who will see this movie will probably own the set, or at least someone who will. And you should not wait for Blade Runner; the budget of the film does not go that far, and the journey is much more crazy. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a sci-fi film set in the future Yokohama (shot in Hong Kong as it is evident) on a society where it is illegal to procreate. Sho Aikawa takes over the role of Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for the birth control police. Takashi Miike is not one to give you all his reasons on a platter, but one can suppose that the law on procreation (imposed by giving the pill to people) exists because overcrowded, increased life, etc. It is interesting to note that the dialogue in the film is mainly Cantonese, while Sho and Riki (who play their roles, as always, brilliantly) speak Japanese, and some speak English. People criticized the English as being in wood, but I did not find any problem with that. In addition, another person found the themes of homosexuality throughout the film offensive; said Takashi Miike was anti-gay. It may well be (and not all artists need to be left-wing), but I can not see this film as an insult to homosexuals. It simply recalls the philosophies of ancient Greece where homosexuality or bisexuality was more common. The film contains similar proportions of action-packed and poignant moments compared to DoA 2, although in this film the action is more martial-based and is done in a very good style of Hong Kong. The cinematography in the film is very pleasing to the eyes, with symmetrical shots, good color control to make the air look polluted, and it's nice to see long, uncut shots that are so rare in Hollywood Nowadays. Basically, there is a lot to love in this film: a good sense of humor, an exciting action and very nice moments. It's an excellent finish for the series. You might blame him for being a bit corny, but is not that part of the charm?
