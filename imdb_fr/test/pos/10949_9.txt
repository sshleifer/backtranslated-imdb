I'm not sure what version of the movie I saw, but it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I did not know who were the "Twins" (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) before seeing this movie and I think that the English translation of the title is somewhat misleading. <br /> <br /> The martial arts are very well done. I particularly liked them because there was a lot of judo / grappling that was very well filmed. Donnie Yen (seeing him in Hero, great performance) as a director is great because he knows how to shoot these scenes. <br /> <br /> Everything seemed to flow for me, except that there is a scene where the girls play the roof fight with bamboo poles. It really has nothing to do with the plot, but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the best HK (modern) action movies I've seen in a long time. Although silly in some ways, he pulls it off anyway. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 9/10
