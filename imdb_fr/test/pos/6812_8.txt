It was so much better than I expected, the film oozed profesionalism compared to other B movies from this type of budget. The scenario was good, although it was poorly worded, but the acting was surprisingly good on everyone's part, including Lorenzo, and you still expect good standards from Scheider and Busey. In addition to the good plot and action, the action is good, especially car chases and collisions are higher class. Overall, it is a step up from the other B-movie thrillers and does not have to rely on constant nudity or a flood of word games to compensate for the shortcomings of its budget and scenario. it is definitely worth the rent.
