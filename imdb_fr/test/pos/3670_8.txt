Yes, sometimes "unconditional love" crushes, rebounds - no, it ricochets - from one element of history to another, in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it was only when I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P. J. Hogan could have attempted to do with this original and unconventional movie. Maybe the whole movie itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love that Grace (Kathy Bates) longs for and describes in the last part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is only that, unconditional and unqualified. So I watched "Unconditional Love" in this spirit. I laughed a lot more than I did the first time, became more involved with the characters, and started to understand the sometimes absurdities of the story. The representations are often excessive, but no more than they need to match Hogan's strange and delusional vision, a vision that moved me to tears, nostalgia and laughter. Yes, Hogan is asking a lot to his audience. For my part, I ended up really enjoying his film - unconditionally.
