I only gave nine stars instead of ten because I do not really approve of pornography. Pornography has a useful purpose in society (I can not say I can always think of it), but it's probably the case. <br /> <br /> The personal views put aside, I really thought that this movie was rather funny. I did not buy this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I'm one of those obsessed with "Alice" who will watch anything on "Alice in Wonderland". I own just about every version available on DVD, so it was obvious to complete my DVD collection with this. I must admit that I was scandalized beyond my expectations, and it would have been completely shocking if it had not been so funny. In addition, the music is really good and I like musicals. <br /> <br /> Everyone can not do a good nudie musical. Anyone who has seen 'The First Nudie Musical' knows how bad this stink bomb was. Considering the budget that Bill Osco used, "Alice" is remarkable as a musical (it's better than some musicals made with expensive budgets). <br /> <br /> the movie can not totally escape the dirt of porn. I usually look at the XXX version for a total shock effect and some of these scenes are outrageous (outrageous because we are talking about Lewis Carroll). I felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed during the scene where "Alice" (Kristine DeBell) starts to masturbate. it made me feel like a voyeur. and the free lesbian scenes with 'Alice' and the kittens were a bit too racist. <br /> <br /> The film has a great sense of humor about everything. There is a particularly entertaining moment during the Queen's orgy when one of the actresses gets up and says "who do I have to F --- K to get out of this movie?" Hilarious. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure to buy all sex, it's good for philosophy, but sex is human, and nothing human disgusts me (I do not know if I I really feel like that, but I could not help but say it Some people think that everything should be about sex I do not know Damn, just show a little bit of responsibility and decorum. definitely points for sex lovers, but I would not want to push your luck, next time you could really panic someone.I mean we are dealing with children's literature here.
