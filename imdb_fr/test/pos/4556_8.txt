A kind of remake of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES in many ways.I think it's a coincidence so bad and so sad that John Candy and Chris Farley have left us while they still had a lot to do.God bless them all both, I think the intrigues of 2 movies are really similar, Road Trips of two poles of different characters, and many unfortunate consequences because of the Chubbies, This film can not be composed of planes and automobiles, but it's a really entertaining movie, especially with Chris Farley's great performance, the missing part of this movie is the tricky subject when compared to Candy & Martin Classic, but I think it's better as well
