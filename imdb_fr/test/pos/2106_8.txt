I have just returned to this piece of cinematic madness that I have fondly remembered since my childhood, and I must urge you to beg him to steal it or borrow it. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a duel between a fair shaolin priest and our villain It is needless to say that Father White kicks ass Buddhist and leads his campaign against Shaolin without help from his new ninja allies (a dressed-up goldhead who fights with a gold ring, a black cladman who fights with a spear, and my favorite, the one who fights with a pair of knives that can disappear and reappear as a Flying Carpet). The rest of the story concerns the formation of the disciples of the Shaolin monks killed by Father White, one of whom is Alexander Lo Rei. As we follow the painful training sequences, the two young Avengers must learn the technique of Shaolin Finger Jab, necessary to overcome Abbot White's invincible armor technique, but we see some of the ways in which our villain can its shape ... mainly thanks to the magic taoiste extract the blood of naked ladies. We all know how it will end, but it's the psychedelic journey between the two that we are here. In conclusion, this is a good example of what Taiwan was doing when Hong Kong was fed up with martial arts films and produced more and more scandalous martial arts movies. This film is very well choreographed, has nudity, gore and enough balls on the wall so that even the most jaded spectators are entertained. Visit your local Beewise today! <br /> <br />
