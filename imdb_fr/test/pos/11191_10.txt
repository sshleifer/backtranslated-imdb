The first time I saw it was with friends. He ended up in the hands of his parents by a stroke of luck; some videostore / bike repair shop !! went bankrupt and deals as if it were up for grabs. We saw it twice in a row and almost wet, we laughed like pants. <br /> <br /> I have seen historical documents like Ninja Mission and Plan 9 of outer space, and they remain very good at it. <br /> <br /> Nearly 15 years after the first contact, it is now considered the best cult movie of all time (in my circles); I showed it to all my friends ... We now have the tradition of looking for films in the same category: non-evaluable films. <br /> <br /> This can not be explained or reviewed. normal way because each scene, each shot, each movement, contains at least an error regarding the editing, the dialouge, the realization etc. <br /> <br /> For all lovers of cult movies, this is the ultimate prize, the jewel of all jewels. <br /> <br /> Raiting: As for crafting, it can not be evaluated because it would even be an insult to home videos of birthdays and weddings. <br /> <br /> As for the fun, it's the funniest movie I've ever seen; Funnier than any comedy ever played or present. Any value below 10/10 should be considered an insult to good sense of humor.
