I was very lucky to see this film at the 2005 Melbourne International Film Festival only a few days ago. I must admit that I am very attached to films that focus on human relationships and especially those that focus on the tragic side of life. I also love the majority of Scandinavian films, there is often a special quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. The construction of the character in this film is extraordinary in its detail and depth. This is despite the fact that we meet a fairly large number of characters, all with personal situations and very specific places in their community. The audience at the end of the screening was very quiet and thoughtful. I still play some of these scenes in my mind and I am always amazed by their power and meaning.
