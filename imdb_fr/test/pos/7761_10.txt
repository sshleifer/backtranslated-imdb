Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu is a very well rated anime in almost every comment page you find on the web. So, I really wanted to know why, and I was anything but disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you can go beyond the first very weird episode (but rather funny), you will find yourself in a very entertaining and exciting movie. strange world. It's a very well drawn and animated world. <br /> <br /> I can not say much about the story without spoiling it, so I'll just say it's a high school comedy ... and yet it's not. I really can not say what it really is. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'm a huge fan of cartoons and I have about 50 complete sets. I'm not kidding when I say that. Even though I have not finished watching Haruhi Suzumiya, he is currently ranked very high in my personal collection. I fell in love with this one and I assure you that you will not be indifferent at least to its irresistible charm. Believe me, I do not give a 10 to everything I watch.
