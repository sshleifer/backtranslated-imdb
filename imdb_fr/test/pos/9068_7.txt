The story of this film is quite unlikely for the class B, but the scenario used a terrifying guy to play the lead role, and in 1940 it meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is at its height in this story as the owner of the island, Stephen Danel, who allows prisoners to be released on bail to work in his diamond mine on the island. When they arrive, the parolees discover they are slave laborers who can be beaten or killed as Danel does. <br /> <br /> Only two things seem to be worse off than slaves; Danel's wife and the monkeys. The monkeys annoy him so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat slaves get. <br /> <br /> Lorre is perfect in his role here and slides on the screen in an industrial way. Although the script is not of Casablanca caliber, editing is very tight and there are no lost scenes. It's a very watchable story, but I do not know what niche this movie was occupied. Too long for a short and short subject for a feature film, I do not know how it was sold to theaters. <br /> <br /> I just understood it for the first time late at night / early morning TCM showing. Lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they have not seen it.
