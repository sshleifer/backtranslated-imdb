Have you ever wondered where this "Tuttle" episode came from in the middle of M * A * S * H's first season? Well now, the cat is out of the bag: this Soviet film pulled him from a satire about the tsar's stupidity, because of the slippage of a pen (making the phrase "the lieutenants, though ... "in" Lieutenant Kizhe "which makes no sense) and no one being honest or daring enough to contradict him and tell him the truth - Kizhe does not exist and never existed. So, they build an imaginary life for him and end up killing him. And forty years later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly borrowed this crazy plot and told us the same story, but on the other side of what had become the cold war, proving that people in high positions can be anything as stupid, whatever their loyalty may be!
