I saw SEA OF DUST at a screening hearing in New York several years ago. I enjoyed the movie at that time and was a bit confused by some of the amendments made since. Maybe that's what I remember, but there seemed to be some missing pieces of exhibits in the version presented at the Rhode Island Film Festival. I'm really not sure which version I prefer, but honestly, I can say that I found something to enjoy it at the same time. <br /> <br /> Let me start by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie. Although this film was presented as a tribute to Hammer Films, people who expect a clash between Van Helsing and Dracula will be deeply disappointed. There is a bit of cleavage, but no nudity (a staple of the latest movies from the British production house). And although SEA OF DUST is filled with gorgeous eyes (it was shot as a sixties movie) and features Hammer star Ingrid Pitt, it's not like the images of society in tone or performance. This film is very dark, very confusing and (sometimes) very funny. I do not remember that the previous version is as crazy as this one, but it's not a bad thing (especially the confrontation in the Black Forest that unfolds like a short film Three Stooges). And some of Mrs. Pitt's speeches are quite amusing. It's as if someone had hurt her and let her go. <br /> <br /> However, the uniqueness of this film does not depend on the details borrowed. It's in ideas. As an occasional spectator of the Sci Fi channel, I regularly criticized the network for its variations of a note on a theme (the CGI monster kills, then is destroyed). SEA OF DUST is full of ideas that you will start to stumble after a while. <br /> <br /> But do not get me wrong. I am not complaining. On the contrary, I congratulate these guys for creating such an entrepreneurial, low-budget image and having the courage to present it with so many concepts. It will not be a picnic for people who hate thinking about cinema (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those of us who are fed up with modern horror movies, predictability, disrespect for the public, that might be your ticket.
