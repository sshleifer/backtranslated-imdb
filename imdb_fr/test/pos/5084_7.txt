Just reading why this show was canceled makes me rather darker. It was one of my favorites when I was a kid and I always watched him when he appeared, no matter how many times I saw the episode. Of course, the effects were not great, but they were not horrible either. They did a pretty good job with the costume and it had the good mood of the 70's which is always nice to see and hear because the music was also very 70's. There were not really bad guys in the comics but most adaptations of live comic shows had none to very few real villains. Spidey's powers were a little different here too, he had his sense of Spidey and he could climb walls, but he was not as powerful as Spider-man comics. He was super strong, although I remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door knob, he was just not the car thrower that the comic book could be. The show was shot in Los Angelos, so there were no buildings from which to rock, but they agreed with the Web. It's good that this series actually has the shooters on the web and not the organic shooters of the film. I love movies, but a part of me wants them to start again and make the smarter pants, the Spidey, which has the mechanical shooters on the web. This show had a good star like Peter Parker and he was fine as a Spider-man, it's nice to see a Spidey who does not live basically in slums like he does in movies. Neither this show nor the film however has a Spider-man that is fast with the insult like that of comics. Still, this show was entertaining without being as cheesy as the Batman show.
