To date, I have not seen any movies more often than The Chipmunk Adventure, and no movie has brought me more happiness. This is by no means the best movie, nor even the best animated film, but for an 8 year old girl in 1988, it was the coolest, funniest and most exciting film of all time! I'm always so impressed by the musical numbers, each of which is a remarkable song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80s pop (think Pat Benetar with helium, but with a more catchy sense). <br /> <br /> The controversy raised the evocative tone of Chipette's song "Gettin 'Lucky With You," which seemed much more innocent to me at the time. However, considering him as a rational adult, I can fully understand the worry; you have three girls dressed in harem harem garments proclaiming passionately that "it's lucky that everything is turning out". The Chipettes were definitely sexed for this film. <br /> <br /> But this controversial issue is not even close to shadowing the fabulous animated adventure of the Chipmunks, I also encourage parents and adults without children to check out this movie. Especially if you were a child of the eighties / early nineties like me. :-)
