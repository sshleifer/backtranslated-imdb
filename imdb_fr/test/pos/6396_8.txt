My wife and children are a good and funny series that really shows the worries and problems that occur most often in the best families. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle (dad) is a man who always tries kids to do teenager stuff like party, drink, love or make love. When they do something wrong, he's just there to fix them (by the way he likes to make bad penalties) <br /> <br /> Janet 'Jay' Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and is rarely agree with her husband. She understands that their children are teenagers and likes to do "bad things", unlike Michael <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle "Jr" is an idiot who believes in everything others have to say. At the beginning of the series, he is really cool and tries to look like his father, but lately, I do not know why, he became very very stupid and he started to be problematic. At the end of the series, he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes a father, or should I say, mute father who does not do anything good <br /> <br /> Kady Kyle is a typical teenager who likes to party, kiss and drink. She has a lot of problems with her parents because they invade too much of her private life. She has a boyfriend named Tony, who is Catholic and scared of everything. We can not understand what makes her go out with him. I remember an episode where they were ready to have sex, but Michael Kyle scares Tony by saying that sex is very dangerous and deadly. So he decided to protect himself until he was married. <br /> <br /> I take this is the best series of my life and I still watch it every day after 3 years, so I recommend it to everyone - especially teenagers.
