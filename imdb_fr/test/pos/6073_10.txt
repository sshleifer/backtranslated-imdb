From 1996, I watched this movie first, I feel never to reach the end of my satisfaction, I want to look more and more so far, my God I do not believe that it was ten years ago and I almost remember every word of the dialogues. I like this film and I love this novel, absolutely perfection. I love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to spell the words "black night" and I always say it many times, never boring. I love Szararem's music, she is so spiritualistic and brought me into another world deep in my heart. can anyone feel what I feel and anyone could make the film like that? I do not believe. Thanks Ondaatje thanks Mingela.
