Even if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's body of work, you will be caught off guard by this exceptional incursion in the field of science fiction. For once, there is not a single girl vampire dressed in diaphanous! True to tradition, the budget proved too tight for the director's vision. Yet his obvious love for genre cinema, his dedication to his craft and his sheer ingenuity make up for this feeling. The atmospheric cinematography of Jean-Claude Couty makes the most of the dark places and Philippe Bréjean (a / k / a "Gary Sandeur") contributes a surprising soundtrack which, fortunately, does not resemble any of the sand pieces he has Compounds for hardcore. <BR /> <br /> Filmed in and around a Parisian building before and after work hours, the film is mainly porn-oriented with porn addicts. He already knew very well his efforts of "Michel Gentil" for fundraising XXX * ck film royalty Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding head. Playing with Elisabeth (pretty good, I might add), she went to roam one night on a highway near Robert (Vincent Gardère) and went home at the end of a long day of work. Barely able to reconstruct the sequence of events that brought her here, Elizabeth seems to lose her memories moments after the events, forgetting even Robert's name and her role as heroic savior before the end of their night flight to his apartment. Before making love, she rightly describes herself as a virgin (also deserves the talent of Brigitte for her sense of thespian that allows her to manage the line so convincingly, being after all one of the most important adult actresses. more active in the 70s), because she does not remember any contact. preceding his. Because of this astute context, the relatively lengthy sexual scene that follows completely avoids the gratuitousness of other "commercial" interludes that Rollin had to include in other works to secure funding. <br /> <br /> When Robert leaves for work, he is inevitably erased from Elisabeth's feeble mind. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau juggles efficiently) and his menacing assistant Solange (porn star Rachel Mhas) go to her house during her absence and bring her back to where she escaped. We find here one of the most memorable scenes of the film when she returns to her companion Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner a / k / a hardcore performer "Cathy Stewart" in a discreetly devastating trick), the two girls desperately providing "memories" fictitious. for each other in an attempt to surpass their inevitable destiny. This deterioration is not limited to the mind and becomes painfully obvious when lunch is served and Catherine is unable to control her movements by trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It is also Catherine who must express the compromise of the director with the demands of the trade by urging Elisabeth to undress and hold her because sex is all that remains to them now that the mental faculties, physical and physical, have abandoned them. . <br /> <br /> Several rather explicit sex scenes - if not hardcore enough - make up the central part of the film and French porn amateurs should recognize personalities like Alain Plumey ("Cyril Val"), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage, as well as Marilyn Jess, the future porn princess, whose rape, mouth, and member of Plumey was only present in the rarely projected version of the film, FILLES TRAQUEES. The centerpiece of Veronique, a girl that Elisabeth seems to remember almost and with which she tries to escape, is admirably managed by the exquisite Dominique Journet - during his unforgettable debut - which would then play an important supporting role in LA from Franco Zeffirelli TRAVIATA. The six feet below reveal that the state of deterioration is the result of a nuclear spill, the quarantined "patients" finally leaving a scarcely empty breathing shell, placed without ceremony in a fiery furnace. The last shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation compared to that of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES in the role of Elisabeth, who is about to collapse completely, and to a wounded Robert who stumbles along the railway bridge, the hands crossed.
