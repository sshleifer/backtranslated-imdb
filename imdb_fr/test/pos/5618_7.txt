I think Samuel Goldwyn was trying to do two things in this movie. First, the film is a tribute to Jascha Heifetz, considered the best violin virtuoso of the last century. Second, after bringing the children of Dead End to the screen with his film of the same title and seeing them sign with Warner Brothers, he was trying to create a second band of attractive sea urchins. <br /> <br /> Even if the film was good, it was certainly not necessary for the children of this film to be reorganized for another feature film. <br /> <br /> The leader of the band is Gene Reynolds, who was playing the violin at one point, but now runs a street gang of unsavory kids. His father-in-law, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin his late father gave to young Reynolds and threatens to send him to a reform school because of weak protests from his mother, Marjorie Main. <br /> <br /> The young Reynolds falls on a music school run by the former master of music himself, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They take it, but they have financial problems with a lot of creditors led by Porter Hall. <br /> <br /> This film is especially worth seeing today, because it is a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear Jascha Heifetz who, as you have understood, is the solution in one way or another, to the problems of all. Joel McCrea is also in this film, but his role is rather colorless as a boyfriend of Andrea Leeds. <br /> <br /> In addition to Heifetz, the film addresses the subject of child abuse and domestic violence. Arthur Hohl is a naughty man and Marjorie Main is very clearly a very battered woman. <br /> <br /> The children of the cast are doing well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a girl named Jacqueline Nash who grew up and played as Gale Sherwood, Nelson Eddy's partner for nightclub. She had a beautiful soprano even in her childhood. <br /> <br /> But it's Heifetz who sees the show.
