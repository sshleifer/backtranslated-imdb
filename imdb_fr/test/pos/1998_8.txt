Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema and is much better than expected. Those who say that it is neither scary nor funny have a meaning, it is not so terrible indeed. But we must not forget that all the people involved in the film are amateurs, so it's an inaugural trip. And comparing this one to other Sinan Çetin movies such as "Propaganda", this movie is pretty good. <br /> <br /> It must be said one thing: it deals with the life of high school students in Turkey very realistic! That's exactly how it happens! Scary scenes are a little cheap and Hollywood. Most of them even if not all. But this religious class scene made me laugh to tears and Emre Kýnay plays the best part of this movie as a religion teacher. <br /> <br /> It's not a waste of time, look at it! You will find it quite amusing, especially if you know Turkey well enough to understand the school life of its young Turks.
