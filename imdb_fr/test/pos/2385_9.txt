I am a talent manager. I have been for 15 years now. I discovered a wonderful talent. They have been in Movies, Commericals, Braodway and Television. In my opinion, Eddie Monroe was very impressed. I like to see the ability of real people. Not just a name. The actors in this film were very natural and credible. This film amused me a lot. I love a movie with some twists. I also like it when, at the end of the movie, the puzzle is solved. I would still like to know what happened to the big sum of money. (When you see the movie, you'll understand what I'm saying.) The gangsters all look true ???? I would like to see this movie on the big screen. The video was very well shot. The New York landscape was the New York City I know. Happy New Year 2006 and this film is rewarded.
