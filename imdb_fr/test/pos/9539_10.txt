It's a film that I love above all others. I try to come back whenever I can to the main locations of Oakworth and Oxenhope, which helps to restore the magical qualities that this film seems to embody so singularly - recalling a softer and more polished age, with his unspoken assertions that people really do. In reality, family life is not just another to throw away, and this life is really worth living (though sometimes we can doubt it). In short, a film that makes me cry quickly, perhaps helped by a deeply evocative music - some tunes are jaunty (like the song of the Perks, played on a trombone, sometimes with spoons), the moving melody of the first For Yorkshire , not knowing what awaits them, and the captivating air played on a solo clarinet (or is it an oboe?) that precedes sudden changes in the fortune felt by the child. <br /> This is just as much a movie for adults as it is for children, appealing to the eternal child in all of us - a key that will effortlessly re-activate those deeply lost and seemingly vanished values ​​and feelings within us that are normally swept away by the demands of modern day life. It's a film about basic human goodness and decency, in which we have the viewer to do what we want, and welcome touches of humor are sometimes added for good measure, such as the arrival of the aunt or more. Earthy Level, the bedroom scene on the occasion of Perks birthday - "Very good Bert - it's your birthday!" I need to know every scene, every line of this movie, and yet, the magic is so great that every time I look, it's as if I'm opening a box of delights for the first time, savoring every moment - sometimes humorous, sometimes .. ..well, very different. As Peter says in the movie: "It's perfect - more perfect than you know." And that's how!!!
