I am not from the United States. I am from Central Europe and I think the show is incredibly good. It can be easily compared to married children. My title says it's not showing for the conservative audience. I mean I'm not so liberal, but there may be a slight difference between European conservatism and counter-Americans. Anyway, the show is starting to be very popular in our area and it is very bad that it only contains two seasons. The last episode opens many continuous and amusing moments. Anyway, many people and I would be happy if it continued to play. The last thing that fascinates me is a very successful moral education in humorous scenes. I've seen a lot of comedies that have more than two minutes and more tragic tragic scenes that are absolutely not part of the comedy. The war does not contain something like that and is made to laugh. It's like Simpsons and married people who have no sad or even unfathomable moments either. I apologize for my awful knowledge of English, but I still hope you understand what I meant.
