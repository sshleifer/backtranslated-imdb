Nana Patekar proves once again that he is the best actor in Bombay without a doubt. His recent films implied shouting his aftershocks, which augurs badly for the formed theater. One wonders why he is not always congratulated during the awards season. <br /> <br /> "Shakti-The Power" was one of his films that was a complete disappointment with Kohram (a missed opportunity to create screen magic with Amitabh Bachchan). <br /> <br /> But Patekar radiates a soothing calm in this movie that embodies a policeman in a kind of social justice course. Clearing the streets of Bombay from the underworld during fake encounters, the character of Patekars takes control of the screen (and the attention of the viewer) and never lets it go. The editing is very rhythmic and there are no boring songs to distract from the story. <br /> <br /> In the same spirit as the classic cult of modern times "Company", the film is well played, directed and expected to have a long life on DVD. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes of conversation between Nana and the main villain at her offshore paradise will inevitably be part of Hindi cinema classics. Will not be disappointed by this cops of thieves and thieves.
