Horses on Mars is an engaging animated short film that casts a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those who have not yet evolved. The story is personal, and sometimes sentimental, and is backed by powerful digital animation and storytelling involving the viewer in this sci-fi story. I had the chance to see this short film at Sundance Film Festival in 2002 and I suppose that transferred to a small screen, it will lose some of its ability to attract the reader in a story no less thoughtful and stunning graphics.
