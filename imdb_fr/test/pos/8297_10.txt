Once a year in America, Saturday morning would give way to new caricatures, usually in America. About the time the school started. <br /> <br /> I guess it was to prevent Saturday school from being more bearable. <br /> <br /> A Friday night before the release of the new caricatures of Saturday morning, a film has arrived. <br /> <br /> "At the Heart of the Earth" I did not know who Cushing or McClure was. Obviously, they did not come from the same country. I did not understand why they were traveling together. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the mechanism in the mouth of the fire-breathing monster. <br /> <br /> What connects this film for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly, we play the group while we see the factory. <br /> <br /> How do you end a movie like this? The music again, and two cops gone astray while the exercise appears behind them. Whatever the reason, I remember watching this movie on Friday night that I do not do any new cartoon the next morning. <BR/> <br /> It was definitely the end of the 70s. <br /> <br /> It would be during the Jurassic Park mania, cicra '93, I believe, before seeing this movie again. <br /> <br /> Yes, people in costumes. There was again the fire-eater. <br /> <br /> Always loved the end with the two cops. <br /> <br /> Finally, it would take me almost a decade to send the film to the DVD movie theater. <br /> <br /> Now, I would just like to look at the beginning and the introduction. <br /> <br /> Oh, I really like the movie. Among all these sci-fi movies Jules Verne, HG Wells, ERB, this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> What I see now is that one of the cops starts spinning a bit too early, then turns back, and then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn around one more time to look behind the exercise. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie is for me one of the best shows on Saturday morning, why I enjoy so much
