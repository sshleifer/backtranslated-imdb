I found the movie Do not Look In The Basement very good, with some great characters. This is a young psychiatric nurse called Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), who will start working in an isolated mental asylum. She met several characters, including Dr. Geraldine Masters, who takes charge of the asylum after the hospital owner, Dr. Stephens, is killed by one of the patients by the ax. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the movie are Mrs. Challingham (Reah MacAdams), a very old, very amusing little lady, Allison, a nymphomaniac, and Sam (Bill McGhee), a young black guy who spends the whole day and seems to be spending the other day. a world all its own all the time. The film was a very low budget film but was still a very good movie. I know it was on the 'Video Nasties' list in the' 80s, but I did not think there was a lot of gore, but there were disturbing senses in his work. GREAT RECOMMENDED MOVIE !!!
