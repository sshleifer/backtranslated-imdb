Despite all the negative reviews, I really enjoyed this movie. I do not say that lightly. I love movies and I'm pretty picky about them (my personal DVD collection has over 9,000 movies - some are excellent, others are OK, others I do not like at all). And to all those who criticize: it's a comedy. I just like this movie. It's light, fun and very relaxing. I am aware of all (or almost) defects, but I love it. The comedy talents of Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are exploited (fully - for this type of film). Do not compare it to other movies with these star actors, just enjoy it. The casting is great and, I believe, the purpose of this film has been fully accomplished. If you want a restful and relaxing night, watch this movie. DeNiro and Murphy just had fun making this movie, so should we (watch it). And, please, do not be so negative. Do not expect a godfather performance or Meet the Parents from DeNiro, do not expect a comic performance from Murphy ... It's a completely different kind, and it made me relax after a day of job. Your sides may not separate from laughter, but it's still VERY funny.
