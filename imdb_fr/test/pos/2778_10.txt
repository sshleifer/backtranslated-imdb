It's the best movie I've ever seen and I like it a lot, it's so sad and adorable that I could watch this movie again and again. When I saw it for the first time on Disney Channel, I was like to see this movie again. I would like to watch this movie every day and recommend it to everyone. it's really a good movie. to all those who have not seen this movie and think about it, they'd better go see it because it's really good. I love the party when the boy discovered the girl and from that moment, I was just in this movie. if I could watch two movies every day, it would be this one and beloved, these are my two favorite movies, I really like them
