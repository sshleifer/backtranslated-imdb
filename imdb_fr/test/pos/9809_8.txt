I started watching this one very tense because I heard so many different things about it. Somehow, I read that it was a drama about child abuse and rated PG-13 for violence. Another reviewer said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure for kids (and I thought it was also for kids to watch). Well, now I've seen it so many times and still do not know which category to put it in. It's extremely funny sometimes but terribly sad and depressing the next moment. Because of the good relationships and adventures, I would like to recommend this film to all the young people I know but I fear that the dark atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the perfect performances and the magic of the film, I must say this: look at it, especially children! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the screenwriter for letting poor Bobby never see his family again after fleeing The King (who did not even come back to terrorize the remains of Mary and Mikey ). It's very good for this movie not to have a happy and perfect ending with everyone happy - and I did not expect it - but this solution left me very, very sad!
