Most of this political thriller was portrayed as a rather ordinary film with a slightly better development of most of the main characters, which was much appreciated, until the big turning point and the powerful climax recalled the twists and turns experienced in "Silence of the Lambs". or "The Sixth Sense". Reese Witherspoon as the helpless wife of the missing Egyptian husband and Yigal Naor as an armed arm interrogator offer strong performances. Jake Gyllenhaal is sadly entrusted with a more two-dimensional character and has to fight with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally torn CIA analyst who has already been featured many times in other films. At first, there is the beautiful scene with an explosion that looks like a scene at the end of "Saving Private Ryan", the silent scene that has been used so effectively to reflect a consequence of the violence. The script also provides additional insight into the "enemy's" state of mind, but still does not allow the audience to really understand much, which again allows it to immerse itself in a stereotypical characterization. Cinematography and photography are also a little disappointing, because unlike "Jarhead" or "Blackhawk Down", raw visceral presentation raw and raw, which does not allow the public to be really present in the film. There is a certain distance that keeps the audience. to realize the intensity of emotions occurring on the screen. Overall, however, the film is redeemed by the end, providing the public with a measured overview of the complexities of the United States' use of restitution and the complications and consequences that may result. Eight stars out of ten.
