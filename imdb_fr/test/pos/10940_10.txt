The twins effect is a movie about vampire martial arts available in Cantonese with English subtitles. This is a Jackie Chan production and it makes a special appearance, although it's not for those who love Shanghai Noon / Knights and the other Hollywood movies for which he became famous, this film is much more special that. <It was originally called The Vampire Effect but as a very popular Chinese female pop duo called The Twins (Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung) took the two main roles, the title was changed to take advantage of their fame. The film will appeal to three types of audiences: those who love martial arts movies, those who love vampire movies and those who hate garbage movies that Hollywood tends to denigrate. <br /> <br /> The film assumes that vampires exist and that a secret society seeks to hunt them down before we all become snacks for the undead. This bloody work is done by martial artists who drink a little vampire blood to give them the edge they need, and it must be a thirsty job! Things are going pretty well for the class until a particularly nasty European vamp finds out that if he gets a set of keys held by all the vampire princes, he can walk in the sun, etc., and eat in general when he wishes. To say more about the plot would spoil the pleasure of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The twins consist of a vampire killer (Chung) and a sister (Choi) of another. It's the twins who really make the film; with some of the coolest and funniest actors go. The fight scenes they perform are fast and furious and well choreographed with a mix of authentic athleticism and hard work. To add icing on the cake, the twins are very nice to watch too. <br /> <br /> The direction is clear and the scenario is precise. This movie only dropped three things: the makeup for the vampires is pretty mediocre, Jackie Chan seems to be in the movie just for the sake of sending it and adds nothing to its content, and some of the Diabolical comedy by the male vampire hunter is pretty lame. Fortunately, the twins saved the day by bringing an originality to the film that is found only in European films. The best scene for me was one of them (Choi) that only communicated by screaming, his ability to transmit his thoughts through this medium was a comical delight. <br /> <br /> Their film still contains many other touches of originality - I particularly liked the complete coffin with its stereo and TV screen! And it is the many original touches of the film that make this film is a tired old flop and makes it a must-see movie.
