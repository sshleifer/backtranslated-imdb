I liked this film, not because Tom Selleck was in the movie, but because it was a good baseball story and he also had a half-dramatized vision of some of the problems that a BASEBALL player arrives at the end of his stay in Major League sports have to face. I also really enjoyed the cultural differences between American and Japanese baseball and the little facts about how games are played differently. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie to watch on cable TV or rent on a cold winter. At night, observe the "Dog Day" in summer and know that spring training is only a few months away. A good movie for a baseball fan and a good movie "DATE" ?? Believe me on that one! *Wink*
