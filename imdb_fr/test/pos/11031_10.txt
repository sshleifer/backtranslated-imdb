I collect movies on Super-8 and I managed to catch a full copy of it last week on E-bay. At least for now, this is the only way to see this movie in a country where the video is in NTSC format. I've seen it available on the Region 2 DVD many times, but never from Region 1. <br /> <br /> I just watched it a few minutes ago and I'm amazed. It is a powerful testament to freedom and to finding your own place in the world. The photography and the music were fantastic and I felt a lot of empathy for some characters. <br /> <br /> I like the idea that I was probably the only one in the US to watch "When the North Wind Blows" tonight! <br /> <br /> Long live Avakum !!
