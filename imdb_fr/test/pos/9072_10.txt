The crowd of stars of the big league at the box office is phenomenal in this film !! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This film was made in one of my favorite years too, 1990 !! I am a Chicagoer, and the setting in Chicago was very identifiable and artistically shipped too! I liked this film, and the excitement that motivated the highlight of this photo was a powerful element of the plot that was absolutely sensational !! /> <br /> "Flatliners" is centered on a group of unhappy pre-medicine students who want to be flat as a way to reach some kind of social claim !! When life does not make sense, it seems very illogical to be curious about apocalyptic nightmares !! At the same time, once their ridiculous curiosity has been right for them, they can not go back! The king of the hill (so to speak) is the one who shouts vehemently: I WILL BE TWO MINUTES !! Who else will do that !! Anyone wants to try for two and a half! In the end, all these newly arrived and very unwelcome recriminations now have an extremely ubiquitous disposition in the life of these pro-debates! The consumption of their justified or unjustified pathos required a 360-degree vision of the problems they were anxious about !! Whatever the reason for this imprudent and academic chimera is, it is certainly an original approach to assert your personality! I loved this movie, 1990 was a good year for me too, things seemed to be coming up this year !! When I saw this film sometime in November of the year 1990, I was very happy to have done it!
