Epic early film, directed by D.W. Griffith Mae Marsh, his little sister and their dogs are orphans. They have to go live with an uncle. Young couples Lillian Gish and Robert Harron celebrate the birth of their first child. The coach arrives at Elderbush Gluch. Marsh's uncle tells her that she can not keep the dogs, and they are expelled. There are Indians (Amerindians) nearby; and, Indians like to eat dog meat (no kidding?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore is sympathetic to Mrs. Marsh, wishing to help her recover the fleeing dogs. An Indian is killed while rescuing the puppies, resulting in a confrontation between "Cowboys and Indians". <br /> <br /> This "Saga of the American West" is certainly an important film; However, Griffith's trusted interpreters start playing excessively with their hands and the story is too artificial. Many Griffith elements are in place - some good and some bad. "The Battle of Elderbush Gluch" prefigures the next epic, "The Birth of a Nation". <br /> <br /> ******* The Battle of Elderbush Gulch (28/03/14) D.W. Griffith ~ Mae Marsh, Robert Harron and Lillian Gish
