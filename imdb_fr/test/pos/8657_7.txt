The Bothersome Man is a clever and surreal film that re-evaluates what you do in your life and what motivates you. When you see these zombie people, like trances, do daily events and realize that this is what we do and what we want in real life, it really hits home. This is a surprisingly effective movie that in the end lets you ask questions about your direction and not so much about the movie. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the main character we see life in the third person as he tries to adapt to a new life after his move. At first, he seems to be the most popular man in the city, because everyone follows him and he is invited to dinners, etc. A good example is the scene with his new boss who offers him an envelope of an indeterminate amount of money saying "here is a little something to help you get started". Andreas even gets a girlfriend in the movie 20 minutes later, with which he moves. This seems to be an ideal life situation since his girlfriend is an established, attractive decorator and never gets angry for anything he does. But Andreas is not happy with their relationship as with everything happening in this world. He then begins an affair with a colleague named Ingeborg, to whom he finally leaves Anne and claims to have love. After explaining to Ingeborg how she feels, she told him that she also saw other colleagues and said that all relationships were "good". Shortly after, we see Andreas in a station where he tries to put an end to his misery and does not disappoint the public. Always in search of salvation, Andreas meets Hugo who has found a hole in which music can be heard. So they go on a mission to get to the other side, will it be better or worse? <br /> <br /> "The Bothersome Man" shows us the obsession of society for appearances and its materialistic state of mind. It does a great job of making fun of us by filling in the IKEA product stoves that characters spend at every meal. I think it makes fun of the sad Scandinavian society and its high suicide rates. For example, there is a scene in the film where Andreas meets a man who jumped off a building and climbed onto a spiked fence. Andreas is tired of this world and cuts his finger, then jumps later in front of a train; This is one of the strangest / scandalous scenes I have ever seen. This world created by Lien is equivalent to a purgatory without punishment or reward. In this world, drink after drink, Andreas never got drunk, sex was unsatisfactory, and no matter how many times he tried, he could not kill himself. This film reminded me of "Fight Club" and explained how the two main characters were out of step with the world around them. In "Fight Club", Tyler Durden creates a second character who does everything he does not do. In this movie, Andreas awakened is the equivalent of Tyler Durden. After a while, he wakes up and tries to escape the bland life of which he is now part by escaping through a hole in a wall. <br /> <br /> Link does a great job of continuity in this movie, that is to say that a character has a cup half full by hand and that it cuts, then comes back, the glass is in the same hand and it is not full empty showing that the shot was made another day. Nowadays, directors are more worried about sound effects and neglect little things like: does this character wear the bracelet in the same hand as the one filmed yesterday? Since I've been in television production for three years in high school, it's hard for me not to look for continuity or a voiceover that drives me crazy. Link does the little things well, it has great lighting in every shot, never lets you wonder why something is in a shot and brings an interesting topic. This movie really worked for me, because it does not make fun of Scandinavians, but of Western society and what's wrong. The only real problem I had was with the man who commits suicide by jumping on a peak fence. Because you end up discovering that this world has no death, but it has remained motionless, forcing you to assume that it was dead and that never answers my opinion. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the only main character while others come and go and never do more than support him. His first girlfriend, Anne Britt, is an interior decorator who, on the surface, seems perfect for him but ends up dull. This leads him to Ingeborg, with whom he begins an affair and falls in love with him. He soon discovers she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. Andreas finally meets Hugo in the bathroom of a bar, complaining that nothing is good and he can not even get drunk. He follows Hugo to his home to find the hole in the wall filled with laughter from children and chirping of birds. <br /> <br /> Link does not have much on the resume, but "The Bothersome Man" is more than just a start for a great career, but also a glimpse of a promising director. If it says a lot about his talent and potential as a storyteller, Link has a bright future and we can only hope that his future films will soon be spent overseas for our greatest pleasure. So sit back and enjoy the ride with director Jens Lien, who takes you from the comfort of your home to the dreamlike world of "The Bothersome Man".
