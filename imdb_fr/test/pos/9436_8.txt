Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) begins this disguised story by helping to smuggle the famous physicist "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) out of Switzerland and under the watchful eye of the Nazis, who want his plans of sighting. The allies obviously want it too, and Sherlock is here to help you. Mr. Tobel invented an instrument that contributes greatly to the precision of aerial bombardment. <br /> <br /> Holmes and Dr. Tobel arrive safe and sound at Baker Street, but the scientist would prefer to be alone, for some mysterious reason, although he promised the English to help them, not the Germans. He remains faithful to this promise, but there are desperate moments for Holmes and the English en route. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining film in which our famous detective uses not one, but three different disguises. He needs all the help he can when he comes up against his rival, Professor Moriarity. A grievance: if Moriarity were this evil, he would have got rid of Holmes without waxing his eyes, instead of giving him openings to escape. It is also sad to note that Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce), who is still stupid, must save his boss from certain death several times! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are credibility issues in this story. but if you can put your brain on hold several times, it's a fun movie to watch ... and it's beautiful, thanks to the restoration work done on this DVD. The old impression is enlivened by beautiful visual elements, especially by night shots. <br /> <br /> Another note: the one who made the English subtitles misspelled or misinterpreted at least half a dozen words. It's a very sloppy job, and it's not the first time I've met this by watching the entire series on the restored DVD set.
