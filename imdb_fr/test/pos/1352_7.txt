Burt Kennedy wrote and directed this western from a novel. Kennedy was a good writer and director of renown, mostly Westerners. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he shot this. This role resembled many of those he had already created. We understand why he was a great star for so many years. <br /> <br /> He easily fulfilled this role as a well-used glove. <br /> <br /> The main character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father, a talented actor, Robert Walker - tragically died at age 32 - his mother is the famous actress Jennifer Jones). <br /> <br /> Robert was slightly build and although he was talented only made a few movies. (He was in Rita Hayworth's latest film. <br /> <br /> On the way to Salinas, the same year and he was very good). <br /> <br /> He looked a lot like his father, but seemed to miss his father's charm. He only made a few more movies. He still lives and I wish him good luck. <br /> <br /> Most of his scenes are with another son of a great Hollywood. John Carradine's son, David, still making movies. they formed a beautiful team. <br /> <br /> In westerns, you always have a female character and she is usually a dance hall dancer. (Today, we call them prostitutes), Angie Dickinson describes this role well. The western pillars, John Anderson and Jack Kelly, are also featured. <br /> <br /> It was a film shot in old Tucson outside downtown Tucaon Az. & the landscape is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Typical of the oldest westerns, there is not too much action, there is a good mood and the usual ending ends. <br /> <br /> It's a quick and enjoyable 89 minutes. <br /> <br /> Notes: *** (out of 10) 84 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
