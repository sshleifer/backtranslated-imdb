His fantastic adventures with John Dark-Kevin Connor were one of the pillars of summer vacation movies in the days leading up to Star Wars: they were not masterpieces, they did not have effects State-of-the-art specials, but they were exactly what an audience of children wanted in a film from the mid 70's. <br /> <br /> At the Earth's Core captures the right tone for the adventure well told of Burroughs about the Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure the underworld of Pelucidar and fighting his evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs. This time, the puppets have disappeared for the benefit of men in monster suits, which is much more fun if you are ready to suspend your disbelief, and if you are not, there is always the neckline of Caroline Munro to watch . Aside from what might be Peter Cushing's worst performance, an irritating but dubious recap of his movie Dr Who ("You can not hypnotize me, I'm British!"), This is by far the best of John Dark-Kevin Connor- Doug McClure, fantastic adventures, surprisingly well directed and enjoying the use of colors in the atmosphere. Never particularly adept at exterior scenes, Alan Hume's photography draws a lot of control from a studio set (the film was shot entirely on sound trays) to paint an extremely alive world worthy of a novel cover pasta. Not great art but really good time in the morning.
