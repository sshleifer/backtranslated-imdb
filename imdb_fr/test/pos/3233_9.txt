I have read all of Jane Austen's novels once a year since I was 9 years old and I received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday present. <br /> <br /> I loved this film for its romance and for the music, which stayed in my head with an obsession. It was an interpretation of course, not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility, but something quite different and something that Catherine herself would have liked. And oh be loved by this passionate Henry! This was the imagination of Catherine Henry, and it is the romantic heroine that she speaks in her novels and was promised to us by the practice Jane Austen who tells us at the beginning that the improbable Catherine will be a. I wonder if Jane was completely satirical in her novel. She too could possibly imagine such a Henry. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie for many years, at least a decade. But since, I long it.
