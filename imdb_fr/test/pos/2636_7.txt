As of this writing (January 25, 2006), I am saddened to hear of the passing of Chris Penn over the past few hours. Aside from Footloose, The Wild Life is the movie I remember most about Chris. <br /> <br /> I still remember the film, with a slight affection, of the wrestling character of Chris and his teammates sitting in their favorite restaurant with a huge plate of fries in front of them, drowned in a bottle of ketchup . <br /> <br /> Anyway, my comment is on the title interpreted by Bananarama. After all these years, I still remember the rumor (Canadian spelling - lol) that Bananarama was called at the very last moment to compose the piece of the film and they wrote the song on the plane to the studio recording. record the song and just after recording the song, they went to shoot low cost video for their title track. I heard that this whole process (from start to finish) took 4 hours! If that's true, then they really deserve to be the most successful women's band of all time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is just a rumor that I heard during the day and I still remember a generation. Anyone reading this may be able to comment and clarify. Thank you.
