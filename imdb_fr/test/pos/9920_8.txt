The opera begins with a close-up shot of the bird's gaze and is one of the strangest and most agreeable traits of Argento (my second favorite, behind Deep Red). Admittedly, the film is sometimes quite absurd (the lack of real concern after the murders, the attack of birds, the model burned, this end ??), but it is the fantastic world of Argento and once found that it works. However, I do not want to completely dismiss these defects, but rather that the art of the film offsets them. For example, the aforementioned bird attack is completely theoretical in theory, but look at its wonderful performance; crows flying in chaos, adding their raging cries to the pitiless rock beat, the crowd panicked as seen through circular camera work, as the crow flies, then the focused attack; indeed, terror. Argento's breathtaking and fluid cinematography is on view at Opera, and is clearly one of the highlights of the film. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of opera and rock music, a nice contrast of well-used music (the rock mixes with the murders in a perfect timing and gives the scenes a very frenetic sensation). The sound effects also deserve a nod, stabbing, scissors, beaks, etc. <br /> <br /> Inspector Alan Santini: "I've seen a lot of your films, yes, you're really an expert in this field, I'd be very interested to know your opinion." <br /> </ br> > Marco: "I think it's imprudent to use movies to direct reality, right, inspector?" <br /> <Inspector Alan Santini: "It depends on what you mean by reality . " <br /> <br /> As this is a giallo, elegant murders are a must and Dario does not disappoint (the "ball through the door" scene is most likely one of the biggest dead ever killed, if you forgive the pun). The black glove killer, the deep voice, the nervous brain (cold shots!) Is cold and brutal, and letting him stick pins under the eyes of our heroine to force her to watch the murders was a good idea. That said, as a giallo, the Opera does not quite have the secret of a mystery. The killer is pretty well kept secret from the public, but the film devotes little effort to solving the murders. This, and the strange ending, could have used more work. Despite these problems, Opera still manages to be a satisfying and satisfying horror film. <br /> <br /> One last remark: it was good to see a movie, for once, show the correct view with binoculars (just a circle, not two circles together)! Nice eye for details, Dario!
