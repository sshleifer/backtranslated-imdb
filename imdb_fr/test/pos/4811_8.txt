I recently saw An Zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong movie, but because I was looking for a change from the movies produced in the United States. In my humble opinion, I think the film could easily compete with the action thrillers produced here, with the exception of the traditional idiocyncracies of the Hong Kong film. The one that always bugs me is the character of chief inspector. I still do not understand why there must be a character of the completely idiot-comic-relief type even in serious Hong Kong movies, but I can live with when the movie is as good. The characters are credible even if the situations in which they are are not. The story is fast and you really want it. The actual stage scenes were the two bus rides driven by the thief. Overall, a really solid movie.
