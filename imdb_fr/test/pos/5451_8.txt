Good movie, nice story, good characters, I enjoyed it a lot, enough to buy the DVD when it came out. <br /> <br /> The story of the real life she claims to tell is more fascinating and captivating than anything novelists could imagine. My friend who works in the media sector said they should not show such insider trading, this gives the company a bad name. As if. <br /> <br /> However, there are some problems with the DVD: First, the volume of the sound is terribly low, so you must increase the volume of the TV to watch it. I notice that this is also the case when HBO executes it in the original way. Second, for about five minutes, the left side of the video is cut off, that is, the image is cut about an inch off the left side. After five minutes, the screen is correctly filled from left to right. Such sloppy technical production is very amateurish and I do not know why the director and the producer let slip such negligence. <br /> <br /> Despite everything, despite its technical flaws, it's a nice story, one of the best of HBO I think.
