It's a movie you will like or dislike. I liked it. If you're looking for suspense, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc., you will not find it in this movie. It is a film that feels good, sentimental, positive, edifying. The heroes of the film are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a strong and honest man, and Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a man with a mental disability who finds a way to contribute to his world. I guess I did not find this film "monstrous sentimental" as many did, because it seemed very real to me. I know people like these. I've seen jocks who think it's fun to attack the most vulnerable. I saw honest men defending the most vulnerable. I have seen people who think football in high school is serious business. I have seen people who know what is really important in life. Each of these people could have been people I knew. I laughed well; I cried. I left the movie feeling good, remembering that there were people like Coach Jones and Radio in my world. If there are not people like them in yours, you might not like the movie. If you do not like a movie that shows the best side of human nature, you'll hate it.
