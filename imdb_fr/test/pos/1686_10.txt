If there are people who do not like this film, I do not think they are human. This film displays all the emotions and shows many facets of the character of Judith Light. Directed in 1997, this is one of the best movies I've seen and the movie Judith Light has played to make me a big fan. This film, although sometimes you want to blame the son for having trusted him so much, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes a lot to do that to me! The plot does not have much to do, but the acting by Judith Light is incredible. She looks great all the time and in the end, you do not want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her. Overall, a film deserves my highest praise! Thank you for having done so and for redefining my point of view on the death penalty. I can not wait for this movie to come out on DVD or some other form of support, because Lifetime is starting to distribute some movies to customers. Although I do not expect much for this one because it happened almost 9 years ago, which is hard to believe, because this film is ALWAYS rooted in my head after all this time.
