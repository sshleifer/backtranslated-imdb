As with all Haneke movies, make your own decision - do not be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the film medium for their own purposes, see it yourself. Isabelle Huppert is breathtaking in this film - combined with Haneke, these two never struggle. Haneke challenges us with the attraction of the golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but it's an anti-novel just as much as Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You will have to force yourself to look at much of it and catharsis is much more disturbing than persistent anxiety, but it is incredibly nervous and provokes thought; Haneke continues to show how Western civilization is or has become insensitive. People can do it, but it only adds to what Solondz did in Happiness. Although rooted in reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be considered an emotional metaphor. I do not recommend it, but I will not dissuade you either ... it definitely divides people, but since it's largely a crackdown, it's not a surprise.
