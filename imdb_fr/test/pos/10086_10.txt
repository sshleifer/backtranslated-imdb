"The tale of two sisters" must be one of the scariest films I have seen recently. In the end, there is no supernatural element, despite what is expected throughout the film. The story seems to be about two sisters who, back in their father's house after an absence (later revealed to have been in a psychiatric facility), are forced to deal with a seemingly schizophrenic mother-in-law who 'Takes it from the youngest girls when the mood hits him and tells them cheerfully that she has prepared a special dinner at another time, but that there is still an unexplained presence. It is then revealed that the younger sister died and exists only in the troubled spirit of her older sister, unable to save her, and her stepmother, who was tough enough to let her die. The film does not reveal many details about this strange family, but it certainly leaves a frightened spectator and a lingering hint of confusion. Look certainly not the light; look at this one when you really want to think about what you saw. It's a hell of a puzzle.
