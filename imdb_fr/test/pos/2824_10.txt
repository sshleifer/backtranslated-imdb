OK, first, to all enemies: win a life! I do not see why you're bothering to post on these bulletin boards, when you obviously do not know anything about movies, robots or people. <br /> <br /> This film contains important lessons to learn about gender, stereotypes, relationships and DESTINY. In reality, we are all robots, programmed to respond to certain stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen a sunset and made a banal comment without even thinking about it? I say THANK YOU Aqua (brilliantly interpreted by Bernadette Peters) for making me stop and thinking about the incredible power of Mother Nature. <br /> <br /> It's only when Val and Aqua begin to reject their programming that they begin to understand their true desire: to find love and run away from the factory in search of a creative life. This film should be viewed in prisons - just think of the dreams and hopes it could inspire inmates. maybe even they could overcome their "bad" programming and join us in a world without crime. <br /> <br /> We can all learn a lot from these robots. I am a better person for Heartbeeps.
