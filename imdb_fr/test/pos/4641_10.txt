Midnight Madness is a film unfortunately very underestimated and unknown. With a flood of classic movies for teenagers and students "angry", it has been forgotten. As a child, I watched this film again and again, luckily, I had it on video. This film shows a more docile side, but the most exciting of the eighties. In the cynical society we live in, drug abuse being the coolest thing, it's good to see, from time to time, a fun and innocent movie called Midnight Madness ... c ' is if you can find it. .
