"Steamboat Willie (1928)" is often misrepresented as the first Mickey Mouse movie, although this title is actually "Plane Crazy (1928)". The source fueling this common misconception is probably an episode of "The Simpsons", which places the origin of Itchy the Mouse in a short film of 1928 titled "Steamboat Itchy", which is obviously a parody of this cartoon. It is interesting to note that "Steamboat Willie" was itself a parody, imitating the latest version of Buster Keaton, "Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928)," although the connection hardly surpasses the title and general history . In this Walt Disney short film, Mickey Mouse takes over a steamboat, to the chagrin of Captain Pete, the cat, who throws it aside. But Mickey is not left in the meanness. Far from the pleasant and healthy Mickey that younger generations enjoyed, this little mouse cares nothing, inflicting pain and discontent on a series of farm animals to provide music for their own entertainment. <br /> <br /> First there is the laughing parrot, with a bucket and a big potato in his head. Then a goat is pushed by the tail to provide music ("Turkey in the straw") from a guitar she swallowed. A cat is swung by the tail, a strangled goose around the throat and a viciously kicked piglet. "Steamboat Willie", a children's film directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks, certainly has a petty sense of humor, although I've also noticed similar (though not quite so) in some of the more recent Disney short films. , like "Gulliver Mickey (1934). 'Do not forget, of course, Minnie Mouse, who is undergoing treatment for which she could now sue for sexual harassment! The jokes may be rude and the animation may be even more, but this caricature offers a bucket of laughter and it's easy to understand why this little rodent has become one of the most beloved characters in the history of cinema. If you're a fan of Mickey Mouse, or Disney in general, it's a steamboat that you can not afford to miss.
