The 08th MS team features two romantic hopefuls from different parts of the conflict. Aina, Officer Zeon, and Shiro, the new pilot of the Federal Forces, meet in a battle in space during the series of 12 episodes (and a "film"). the war that surrounds them. It presents a romance of Romeo and Juliet and an unbeatable animation. By far one of the best to hit American Shores. Suit Up!
