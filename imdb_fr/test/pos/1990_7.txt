An exciting exploration of virtual reality, although we do not know exactly how much the director wanted it. This film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues to the layer of virtual reality in which you find yourself, creating an ontological confusion that the viewer has to think about. <br /> <br /> Can also be seen as a satire of video games - the whole movie can fall into the illusion of an imitative form here. It seems impossible to escape the kind of video game he imitates; so satire becomes problematic. <br /> <br /> A number of interesting ideas intersect, however: the biological mutant is one; the interface of technology and biology, the cyborg need to transcend reality - and philosophical allusions such as the title of Heidegger, as well as existential questions: the characters in the game are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to change their destiny, and they wonder how strange it is in the game. A character notes that this existential confusion is similar to real life, thus erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real. Likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble in a world where you do not know what will happen and where you do not know how to play, you have to stumble to discover the goal and the unknown rules. A virtual game in the game is titled "TranscendenZ". Also a critique of how virtual violence prevents us from feeling the effects of real violence. Even heroes at every level of ontological existence are confused about violence. They do not like it, but it's exciting and it's part of the "game" that they fear, it's real. <br /> <br /> The creator of the game, the god of the system, is assassinated at the end; Yet this scenario runs parallel to a video game we just watched - and viewers think it's still part of virtual reality. In the end, the movie does not solve the doubt about whether this is "real" but the point is clear (for me anyway). Existenz means Da-sein: you are there. You are immersed in a set of rules and mysteries at every level. Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. And his current playing patterns express, as a royal road to the unconscious, our own fascination for violence. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, while Cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he claims to be very much against the "reality ... (underground terrorist group name) described in the film at once. in the game and at the "real" level. " It seems like Cronenberg himself did not think much about the film, although his impressive education is revealing. The interview in Cineaste gives the impression of an intellectual on the middle front who tries to be avant-garde by inclination. Cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination - the clich√©d bourgeois modernist credo - despite the recognized ambivalence. (My impression here may be due to a limited interview.) Still, Cronenburg seems to forget that his film betrays the illusion of an imitative form (imitating here computer games while criticizing them satirically, but without being able to "transcend" the same form) probably because he thinks it's "imaginative" and radical. Yet the imaginary world of the film is less bearable and more unfair than our too real world. He remains trapped in the world of video games.
