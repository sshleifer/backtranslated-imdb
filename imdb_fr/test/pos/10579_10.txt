I love Sarah Waters' Fingersmith and I was worried about the TV adaptation, because I was disappointed by the BBC's version of Tipping the Velvet (which, although beautiful to watch, had been dropped because Keeley Hawes could not sing and Rachael Stirling could not act). Fingersmith is a novel very closely drawn with breathtaking twists and I wondered if it could be done just in 3 hours. <br /> <br /> I did not need to worry. The adaptation was excellent, very little cut and went at a frantic pace (although I wondered if, if you had not read the book, would you miss things?). It looked like a classic drama of BBC costumes and I kept reminding myself that it was a contemporary book. <br /> <br /> The acting game was stellar. Sally Hawkins plays her heart as Sue Trinder and Elaine Cassidy, a slow burn, who at the end of the story was incandescent under the name of Maud Lilley. The love, the passion, the realization of the acts of betrayal that both would have to accomplish would be inscribed on their faces. It was a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachael Stirling is watching us: that's how you play as a Sarah Waters character!
