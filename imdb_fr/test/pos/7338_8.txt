"The Gymnast" takes place in short shots and short scenes, revealing his characters and his message over time. The spare edition is accompanied by a beautiful simple score. This intimate approach is wonderful because it gives you the impression of being on the path of discovery, just as much as the characters. <br /> <br /> The casual approach is also its disadvantage; There are some scenes that confuse because they do not have enough context. Some of the decisions made by the characters seemed to turn around until I looked at the interviews that appeared in the bonuses. I am happy to have done so because the description by the actors of their motivations allowed me to better understand the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Aside from the story itself, it was wonderful to see women comfortable and strong in their own bodies. The shooting was done with great taste. very convenient. We have the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold, not a voyeuristic film. The physiognomy of athletes - their reality - contrasts with the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that I will have to review anytime soon because the scenario is simple. but his delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.
