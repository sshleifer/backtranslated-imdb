Danny Boyle was not the first to realize that zombies can run like clappers. This honor belongs to Lifeforce, which is, of course, the biggest vampire zombie in Halley's Comet's movie space that turns sour at the end of the world. Tobe Hooper may have done a lot of bullshit, but for this epic and delusional epic sci-fi horror, he deserves a place among the immortals. In addition, she offers the space vampire Mathilda May, the best thing to do that to leave France since Simone Simon, who spends all the film naked. Which she does very very well. Do not forget that, even though she is the most feminine presence among all people on Earth, she is also "totally foreign to this planet and to our life form and totally dangerous". This is an event I would have liked to attend: the astronauts of the British space program discover three extraterrestrial life forms humanoid naked inside a giant spacecraft 150 km long artichoke / umbrella hidden in the Halley's comet tail bats the bats and bring them back to Earth with almost apocalyptic results as they drain the London population of their life force amidst a lot of nudity, thunder whirls and spit out your coffee through the room direlogue ("I've been in space for six months and it looks perfect for me." "Suppose we do not know anything, which underestimates the problem." "Do not worry, a naked woman is not going out of this complex. "). Oh, and we'll ask the Alien and Blue Thunder authors to write it with uncredited rewrites of Mark of the Devil's writer, The Thief and Eskimo Nell, and Jonestown's Monster Director. It looks like a winner, here's $ 22 million ?? enjoy. And they do it, they do it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the raw material is promising enough to have created something really scary and provoking thought (at a time when AIDS hysteria was approaching its peak, a sexual transmission ' plague 'offers plenty of allegory possibilities), but in the hands of Cannon's Go-Go Boys, which could have been another Quatermass and the Pit is quickly turning into an even more level plane 10 seen from space . It's Frank Finlay's hilarious death scene ("Here I Go!"), Peter Firth's grand entrance ("I'm Colonel Caine") "From SAS?" Quietly cries Michael Gothard a hall filled with journalists: "Gentlemen, this last remark is not intended to be published." This is a D-Notice situation, "he replies to surprisingly helpful press agents." The security officers offering the naked vampire Mathilda May a good cookie to stop her from running away, reanimated bodies exploding to dust on everyone, the sweaty Prime Minister sucking the life of his secretary and London filling up with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and joggers as the city becomes the most complete on-screen since Ms. Gorgo lost her junior to Battersea Funfair and went on the rampage. And it does not mention the "This woman is a masochist! An extreme masochist!" scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire "it's going to be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me" line while Peter Firth, lead actor, adopts his best Action Man voice to answer this! "In only one scene, you have a possessed, Patrick Stewart, who embodies the woman in the mind of our deeply confused astronaut hero, Steve "I've never been wrong playing Charlie-Manson" and his amazing eyebrows dancing in " Helta - Skelta! "In trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable Aubrey Morris (the only man who gives Freddie Jones a moderated air) plays the role of Home Secretary Sir Percy Heseltine as a kind of insane Brian Rix, Peter Firth (one of those actors as if he must have been a Doctor Who at the time when no one was watching him anymore) tinkering with the jaded public school macho in the hope that no one would will never see and John Hallam's unparalleled plans as a nurse continue to open the psychic-tornado door to bring more drugs, as if they needed more in this film. Frank Finlay, who is not qualified to certify death on extraterrestrial life forms (a role initially planned for Klaus Kinski), has missed the action in this one. <br /> </ br> > No Even if you think the movie is crazy, it still manages to become pl furious, whether it's a zombie pathologist ("He also needs to feed himself") and that Patrick Stewart's blood and entrails forming a Mathilda May nude vampires from space make the cathedral St. Paul's largest laser show in the world to transport human souls from the London Underground to the geostationary master ship. I loved every moment gloriously crazy. This film is perhaps the greatest film ever made in its own way. <br /> <br /> The DVD offers the original 116-minute version that was opened in the UK, rather than the heavily modified 101-minute US version, which not only offers a lot more hilarity for your dollar, but also completely restores Henry Mancini's score to his original glory (the American version has covered many gaps with additional clues from Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Although it is a surprising choice at first glance, Mancini has made his way into many of the classic horrors of Universal's science fiction. His score is rather superb, with a superb headline at the wheel that rarely reminds how interesting it could be. to be away from Blake Edwards. Unfortunately, there is nothing more than a trailer in the form of extra, although it would be good to hope one day a special edition containing some of the deleted scenes of the original 128-second version of Hooper: these could simply offer even more gold comedy!
