Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert cult that attempts to resurrect one of its members, only to have a heart attack! He eventually dies on an operating table and, through revenge, his mind takes hold of the body of the main character (Jill Jacobson), who then undertakes to hack and reduce until his fellow nurses know what We have to do. exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> Although I know enough about directors' filmography to know that it's mostly a straightforward schlock, "Nurse Sherri" is not that bad. Of course, it was clear that it was a very low budget, but I found everything I found absolutely ridiculous about the visual effects. The acting is not as bad as you would expect. <br /> <br /> Two different versions are available on DVD. A much more sex-oriented version with many amounts of T & A is the original cut, with vignettes as hilarious and ridiculous as the victim and her love interest sharing their moments of "strangest sex", including an event involving a blowjob during a conference at the university! <The film would then be redone for the theatrical version with the horror elements accentuated more strongly. Some scenes are deleted with new ones added (with Stevens, the role played by J.C. Wells, expanded). The most memorable sequence of the film in this sequence is a scene in a foundry and it works pretty well. This cut of the film is generally more interesting. I would recommend that viewers see and compare them. <br /> <br /> Both versions proved themselves in the last third and took advantage of the wonderful performance of Bill Roy, captured by the scene, in the role of Reanhauer, a madman. Morose climax in a cemetery (although filmed in the courtyard of the Adamson!). Marilyn Joi also deserves to be named as the pretty nurse attracted by football player Marcus Washington (Prentiss Molden), who lost his sight in a car accident and is incidentally a key to solving the story. knowledge of voodoo rituals. The film also uses the music of composer Harry Lubins' personal collection in a fun way, including compositions for television series such as "One Step Beyond" and "The Outer Limits". <br /> <br /> "Nurse Sherri" more alternative titles (including "Beyond the Living" and "Hospital of Terror") than any other Adamson movie) are actually quite entertaining. I ended up having a good time watching it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
