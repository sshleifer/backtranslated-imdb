Excellence seems to be becoming rare in Hollwood today. Many consider that only two of the best nominees in the photo contest of the year will make sense for the film industry. And in "Everything is illuminated", the mark is hit directly. <br /> <br /> The film begins its brilliance by the beautiful stage entrance. From the beginning, you receive a feeling of warmth and true family ties and relationships between each other. And also, the casting is presented perfectly. For Elijah Wood's character, Jonathon, his sensitivity is expressed by holding the hand of his dying grandmother. And for the character named Alex, it's easy to see his life in his perspective - the real Ukrainian rock star. The cast being illuminated at the beginning, the story slowly moderates in our mind while Jonathon decides to venture into Ukraine to meet the woman who would have saved her grandfather, so the whole family. And from there, the story films unfold slowly, but at a steady pace, despite the contrast between the drama that flows to tears and the laughing humor present in each scene. <br /> <br /> the film itself is rather priming. Several sources have complained of Liev Schrieber's inaccurate adaptation of Jonathon Safron Foer's novel. Personally, I have never read the novel. But any movie, especially this movie in particular, should not indicate if the storyboard of the film matches the script of the book, but rather how the main concepts of the novel have been expressed and exploited throughout the film. This is perhaps not what to look for in the novel. This film is no longer a must. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, new information floods the viewer's mind very slowly. Some of these thoughts are never answered; and in fact, the second half of the film focuses its subject and its reason to travel across Ukraine on something different, but which is closer to the original intentions of this film. However, the film leaves you on a satisfied note - but for weak-hearted souls, a tear can be dropped. And throughout the film. Sensible people with a good sense of humor may have to laugh at the amusing and ongoing conversations of Alex and John. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to many types of people: to those who love movies that share the comedy drama genre, for those interested in family ties and those interested in topics of the holocaust. And for those crazy people who find the comic movie as a hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. And for you who think it's a really funny and absolutely ingenious film, you're wrong; This film shares comical moments and dramatic sequences. And for those who judge a film based on their likelihood with the corresponding novel, you may or may not enjoy this movie, but this film has to be taken for much more than whether or not it was close to the book. <br /> <All in all, "Everything is illuminated" is an ingenious work that will enlighten anyone's heart.
