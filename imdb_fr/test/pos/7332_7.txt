I thought it was a beautiful movie - very brave. Such a beautiful image and I liked to use broken glasses with applause. The way the best friend repeated that "..and she is a year older than me ..." showed that their friendship had been revived and strengthened, but perhaps there was still competition ... I loved the pictures of hands that feel the fabric. The dance concert was magnificent. The beginning seemed slow, though..It took a while before looking for the characters - the husband could have been more violent - he just seemed missing, so when the other characters are talking about him - it does not really fit. The case has been. the best friend and the husband seemed to be random ... the doctors' meeting seemed to suggest that there was not much time left (to live ..). Thus, when the infidelity was revealed, I did not feel as much sympathy for the character. ! the end was so big - the lines between two. she and her husband, and the scene where she is arrested is awesome!
