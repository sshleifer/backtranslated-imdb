It would be so easy to reject a film about abduction by aliens before you even saw it - as I did - but it's really worth it. If you think about it, it's not an easy subject to deal with, but this film manages to suspend disbelief, which in itself is a feat for such a subject. Embodying the main character as a doctor was a wise gesture that reinforces his willingness to believe in the possibility of abduction by extraterrestrials. Vosloo plays this role with great sensitivity, dragging us into his pain and confusion about the strange events that occur between him and his wife. The special effects are used sparingly but with a shocking effect and sometimes the film is totally captivating, but unfortunately, there are some points on which the plot shies away and leaves some confusion. In addition, after reaching a tense climax, the end is a little disappointing. The secondary characters were unnecessarily weak (the extraterrestrial hunter) or threatening (the psychiatrist), which also served to harm. <br /> <br /> But overall, he raises interesting questions, including a revealing line "How do animals think when we experience them". <br /> <br /> The concept of "lost time" has also sparked reflection.
