Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's just way too long, varied and cerebral to become completely perfect, especially with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstract dialogue. In any setting, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes or intonations with which one disagrees. I saw a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott and now this BBC movie with Jacobi. As for the integral and faithful productions, this one is among the best. <br /> <br /> Most of Hamlet's productions are drastically cut, as playing the entire piece takes four to five times a year. hours. This production seems to be complete - that is, ALL of Shakespeare's original dialogue is intact - and therefore essential for scholars and lovers of Shakespeare. And although the lines seemed pressed on rare occasions (for those who are less familiar with the text), the script is largely well played, well spoken and well interpreted. Subtitles are available and very useful, although sometimes they are slightly late. <br /> <br /> Jacobi does a remarkable job on the longest and most impossible role of the theater. In fact, I cried when Hamlet died, and I do not think I did it before. Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), as well as the rest of the very punctual cast. The sets are minimal, so we can devote ourselves to the game without distraction or attention to nonessential elements. <br /> <br /> At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this big hamlet is a long way to go, but again, if you want the real deal, it's worth it, even if you have to take an interlude for yourself. I highly recommend this production to all Shakespeare lovers and scholars.
