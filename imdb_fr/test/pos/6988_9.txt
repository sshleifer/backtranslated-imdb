If you are a fan of science fiction and have only seen this movie once, please go ahead and enjoy a second viewing. I just did it and I was amazed at the quality of my thinking about the film, compared to the first time I saw it three years ago. The first time, I was certainly impressed by the astronomical views we saw in this film, but overall, I did not really think about the film as a whole. It was an Alien scam, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of very bad science. The fact that they were allergic to light was something that I found particularly ridiculous. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated the film as 5. <br /> <br /> However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way to success, and I'd better refresh Pitch Black once again, so I borrowed the video from a friend . I'm so glad I did it. There are so many things I thought I remembered during the first viewing and that were extremely imprecise. I thought most of the characters had died very early in the movie. This was not the case. I thought that Claudia Black's character was the first to die. This was not the case. I thought Riddick was the only survivor. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> I see now that the film works * extremely * well. There is no excessive and tedious concentration on monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are attractive and able to act convincingly. And there are so many small details that make the Pitch Black universe consistent and believable, such as the lack of oxygen in the planet's atmosphere on which they collapse and the fact that the monsters ate everything on the planet. planet and they turn against them. one over the other. <br /> <br /> And I have to mention the astronomical views again. I mean, we start to see the spaceship pass through the tail of a comet, with fragments of space spaces zapping through the hull. We arrive then on a planet with three suns. Just when the castaways think it's going to be dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. At the approach of the eclipse, we see the giant giant sky nearby surrounded by ringed gas and, in the last scene of the film, the ship skids very close over one of these rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I do not think I've seen another SF movie that really made such an affirmation by including these things. I hope we will see many more in the future. <br /> <br /> Pitch Black now gets me a 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You bet!!
