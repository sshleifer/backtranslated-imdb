I saw this film more than 5 years ago and the subject exasperates me always, as it should be. His anger and initiative were inspiring. Not that I would take an army and kill people, but the scene at the well and the strong rebel hold will never leave me. It's an excellent movie, but be prepared for the strong subject.
