Well, my father drove Lee Evans between the hotels, so I realized that some work was going on. It's a brilliant film! Bob Pugh passed a shed with a lawn mower and accidentally dropped it. He fell into a fence and fell. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans was as funny as he saw me and said: are you cold I said yes and he said well hit your hands in your pockets! I think it was really funny and it will be a well known comedy. Like all the other Lee Evans movies! They were really great people. they seemed to be pretty polite and funny. I would like to see them again one day. Brenda Blethyn came out of her caravan with blood on her and twigs in her messy hair and I was really scared because I did not notice her until she was right behind me
