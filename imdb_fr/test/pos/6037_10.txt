Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is a conductor who maintains a secret affair with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he does not leave his wife, he realizes that he has no choice but to murder him and to give him the impression that he she committed suicide. It's a shame for him that our collapsed detective, Lieutenant Columbo (Peter Falk), is on file. <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco wrote another episode for the series, after wonderful details and wonderful details. We watch the perpetrator commit his murder and establish his alibi for about twenty-five minutes and we are completely absorbed. Then, when Columbo appears on the scene, the situation improves again. <br /> <br /> We first see Columbo after the murder (as usual). This time, he is at the vet's with his new dog. The purely comic relief scenes are usually the weakest in the series (think of the discomfort of Columbo compared to the nude model in "Suitable for Framing"). Columbo is hilarious when he stalls or deliberately to stumble in his career; but too many writers make the mistake of showing it in a ridiculous light when it is with non-suspects. Bochco, on the contrary, shows Columbo a bit clumsy with his new pet in a handful of discrete scenes, fun and artfully integrated into the story. (And I'm grateful that he did not insist that Columbo give his name to the dog.) As far as we know, the dog remains anonymous.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode, and Peter Falk makes the most of it. He is particularly gifted in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone can kill himself, let alone that brilliant and handsome young pianist. And he is even better in his scenes where he plays cat and mouse with Cassavetes. It is to be expected that these two friends and long-time collaborators will play each other brilliantly. and that's what we get. Note how Alex Benedict can not help admiring Columbo, who is deceptive, even as the brilliant detective narrows the noose around his neck. <br /> <br /> Bochco takes full advantage of each situation in his scenario. When Columbo goes to question Beno√Æt's arrogant mechanic, of course ?? of course! ?? he asks the man to look at his own pile of blows. And when Benedict will find Columbo at the Hollywood Bowl before the rehearsal, of course ?? of course! ?? he plays piano in Chopsticks. And what will our daring lieutenant bring with the victim's typewriter with the wrong suicide note still in the roll. <br /> <br /> Columbo also has good scenes with a little girl early (Dawn Frame) and the charming Blythe Danner, who plays the woman Cassavetes. It is nice to see Myrna Loy present herself as Danner's mother, even if she plays little with her minor role. <br /> <br /> Director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted as coach in "Cheers") does a commendable job, although he follows in the footsteps of almost all the other directors of "Columbo" by adding a or two idiotic flourishes. The scenes end up being fuzzy and begin to be in focus. Then there is this piece where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped on the scene of the crime ?? and we see a zoom shot of it reflected in his sunglasses. There is also a scene with Myrna Loy and a group of old fogies that is atrociously performed by everyone except Cassavetes. <br /> <br /> These are small jokes though. It's a very entertaining episode, the kind that made me a fan of "Columbo".
