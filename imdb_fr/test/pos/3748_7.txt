Is it a good movie? It's hard to say - but in 1953, for a lot of people, it was a remarkably effective, suspenseful, scary and, surprisingly, moving film when "the old man" meets his unhappy death at the end of the film. /> <br /> Yes, what lies in the labyrinth turns out to be a surprise and, for many people, a hilarious feeling. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was very real at the time of writing the book and actually has some basics. Of course, this will never result in what we see in the movie. <br /> <br /> But we are working on what has to be a very small budget, one of the greatest production designers - and the person for whom the term "production designer" was coined - creates an atmosphere very strange and fascinating. Sometimes, of course, the movie is very ridiculous, but it has its moments.
