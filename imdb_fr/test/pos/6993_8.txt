It was a "sleeper" for sure !! Much better than I thought! Never realizing that it was a horror movie ... and who was this handsome boy with the baritone voice, named Vin Diesel ... that adds spice and intrigue to this film otherwise devoid of promotion? ?? The monsters in this movie were quite unusual, not the same as other types to devour! The end was great too, to change, all the "bad guys are not bad" !!! I give him 2 bravo!
