Sri Lanka ... I must not confess that I have never thought too much about a country. I did not even know it was near India, let alone that there had been a bloody civil war there since 1983. It seems that the Tamil minority rebels are in conflict with the military regime who runs the country. for many years, causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman's latest film, A PECK ON THE CHEEK, tells the story of a young girl named Amudha, separated from her Sri Lankan parent by war and raised by a young Indian couple. Amudha is a brilliant, mischievous girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child. Although her adoptive parents love her as much as possible and raised her without bias with their biological children, Amudha can not help but want to know more about her biological family. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratman is probably the best person. known for his 1998 film DIL SE, which hides a story about terrorism and politics in a love story (or is it the other way around?). A PECK ON THE CHEEK lives in a similar territory, but may be more ambitious on the terrain it covers. The central theme of the film is love between all members of a family, and especially between the child and his adoptive parents. It is a fairly honest and open look at feelings, which can be extremely touching and comforting at times and very painful to others. It is an emotionally complex film, with characters somewhat idealized but still behaving in a very human way. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around 9-year-old Amudha, played with charm and vivacity by young actress P.S. Keerthana in her first and only actor role. Princess and monster, she still has problems, but she is so charming that no one can stay angry long against her. The young actress is perfectly chosen for the role and does a great job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes that are expected of her. <br /> <br /> A PECK ON THE CHEEK bears a name as innocent as I was not prepared for it. the intensity of the experience. I never dare to say that such a small act has had such an enormous emotional impact. The film is an artistic and daring effort to explore issues that are not often addressed on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mani Ratman is superb, very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work I've seen from this director film yet. The film is very visually elegant, with excellent camera work and imagery. A.R. Rahman provides the soundtrack of the film, which is not as good as his classical music DIL SE or BOMBAY (based on at least first impressions), but still shows his great musical talent. <br /> <br /> I'm not aware of a DVD release for the moment - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival, whose film was undoubtedly the highlight. Production is a truly world-class effort and I am sure it will be popular with the Western audience as it will begin to receive greater exposure. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
