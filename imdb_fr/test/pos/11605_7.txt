I agree with what mallicka.b said. The film is described in a way that seems to be a kind of defamation of the original content. Emotions are not correctly transmitted. I suppose that some not very good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a little sturdy, which is not what the film should have been. I also noticed a bit of over-action in some of his scenes. I am a sharp critic of Aishwarya Rai :) I can not help it; Sorry. "Raincoat" was a good film by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not impressed at all.
