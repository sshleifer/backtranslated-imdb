It could not have come from a different country or a different time. This film is full of psychedelia and influenced the Italian cinema of the late 60s. So, pseudo serious and sexually free. Sumptuous settings and dream music make it a visual and sound delight. In addition, we will have the beautiful Dagmar Lassander, surely at its best. The evil adventures make the race crazy and if the frolics around the mimosa towards the end seem too long, it is only another rather charming trait of the time. You were probably supposed to share these few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend, which, of course, heralds a turning point in the process. It could have been better if Philippe Leroy did not look so strange with his frayed red hair and twisted facial expression. He does well though and has many silent moments where Dagmar is frolicking and he has to show a mix of love and hate. It's not an ordinary narrative film, but for those who like something different, that's definitely it.
