I remember seeing this movie at the theater and enjoying it. I stumbled across the fear network last month and looked at it again and found it better with age. First of all for those of you who describe this cheese as a 1980s cheese if you compare it objectively to the horror movies of the last two decades, it compares very well if compared to movies in its a unique horror sub-genre that I would call action / horror versus a psychological horror such as "The Shining" or "the exorcist". <br /> <br /> In addition, this film really offers good value for money (or in this case, a bad image). The film actually has a character development and gives enough story of the infamous soft-boiled house to create the mood just before the characters get in front of the door. The film also has several hilarious liners and gives the appropriate mood to a horror movie. If you compare NOD to big budget contemporary horror movies like "I'm a legend" (Vincent Price's version was much better), this movie really stands out. Modern horror movies have become almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no plot or character development and are totally predictable. Special effects dominate these movies from beginning to end and the characters are 24k plastic. If it is a horror cheese of the 80s, I will occupy more than 95% of the current entries in this genre. <br /> <br /> To conclude, seeing NOD once again reminded me of the beautiful Jill Terashita and wondering why I did not see her in more horror movies or otherwise. Jill on a strange chance that you were reading this - I think you are gorgeous and should have been in more movies. Finally, if you like horror movies, you will probably like this one a lot.
