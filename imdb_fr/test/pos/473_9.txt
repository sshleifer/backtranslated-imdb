You Are Alone is a beautiful film, almost delicate, intelligently directed, written with precision, with two complex and captivating performances, and a turn of an end that nobody will see coming, but will make you want to see the film a second time returns see all the clues that you misinterpreted. <br /> <br /> The story, that of a high school girl who drowns her depression and clumsiness by working a few hours a week as a "schoolgirl" escort of $ 500 an hour, and the depressed neighbor who discovers her secret and hired her for an afternoon at a downtown New Haven hotel, presents breathtaking performances from Jessica Bohl as a girl and Richard Brundage as her neighbor. <br /> Bohl as Daphne gives a decisive performance tied with Maggie Gyllenhaal in the secretary. She captures the anguish of a teenager growing up in her own skin, and when she talks about always having control, one begins to realize that she is not in control at all, but at the risk of going to- beyond, which, I suppose, somehow it does. <br /> <br /> Brundage while Buddy is depressed, angry, heartbroken, the carapace of a man. But it is not until the surprising conclusion of the film that you will fully understand his pain. <br /> <br /> After a very short opening session, which will appeal to most independent moviegoers, and who has the right to religious outings, we are brought into the hotel room. At first, you're not sure about these people, nor about the style of filming. Shaky, boring ... like the characters. Until you realize their story, told in brief flashbacks. They are initially conflictual for a reason, as is the camera. But as they open, that the story is quiet, the camera too. And, I do not know, after 20 minutes, you find yourself unable to look away from your screen. <br /> <br /> We just saw the world premiere at the Brooklyn Film Fest - - where the director asked the audience if someone was expecting the end and not a person answered yes ?? I almost wish the film is already on video to be able to watch it again. Thinking back to some of the film's conversations, especially a very candid dialogue about fantasy and apogee, I really thought things were going in a very different direction. But now I realize that many of their conversations meant something completely different from what I thought. I need to see him again !!! But as dark and sexual as the conversation is, to say the least, I found myself laughing more than I would have imagined because of its candor, which definitely falls into the "things we think, but that does not matter." do not have the courage to say it ". This is very straightforward, especially when you realize that many things have a completely different meaning, which will sometimes make you feel uncomfortable, especially if you look at You Are Alone with a partner. Something to talk about maybe discuss about? Then maybe he should come with a warning: You should be alone when you look! The music is amazing. I would have gone home and would have bought the soundtrack of my favorite online music store if I could, the movie is as beautiful as all that was shot After the director of the screening, Gorman Bechard, was asked about the type of process that he was using to get such a beautiful digital footage His answer: none They could not afford it <br /> <br /> I have to give a credit to Bechard I'm a big fan of his two short films -m√©trages, The pretty girl and the objects d years in the mirror, but they could not even prepare me for the complexities and surprises of this film. <br /> <br /> To everyone involved: bravo.
