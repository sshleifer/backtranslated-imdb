I read viciously hidden remarks on earlier comments claiming that this film showed a group of gays arguing about their homosexuality. <br /> <br /> That could not be more misleading. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. It contains only three homosexual characters and one of them is victim of the prejudices of people like the one who wrote the comments, despite his admission of fairness. <br /> <br /> Pip's grandfather was not homosexual. The tender scene of the soldier and his sergeant is a masculine bond at the crucial moment of death. But some people are shocked by a kiss and host a scene showing the guts of a man killed by a bomb. <br /> <br /> The main object of the film is the direct relationship between Pip, this pretty girl and their face social obligation and parenthood. <br /> <br /> Ralph Rewes www.r1313.info
