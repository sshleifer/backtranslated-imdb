"O Brother, Where Art Thou" is a joyous account of Homer's "Odyssey", which takes place in Mississippi in the 1930s and is full of offbeat splendor that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Three unfortunate convicts escape to find a treasure - and more than their share of adventure - in this enchanting film. George Clooney is in good shape ingenuous as a talkative and kind leader of the trio; but the real congratulations go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson, his zany but adorable cohorts, nicknamed "Soggy Bottom Boys" by the character of Clooney after being baptized by total immersion in a river. The three men broke a record under the pen name to make money, and unwittingly felt the overnight sensations with the status of "rock star". The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to call it almost musical. And there are incredible feats in filmmaking here: the KKK gathering scene is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene when Dorothy's friends save her from the witch's castle in 'The Wizard of Oz 'to cinematographic plagiarism. And what an amazing job of plagiarism! Without giving an end, I must say that the highlight of the film is one of the most breathtaking sequences of all time (it's comparable to the spectacular finale of Magnolia, another one of my favorites). 'O Brother' is a must, a perfect 10!
