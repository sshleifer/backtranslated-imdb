This is one of those movies that contains everything. I do not think I would tire of seeing him. Hopefully other films like this one will be made in the future. The cast was perfect in every respect. In a sense, Engelbert Humperdink's song "I never had to say goodbye" is the song that comes alive. You will surely laugh and cry throughout the scenario. I'm just surprised I never saw him this weekend. I think it's really worth seeing and your heart will be glowing. It would be nice to snuggle with your "darling"; sip a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other. There is so much heart and emotion that you honestly do not know where to turn. You will know exactly how the character feels. The real family expression is available throughout. In fact, you will sometimes think that you are part of this family or that they are part of your family. To see him!
