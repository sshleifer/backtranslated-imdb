This film talks about so many things. The most obvious is the power that the film can have on an audience and how to capture the life of a movie can be a kind of magic. There is also the tense relationship between China and the West, as many Chinese have seen (probably rightly) the "barbarians" as trying to seize their way of life and pollute it. Liu even seeks to preserve his lifestyle on film because he sees that it will disappear one day. Liu is also the internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of China and the philosophy of self-determination of the West. All these themes are very skillfully woven into a coherent and enjoyable whole by Hu. A very nice film.
