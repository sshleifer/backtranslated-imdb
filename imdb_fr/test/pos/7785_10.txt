In my opinion, a film can be better evaluated according to the number of "best scenes" that are. There are probably at least 80 to 90 scenes in the whole movie that are probably considered "better" by someone or the other. <br /> <br /> This film is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who called him ahead of time, probably because he bombed at the box office. However, I think that all generations can understand this movie and have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I am personally happy that Mahmood is also part of the film. His role is not "meaty", but it's good to see that he's part of the hottest Hindi movie cast ever.
