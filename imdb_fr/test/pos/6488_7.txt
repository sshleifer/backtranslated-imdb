It is sometimes difficult to define what separates a successful and delightful comedy from a comedy that falls flat. In this case, the artificial plot on a spoiled rich girl who plans to remove her nieces from the "bohemian" Greenwich Village that raises them, to fear only for herself, is not promising. And nothing in the filmography of director Leigh Jason indicates that he was a neglected great talent. And yet, he had to be responsible for creating a relaxed and cheerful atmosphere on the set, which was faithfully recorded on the film. <br /> <br /> He also had the good sense to shoot this movie properly. The only flaw is Miriam Hopkins in a game for which Ginger Rogers would have been perfect. Hopkins is efficient but fragile, lacking the warmth and sexy side that Rogers could have had. She is also embarrassed by a pair of oddly long and oozing false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. But a very young and very handsome Ray Milland could not be better in an exuberant comic performance, without inhibition and great charm. <br /> <br /> And better than that, especially for New York residents, is the Hollywood portrayal of Greenwich Village in 1937. Though completely synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer. Artistic Director Van Nest Polglase has created a friendly mix of furnished apartments and dilapidated shared courtyards that are the perfect backdrop for the collection of artists, artists, intelligent artists and spectators. Guinn Williams is the best performer. He brings softness and light to his role as a sculptor-sculptor-couturier, suggesting self-invention and the fluidity (sexual and other) of life in the village. Even more refreshing, Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby play little girls. Sober, intelligent and humorous, these girls look like real human beings and do not look like the child professional actors of the time. <br /> <br /> Two memorable cartoon pieces are of particular interest: Ray Milland's demonstration of a vacuum cleaner to a woman with a screaming baby is played with more spontaneity than expected (the baby and his contortions are wonderful "moments found") and a fake domestic "game" in a window of a department store that degenerates into a free-All is also fun. The film slowly slides down with a spotless trial and never regains its fame when the action takes place on Long Island, but this film still deserves to be viewed.
