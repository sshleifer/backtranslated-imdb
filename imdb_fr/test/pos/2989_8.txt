I can hardly remember what decade I saw this movie. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late-night movie in the middle or early 80's, and much of it has been with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea that it would have been shown in theaters, or that anyone else, even new, would have existed. I do not think I even mentioned the film to anyone. <br /> <br /> But a half-life later, I still remember the movie I had watched late at night. I think that the characters' innocence, their situation, their mutual affection over a long period, have left a lasting imprint for reasons that I do not quite understand. Maybe because I was a teenager when I saw her, and it touched me one way or another ..... I really do not know! I also REALLY wanted to know what would happen after the end of the movie. Oh, agony !! <br /> <br /> I have never seen it before, nor since, but I would like. I watch it informally, but I doubt now that the film will have been shown and it seems to have faded into oblivion. But I would probably miss it in the TV guide even though it was DID. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Read the comments here renewed my interest. If anyone knows of his availability in Australia, write to me and let me know. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Sean Bury ... Nice to see you here. I took a look at your story and noticed your last appearance in a James Bond movie. What are you doing so far? Oh, and do you have a copy of the movie? CHEERS!!!
