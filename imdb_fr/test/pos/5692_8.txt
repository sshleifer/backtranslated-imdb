"Black Water" is one of the most tense movies I've watched for a long time. The story goes quickly as she follows three tourists (all excellent actors) in a swamp during a guided tour with a Butch tourist guide on a small boat. Shortly after anchoring in a remote area of ​​the marsh, they are overturned by something huge in the water. <br /> <br /> Soon, the three manage to make a big tree nearby when they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. Over the next two days, they must desperately try to escape the evil watchful eye of the crocodile, who does not seem to want to leave. The movie hangs out a bit, but what can you expect from the frame and the limited budget? It's so much better than "Primeval" and other recent thrillers of crocodile / underwater predators. The tension is heavy and the three tracks give fantastic performances. Really scary, this film touched a chord of claustrophobic fear in me. Apparently based on real events.
