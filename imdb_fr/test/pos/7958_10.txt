Palwol ui Christmas is very Korean. If you went to Korea or have Korean friends, know what I mean. Koreans are very traditional people, they see love very discreetly. a kind of feeling that you do not find in today's world. I think that's why this movie is so special. it is wrong to compare this film to Shunji Iwai's "Love Letter", the Japanese are very good but could never make one like that of Palwol ui Christmas. if you have a chance please see this movie for yourself.
