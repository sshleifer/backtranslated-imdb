It was the best movie I saw in 2000. The Cohen brothers never let me down before, and they certainly did not do it this time either. <br /> witty, intelligent and very entertaining. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there are a lot of things about Cohen, strange characters and special gadgets, a well-developed plot and a magical camera. But no Cohen film is like any other Cohen film, if you forget the overall quality, of course. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the real masterpiece in this film comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is superb too. <br /> <br /> A light film, with a musical touch that evolves its story around rednecks and old country music - brimming with wit and intelligence. It's a very unlikely combination. But that's exactly what this picture is.
