This film made me a rugby fan and coach Larry Gelwix. The characters in the story slipped and fell before they began to grow as they struggled in incredibly loud conflicts. These were understandable and completely credible. As in life, there was no easy solution to the problems they faced. Stunning actors and an excellent script gave life to this true story. I wish there were more films like this one. Nowadays, I look almost exclusively at true stories that are worthwhile because they are usually much more interesting than fiction. Moreover, this one is a source of inspiration and teaches us not to abandon someone too quickly.
