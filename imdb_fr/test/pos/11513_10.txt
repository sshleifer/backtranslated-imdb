It's the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years. This will surely be in the same row with masterpieces such as The Squad, Apocalypse Now, The Doors, The Dog's Heart (Russian film). Really, the game of the boy and his parents is so good that you can not even say they "play". No, they live as if it happened to them. Note the smile on faces when the main hero agrees to take a walk with them. Hate and love in one piece. And the final scene! <br /> <br /> Really, I'm still under the impression of this movie. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to combine humor and tragedy, but if you succeed (and Frederikson does), the impact would be twice as strong. <br /> <br /> I compared it to "A FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NID". I like this film either (and the novel itself is good too), but after the Frederikson film, it seems simple. (The same difference I noticed after watching the movie "American history X" and "ROMPER STOMPER" - the latter is deeper). I mean that Milos Forman showed only the material point of view of the problem. You look at it, then you say Yes, it's a good movie, I like it, I do not like it, and that's it. But "Angels" leaves you a broad base for thinking. There is no bad guy in the movie. Because each of them has the right to behave as he does. Like the girlfriend of one of the patients. Of course, she is young and pregnant and the fact that her husband is at the clinic is a problem for her, but the feelings and emotional experience of her ex-friend are even stronger (the result is her suicide). Why ask him what he did? Are not you crazy to ask? Why not support him, help him, understand him? Finally, it is even fun that these people talk to each other. They say things of genius! I would like to say a lot about this movie, but I'm not very good at English. But I'm sure that those who watched the movie understand me. <br /> <br /> Good luck! <br /> <br />
