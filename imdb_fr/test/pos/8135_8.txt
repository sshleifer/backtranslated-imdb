When an idea has been successful during these "Golden Days" of Silent Movies, you can bet that your last cent will be repeated; although "rework" is the term used. Of course, one could argue that this company being reorganized has never left us, because success in movies or television always leads to a trend. all competing parties seeking to present their own version of such successful film or television program. <br /> <br /> On this last premise, we strongly disagree; because it's copy or plagiarism, clear and simple. <br /> <br /> THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, must have been very well received; for ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929) has been reworked on the Roach Lot, not once, but twice over the next three years. We were treated to Laughing Graving (Roach / MGM, 1931), in which the goat was replaced by a cute little puppy. In addition, the weather is turned into winter deaths in the middle of a snowstorm. They also made other changes to their composition by replacing owner Edgar Kennedy with owner Charlie Hall. <br /> <br /> The second overhaul of the premise of the hidden animal is the 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932). substituted for a female monkey from a dissolved and vanished circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees. The circus paid its employees with their assets and the boys received the chimpanzee as the ultimate payment. <br /> <br /> RETURN to our original "victim", the subject of today, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? THE court starts quite simply. The boys meet the goat on the street and the nanny follows them back to their rooming house; after Stan gave him a donut. The comic moments that follow are generated by the interaction between L & H and the slow-burning exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their owner. The impact of the incident is magnified by the interaction that occurs at night. And how lucky would it be; their room is located directly above the owner's quarters. <br /> <br /> Besides the noise, the goat's bath, its smell and the owner Edgar's suspicions about the illegal presence of another person in Laurel & Hardy's play; We were very amused by a little gag that the Censors may have missed. While warning the boys of the noise they were making and reminding them of the rules of the house that unauthorized people would spend the night, regardless of gender. <br /> <br /> The camera is made from inside the boy's room, on their shoulder. With Edgar in the lobby and facing them, he warns; "Remember, it's a respectable establishment!" At the very moment when he says that, a lady dressed in an evening dress walks behind and behind the owner; followed by a sailor in uniform who raises his hat by the way! POODLE SCHNITZ !!
