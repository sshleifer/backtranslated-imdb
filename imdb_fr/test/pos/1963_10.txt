I just saw this movie for the second time. I saw it for the first time in the mid-90s as a selection of Vanguard videos. He has retained his power. <br /> <br /> It's interesting in many ways. The first is that it is based on a true story. The second is a springboard for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And thirdly, Dennis Hopper plays one of his most maladaptive / psychotic social roles. <br /> <br /> The film is also a study of how people act in different contexts. You have one-to-one, family, peer group, school, society, etc. The story shows how a person will act in each context. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find the details of the actual murder compared to the movie. I saw a short excerpt indicating that it had happened in California and that several classmates had been taken away to see the corpse. <br /> <br /> This is a good choice for rainy night video rentals. Be prepared to feel disturbed in the end.
