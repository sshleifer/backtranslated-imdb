I bought it at the budget department last week. I already had Halloween and Halloween II, and as I want to collect all the horror movies, I chose this. after all, the first two were good. <br /> <br /> This movie is smart enough to tell the truth. he seems to create the correct atmosphere, and has a nice "Michael Myers story". he uses the ancient places of the original, and the main character is the kid that laurie incited to keep as babysat from the fatal halloween of 1978 ... <br /> <br /> The climax is also quite satisfactory . Anyway, it's much better than H20, which, frankly, is absolute shit.
