Wow, here's another great movie about golf. It's at least three years in recent years that I really appreciated: they were well done, beautifully filmed and inspiring. The other two were "Bobby Jones: A Genius Shot" and "The Legend of Bagger Vance." Defeating all professionals by an amateur and winning the United States Open Golf Tournament is an unprecedented achievement. I believe this is the only time in 100 years that it has been accomplished. I do not know how much this film is a drama with dramatic effects. I know that I intend to read the book and that in real life, Francis Ouimet had a three-time lead in the playoffs with only two holes to play, contrary to what we saw in the film. <br /> It does not matter. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is a fact. It's an incredible story and the filmmakers did a great job in presenting it here. This is not something for golf lovers; it's a funny movie. Kudso to Bill Paxton, the actor turned director, for his outstanding work. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's mostly golf, but there are secondary intrigues, as Ouimet's relationship with his father and a pretty young woman is obviously interested in him. It's also a touching story of someone giving a little child a chance. The film also deals with Vardon demons who claim to come from the wrong side of the tracks and try to do so in an elitist sport, which was for both Europeans and Americans. <br /> Shia LaBeouf is seductive as Ouimet as Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who do not know, Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day, perhaps even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is described as a friendly and warm guy. a true human being the other major competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is portrayed as a mean and brutal guy. <br /> <br /> The fourth main character in this golf story might be the coolest person in the film: a fifth-year boy who ends up being the younger of Ouimet at the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the film. <br /> <br /> If all this - a playoff game with the huge underdog against two powerful pros and ending up on the last hole - was not true, you might think, "Oh, man, that's it." is so hokey, who could believe it? " That's what makes this story really fun to finally see filmed. As with another 2005 sports film - "Cinderella Man" - here's another great film that has been unfairly ignored regarding prizes. I guess the beautiful movies do not win ..... just the hearts of their audience.
