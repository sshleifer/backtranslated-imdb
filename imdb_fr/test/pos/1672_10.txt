If the hug kind owes much to Walter Huston, he also wishes to thank Jules Dassin, a man who was ahead of his time and who suffered a lot because of his blacklist when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr. Dassin, but settling in Europe proved that he was taller than the same people who had contributed to his death in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> "Rififi" is an elegant film in which all elements are brought together thanks to the vision of Mr. Dassin. He decided to adapt Auguste Le Breton's novel because he saw the possibilities of transforming it into a film of capers that instantly became a classic. Jules Dassin was penniless in Paris when he discovered the city that would serve as background to his film. The bad weather paid for Mr. Dassin because the streets were always wet and there was not much to do to show them. <br /> <br /> When we meet Tony for the first time, he plays cards. Tony seems to be in poor health; he coughs all the time and sweats profusely. After losing all his money, he goes to Jo, the Swede, who tells him about a possibility of theft at Maupin & Webb, the luxury jewelery in a small Parisian city. They convey the idea to Mario, who suggests Caesar, the Milanese expert in the field. <br /> <br /> Tony, recently released from prison, learns that Mado, his former lover, is now with Grutter, a creep that has a nightclub. In confronting Mado, instead of loving, all he feels is scorn, and the encounter ends badly and he throws her out of place. Grutter does not like Tony, who is his natural enemy because of his relationship with Mado. <br /> <br /> When the day comes, the gang can go to the building on the second floor, just above the jeweler's shop, the owner lives, but he is not there. Everything is going well and the gang is doing well with the jewels. Caesar, the Milanese, a typical man, takes a ring as a souvenir that he gives in turn to the singer in the Grutter's nightclub. This tactical error is the spark that unveils the well thought out plan. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais did an excellent Tony. He showed a tired man who may have been on his last flight. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and the director, Jules Dassin, are interpreted as Jo, Mario and Cesar, the jewelry thieves of the quartet. Marie Sabouret plays Mado. Marcel Lupovici plays Grutter with moderate intensity. Robert Hussein, who will later go to the cinema, impresses with his RÃ©mi, one of Grutter's men. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the superb work of Camera Philippe Agostini, who captured the atmosphere of Paris and the places of origin of all these criminals. The music of Georges Auric plays well with the action of the film. Jules Dassin was curious about the films he made, and unfortunately, it's our loss, because this man was a genius, as evidenced mainly by "The Naked City", "Night and the City" and "Rififi ".
