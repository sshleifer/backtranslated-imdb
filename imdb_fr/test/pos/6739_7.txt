It's a funny and fun comedy that comes from the age and comes from the later, more mature period of Neil Simon's writing. Although there is a lot of nonsense to do, it's not one of Neil Simon's pieces where each character throws solitary jokes for 2 hours as if they were guest stars on a special Bob Hope show. There are also dramatic elements (some works, some are excessive) that give some weight to the story. <br /> <br /> The performances are good in all areas, especially Blythe Danner as a mother (although Judith Ivey and she have oddly, WASP choice to play Jewish women). I have never been a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I will say he hits hard as the uncomfortable, clumsy and totally excited narrator / protagonist of adolescence. <br /> <br /> The movie looks a lot like Woody Allen's "Radio Days", but it's more imaginative and fun than this one.
