I'm not sure how the "weighted average" of IMDb scored so low on this film. This is in my opinion and according to all other accounts an overlooked jewel of a movie. Rip Torn is fantastic as the stubborn Noel Lord, and Cardinal Tantoo is a superlative as a mate. Torn and Cardinal are both underrated actors who are finally given a stage to work their art. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is not always pleasant, but very real. This is not the "humorous and touching love story" that is presented as on the DVD cover. In the end it's a tragedy. Lord is simply aiming too high and ignoring all the advice he has been given. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, as are the period sets.
