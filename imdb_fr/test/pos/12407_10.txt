I like this film. Tense with great characters. The kid of "Sandlot" is excellent, as is Corey Feldman. When kids storm the bank, it's pure adrenaline. Inside the bank, it looks a little like a "fly lord" situation in which they turn around. Justin Walker from "Clueless" is wonderful. I saw this on "Showtime" while surfing the channels. It was a nice surprise. James Remar is also very good here as the sheriff of the small town. Taylor Nichols, whom I love a lot about "Barcelona", is also doing a good job as a federal agent. I recommend this film to all burglary movie fans with lots of good characters. I was shocked to discover that Roger Corman was a producer on this subject, since the film is not a serial movie.
