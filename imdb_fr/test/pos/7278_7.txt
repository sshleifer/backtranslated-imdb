After reading the dreadful reviews of this movie, including the comments quoted by Colin, I have hardly bothered to add this film to my Firth Film collection, although being the Firth fan I am, the plot got the better of me! <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I really enjoyed the movie. There was suspense, drama and plot and scenes of V.sexy Colin. The plot left me guessing until the end credits and I felt that once we had passed the opening scene of Jennifer Rubens, the actress had played her role convincingly. Colin has been as brilliant as ever and I'm delighted to see him play a "dark side" character, a "shiver runs my back" and after watching this, I'm looking forward to seeing Colins' recent movie, "Trauma soon, to be on DVD. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe it was not a film that put you in the mouth and you could not "fall asleep on the ground", especially towards the end Because there are a lot of things going on, but that's what I liked about it, the acting was subtle, fortunately not exaggerated (like a lot of thrillers thriller), it made the film all the more chilling to watch. We just can not guess what the character of Colins (Ross Talbert), or that of Jennifer Rubens (Jamie Harris) was going to do next, and there were a lot of surprises in reserve, I sat on the edge of my seat All along, with a cushion at your fingertips! <br /> <br /> Personally, I am very happy to have watched 'Playmaker' and I will definitely go back and get back to the view. I think any fan of Firth would benefit from watching this movie, if they did not like the plot, so look at Colin ;-))
