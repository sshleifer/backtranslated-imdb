Note: I tried not to reveal significant twists (or the end), but if you're concerned, consider watching the movie before continuing reading - Thanks! <br /> <br /> This was obviously a pretty high budget production, published by Paramount. The story follows the exploits (supposedly true) of the man of the road, Jack Shepard, in the 1700s in London. It was a locksmith who had been blackmailed by the "thief taker" into a life of crime to save his brother's life. After being dubbed by the robber-taker, we become a kind of Robin Hood character and get the support of the people. He then escapes several prisons (including the infamous Newgate) while having time to "entertain" many noble women. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie, even though the plot was a little predictable. The film was shot in Glencree and Wicklow, Ireland and the sets were very well done and looked realistic. I think Clavell captured the lively atmosphere of London in the 1700s very well and I appreciated his creative use of viewing angles. And, unlike many films describing this period, Clavell does not show us the deplorable conditions in which the poor lived (several people argue over a scene for a meat pie that went around the street). <br /> <br /> Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I'll admit that the beautiful scenery and political commentary behind Clavell's upcoming film The Last Valley (a parable of the Vietnam War) is missing, but it still deserves a projection or two. It is unfortunate that it has never been (to my knowledge) published on video or DVD.
