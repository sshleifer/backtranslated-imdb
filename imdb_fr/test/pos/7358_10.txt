It may not have had the big budgets, celebrities or endorsements of Scream, Urban Legend or I know what you did last summer, but Campfire Tales had one thing that was missing from these three films: the real horror. <br /> <br /> This film A year before the subject of urban legends, aptly titled and exciting, Urban tackled the subject of urban legends. It was intriguing, masterfully scripted and logical, in a way that I know what you did last summer could only dream. Finally, he kept his goal and ended with a wave while Scream sparkled and died. <br /> <br /> What's most exciting about the film is the variety of horror writers and directors have achieved. The overall story of teenagers around a campfire was a classic terror of the unknown (but certainly expected) fate that awaited them in the forest, but the tales themselves are where the film was really shined. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is pure and fast urban myth. It is based on a popular legend, and the director plays with the style and rhythm of the action, which makes it more captivating because we know what will happen. <br /> <br /> The first campfire story is a thriller ahead. Based on another popular myth, we do not really realize it until the end, both because it blends so well in history and because action catches our attention. Thriller trilogy, this one plays on our fear of the unknown and includes several sequences of "jumps" well done that do not feel as cheap and as contrite as those of films like Scream or Urban Legend. <br /> <br /> The second story is more suspenseful. This time, although the characters still do not know what's going on, we know it, and that gives horror. No need for cheap thrills here. <br /> <br /> The final narrative contains elements of the supernatural and uses a scary / trippy atmosphere to frighten the viewer. Because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation, our fear comes from their intensity and what they can not explain. This is the true ghost story of the trio. <br /> <br /> I did not think I could enjoy Campfire Tales when I rented it. I thought that if I did not like his more acclaimed and more budgeted counterparts, how could I love him? <br /> <br /> The truth is that this film succeeds where others are not up to par. .
