One of the major successes of The Decline of Western Civilization, the independent breakthrough of director Penelope Spheeris, is that it can perhaps appeal to non-punk fans as well as the most fervent fans. More importantly, it captures a moment in history before the movement becomes completely "market worthy", when groups play (or, at least, try to play in some cases) in questionable and dirty clubs in front of a club. audience as moving. self respect as they had respect for the bands. For the fan, like me, there are precious conversations with quasi-legends of the punk-scum of Los Angeles, the dead, the living and hard workers. <br /> <br /> The performances and interviews include, among others, The Circle Jerks, X, Black Flag (before the arrival of Henry Rollins), Catholic Discipline, Fear, the Alice Bag Band, and the more memorable (in my opinion) being the germs. Although I knew some of the bands and performers of the movie (mostly Jerks and Black Flag), I had only heard rumors about the lead singer (the late) Darby Crash, and from the footage, he seems to be one. epitomies of the punk movement. He does not take himself too seriously, he loves to drink. Sometimes, when he speaks, it's gibberish and the attitude he takes on stage is both funny and exhilarating. Such an artist would probably scare Steve Miller and Jackson Browne. <br /> <br /> The decline of Western civilization may not appeal to all non-punk fans looking for this film (hard to find on video), but do not necessarily turn them off either. Similar to an anthropologist who sneaks into the evening, Spheeris understands the behavior of these people, their motives, their likes and dislikes, and the power they have both on screen and on screen. Some of them end almost as usual, others do not, but they are only offensive to those who are not too open to things. On top of that, the movie is a must for the types of kids who think they are punk fans just because they listen to Good Charlotte and Blink-182: if you want to get the real scoop on the movement and the kind of rock that you claim to love, give the pioneers a chance.
