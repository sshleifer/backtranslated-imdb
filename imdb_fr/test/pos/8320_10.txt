"Walking with dinosaurs" is absolutely great in every respect. Kenneth Branagh tells a story that really makes you want to listen. The documentary scenario really gives the impression that researchers and writers have done their homework. It's so insightful that it makes you addicted and never lets go. The music is also brilliant, very dramatic when it is necessary. But it is the visual effects and scenery that make this documentary work so well. The scenery is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so real, with simply amazing effects. It is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but also children. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it is a watch not to be missed. Not only did I love that, but it's probably the best documentary I've ever seen. If anything, it could have been longer, except that it's perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
