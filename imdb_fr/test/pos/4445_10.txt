"Do not Torture a Duckling" is one of the coolest Italian horror movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my hand. To call it giallo is a little misleading, because it's not really a mystery of murder. It's more of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Complete one of the most brutal and bloody scenes of all time in such an old film, Fulci's twisted and spinning film is brimming with a scary vibe and an Italian vibe Ancient. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect. The finish is authentic and original. <br /> <br /> After seeing "Do not torture a duckling", you really have to wonder how the last things Fulci have been so badly treated. I like all his stuff, but he's gone astray. Maybe he thought he had already done it ... Because with this movie, he hits hard. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who thinks that Dario Argento has the giallo genre. Fulci beats him with this one. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 children.
