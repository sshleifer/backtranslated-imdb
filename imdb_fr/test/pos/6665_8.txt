I really enjoyed it the two times I watched it. And both times, I went back thinking a lot, and the "moral of history". I agree with another reviewer that the film does not focus on the science-fiction aspects that might be expected of an extraterrestrial film on Earth, but rather concerns the human condition. The characters in the psychiatric hospital give a glimpse of the situation and how they go from hopelessness to hope. This film has touches of sadness to humor to sympathy at the finale "is there or not it". The last question has been well dealt with, and although some may say that you do not know what is going on at the end and the question remains unanswered, I think it's much more detailed than something fictitious like the Ronin Niro movie) where you never find what's in the box and you feel very frustrated because of it. I highly recommend K-PAX. 8/10
