It's a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show thinks this could result in a sequel, but I doubt that it will yield enough money. <br /> <br /> Deniro proves that he can once again become a great Straight Man with hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people rather than CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo - well, she's just fun to watch anyway and she played an excellent role. <br /> <br /> Wild and unusual waterfalls, especially the scene of the garbage truck. It was worth the detour to the theater. We needed to laugh and had a lot of film and good times at the end. DO NOT leave at the beginning of the credits! <br /> <br /> At least 7.
