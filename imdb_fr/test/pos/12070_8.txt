This is not a great movie, but actors (especially children) help admirably to lead this very sad and yet frustrated plot, filled with clichés on clichés. Poor family in their fifties in Central America, dying mother, alcoholic father, 10 children (including one with epilepsy) and a terrible decision to make. It's very easy to watch and some of the kids' performances move without being sick or naff. And the little Frank and Warrnen steal the show with the last scene that let me yell, no matter how many times I see it. A rainy afternoon movie that I recommend to everyone. Only those with the hardest heart might not be moved by it. Not on a par with Sophies Choice, but a good equivalent of TV movie !!!
