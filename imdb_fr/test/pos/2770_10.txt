I am absolutely disgusted that this film is not sold. Everyone who loves this movie should send an email to Disney and increase the demand. They should eventually sell it at that time. I would buy copies for everyone I know. Everything and everyone in this movie did a good job, and I did not understand why Disney did not put this movie on DVD or VHS in rental stores. At least I did not see any copy. This is a good nasty movie and should be seen by all. New generation children do not see it and I think they should do it. It should at least be put back on the channel. This film does not deserve a cheap download. It deserves the real thing. I'm sending them an email now. This film will be on DVD.
