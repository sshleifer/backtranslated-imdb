This film offers one of the greatest experiences available for movie buffs. It's certainly not a nice film, but it offers realities and emotions that the human mind may never have wanted to touch. It opens ways in the way an individual thinks, and then changes the person forever. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this film, it was in class and immediately after seeing it, I had to skip my next class and walk the campus to be able to get in shape . I felt devastated and, in a way, unreal, as if I did not exist. It was not until a few months later that I was talking about SHAME to a friend of mine and she asked me, "Oh, was that when you were spoiled after having it? saw, and that I found myself talking in a strange way? " I did not even remember meeting anyone or talking to anyone outside of that day, I was stunned. <br /> <br /> In terms of intrigue, it's the simple story of a couple torn apart by the war. The suffering is greater than that of the dead and at the end ... there are no words to complete the image that creates Bergman. It's like a horrible dream that makes you wake up, changing your own reality forever. This film must be seen.
