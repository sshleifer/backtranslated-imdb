I WILL BUY THIS FOR A DOLLAR !!! <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for a dollar and I saw a lot worse for a lot more !! <br /> <br /> It's a sci-fi sci-fi movie by Mark Stirton and according to the Making of (hysterical, by the way), production costs only $ 8,000. Eight thousand !!! It would not cost Hollywood half a minute! Nevertheless ---- This is a very funny movie. If you like difficult things, then you are in for a treat. They are rough characters with rough voices and severe insults. It did not bother me, but my girlfriend did it !! The actors are doing a good job and it's interesting to see people I have never heard of or seen before. It meant that I did not know who was going to die first. <br /> <br /> If you're watching a movie for its latest visual effects, watch Star Wars. The effects here are OK, but a little weak in space. But the monsters are very well done, if a bit like a predator. <br /> <br /> Stirton does an amazing job with not much and I would love to see his interpretation of a real Hollywood movie. At least it was not predictable and I almost fell off my chair when a guy had his head torn off! OK, so it's kind of a derivative of science fiction, but for this budget, it's an incredible attempt and anyone who thinks that making a sci-fi movie for 8g is easy or that it's happening a lot does not know anything about the film industry. <br /> <br /> Good marks for a good movie, extra notes to work so hard, extra notes for a really interesting shoot. No standard bull here, all production problems are solved for it to be like in Lost in Mancha only with a movie at the end. But why not comment? KEEP THE BASSES SCOTTISH!
