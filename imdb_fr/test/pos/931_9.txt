and there are not many in the history of cinema. "Red" seems to be a little hope. Hope in humanity and in life. But to say only that can be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of this bitter judge and the twentieth-century but wise model. Maybe this old and disappointing love story will not be repeated - there is the new couple with the young judge after the accident. But what about this camera master? You can not miss a second of the movie because you have to watch each of these faces. Kieslowski loved human beings and this is evident in the way the camera treats actors. Mrs. Jacob and Mr. Tringtignant are perfect. It's not just about this film, but the bad weather "You will not kill" and "A love story" that could make contemporary cinema seem like a way to express an artist's point of view . Too bad the American public - the average audience - can not see these films. At least they are not in the Maltese dictionary. And even Baseline does not know what to say about this unique man.
