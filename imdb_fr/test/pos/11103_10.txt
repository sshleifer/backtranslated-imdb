There is something in the true stories that makes them so much more interesting than fiction. I guess it's the fact that truth has always been more foreign than fiction. The Falcon and the Snowman tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and his boyfriend Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a former alter-boy and intellectual who seeks a job that can support and entertain him. His FBI father is able to pull strings and get his idealistic son working in the defense department. Boyce has little responsibility and seems to be complacent by drinking and having fun with his colleagues. However, with time, Boyce begins to learn secret information that makes him doubt the morality of his government. The idealist Boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the CIA leads primarily in Australia. Boyce finally decides to disclose some of the top secret information he has at the KGB. Of course, Boyce's mistake is to assume that because the US is doing bad things, the USSR is the good guy. Over time, Boyce and his drug friend, Lee (Penn), start selling their secret information to the KGB. What was once idealism is transformed into capitalism and espionage. The strength of this film lies in the incredible performances of Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best intentions, they will soon find themselves in an infernal spiral. Good direction, music, everything. Not only a great movie, but one of my favorites of all time.
