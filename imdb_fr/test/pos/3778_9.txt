This film is one of three films that Chapin then put together in a compilation that went on sale in the late 1950s under the title "The Chaplin Review". <br /> <br /> It was a strange film in some ways, because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his films insist on peace and brotherhood. This film, on the other hand, is a propaganda comedy intended to reinforce the efforts of the United States during the First World War. It's really strange to see Charlie as the "super soldier" who has captured 13 Germans alone, unknowingly and coldly fired in several seconds as a shooter, then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself. -even! Really, it was an important start for the little wanderer, although at the same time it was a lot of fun and fun. The film is exceptionally well paced and well done, and I'm sure it has been instrumental in strengthening the support of our troops at home (a pity that it was such a useless and expensive war).
