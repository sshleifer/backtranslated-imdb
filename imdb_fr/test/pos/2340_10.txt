Seriously engaging, intelligent and provoking dramatic reflection at its best. Middle, striking, moody and captivating. Every house should have a copy! Do not take my word to see it yourself. One Life Stand lets you think about your own lifestyle and the way you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting make it one of the best cinematic experiences of the year. The beginnings of John Kielty are a delight and add a touch of truth and realism to this deep and serious film. It's a film that cares and has an unparalleled honesty in recent years. No pursuit by car, but a movie filled with hum and emotions. I saw this film for the first time at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000 and I am now delighted to have a copy on DVD.
