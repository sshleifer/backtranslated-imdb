This sequel proves that Tim Burton was for all intents and purposes THE best choice for making a Batman movie. The story is centered on Baman attacking three enemies: the penguin (beautifully played by Danny DeVito), Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the beautiful Christopher Walken). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best entry in the series, it has it all: complex themes, complex characters and a dark tone that really stands out. The cast is simply beautiful, although DeVito is the multilayer penguin. Here is a guy who is bad, pitiful, funny and maybe the most important, scary. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants sends me shivers again. In other words, the casting is simply a pleasure to watch and give top-notch performances. <br /> <br /> I do not hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my favorite among all published Batmans (sorry, Fans of Dark Knight). If you want a superhero movie that has a bit more to offer than flashy effects and a large-scale action, then take a look at this underrated movie. <br /> <br /> At the very least, it's at least the best film Tim Burton ever made.
