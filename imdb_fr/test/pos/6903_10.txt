(Note: I saw I SELL THE DEAD TO DEATH at the Glasgow International Film Festival on January 20, 2009.) I Sell the Dead is a dark dark horror comedy set in the late Middle Ages. It stars Dominic Monaghan (Lost, The Lord of the Rings), Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Larry Fessenden (Session 9) and Angus Scrimm (Phantasm). <br /> <br /> The film begins with the brigandier Willie Grimes (Fessenden), always indignant and insensitive, dragged to the guillotine. and executed. His apprentice and partner in crime, Arthur Blake (Monaghan) is locked in the tower while waiting for his turn when Father Duffy (Perlman), a priest who suffers whiskey and shows an unhealthy interest in occultism, visits him with apparent intention. the recording of Blake's last confession. However, it soon becomes clear that Duffy's main interest lies in the more distant side of Blake's exploits. Most of the plot here is told as a flashback while Monaghan Duffy takes with stories of his career macabre. <br /> <br /> Initially, Grimes and Blake start out like simple, crispy body thieves, working for Dr. Quint (Scrimm), a macabre monster, a corrupt and insensitive anatomist who uses blackmail as a lever to counter his two anti-heroes and takes a rather unhealthy taste in his work. The two men meet for the first time with the undead when, one evening, Quint sends them on a mission to a desolate moonlit moor to recover a body mysteriously buried at a crossroads, apparently according to an old custom. But there is something different about this corpse. This one was wrapped in cloves of garlic ... and buried with a stake in his heart ... <br /> <br /> Following a terrifying encounter, not only do they develop a plan for get rid of the intriguing Doctor of machinations, but they also discover a secret subculture of occultists who will pay a good sum for the corpses, and an even better sum for the LIVING SPECIMENS of the undead. This leads our intrepid duo into the hidden underground trading world of "ghoul hunting", where they find themselves face to face, not just with vampires, monsters and zombies (and another paranormal entity for which I will not spoil surprise), but also rival ghoul hunters in the form of the murderous and murderous Murphy clan. <br /> <br /> I entered I Sell the Dead hoping a discreet cooler, slightly annoying and low budget. I was not prepared for the incredible imagination, the dizzying humor, the quality of play, the dialogue, the thick atmosphere and the pure personality that make I sell the dead an important competitor for my film. horror of the year. <br /> <br /> With the exception of some asperities, the production values ​​are really fantastic for such a small budget film - it seems to have been realized for around $ 20 million, and I was surprised when the director announced to the audience that his price was well under half (although he was not willing to give exact figures because the film was still sold to distributors). The "look" and tone of the film is a visual comic somewhere between Tim Burton and Hammer Horror, with nifty little insets of artwork. The plot is wonderfully surreal, but the idea of ​​a hidden underground world, parallel to everyday life but to which the general population is unable or unwilling to believe, is in fact an idea that makes sense in the world. context of the film. <BR/> <br /> As you can imagine, the acting is excellent. The characters are surprisingly well-fleshed, especially Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their perfectly scripted lines with just the right amount of impassive language to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic. Angus Scrimm also performs well in a rather brief but memorable role as Dr. Quinn, a slightly threatening fiddle-playing violinist. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - I loved it. It's been a long time since I was entertained by a movie. I can not find anything bad to say. Mark my words, it's one of those cult movies like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still discover and fall in love with 20, 30 or 40 years.
