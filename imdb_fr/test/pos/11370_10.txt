I saw this mini-series when I was in high school. I remember it as absolutely brilliant and convincing. At the time, I did not know any British actors of the series, but I have since learned that some of today's stars have played there, including Sean Connery (James Bond original, among other roles), Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth in "Shakespeare in love" among many other roles) and Eilene Atkins (probably best known for having created "Upstairs / Downstairs" but also superb in many acting roles). Like the other commentator, I would like to see him again. I'm sure the production remains timeless and I hope it was or will be released on VHS or DVD. If you have the chance to see it, do not miss it.
