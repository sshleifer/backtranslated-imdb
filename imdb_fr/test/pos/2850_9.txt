Nurse Betty impressed me all the time. It contains a beautiful set of characters, an original plot and an end that I should see coming but did not help you and pulls the strings to the heart. most were the interactions of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. These two are great and it's heart-warming to see that Rock will not make a shabby dish for Big Hollywood like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really, it should not be necessary to criticize his work anymore. Hell, Kiss the Girls was visible with him inside. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellwegger does her best with her role, and Kinnear is as good as her obession. <br /> <br /> Sweet movie with a nice touch of free violence in it to satisfy the lust of the male's blood. 9 stars 10 <br /> <br />
