I went to the preselection of "Rory O'Shea Was Here". I like this film better than I expected, because of the excellent casting and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two young disabled people. Rory is a free-spirited young man who wants to be independent despite his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his fingers, but he can speak eloquently and help his new friend, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and speech problems. I guess that's enough to start with a crying drama. Well it is. But with inspiring messages and deeply moving performances. It made me look at my life for things that I take for granted. What would I do if all I could do was move my two fingers? I should be grateful for what I have and what I am capable of doing. It's a good movie, although it could have been better.
