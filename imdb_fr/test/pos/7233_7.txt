This movie is really sick and funny. I made my friends cringe by describing it to them. I saw it about 8 months ago and I still have the song "Shall we meet at the river" that resonates in my head. <br /> <br /> This is basically a Romeo and Juliet tromatised, but it goes beyond what you expect. Let's just say incest, references to child abuse, gore (of course), but unfortunately, has some sort of happy ending ... somehow ... it's stranger than happy. Cappy Capulet was awesome! He has this kind of intellectual snob, he is violent, but civilized. He quotes more Shakespeare than anyone in the film ... while assuming his sadistic role as husband and father. <br /> <br /> The meat guy was pretty cool too. He was Juliet's fianc√©, deeply enamored of her, and would soon be heartbroken because of Tromeo. And Tromeo, a true romantic. He's a really nice guy, desperate to find true love. "She makes torches to burn briskly! Unfortunately, Troma had only to resort to this horrible false green vomit and their other antics. They are sometimes carried away by this thing. But hey, this movie impressed me a lot. How many times can I refer to it in real life situations ... wow it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> In any case, enjoy!
