The management of Wayne Wang is perhaps the ingredient that made this film much more impressive to me than "Slums of Beverly Hills", which covers a remarkably similar terrain. The interaction between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is fascinating. The real chemistry there. This film managed to introduce me into the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me into a depressed frustration. The character of Susan Sarandon hammers all the nerves that a narcissistic parent is able to touch in a teenager without security. She surprisingly manages to do this without appearing insane or intentionally sadistic. And Natalie Portman deviates each attack on the ego of her character with the resigned grace of a child intelligent and independent of the code, insensitive enough cynicism of Natasha Lyonne's character in "Slums of Beverly Hills". The character of Portman is a teenager with dignity under stress, an unusual creature in modern movies. The film reaches a very satisfactory resolution without much searching. I highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.
