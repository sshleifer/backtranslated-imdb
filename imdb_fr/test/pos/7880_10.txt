I really liked the movie "JOE". It really has become a cult classic among some age groups. <br /> <br /> The producer of this film is one of my personal friends. He is my father-in-law, my father-in-law. He lives in West Manhattan and owns a bungalow. in Southampton, Long Island. His son-in-law lives next to his bungalow. <br /> <br /> Currently, he does not make a production but mingles with an affair with HBO movies. <br /> <br /> As a person, Mr. Gil is a true gentleman and I would have liked to stay in the production sector.
