Hmmmm, ... ANOTHER Keystone comedy taking place in the park !!! It seems that the number one filming location for filming is in this same local park, as many Chaplin and Arbuckle films are installed! And while this is another initiative, it is sufficiently different and well done for me to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Fatty is interested in a younger and older Normande than usual. I think she's supposed to be a little younger, though, in her mother's eyes, she's TOO YOUNG to be interested in men. Well, Fatty does not share his feelings and soon, he and Mabel escape to have fun innocently. Things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. Fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel, ... and a LOT of problems result. <br /> <br /> A decent stimulation and the fact that this film does not rely too much on cheap zipper cards but on a reasonable plot a cute and pleasant little film.
