You can not really call prolific Roy Andersson (6 films in 37 years). Nor can you accuse him of being conventional; he does not do "right away", at least in narration. "You, the Living," his first film in seven years, is like a surreal documentary in which we see a lot of characters doing nothing, and if it sounds confusing, let me assure you that it's not the case. It's a fun, accessible film with a surprising heart, a slice of life far removed from what we normally see on the screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, "slice of life" is this is hardly the nickname that should be applied to this film because the life of most people is unlikely to look like this . The incidents on the screen cover the whole gamut from the almost terrifying ordinary to the downright crazy and while the characters can scroll, sometimes never to be seen again, others to reappear as if they were impatient to get the approval, Andersson gives them all a kind of caring affection. That, along with catchy music, ensures that the time we spend with them is well spent.
