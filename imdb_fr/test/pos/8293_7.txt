It is certainly a good movie, beautifully photographed and interpreted in an evocative way. However, it must certainly be criticized, and Mizoguchi, because it is not without flaws and weaknesses. Mizoguchi really cared about women and wanted to make statements about the lack of sympathy and total cruelty of the man. Yet, he sometimes takes a step ahead of himself by trying to make this statement by taking the wrong ways. This is certainly the case of "Crucified lovers", "Princess Yang Kwei Fei" and "Zankiku monogatari". He defines the scenario in feudal Japan, leaving the viewer at the end with the exclamation partially right: "boy, feudalism fears, I'm happy it's over ...". And true, some of the scenarios such weak films of Mizoguchi present would be impossible literary today. In addition, her female characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifice, which also simplifies the less appealing scenario. By saying this, "Crucified Lovers" is a good movie, with so few relative weaknesses, although Ueda's cynical and sometimes chilly prose, helps the scriptwriter to attribute it to this film. I always prefer and strongly recommend Mizoguchi's "realistic," contemporary "1936" films: "Osaka Elegy" and "Sisters of the Gion", as well as his latest masterpieces, in which he has demonstrated more than restraint and subtlety: "Ugetsu", "Sansho Dayu 'and' The life of Oharu '.
