It feels like an impressionist film; if there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> The story is well told, very poetic. characters well developed and well interpreted by the performers (or interpreted by the actors :)). <br /> <br /> At times, the film delights in its own sumptuous emotions and works well, unless you hate such emotion in the cinema - this is not the case in my case. <br /> <br /> It's a very humanistic film. <br /> <br /> The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the moved cook are very poetic in themselves. <br /> <br /> Well done. <br /> <br /> A good classic for any good movie collection.
