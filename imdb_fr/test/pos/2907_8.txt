He came before "the ten commandments" "the country of the pharaohs" "Ben Hur" and he is neglected today. It is unfair! According to the gigantic novel by Mika Waltari, it does not bring down prices! Waltari's novel was so huge, only a miniseries could have done justice (I hope it will be done someday) .Waltari, whose message is essentially Christian, remains intact (another of his books "the secret of the kingdom" (first part) takes place after the death of Christ in the Holy Land). <br /> <br /> "The Egyptian" is the emergence of a monotheism close to Christianity long before Christ: the Pharaoh (Wilding) is a kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the a real kingdom is not in the material world: it demands to return good for evil! And he has disciples who will eventually become martyrs (the scene where Simmons and the other worshipers of the sun god are killed is visually stunning and looks like a pagan ballet). priests, on the other hand, this new religion would mean the end of their influence on that is why they are looking for a strong man (Mature) capable of leading the army against the Hittites and their dangerous compatriots. Another religion, or another religion, should we say, is that of Sinuhe (Purdom) hours does not believe in anything (the sequence of the grain of sand is absolutely sensational and rises well above the average peplum!) > <br /> There is another fascinating aspect: the film resembles a blazing melodrama.Not only for the scenario (including the final revelation of the sister of Pharoah (Tierney) who dates from two years before "the ten commandments" ), but also for the splendor of cinematography: Viviani, in her book on Curtiz, speaks of a Baudelairian atmosphere, blue and golden, especially in scenes involving the prostitute (Darvi) who contemplates his reflection in the water of his bath, supreme narcissism. Around the hero, all the characters appear, disappear, reappear, but when they reappear, they followed their path and all the secondary intrigues were assembled with an accomplished skill. Beyond that, as such, is often the case in the "modern" melodramas, the story is a long step back, framed by two short sequences showing Sinouh√©, an old man who remembers. <br /> <br /> It is a magnificent sword and sandals, which had a strong influence not only in America, but also in Europe, especially In Poland, Jerzy Kawalerowicz directed a fascinating "faraon" (1966) who owed a lot to Curtiz.
