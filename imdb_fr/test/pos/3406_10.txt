It was the only movie to watch on the Civi war. In fact, my aunt played in this film as an extras in the Justin and Madeline weddings scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was authentic and accurate. The costumes were made with taste, the sequence was in order and even the accents were good. I really like Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and there was even excellent distribution. The Civil War is my favorite part of American history and I love movies about it. I've seen quite a bit, and this movie and its sequel North and South Book 2 took the cake. If you have not seen it, rent it. As soon as possible. It's quite an education.
