Mysterious psychological thriller with evocative and artfully photographed direction with an exceptional rendition of the dark Donald Sutherland and powerful supporting roles of Donald Pleasence and David Hemming. The material decides not to say more and goes from the investigation period to the story of the victim. The rarely and rather gloomy nature of the survey attracted me, but when he appeared alongside the victim showing his last days, she was less convincing and became a bit heavy and stock-like. Although the scenario is extremely detailed and complex to some extent, the final and surprising revelation had to be more shocking and its botched execution did not help. Howard Blake's musical score has an emotional edge that lasts, and the talent of director Claude Chabrol (although in most cases) has a strong and precise style, which makes the most of the dark places and the flexible distribution . Young faces Lisa Langlois and Aude Landry are also doing incredibly good work.
