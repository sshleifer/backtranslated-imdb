It's an exceptional film. It's both comedy, drama and suspense. The dialogue is exquisite. Most actors and actresses were very famous in their time and for good reason. You will probably recognize someone, even if you do not usually watch old movies. They also play a role that is particularly suited to their talents. <br /> <br /> A correction to the comment of another user is that two people, not one, are announced as dead in the accident. Maybe the two unlucky ones are a reflection of what the author considers important in life. The movie is too engaging to know who it is before it happens. <br /> <br /> The story is ahead of its time, but it does not lose the quality of an older movie. Time and effort have gone into focusing the camera's view and soundtrack, which modern filmmakers tend to forget.
