In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised moviegoers around the world with his epic epic Heimat: A Chronicle of Germany. Eight years later, he proposes a sequel, The Second Heimat: Chronicle of a Youth, which is even more amazing than its predecessor. <br /> <br /> In reality, it's not really a sequel. It is more of a "midquel" because it covers the events that took place between the ninth and the eleventh episode of the first cycle of Heimat. <br /> <br /> The second Heimat begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from his first love, Klarchen, by the grace of his intolerant mother and his elder brother (the controversy bore on the fact that he was a minor when she was about 25 years old). Irritated by these events, the young man swears never to fall in love again (a grandiose but scary scene) and decides to settle in Munich (as the director did at about the same time), in hope to become a professional composer. after a few years spent at the music academy. He stays in Munich for ten years and the thirteen episodes of Heimat 2, lasting two hours, cover this period, each of them focusing on a different person among Hermann's classmates, people who, like him, are looking for a "second home". country, "whether it be music, movies or something else, in which they can finally live in peace. <br /> <br /> Like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a union perfect film and television: the episodic structure several romantic secondary intrigues make it look like a soap opera.In fact, we must see the second Heimat in its entirety to be adopted successfully, while some chapters of Heimat 1 could be considered as separate stories (especially Hermann's adolescence) The style and content, however, are pure auteur cinema, with the familiar black / white / color transitions (in fact, a little more predictable) this time) and ambiguous characters, the latter being underlined by the relationship between Hermann and cellist Clarissa Lichtblau (Salom√© Kammer): They love each other clearly, but continue to deal with other people, delaying the inevitable until it is too late. This time, Reitz seems more pessimistic about his characters (at one point, Hermann is so disillusioned that he says, "The Beatles are way better than us!"), Building whole episodes around dark and controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. The decade he is exploring does not suit everyone, as some are dramatically marked by the defining events of the 1960s (especially the 68 revolution). <br /> <br /> Reitz also seems to have made this event series dedicated to film lovers, given the many cinematographic references (including a brilliant quote from Casablanca) and clever jokes (an episode takes place in Venice, whose festival of the film played an important role in the success of the Heimat saga). And since 1992, film buffs have been thanking him for having dedicated 26 hours of the most fascinating time ever devoted to celluloid.
