I do not really know what to do with this movie, especially after watching a movie as great as La Notte. Unfortunately, I saw this in German at an Antonioni film festival at the Frankfurt Film Museum. So I did not hear Malkovich's big voice. It is supposed to link four stories about couples in Italy. However, as good as he is, Malkovich can not save the most ridiculous of the four stories told here: a woman who joins him in a cafe at the edge of the water near a store she owns and explains how she killed her father nearby. Then they go home, make love and he goes away. It seems that Antonioni has lost the subtlety that prevailed in previous films (like The Passenger) in the face of sex and replaced it with a blatant nudity. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the script is, the film presents two things that make it observable: sweets for the eyes and ears. The actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and the cinematography is wonderful - the scenes in the old Italian cities contrast with a little in a large building overlooking a city (which reminds La Notte). <br /> <br /> Sweet in the ear However, that's what makes the film worth watching. U2 and Brian Eno collaborated on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence", two elements that create the perfect mood in the film. The songs are available on "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1."
