Some people think it was a rather bad TV series, with some tacky effects. (Whereas the film was filmed between 1977 and 1979), but look at these years and think: "We did not have a computer at the time". So, if you think about it, it's a pretty good TV show. <br /> <br /> I always thought that the bad audiences had killed the series, but no. the network did. they canceled their theme "The Network of Superheroes" and dropped an ephemeral series of Spider-Man. if it had lasted, it would probably have run well into the 80s, and if it had been really lucky (and I mean really lucky), in the early '90s. <br /> <br /> And no one wanted to choose this series up. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the old (or young) Jolly, Nicholas Hammond, of The Renowned Sound of Music, goes on TV screen as Peter Parker, the secret identity of the incredible spider-man. along the series, peter deals with a clone, a beautiful girl from a foreign country and a corrupt politician. <br /> <br /> while the series is out of date (since peter is already a graduate of college and that's when he gets bitten and Uncle Ben is already dead,) The public is treated for the action, the suspense and the attitude that the characters have towards Peter and his alter ego, Spider-Man. <br /> <br /> So it's also a little disappointing that Robert. F Simon does not look like JJJameson, it's not so disappointing that Betty's grant is not a grant from Betty, but an African-American girl (which reminds me of Halle Berry, one of the most hottest on the planet). we were not so bad. <br /> <br /> but given the time and scale of the drama they put into it, it suggests that the bad TV is today. anyway, it's fun, even for today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
