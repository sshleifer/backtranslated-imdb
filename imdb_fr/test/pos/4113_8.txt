Although songs and dance numbers, in general, are not as powerful as many would like, the script and the message of the film are still there and resonate above the simple music numbers of the 70's. <Br /> Keeping in mind that this movie was shot after the almost complete demise of the Hollywood Musical (with a few exceptions, rock musicals), the audience that went to see it did not like the fact that he was a brave attempt at something that had not been done to date. Viewers who see it today will tend to judge it in relation to today's movies and musicals and, perhaps, the huge tournaments of all-star musicals. But doing this to this film, or to others, is an injustice to the film itself. <br /> <br /> There are good musical moments in the film. The first is Bobby Van's. Mr. Van took his role as Harry Lovett right after the closing of a two-year-old series named Tony (best actor) of the Broadway cover, "No, no, Nanette." He is a man of long-time songs and dancers and, honestly, the only one of the cast to be really talented and experienced for musicals. He never misses a stage of his "Question Me An An Answer" and rightly ... he was totally at home as Harry. Olivia Hussey makes other nice numbers when she welcomes new visitors. Although the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows his powerful voice in the song "Family", as well as a well-made staging of the complete piece. <br /> <br /> Watch the film for what it is ... a fantasy about a place where one never gets old, hidden in the icy mountains and covered with snow from Tibet, found by a group of people without mistrust of modern times, enveloped in the conflicts of any modern culture. Take this and compare it to reality and you get a movie that does not reach its goal. But ... take this film for the message of love, peace, tranquility and brotherly love and you will get a warm and refreshing message and a positive message. <br /> <br /> For some, this film may seem corny. others, a welcome release from the frantic pace of reality. For the first, try not to judge and just appreciate the message. By the second, you have discovered the secret of Shangri-La!
