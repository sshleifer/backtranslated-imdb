I saw this movie for the first time at least thirty years ago and it remains one of my favorites! It's a classic: the intriguing plot, the great characters, the suspense and the shocking ending (all on the backdrop of the beautiful Monterey / Big Sur coast) never get old. Roy Thinnes describes Johnny Brant, a captivating character who becomes more and more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. The acting is big and credible; viewers are caught in the web that develops between the busy husband, the disenchanted wife and the seductive stranger (Thinnes as Brant). I've been looking for a copy to buy for years - I guess the TV movies are not showing on video, unfortunately. Excellent movie, see it if you can find it.
