Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny / Daffy Duck / Elmer Fudd in a war of words and ideas to decide if this is the season of rabbits or ducks. Love Bugs and Daffy stoke "the troubles of the pronoun" with Daffy, still a victim of Elmer's shotgun, whose beak is still dismembered. Then there is the disguise of the rabbit that always gives Elmer his love-struck style. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are still my favorites in the writer-director category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy drawings that have made me laugh since I was a kid. And at least two of them end with Daffy's exclamation to Bugs: "You're despicable!" I can not get better than this!
