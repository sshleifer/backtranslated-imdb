"The China Syndrome" by James Bridges is a first-rate thriller; a model for those who want to make a truly terrifying thriller but who do not know how to do it. <br /> <br /> Most thrillers end with a standard shoot-em-up and a chase that ends with the villain who gets what he / she deserves. But Bridges understands that such a standard finale is not the case in some scenarios. "China's Syndrome" is thrilling in an unexpected way. He has the type of ending that is so unexpected, yet so logical. <br /> <br /> The film features three current Oscar winners: Jack Lemmon (Best Actor 1973 for "Save the Tiger"), Jane Fonda (Best Actress in 1971 and 1978 for "Klute" and "Coming Home"). "respectively) and Michael Douglas (Best film in 1975 for the production of" Flight over a cuckoo's nest. "This is not your usual style, popular in the 70s. strong and strong that we forget who plays the roles and we believe that the characters are real people, which testifies to the collective abilities of the three actors.They can be stars, but they are actors. /> <br /> There is no music score in the movie, except for some background songs from jukeboxes or TV shows, there is nothing Bridges does not allow any style realization to go on screen.with a strong dramatic story like this, we do not need a score for us di This seems to me to be a predecessor of the 1997 Lars Von Trier Dogma 95 film series that focuses on characters and story rather than style. <br /> <br /> The story is about a nuclear power plant in Southern California. ** SPOILER ** An accident seems to have occurred and the film is essentially about Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas trying to reveal the truth. In a sense, it's not a spoiler, because the trailer, the TV spots, the video boxes and the critics give it all. But from this seemingly simple principle, a surprisingly complex moral piece springs up and the suspense comes from human nature and people's actions rather than from a villain who frames another guy (though it's an element of the movie). That's what makes the "China Syndrome" so good. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
