Well each scene so perfectly presented. Never before have I seen such a film that makes sense in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> Well, while watching this movie, I remembered seeing "Amilie". Amilie is also a similar genre of film, more fun and more fantastic. These films are both based on the same line of plot. But both are perfectly perfect in their own way and are able to create their own world. <br /> <br /> Red is able to provoke many thoughts among people about destiny and dejavu. And I'm still thinking about it <br /> <br /> The story is excellent and the end is a bit funny. I laughed at the end of the stage. Funny how these three movies Red White and Blue are connected. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a great work of art. A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
