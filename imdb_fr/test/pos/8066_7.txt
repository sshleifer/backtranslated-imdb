Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney - the daughter of a police officer who lives in the tough part of the city. She is a rough and tumbling young woman of undetermined age (between 12 and 16 years old) who likes to fall but has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> This is a very typical movie style for Mary Pickford. Like many of her films, she plays a girl - even though she was almost 40 when she shot LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And, like so many other stories, she was brave and courageous. As a result, I had a strong sense of déjà vu. Now, if you have not seen his other movies, that's not a problem. However, it essentially plays a character much like that of SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS - although these two other films are much better. Now, that does not mean it's a bad movie - just that it's certainly not one of his best films - mainly because of a rather "schmaltzy" story that is very heavy, but not particularly convincing. Watching entertaining but not essential, unless you're a big fan of silences.
