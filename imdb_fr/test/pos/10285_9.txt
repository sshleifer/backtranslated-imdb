In this romantic and tense tragi-comedy inspired by the characters, we discover the intimacy of the lives of four Parisian thirties. In the center is the representation of Max by Vinz Cassell. Romeo star-eyed, he falls madly in love with the beautiful unknown Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his best friend Lucien (Ecoffey, in a sober but effective performance), he wins his heart and they live happily ever after ... that is to say until Alice (the versatile Romane Bohringer), intriguing and obsessive becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three. <br /> <br /> The intricate plot is thickened by a curious chronological mix, and the film appears as a complex puzzle, the Paris candy as a postcard in the heart of everything. The use of color does not go unnoticed, especially in Lisa's spectacular apartment (which probably represents the title of the film), where the reds and yellows cause fires of passion and lust. <br /> <br /> The public can identify with Max: he really wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstances. In a memorable scene, our lovers to whom fate (torn by a "choreographed" misunderstanding) would barely miss the chance encounter that would surely bring them together. Independent of each other, they travel to the same destination: she in the subway, he in a taxi, almost head-to-head. Yet fate seems to have prevailed and the public is captivatingly teased. <br /> <br /> The performances of this film are really what sets The Apartment apart. I still do not understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. He has a presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's actual wife at the time of writing) has recently made her name in the English-language film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - she's divinely beautiful, but behind her is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in the classic style of the lead role, which many British and American actresses reject in favor of an approach too easy "subtle". <br /> <br /> Overall, watch this movie! I doubt that you are disappointed. It's captivating, satisfying, fun, sad, sumptuous and a lesson in artistic achievement.
