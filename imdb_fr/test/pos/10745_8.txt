The suites are a capricious lot, most of which are far from the stature of the original. Sometimes you find a suite considered better than the original. Some critics (such as John Charles) said the A2 project was better than the original. I do not agree at all with this film, but this film still deserves a follow-up and fits well into the production of the brilliant Hong Kong action cinema of the 1980s as well as the work of Jackie. I wonder how, with such an impressive release of great movies, that his latest films are not so good. He made only two films in the 1990s, but he has had a lot of weight in many films of which he is not officially the director. <br /> <br /> Earlier in 1987, Jackie had surgery on the brain following a disastrous fall in the shooting of God's armor. This encouraged him to work on his next film near his home. This did not encourage her to stop risking her life and stunt team for our amusement. This resulted in a resounding success at home that overshadowed the original box office result (HK $ 31 million, up from $ 19 million for the original amount). <br /> <br /> Jackie Chan is again an extraordinary policeman, Dragon Ma, and is ordered to work with Superintendent "Three Wan" Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors) who is the only Chinese police officer authorized to to have a gun but that would arrange arrests to be better seen and ignore the crimes of a triad lord named Tiger Au (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Dragon Lord). Apparently, Chun has too much power to be removed directly, but he is relieved from Sai Wan District (now he is "Two Wan"), which Dragon Ma supports. This inefficient and corrupt office will soon be revamped and there is a great scene where three officers, who do not know who they are dealing with, try to attack Ma to teach him to complain about the police. He soon has this form of district ship and Tiger Au supported. The combat choreography and the stunts with Tiger and his men are quite impressive. My favorite waterfall was a sudden drop of the second floor in a large vase and this vase did not seem to be soft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, two secondary intrigues unfold. There are pirates who survived after the first film and who seek revenge and food. Then there are revolutionaries including Maggie (Maggie Cheung, In The Mood For Love) and Rosamund Kwan (Raiders Casino) who are trying to raise funds for Dr. Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the Qing government, as well as agents from the government to find these rebels. Add a mix of corrupt police officers from Hong Kong and Colombia, as well as legitimate ones, and you'll get a stew that contains a little too many ingredients, but that seems to blend. It works well when there is a scene influenced by the Marx Brothers (the Marx Brothers have already made this type of scene a few times, with The Cocoanuts (1929) first) at Maggie where everyone is looking for someone in hiding. Several weeks have been devoted to this single scene and the efforts made bear witness to this. <br /> <br /> The film has several flaws. There is a certain didactic nature in the film that seems a bit out of place ?? In particular, a little speech towards the end that Jackie made about the mainland revolutionaries and the extremely easy conversion of the pirates who survived after the first film. The female characters are once again underused and underrated, especially Maggie Cheung. I am not as satisfied with the continuity of the plot as the first film. The individual scenes dominate my feelings for the film instead of thinking of this film as a coherent whole. However, I do not blame the film for not having Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao as the first (I heard that it was mainly because these two people were shooting Eastern Condors, but I wonder if Jackie could have waited a bit longer, while to encourage them to play in this movie, they would work together for the last time the following year in Dragons Forever), but we miss them. <br /> <br /> I thought it was nice and good. made a movie and is rightly considered one of the best comedy action movies of the 1980s. This movie is also pretty good in some unexpected places. The artistic direction is superb (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are exquisite, the cinematography is good and the film looks quite authentic. But stunts, comedy and action are what I remember for this movie. There is a chase between a handcuffed Dragon and Chun who is superb (part of the ax throwing scene would be used in Shanghai midday). The last twenty minutes are filled with impressive shots, falls, chillies like a club (Jackie writes in his autobiography about how he used real peppers in this scene, you can see him feeling a lot of pain at the end) and is a worthy conclusion of this film. The most famous waterfall in this sequence is his tribute to Buster Keaton by Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928), except that there is no hole and only a weak part where his head passes through . <br /> <br /> Jackie and / or Hong Kong action film should consider this as a necessity and possess. I certainly do.
