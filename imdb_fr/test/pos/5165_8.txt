I've already seen spin-offs of cartoons like The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes, and most of them are excellent. <br /> <br /> When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see how the Rugrats would look like their pre-teens / teens and that contained things that would usually happen during this period of life, like going to a concert, going to school and staying on the ground. <br /> <br /> The TV show is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes for each episode and Angelica does not get punished as much as in the original series of Rugrats. Tommy and Susie are punished in this series. <br /> <br /> I also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashbacks about the appearance of the Rugrats in the original series. In fact, they talk to adults about this show because they are 10 years older. <br /> <br /> The show is for a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like that.
