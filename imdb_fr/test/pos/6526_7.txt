A £ 3.50 DVD can be a bet and it's a movie that has paid off. <br /> <br /> A decent film of the Saturday Night type that entertains if you hide the obvious flaws of the scenario. The special effects are a bit rare with some rehearsals (and why does London always look like the 60's?) <br /> <br /> If she had Armageddon's budget, then I'm sure it would have worked better at the box office because the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Tycus is recorded in the story of movie B but if you see it for £ 3.50, it's worth buying it.
