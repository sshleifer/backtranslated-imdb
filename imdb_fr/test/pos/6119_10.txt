The film that gave us John Waters is one of the funniest movies of all time. Yes, it may be disgusting, but it's full of hysterical moments that no one has done since. The infamous dog scene must be one of the highlights of the cinema. This is not a film for those who are easily offended. It's one of those movies where you always see something new. Divine's performance is worth the reputation. Mink Stole is hysterical. This is the film responsible for the Farrely brothers and all the kind of comedy Gross-out. I know it sounds a bit extreme, but think about it. Previously, these comedies were very common and almost identical. After this movie, the comedies became weird and weird, but in a good way. I would give it 15 out of 10 if I could.
