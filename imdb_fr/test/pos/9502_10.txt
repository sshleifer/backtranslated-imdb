Cecil B. DeMille directed a series of comedy series in the late teens and early twenties. He found his perfect lady for these provocative works at Gloria Swanson. In Do not Change Your Husband, Swanson plays the role of a bored housewife, whose rich husband (Elliott Dexter) pays more attention to work than she does. She is pursued by a beautiful wheel (Lew Cody) until she gives in and divorces the boring husband of the new love. <br /> <br /> Things quickly become familiar and Swanson discovers that the new husband is as careless as the first. To make matters worse, she discovers that Cody has a woman by her side (Julia Faye). After several clashes and proper meetings, the problems are solved. <br /> <br /> It was a resounding success in 1919 that allowed Gloria Swanson to become a star. Although she was only 20 years old when she filmed this, she is very good as a maybe stupid woman. She looks great and wears beautiful dresses. <br /> <br /> There is a 100% memorable DeMille scene in which Cody seduces Swanson with promises of wealth, pleasure and love. As he rolls her, she imagines the scenes. Pleasure is a fantastic Swanson scene in a spider web hammock swinging over a pool while people dance. Wealth is a scene in which Swanson is portrayed as a Babylonian queen while the maids bring her a jeweled chest that she throws aside. Love is a scene in which she is a woodland nymph making love in a forest clearing with a Pan type character (Ted Shawn). Pure hokum but very entertaining, and Swanson looks great. <br /> <br /> Dexter is very good as a bland husband who shaves his mustache and begins to train to win back his wife. Cody is also good as a fake charmer who is a liar and cheat. Faye is funny like the other bitch - named Toodles no less - who takes hers. Sylvia Ashton plays Ms. Huckney. Ted Shawn was married to Ruth St. Denis. Together, they were modern and influential dancers (from Denishawn School). <br /> <br /> Swanson impresses me more every time I see her. She seems to have been such a natural actress and yet there is a way for the camera to capture her expressive, hypnotic face. She is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining movie with lots of color tones in different scenes to keep things alive. And much of the furniture is back in style 86 years later.
