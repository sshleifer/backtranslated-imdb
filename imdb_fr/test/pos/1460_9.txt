There are only a few films that can be called "to see" and SHEPHERED is one of those films. In many ways, it was ahead of its time (and you can say it was a source of inspiration for several more well-known movies) copied by many, matched by none, it's really a great movie. <br /> <br /> The story is complex but unfolds like a thriller tense but often fun and a very inspiring exploration of the nature of humanity. The story unfolds in a post-apocalyptic world where people have to live in hiding and where chaos reigns. C. Thomas Howell is a "shepherd" who protects the people of various religious leaders by eliminating any unfit members of society. The whole idea made me think of our society. It's really a brilliant social comment, which is more than I can say for some recent science fiction / action blockbuster movies. MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS did not give the impression that true innovation was happening, but only boring video game effects. But SHEPHERD also scores on the scale of the actions ... <br /> <br /> This film did not let the spectator catch his breath. Peter Hayman turns out to be one of the few great action directors. We are talking 100%, high level, kung fu fighting at home It was excellent. Really good special effects, shootings, black and futuristic black cyber-punk style ?? the movie really has its own elements. <br /> <br /> When talking about SHEPHERD, it's impossible not to say how stylish it is. The vision of this city is really beautiful. It recalls images of Gotham's very memorable vision in BATMAN by Tim Burton. And these views are photographed by Graeme Mears with a degree of skill that shames Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall. Even the special effects have been amazing. Without a doubt, fighting scenes are landmarks throughout the cinema. This film is a ballet of excellent visual. <br /> <br /> Yet, at the base of all this, there is an interesting story, driven by a strong distribution. The acting game (especially Rowdy Piper) and the plot are excellent and perfectly directed. Unlike tons of futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor, the characters are believable and the dialogue natural and witty. I'm always proud to see a great movie like SHEPHERD. It's a shame that she was not well distributed and did nothing at the box office. It is a rarity to look for. This movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler to have seen it!
