The only thing I can not really forget about this film is its beginning: the classic comedy, brilliantly conceived. I like that. See for yourself (no spoilers here !:-). The fighting between DeVito and Crystal also shines in this film, DeVito being the perfect oppressed son. One of my favorites. Highly recommended for Crystal fans.
