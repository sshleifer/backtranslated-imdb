As a fan of Old Warner Brothers' gangster movies, I had to check this out: it's the second best DVD movie of adventure classics that also contains one of my favorite movies: Scott of the Antarctic . This film was made in 1939, a good year for many Warner Brothers movies, it has an excellent cast: John Garfield, Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan and Deadlocks, who will later be known as Bowery's boys on the pictures of monograms. Well, a boxer (Garfield) is accused of a murder he did not commit, he is on the run and followed by a tough New York detective (Claude Rains). He then finds himself in a fruit picking center run by a pretty woman (Gloria Dickson) and the dead kids (Huntz Hall, Leo Gorcey, Benard Punsley, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Gabreil Dell), he later returns to boxing but tries to keep a low profile. This was done by famous director Busby Berkley who made timeless classics such as 42nd Street, the 1933 and 35 year old gold diggers, the footlight parade and many more. I would like to make a cry to DVD / video platinum for having released many cheap DVDs, like adventure classics (see my Scott of Antarctica review) I give they made me a criminal 10 out of 10, excellent movie. I must say that I only saw 2 movies of John Garfield, this one and the body and soul. I thought he was a very good actor.
