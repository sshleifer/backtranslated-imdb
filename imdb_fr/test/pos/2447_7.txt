This film was well done. He discusses the difficulties that a Vietnamese veteran on his return experiences facing the horrors of war. Unfortunately, writers have chosen to focus on a veterinarian involved in an act of atrocity. I was in Vietnam and only one person witnessed it. The offender was prosecuted and sentenced in Leavenworth for many years. <br /> <br /> The idea that only veterans involved in atrocities have emotional problems is a bad service to all those who served. All the soldiers I knew personally or whom I knew by name were honorable soldiers who even respected the enemy and believed that they were there to stop the spread of communism. The biggest problem was going home to learn that many Americans were opposed to the war. This has led many veterans to feel that they have been involved in something less than honorable. Not the way they served. <br /> <br /> The end describes the father behaving more like a belligerent tyrant than a loving and caring father. For that, I gave it a 7 out of 10. If the end had allowed a degree of acceptance, I could have evaluated it as a 9. <br /> <br /> Most honest men will come back from the war with guilt and emotional scars. They need acceptance and understanding to overcome that. I pray that the public will better understand our veterans today than it was at the time of Vietnam.
