Nicely filmed, a little uneven, "Nobody" is a good evening. The plot is quite simple: three yuppies are in a bar with a group of foreigners and it is much more than they had planned. The acting is decent, and there are some unexpected twists. Watch for the incredible (like the 10-shot revolver and the 25-shot semi-automatic handgun).
