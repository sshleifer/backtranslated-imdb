It's one of those movies that critics really missed. This film is practically McHale's navy for the 90s or the police academy at sea. Grammer proves that he can play another role than Frasier by foiling and crushing the navy to get his own submarine. Rob Schneider is as voracious as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot, even though he has a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as ever, with almost every line being a slogan. The film has a wonderful intelligent plot and an unpredictable scenario that always surprises me every time I look at it. Many of the Marine's phrases and terms go through my head, but it's a small obstacle to the accuracy and realism of the film and its characters.
