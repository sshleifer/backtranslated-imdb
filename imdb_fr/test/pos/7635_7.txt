OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED or THE SEXORCIST, or the ridiculous THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCISTE scam that contains one of the best horror moments I've ever seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes to life. This spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective (good exchange effects). It's a shame that the rest of the movie does not maintain the level of goosebumps shown in this scene. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most frustrating movies of all time. Imagine that the producers decide to make an EXORCIST copy but that they manage to create something really original (a sculpture possessed of crucified man, who shocks when you think about it), but completely forgets their original idea to make a scam EXORCIST boring and uninspired. If the film had continued with the concept of possessed sculpture (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc.), this movie would have rocked. But once the girl is possessed by the spirit of sculpture, she never tells anyone where the demon came from. She and the scenario completely forget the haunted crucifix, which is STUPID !!! <br /> <br /> If you like so-called "euro-cult" films, the first 45 minutes give incomparable results. movies. But after the scene when the girl has the vision to be crucified and stigmatized, the remaining 45 minutes SUCK. Boring. He is not going anywhere fast as he tries to mimic THE EXORCIST. So, look at the first 45 minutes of L'OSSESSA and admire the fashion of the 1970s, the film and the incredible scene of the statue becomes reality, but after the first 45 minutes, press the Stop, Eject and so cut buttons your nails.
