Minnie and Moskowitz are the most pathetic and ungrateful love story I have ever seen. Between Minnie, a disillusioned museum curator, whose married boyfriend abandons her and leaves her even more stuck and confused than she already was, and Seymour Moskowitz, a parking attendant so desperate that he spends his nights in bars and restaurants to annoy people, there is a chaotic and disenchanted match from the beginning. As in so many matches that we see every day. <br /> <br /> In almost all love stories, there is a man and a woman, this man is confident, funny, either classic, or seductive in his own way, whose flaws are charming, and the woman a wounded soul who could have any man of her choice who chooses this guy because he just has something to say about him. These films make everyone feel so good because the characters embody what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. Minnie and Moskowitz, instead of indulging in a hint of fantasy in the field of romance, describe people who are perhaps more common than the attractive and confident people who have so much experience playing in the field. What is the story behind the love stories of the ugly alarming, clumsy, lifeless, or working man we all meet, or the woman so paralyzed by insecurity that it's hard to talk to her? <br /> <br /> The film is not as fascinating as Cassavetes' Faces or Opening Night, but it has this captivating quality that Cassavetes has always fought to render, which is a frantic representation of people under the me who is behind almost all the other films. Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, who deliver surprisingly pitiful people, have little sympathy. Moskowitz makes us almost mad, let alone Minnie. He imposes himself with so much strength in his life. The dates are an explosion of our inner voices that respond to the crying and inept discomfort of the dates to which we are all accustomed, the rejections we all swallowed and the arguments we all had. that we know were our own faults. I admire a film like Minnie and Moskowitz because, as the trademark is with the films that Cassavetes blocked, he identifies with us in all honesty. Our ego plays no role in the company of its characters, which is a formidable feat by actor.
