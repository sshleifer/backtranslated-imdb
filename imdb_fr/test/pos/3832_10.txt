This is one of the best episodes of the first episodes of "Star Trek". Kirk and his team ventured into the unknown to confront an enemy whose name is known. Imagine their surprise when they discover that the dreaded Romulans are racial offspring of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unique characters in the Star Trek universe. His barely disguised hate against Mr. Spock is strangely similar to the hate after 9/11 and the suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern descent. The atmosphere of paranoia in wartime is all too real. Then there are the Romulans: they are the ultimate enemy of the Federation. The Klingons are mean but basically harmless; more a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, are serious: it is the ancient Romans who are reborn in the space age; despite their vulcanooid features, they are clearly intended to remind us of imperial Rome, with names such as Decius and titles such as "centurion" and "praetor". Chain mail armor is really cool. Famous guest star Mark Lenard, who then played Spock's father, Sorek, as well as the Klingon commander in "Star Trek: The Movie" is a tired, war-weary commander, a character who looks suspiciously like Crassus by Laurence Olivier. in "Spartacus". In addition, his questioning of the unquenchable thirst for conquest of the Empire reminds me of the similar concerns voiced by Marc Aurelius (Richard Harris) at the beginning of "Gladiator". A must for Trekkies and epic fans of the sword and sandal.
