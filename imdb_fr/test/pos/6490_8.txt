I'm a big fan of the $ 5.50 DVD trash at my local WalMart. I hope you have one in your local agency. You can find a bunch of campy movies, a pile of garbage, and occasional surprise. This film is one of the surprises. My friend recently bought this one, and thinking it would be another riot of cheese kung fu, I was really surprised at the quality of his work. I watch a lot of movies and, therefore, I can almost always tell how a movie will run. and if there is a twist of conspiracy, it will be. Not this movie! The staging is brilliant, the plot is great and the fights are incredibly inventive. If you see this one sitting somewhere at a very low price, buy it! If you see it at a high price, I would recommend it anyway.
