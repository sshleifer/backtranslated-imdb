It's really a classic Australian cult. If you are one of the lucky ones to have seen it, then you are very lucky. It has been published in most countries, but not in Australia for any reason. I have a DVD copy of the UK. Not a good transfer, but I bought it, I had already seen it at a film festival. The staging is perfect and the performances are rock! It's a scary movie dark film, but often, very funny in some parts. I urge you to see this film, there is a freshness about it that you do not see in 99% of typical Australian dishes. The scenario is very well designed and sends you on a journey where you know it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes you can not really know how much. Excellent work from the four leaders, especially Lachy Hulme. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done: great job!
