While "The Jackal" [remake of the excellent "Day of the Jackal"] has a better aesthetic [and a boat loading budget], this movie describes the character of "Carlos" ... <br /> < Quinn excels when the naval officer is committed to imitating Wiley Jackal from his hiding place and, facing the hands of Kingsley and Sutherland, turns to do so. At the risk of his family, his career and all that he believes in, he carries out his task, even reluctantly. <br /> <br /> Say more would spoil it ... it's an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ Stars [on 4]
