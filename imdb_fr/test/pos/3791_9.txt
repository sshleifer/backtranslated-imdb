The character of Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp or Little Man won the First World War, then called the Great War, all by himself, even capturing the Kaiser, something that all Allied forces were unable to do. Too bad, it turns out to be a dream, which is a bit of a cop and the weakest part of this hypnotizing short film (almost a feature film in 46 minutes). <br /> <br /> Inventive gags in abundance Charlie must wear a gas mask to eat Limburger cheese sent from his home, then use it as a weapon against the Germans; Charlie sleeps underwater in a flooded trench beside a soldier he continues to annoy; Charlie disguising himself as a tree - one of his best sketches of all time - and pretending to hit his friend turned prisoner of war, then hugging him when the enemy is invisible. <br /> <br /> One What is amazing is how Charlie, when he is behind enemy lines dressed in German, looks like Hitler more than ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs dominate the German policy. Obviously, Hitler modeled his appearance on Charlie's one of this movie.
