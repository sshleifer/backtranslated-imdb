I enjoy myself as much to read the comments of the users as to watch the film! It seems to be the classic movie "Love it" or "Hate it". And I must say that I am not only on the side "Love it", I go on a member to say it to my film FAVORI, EVER! Thank God I found it in the first place. Almost impossible to find, I was lucky about ten years ago to record it on a UHF channel at the end of the evening. Of course, my taste for Sellers can make me a bit biased, but I do not see how someone with a cornball, an arid sense of humor (like me), can not like this movie. The plot is great (but maybe, as a previous poster said, maybe the reason it's not a widely known movie ... upset the medical world?) It's great (I can see why some will say that it is horrible to play). But that's what makes this movie so great ... it's total insensitivity) and the humor is flat. I'm proud to say that I watched this movie no less than 20 times and that I memorized each line. This movie is great !!
