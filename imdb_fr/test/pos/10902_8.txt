After reading the comment about this movie and watching it, I can understand what the person thought about it. Decisions were made after listening to common sense. When the movie came out, I heard how it had happened. The scenario was created from a real event. During an award ceremony, an actor, thanking people of his age, awarded the prize to a former school teacher and surprised him. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people come out of the closet most of the time. everyday. Each exit is different for each person. In real life, the result of each individual will also be different. And the willingness to accept who they are is the most important thing in life to achieve personal happiness. For those around them, joy and honest acceptance can make life a lot more complete. For the film, the purpose of Howard is much more comical than real life. And the acceptance of the community showed others that Howard was himself and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances were crazy. Memorable quotes and the use of music add to the stereoscopic types of the world, but taken with humor. It's a film. Sit down, look with an open mind and burst out laughing.
