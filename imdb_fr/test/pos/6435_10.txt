OKAY. Whoever has ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all cut their throats. This "film" was an absolute and absolute dirt. What was going on with the old strange bags? Seriously, was she taking some kind of horrible drug and then she thought she could control people? She ran with her evil eye and it was like what? Do I have a booger on my nose? What are you looking at? Are you like the sea witch or something? Still, I thought the graphics were top notch. For that only, I would give him a ten. But cover your ears when you look at it. The pure and complete evil that comes from this film will bleed your ears and your eyelids down. Who knows? You could even have a knot in your small intestine. You better look at fools.
