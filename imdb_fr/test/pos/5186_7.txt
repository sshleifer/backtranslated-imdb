It's a disaster movie taking place in London. From several hurricanes, superstorm and tornadoes on Scotland are moved east, down the coast of England and later to the south. After several hours of heavy rain, the London barrier over Thames is no longer in a state of collapse and opens the way for disaster. Then, a colossal tidal wave reclines incessantly in the east, causing the devastation and lives of millions of Londoners in danger. At the center of the story is a climatologist (Tom Courtenay), a climatologist who tries to save London from the effects of the giant wave, trying to convince the authorities that the city's dyke was dangerous, as well as an engineer from the city. Navy (Robert Carlyle) and his ex-wife Samantha (Jessalyn Gilsig). They are trapped in the barrier and thrown into the sea. In the meantime, the headquarters of the secret government agency led by Nash (Joanne Whalley) under the direct orders of the Deputy Minister (David Suchet) tries to control many displaced and avoid more deaths, about 200,000 dead. They have a little time to save London from a total disaster. <br /> <br /> A perfectly acceptable drama-disaster with a correct acting game. The magnificent Tom Courtenay as a climatologist who predicts the disaster and the excellent Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gilsig as the ex-marriage reviving their love. The film features impressive flood scenes animated by stunning special effects, generated by computer generators, better than the classics of the 70s, such as "Earthquake, Inferno Towering" and in the same way as "Armageddon and on the next day". Although the denunciation is unclear, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming, causing the hole in the ozone layer. The film is well directed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this film to people who like disaster movies. Here is another flood adaptation: "Flood (1976)", directed by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; Hard rain (1998) by Mikael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; "Flood: the ravage of a river (1979)" directed by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
