Crackerjack is another classic Australian film. Like so many Australian films like The Castle, The Dish and Sunday Too Far, it's going somewhere that has not been explored in the movie before, this time it's the game of the Lawn Bowls and bowling clubs. Crackerjack is a much slower sports film than many others, like Remember the Titans or Million Dollar Baby, but the characters involved are full-fledged athletes. This film is a showcase for much of Australia's culture and features a popular and growing sport in Australia. Mick Molloy presents a classic and unforgettable character. It's really worth seeing.
