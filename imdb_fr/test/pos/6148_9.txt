An example of a genius film. The epic story of three major stages of a young boy's life told with eloquence and raw intrepidity. It's rare that a movie happens that makes me say aloud during most of the viewing: "It's a very good movie ...." again and again. That's exactly what happened when I watched this movie. I really do not understand how someone could not like it. I found myself crying at times and laughing at the same time, unable to control how I felt for the scene. The acting is exceptional. Eric Mabius, why is he not everywhere on the cinema screens? He was really amazing. His seemingly effortless attempt on the screen struck me deeply viscerally. I thank him. Eric Schaeffer is, in my opinion, one of the best filmmakers of the moment and I hope he will continue to meet the challenges he faces in trying to give us the art in the face of fierce commercial shoots. <br /> <br />
