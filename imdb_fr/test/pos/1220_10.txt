Cute Movie, good movie, I had never heard of this movie, but I found it looking for a place to rent. I had high hopes for this film based solely on the presence of Flex in this film. I have never seen it in anything that is not worth it. Faithful to train this film delivered for me. I enjoyed the story. The film is full of great actors and actresses. The hilarious Tasha Smith, Atkins Essence and of course Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie. I did not give it five stars because it did not deal with certain issues that the film should have detailed. The question was apparently resolved but I would have appreciated a discussion to solve it. I liked the film so much that I buy it now after renting it and watching it.
