"Robin Hood: Men in Tights" received no respect of any kind. It was hilarious! Cary Elwes was excellent as a "Prince of Thieves", and David Chappelle, Amy Yasbeck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield as Blinkin all did a great job. I will never understand the hostility to "Robin Hood: men in tights", but I know an excellent comedy when I see one. <br /> <br /> "Robin Hood: men in pantyhose" *** receives from *** ****
