There was something in the three original films that made them so special and so delicious - probably their length. Unfortunately, it lacks charm, but it always ends up being a fun movie. <br /> <br /> The shiny and shimmering aspect is that our favorite plasticene figurines continue to do a fantastic job, there is a good animation in plasticene used, a silly plot, but well structured and entertaining, A fun adventure , a good idea of ​​the plot (a bunny rabbit and a giant celebrity contest) and good new characters! <br /> <br /> In addition to the original charm, the only other slightly dark side of the film is that the humor, though good, is slightly exaggerated, especially compared to the original movies. <br /> <br /> The popular Giant Vedgetable Competition is approaching and Wallace and Gromit are helping witnesses to keep rabbits from eating all Pesto. They do a good job, but soon there is a danger. A werewolf is nearby ... <br /> <br /> Recommended to all fans of Wallace and Gromit and lovers of plastic films, enjoy "Wallace and Gromit: The curse of the Wererabbit"! :-)
