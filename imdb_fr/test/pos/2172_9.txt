It is a classic unfortunately unknown. <br /> <br /> The look is superb, the design, the costumes, etc. are flawless, post-battle scenes and cavalry charge are both frightening and exciting. <br /> <br /> The characters are alive and really human. Ardent is right and the lawyer Derville, Fabrice Luchini, steals the film with his clever performance resembling a pedantic rodent, rejoicing in the ups and downs of the misfortunes of others. Depardieu is good, but his presence may be too important for this role. <br /> <br /> The film really excels, it's the story and its changes to the news of Balzac. These changes are editorial in that Balzac has a lot of discussions about society and this film breathes with the characters. Nevertheless, Yves Angelo has kept the essential ingredient, not only the disappeared who seeks to find his place in society, but each character must find his place in society: Count Ferraud tries to buy a peerage, his wife (Ardent ) when she was married to Colonel Chabert, they reached their position in the turbulence of post-revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status and that makes a good drama because their goals are in conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> He also feels very modern: money is essential to buy a status in order to reach power, but someone can go down as fast as he goes up. Derville loves strategy, he has seen the worst of people he tells Chabert when he takes the case. The place of origin of this speech is at the end of the story. Balzac sums up the human comedy with enormous irony.
