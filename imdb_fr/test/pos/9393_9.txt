A demon, from a tree, retires in the form of a man to make love to a blonde girl just for her to die. The demon's eyes froze, two drops of blood fell on a bed he had specially created for his object of desire. The bed consumes blood and hunger persists .. everything that comes in contact with the bed is consumed! This is explained by one of the victims of the bed, a painter whose soul is imprisoned "in" one of his last works, the artistic rendering of his last resting place (.. he died of consumption, spitting blood, deciding to die on the bed of death). You see the painter, whom we can see as if he were trapped in a small room looking through his painting, unfortunately a spectator at the bedtime meal. The bed has a sense of black humor and we see it well by allowing the painter to live, even giving him jewels and other property formerly belonging to devoured victims. The skull of a victim produces bright red flowers not far from the basement sheltering the bed. The film features three young women crossing the mansion that contains the basement containing the death bed. The painter (Dave Marsh) might have a method to destroy the death bed, but it would involve a human sacrifice to resurrect the body of the one whose death had caused hunger. Patrick Spence-Thomas provides the soft and depressing voice of the trapped painter, telling the film, lamenting his current situation, evoking past victims and often blaming the bottom of his predatory nature. <br /> <br /> A definitive and authentic cult film..I expect his status to grow now that DEATH BED: THE BED THAT EAT has found the way to an audience (like me) who appreciates the strange and the grotesque. The bed itself contains a type of liquid acid with a hint of apple cider where we see objects and humans (who struggle for nothing) are consumed. Many could recognize a young William Russ looping, looking for his runaway sister, finding her in the basement, looking like a zombie and traumatized (of course, Julie Ritter was pretty much like that. trance, scarcely speaking a word) with the two trapped. In one of the most insane scenes in the film, Russ tries to stab the bed only to keep his hands stuck in his hands, the acidified flesh leaving only skeletal bones, the cartilage deteriorating. There is a long escape attempt by a victim whose legs were stuck in the bed, almost out of the basement when her sheets brought her back to her belly where she belonged. The film is almost completely surrealistic, as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold. Director George Barry often portrays gags about the victims who are in the most unfortunate situation by choosing the death bed as a place of refuge. The painter reminds us of the different people who have been eaten. There is really nothing like this movie anywhere, it's really unique.
