Little Dieter Needs to Fly was my first film at the 1999 GÃ¶teborg Film Festival. As I was extremely tired that night, I was hesitant to see him, but the overall disappointing score of 9 here at IMDB forced me to go. <br /> <br /> It was 80 minutes of life force! Discovering Dieter Denglers' life through his own stories was enchanting. <br /> <br /> TO SEE! And if possible ... see it in the cinema!
