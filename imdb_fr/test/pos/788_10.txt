It's a wonderful comic short film - one of Keaton's best absolutes. Through a long series of stupid mistakes, Buster is confused with a wanted killer. And, as a result, most of the film consists of him fleeing the cops and a particular detective. Although I'm usually NOT a fan of movies with a lot of pursuit scenes, this one is the absolute best when it comes to pure athletic and acrobatic abilities. I saw some who had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so flexible and able to move with incredible grace. In particular, there is a scene where he runs on a table, jumps on the shoulders of a man and plunges across the board, as quickly as possible. In addition, many gags are fun and perfectly synchronized, like how he comes to believe that he killed someone. By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also from Keaton, but sufficiently original and energetic enough to make them worthy of interest. <br /> <br /> This film is brilliant and Keaton's only short film I can think of THE PLAYHOUSE, where Buster plays all the roles in the theater, I liked even more.
