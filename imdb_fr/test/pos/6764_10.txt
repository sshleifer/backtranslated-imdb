This is without a doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. I really enjoyed the characters in the movie. They are all wonderful weird in themselves. It's something I've never seen before in any movie. <br /> <br /> The story is almost continuous from beginning to end. There are no boring moments. I was totally captured by the movie. And I thought the acting was awesome. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to see a funny movie. You should look for green butchers. A good film. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10
