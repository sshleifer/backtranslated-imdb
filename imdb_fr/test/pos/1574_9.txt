Until I did a research on "What Alice Found", I did not realize that the name of the film was incorporated into the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The full title of the book is "Through the mirror (and what Alice found there)". <br /> <br /> The Alice of the film comes from a context quite different from that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Its fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The film Alice begins as a young New Hampshire woman who steals money from her boss and flies to Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She meets a middle-aged couple in a motorhome (the husband retired from the army) who saves her from a strange man at a road stop and the breakdown of his car (perhaps caused by their mechanization ). <br /> <br /> It turns out that the couple is heavily involved in stopping prostitution by trucks and considers the sweet and young Alice as a promising rookie. The woman (interpreted by Judith Ivey in a performance worthy of a great price) buys Alice's sexy clothes and shows her how to make up hot. At first, Alice passively accepts her tasks and, with the couple's instructions, makes several tips. The encounter presented in more detail is quite different from most cinematic sex, but may be typical of what happens most often in real life. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for his "finish" too fast. <br /> <br /> What's wonderful about Alice (and different from her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. Here's how things really happen. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither good nor bad. Alice leaves the camper with her well-earned money and a feeling of mutual respect.
