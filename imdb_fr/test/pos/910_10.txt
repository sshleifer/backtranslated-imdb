What some Hollywood movies are trying to do and almost never succeed, creating metaphysical links between people (without becoming unrealistic), perfectly manages this beautiful film (resembling the wonderful "The Double Life of Veronique" of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). It's a real film, which changes the perspective of life a bit - a smart and beautiful story, a masterful direction, excellent leading actors, a masterful cinematography. I just saw the movie for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if you are unhappy with the end of "White" - "Red" puts a happy ending to all the trilogy.
