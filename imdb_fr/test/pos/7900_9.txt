Vanaja is a film of superlatives. Mamatha is his jewel, a superb production and perhaps a pre-production with Rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic journey through rural South India through the eyes of a 15-year-old man, a mix remarkable singing and dancing, traditional and modern, marry to perfection and form a magnificent background of lush colors for the flora and fauna that make up this magnificent experience. What a feat for a first director !! The casting was absolutely without a future. I wish that India will come out with more of these films. This film will remain one of my favorites throughout my life. 9/10.
