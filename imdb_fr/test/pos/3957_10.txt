"Blind Spot" one of my favorites of the festival. I was totally intrigued by the idea of ​​three strangers looking for a mysterious man who loved them and betrayed them in different ways. The casting is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as a heartbroken boy from Los Angeles. His diary entries, which we hear in a voice-over narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. He pushes things like the road movie and the revenge drama in new directions. He also plays with time and perspective in a way that captures the scary atmosphere of lost love. There is a dream quality in several sequences and the images are saturated by a strange feeling of tension. Strange. Suspenseful. Nice to watch. Well worth a visit. I would really like to see him again. I periodically check if Blind Spot has been distributed. I can not wait to see the movie in the cinema or on DVD. <br /> <br /> Davide Pepe 13/08/2005 Bologna - Italy
