In a word ... magic. And so incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so vulnerable that you just want his characters to succeed no matter what he does. And he plays Hari Om irreproachably, from his "Bollywood e-shtyle" absolutely perfect in his clumsy and timid way with a first kiss. He is a really talented actor and I would not hesitate to see him in anything, because he gives life to everything and gives him a soul. Camille Natta is absolutely beautiful. It took me a while to get warm - perhaps because she plays so well the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist. Her transition really became her and she integrated her role very well. Even the man you love to hate, his boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, even though you never really like him for the scum he plays, Jean-Marie Lamour makes a perfect CAD. The script is so real. I often looked to my friend all the way through the movie and said, "That's exactly what is happening in India! Very real, very raw. VERY bittersweet but you are definitely leaving the theater with a sense of fulfillment. Nitin Sawhney's music is wonderful and goes perfectly with changing moods. But Vijay Raaz ... I find myself constantly with him, because it is he who makes this film. He's the hero, the most charming and disarming rickshaw driver you can ever meet - he's magical. A charming, real, lovable and incredibly talented actor that I'm looking forward to seeing shine and succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or elsewhere!
