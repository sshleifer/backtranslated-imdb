To defend this film, I must repeat what I already said. The film is called Arachina, it does not have a name casting and I do not mean any name, as in the actors who play in unpublished films of art house. I mean no name because in your local high school decided to make an unnamed film and it could have a budget of 2 dollars. So what are we waiting for? Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie never took itself seriously, which automatically removed it from the worst movie list. This list only concerns the movies of all stars, big budget, which takes itself too seriously. We think of The Oscar, most of Sylvester Stallone's films. The two main roles were not Hepburn and Tracy but they did their job well enough for this film. The woman kicked her legs and the guy was not a scathing idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man who played the position of retained professor was not Clifton Webb but he did a divine job. And the Bimbo, for lack of a better one, were played by two competent actors. I laughed special effects of 50 cents. But that was part of the charm of the film. He played as a hybrid Tremors meets Night of the Living Dead. The principle of the film is like all Giant Bug films of the 1950s. A meteor or radiation moves the ecosystem and, before you know it, giant ants, lobsters, rocks or lizards terrorize the locals. A meteor was the cause of the problems this time. I was very entertained. I did not expect much and I go much more than I expected.
