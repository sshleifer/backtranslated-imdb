Although this film has wiped out the career of director and screenwriter Michael Cimino and bankrupted United Artists, it remains one of the best movies of all time. There are many reasons to give up this film prematurely. Among them: its length, its technical problems, its enormous maltreatment of animals on the set - the list goes on and on. And yet, despite everything, there remains a film that captures something. This is a classic example of naturalistic storytelling just like Strindberg's - his moments last as long as they could in reality, having not been silenced for good cinematic timing. He feels real in his moments of anger, love and war (and despair). This film should be seen by anyone who appreciates film and narration.
