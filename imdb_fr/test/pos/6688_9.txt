I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, so I burned it on DVD without seeing it before. I also instantly became a fan of Kevin Spacey. <br /> <br /> The general plot "of extraterrestrials in the human body" was made to death, but I liked the approach taken in K-PAX, which I thought was very different and much more sensitive than most. Bridges is an excellent doctor (you * want to * tell him what you think) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in this role. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Prot and the all-human characters of the clinic is delicious, especially the subtle manipulation of their behavior. <br /> <br /> The end is bittersweet - I like the choice of Prot, but the final scenes (with Bridges) made me cry.
