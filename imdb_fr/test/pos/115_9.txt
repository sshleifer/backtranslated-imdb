It is a very sensitive portrait of life with unfulfilled or limited desires. What is one doing in a culture and society with rigid norms? A husband finds an outlet with the immigrant - as immigrants do not belong or are not accepted, they do not need to comply and block their desires. The other husband seeks comfort in spirituality and tries to make his desire disappear into nothingness. This fails - of course - and it breaks down in the last scene for several reasons. Sita was still keen enough that he found this moment to let him know that he was not responsible for his outlet deviating to his stranded desires. The mother in her still could not find the strength to destroy her myth. She sees him as a child who glorifies himself in his desire to control lust, but should she give him the opportunity to grow up at last? The two wives find courage and solidarity thanks to their rejection shared by their husband. <br /> <br /> But the last act of rejection was imposed by the grandmother: she could not free herself from her rusty state of mind to accept Sita's desire. A decade or more of care has not been enough to break the chains of its culture. <br /> <br /> It seems that it was easier for the housekeeper to let his desires express himself - for he is in any case doomed by his culture - to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is no respect and expectation anyway, so much to taste sin.
