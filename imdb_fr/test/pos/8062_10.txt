As good as Schindler's list was, I found this film much more powerful because it is a documentary based on real life. It details the story of the Frank family and Anne in particular. Although it's a bit slow at first (detailing their family life before the war); it becomes very powerful. <br /> <br /> Because of some images and photos of the camps, I would not recommend it to children but to adults, it illustrates the horror of the Holocaust through a girl. Highly recommended.
