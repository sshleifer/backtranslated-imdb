I finally managed to take a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent the day before New Yera watching an incredible drama unfold. It started with the marriage of Shyama (a Nandita Das) and Dhileepan in the Sri Lankan backwaters, then a war took over their history. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp while giving birth to a child. Several years later, we see Amudha, a cheerful and well-liked child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and classmates, in a very simple sequence. On her birthday, her parents, Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran), tell her that she is not their biological child, she was adopted. This inclines her loving and confident world and she constantly insists on why her birth mother left her. On several occasions, the adoptive parents took her to Sri Lanka to try to find her biological mother. The country is torn by a civil war and the trio is inevitably trapped. But it also brings them to meet the new Shyama - a man who is finally confronted with Amudha and asks her why she abandoned her daughter. <br /> <br /> The story of a child struggling with the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive desire to reconnect with her biological mother, her unconditional love for adoptive parents, demons that animate his biological mother, the normality of Chennai and the horrors of ravaged terrorism in Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam has made a masterful film of many ingredients in a moving saga. The music of AR Rahman perfectly completes the magical and poignant moments of the film. The film features excellent performances by Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolutely amazing role in the role of Amudha - the abandonment - directed by the child artist P. P. Keerthana. This performance earned him a national award. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a visual poetry - every image is beautifully designed and turned breathtaking. I am intrigued by the connection between Mani Ratnam and terrorism, love and obsessions. I think his exploration of these topics is absolutely remarkable. The character of Mahadevan was unique: his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, but rather the measure of his love for the little girl. His linings were hilarious. Simran's mother was also very multidimensional: she was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter, but also worried about her biological children. The shock, anxiety and obsession of the child Amudha were remarkably described by P. Keerthana. His big accusing eyes made most of the conversation. In fact, the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das and her husband. Maybe Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as not to give us a clear idea of ​​why they were as they were, the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he becomes. It also prevented him from making judgments - it was another conflict in which he did not take sides, but pointed out while showing the human tragedy. <br /> <br /> Kannathil Muthamittal is a visual poem and moving drama - I rarely cry movies, but this one left me with wet eyes and a bit of a broken heart. It's a beautiful movie - a treasure and a guardian if you can find a copy; beg to borrow or steal one today and watch the movie!
