The jacket of the DVD in which this film came describes it as "uplifting and humorous". These are not the words I would have chosen - not far away. I would choose a word as "dark", sometimes even "depressing". Which does not mean that it's a bad movie. It's actually a very good movie, with good performances from the main actors, with enough uncertainty about what will happen in the end that you keep watching. Uncertainty comes from the film's structure - it seems to revolve around Ellen's memories of her mother's slow death of cancer, as she is interviewed by the AD. So we know from the beginning that something suspicious happened in the end - the questions are "what?" and who? "<br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger was very good Ellen - the rancorous girl who has to give up her life and work in New York to go home taking care of her sick mother. the movie - more than any other character - as she learns to manage the strengths and weaknesses of her parents.His relationship with her father (William Hurt) is very interesting.Our initial impression was that they were close enough , but the warts in the relationship start to appear after a while.Hurt was effective as a detached husband - detached not indifferently, but in the sense that he was unable to cope with what was happening to his And finally, Meryl Streep as Kate with cancer was very convincing in the role, trying to live what was left of her life in the most rewarding way possible, then to rer anger she felt about her growing weakness. In a way, looking at a family business with this kind of crisis reminded me a little of the "ordinary people" character, although this movie was much less emotionally intense. So, not edifying and humorous (with all due respect to the one who wrote the synopsis on the DVD cover), but very good in its own way. 7/10
