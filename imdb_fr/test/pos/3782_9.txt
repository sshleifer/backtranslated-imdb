Fantastic film of Chaplin with many memorable moments while Charlie joins the army to fight in the First World War. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, he goes to training camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and to walk in line. It's a really fun scene because the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight! <br /> <br /> The next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes include Hungry Charlie, who eats cheese from a mousetrap, and reads a letter from the house over someone's shoulder. <br /> <br /> When Charlie falls asleep, his bunker is flooded and his roommate snores. It's such a fun part! I can not really describe it, just watch the movie. When Charlie wakes up, his legs are numb and he tries to "wake up". I felt numb as Charlie rubbed his roommate's foot! <br /> <br /> The film then turns a little sinister, while Charlie shoots several times. The Germans from his trench (albeit in a very funny way) and personifying him into a tree to get close to the enemy, saving one of his friends from a death squad. <br /> <br /> a French girl in trouble by hiding in her house. He must then save it and, in doing so, he also captures the German kaiser. To do this, he personifies a German kolonel or something. I love it when we ask Charlie something in German and he looks like nein nein nein. The soldier looks at him in a funny way so Charlie changes his mind: ja ja ja! The kaiser is captured and Charlie is the hero ... but then he wakes up again in the bootcamp, it was only a sweet dream! <br /> <br /> Charlie had already done one of these dream sequences (The Bank comes to my mind) but no matter, this movie was so funny that it made me laugh all the time. time. Chaplin also has something to say with this film (his latest work becoming more of a social comment than several mishaps in the world) and better explained in the last sentence of the film: "Peace on earth, goodwill to all humanity. '<br /> <br /> In short: Charlie's classic, very funny, timeless. 9/10.
