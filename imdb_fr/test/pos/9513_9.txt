As a show, it's hard to blame Nihon Chinbotsu. The Japanese have benefited from their intimate relationship with the sea, and the concept of the film implies that a world and a way of life at risk - thanks to its volcanic heritage. From the point of view of reality, it is rather ridiculous to have a drama in which all Japan disappears under the waves; why just Japan? <br /> <br /> Suppose, then, that we have the reality of the film, fueled by the show (and popcorn), and that some may find it very touching. Compared to adventures with Japanese radioactive monsters, it turns out to be more mature and better paced. The emotional element is minimized and it really works. (He loses a bit with the overflowing theme song.) <br /> <br /> Is Nihon chinbotsu credible? Probably not, but the thrilling eruptions and the laid-back pace make for a more enjoyable entertainment than a night.
