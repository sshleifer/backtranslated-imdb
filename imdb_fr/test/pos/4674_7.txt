I went to see this movie with a lady from my family, who does not like heist movies. But she appreciated. I missed pieces of the movie throughout the film. It's a story of Edward Norton and a group of golden thieves, and Norton has decided to want him for himself. So the people he betrayed want revenge on him. It's a well-edited, intelligent, funny and action-packed film that I need to see again ... all the way through. Seth Green is one of my best summer movies to date. <br /> <br /> Seth Green is a great help for entertainment. I do not know anyone who does not like Seth Green, and it adds to the flavor. He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roommate stole him. He is a computer genius who is a marvel to watch. <br /> <br /> It was said that Norton did not want to do this movie .. but if I was him, I would have liked to register. The only problem is that it is very predictable. All moviegoers should be able to say what happens before they arrive. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that Eddie Norton chose facial hair. The thick mustache, but thin, and a little pike on his chin ... he looks like a porn star of the 80s for the sake of gods.
