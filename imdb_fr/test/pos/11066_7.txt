"Saratoga Trunk" is a 1945 film starring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It is based on a 1941 book of the great Edna Ferber. Unconsciously, she may have felt herself carried away by the wind; parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. <br /> <br /> Clio Dulaine, born in the 1890s, is an illegitimate child returning from New Orleans with a mulatto servant (Flora Robson) and a dwarven servant, Cupid (Jerry Austin). She has given herself a title of countess and claims to be a widow. His mother accidentally killed her father and her family rejected her. Clio takes the old farm with the idea of ​​embarrassing his half-sister and his father's wife, which she does with great care. Her plan is to marry a very wealthy person who can give her the security and respectability she needs. Then she spots Clint Maroon (Cooper), a Texas player, and cracks for him. The two men have an unstable relationship - he has no money so she can not marry him - so he leaves for Saratoga Springs. Finally, the Dulaine family has had enough and his lawyer gives him $ 10,000 to get out of the city. She does. She travels to Saratoga Springs and sues the owner of the railway, Bart von Steed. But Clint is still here. <br /> <br /> Bergman is beautiful in black hair and wears vintage costumes, and Cooper is gorgeous as a dead man, with his incredible 300-watt smile. How she could resist him is beyond me. And the scenes of love - whoa, what chemistry! The distribution is excellent, Robson and Cupid creating interesting characters, and Florence Bates giving an excellent performance as a socially important woman who takes Clio under her wing, knowing that she is a big fake. <br /> <br /> few actors and some actors may seem out of fashion today, but it's a captivating story full of atmosphere and vivid performance. The end will not be a surprise. It's a fun trip, though.
