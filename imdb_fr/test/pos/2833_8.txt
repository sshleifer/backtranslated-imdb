... I saw this movie when it came out for the first time in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine years old and today, I still remember every black frame and white, especially blacks, because he was so tense and scary. , these sneak attacks through this dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight by their captors, the last battle with the discovery of the wagon with the Gatling inside, the last fight between Peck and the leader and the happy ending that lets me catch my breath. I have not seen it since and I do not know if it would be a good idea to see it again today, it was such a fabulous time for the kid I was.
