I bought this DVD recently and am totally impressed by the fact that Rush's songs sound the same as when I first listened to them in 1980. Geddy Lee's lineup, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart's so talented that I want to list it. again and again. <br /> <br /> Songs I remember, such as Tom Sawyer, XYZ, The Big Money, The Trees, Free Will, Closer to the Heart, 2112, Limelight and The Spirit of Radio were played and The 40000 plus Fans who sing and have fun and I swear that more than half of the audience was under 25! <br /> <br /> The writers who write Rush about Rush fans like me are a bunch of jealous dungeons who like to taste the rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in a taco. <br /> <br /> Rush does not make up, does not wear spikes, does not sync lips, does not wear lipstick, does not get bored with the law and does not brag about how much of time they were single. They only have fun! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD a rating of 100 out of 100.
