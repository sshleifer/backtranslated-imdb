Although I am a little older than the recommended age group, I really enjoyed this movie. It's a little break from reality and it must be every little girl's dream to become friends with a pop star. I know it was mine, of course! The first 10 minutes were really lame and the naughty girls said a few things that were also slightly lame. Once you have overcome this, you can really start enjoying it. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane - it was really nice and you could tell how much they started to love each other. The soundtrack is perfect and it fits perfectly in the film. I also loved the family settled for Jane, her sisters seemed adorable. Film very well done.
