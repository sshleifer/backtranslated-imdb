In Dublin, the crippled rebel Rory O'Shea (James McAvoy) settles in the Carrigmore Home for the Disabled, affecting the lives of its residents. Roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson), left in the shelter by his well-known father several years ago because of his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. Rory convinced Michael to move from Carrigmore to an apartment in Dublin, and they hired the beautiful Siobhan (Romola Garai) to help him. Living together with Rory, Michael faces a new world, finding friendship, love and freedom and learning to survive alone. <br /> <br /> "Inside I'm Dancing" is a wonderful story of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. The roles of Steven Robertson and James McAvoy are great and I do not understand how they were not nominated for the Oscar with such magnificent performances. Romola Garai also has a high level performance and is extremely beautiful and sexy. The scenario is touching, never cheesy and without redemption and the precise direction of Damien O'Donnell is very sensitive. Unfortunately, the Brazilian title of the DVD is shamefully ridiculous, giving a false idea of ​​this excellent movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Melhores Dias de Nossas Vidas" ("The best years of our life")
