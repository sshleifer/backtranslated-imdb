I just took this in a decent DVD version if not remarkable for a dollar at Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> Run and buy it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure this version is the short and incomplete version published against the will of the host at the end of the 50s, but despite that, it's a bargain * incredible * . <br /> <br /> This film was distributed in small parts in the form of a local soap opera In the early 1960s, children's television channels showed that almost every station broadcast these afternoons: "Mr. Bill and Bozo "," Monty's Gang "(Channel 4, Greenville SC) and" Captain Grady "(Channel 13, Asheville NC - which is where I saw it). It impressed me so much that I recognized it right away when I saw it in Wal Mart tonight and grabbed it. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You should get it.
