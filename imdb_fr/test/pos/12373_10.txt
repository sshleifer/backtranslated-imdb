Many say without words. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. It was made in color, not as in today's movies, but for a special monochrome use (with shadows) that represents meaning, mood, meaning and time. It should be seen in color because it becomes an entirely different movie. The story, presented by Nobel laureate Selma Lagerl√∂f, is actually presented. We never have a clear sense of reality, memory or ghost. The changes underway in Swedish society at this time are subtly stratified. I highly recommend it. Try to rent it or find it online. I saw it in a Swedish film class and I want to add it to my film library.
