Meatballs makes its way into conversations, not like other movies. Especially in summer. Whether it's the CIT song, cut-outs, Rudy the Rabbit's inspiring speech, or inspiring speech, it does not matter ... it appears! Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where he would wake up next?! Such a great snapshot of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that the non-PC is really fun, no matter who you are! Wheels and Spaz are the favorites, as is the hot dog competition with the famous line "What ..? No mustard?" Oh, how many times have I reiterated this line and was the only one to laugh! Thanks to the authors, the actors and the directors! Applause, applause!
