This film is a sleeper because Rod Steiger is the only big name in the credits. Yet, all the supporting actors correspond well to his character. It was fitting that Rod Steiger, in his latest film, reminded us once again of his inventive power as an actor. He described the impulsiveness, stubbornness and acceptance of the end of a grandfather's life in an individual and convincing performance. Because his character was close to death, history brings us closer to the most precious things we are granted: the privilege of life, relationships with family members and the empathy of those who take care of we. His search for one of his sons with his granddaughter has provided enough suspense to keep me waiting, expecting a very heavy climax like the meeting of two long-separated elderly lovers who were also on the verge of dying in "Forever Young". "I was wondering how the meeting would be and how much my emotions would be wiped out by the time he and his granddaughter came to the end of his quest." I was pleased to see that the story was more than what it was. I was expecting the deliciously satisfying climax that allowed me to better understand the value of the precious gifts of life, love and family that we enjoy today, to us as to all.
