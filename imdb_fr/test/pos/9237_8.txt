This film would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially as an independent, ... those whose heritage includes an introduction to the film may not appreciate it as much. I am hard to please in the documentary category. This doc is different, his pleasure comes from a terrifying realism of punks independent of the filmmaker who like to be there and watch. Whether you're wondering what it's like to be in a movie, in front of or behind the camera, or that you've managed to make your way through the sometimes painful and hard but rewarding indie world, you'll definitely have a shot of heart for this film.
