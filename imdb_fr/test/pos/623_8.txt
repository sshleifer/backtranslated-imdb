A superbly designed budget thriller with more twists than you can possibly have, and a lot of macabre humor along the way. <br /> <br /> The actors play very well, although Richards centered filmmaker is a bit difficult to take at once. The tiny cameo of two scenes by Sir Alec Guinness, threatening like the Moscow crime tsar, is simply the icing on the cake. alone!
