"Who Will Love My Children" The saddest film I have ever seen. Definitely 10/10. Released on television in 1983. The film was released in VHS. The DVD release is a must, as soon as possible. The mother who dies of cancer must find a home for all her children before she dies, because she thinks that her husband and father are not able to take care of them once she has passed away. She manages to find homes for children except one, a young boy who we do not want because he has epilepsy. Very sad when you did not want to. For a real good shaker of tears, get hold of this movie. I am a man even I cried when I watched this movie. Do not miss.
