The pantheon of John Ford's films occupies a unique place for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge and The Sun Shines Bright. It's not these three unnamed box office films that made Ford not have to adapt the movie to the character of a star, it's John Wayne, Henry Fonda or one of the movies he worked with . It's no surprise that Ford has seen them all as favorites. <br /> <br /> Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, two friendly cowpokes pledge to guide a train of Mormon cars into a valley in Arizona. Along the way, they are joined first by a group of stranded players from a medical fair, then by a family of outlaws fleeing named Clegg. Their stories merge and what happens is at the base of the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> If Wagonmaster had been done 10 years earlier with the strength of the two performances made by Johnson and Carey, the two would probably have had an important career as cowboys in picture B. In the case of Johnson, it was an art that imitated life. Johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a rope of horses that John Ford could use at Fort Apache. Ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> But the western western day was coming to an end and Johnson and Carey had a great career as good actors. <br /> <br /> Ward Bond plays the old Wiggs at the head of the Mormons. Bond is a recent convert and has trouble remembering not to use four-letter words. But he is the leader because of his strength of character, not his unstoppable theology of the SDJ. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. <br /> <br /> To represent the Cleggs, Ford was only four years old to return to his My Darling Clementine. They are the reincarnation of Clanton's gang and pure evil. In fact, if Walter Brennan, who after My Darling, Clementine had refused to work for Ford, still wanted him, I could easily see him embodied by Shiloh Clegg, the head of the family. Charles Kemper did a great job, and that's probably the role he's been most noticeable for. Shortly after the shooting of this film, Kemper was killed in a car accident. He could very well have worked for Ford in the future. <br /> <br /> Ford makes the Mormons pacifists here and I do not remember that pacifism was part of the LDS doctrine. Nevertheless, it works here, the idea being that these people who do not carry any weapon are innocent in front of perverse people like the Cleggs. It takes guns to cowboys to eliminate them properly. I think this post-WWII film tries to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. <br /> <br /> Another report from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray, playing the same kind of role he held there as head of the troupe at the medicine fair. Joanne Dru is part of the troupe. She plays another role as a woman of elastic virtue, as in Red River. Dru used to do so much western that she wanted to be in gingham and adopt a modern fashion. <br /> <br /> Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I'm willing to bet in the state of Utah that it's a very popular movie. .
