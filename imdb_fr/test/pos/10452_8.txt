It's one of the best and least rated teen movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I've seen it grow and it's one of my favorites, maybe less popular than "Fast Times", but simply. as great. <br /> <br /> There is a serious side to this film, as mentioned by other critics, it starts as a comedy and turns into a mid-drama. Yet it is its beauty and what distinguishes it. You have everything. Humor (not very different from that of "Fast Times"), drama, and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that every child about to enter high school should see it, this would give an idea of ​​the trip. their about to embark. Cmon-which kid who looks at this, would not be able to understand someone in the movie? The fact that it gets so serious midway is as cool and just right. You do not even see him coming. Absolutely a lot of surprises. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> An awesome humor slamming the knee (who could forget the scene between Gary and Camilla?). I can still hear it: "Oh my big strong burrito !!" Priceless !! <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes between Gary and Karin are hard to watch (especially the rude final scene). There are so many women like Karen who would have made the same choice as her. Think about it: how many women reject men with gold hearts (like Gary) for shaking? I know I did it - so I have a lot of women I know. This film will spark discussion and, despite the countless times I have seen it, it still leaves me with great admiration for filmmakers and performers. Everyone will find someone with whom to relate to this movie or who is more likely than one person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music used is great (a lot of Cars, u2, a lot of obscure songs (now)). 80s. -the dream of a purist of the 80s. <br /> <br /> But do not get me wrong, it's not the music that makes this film unique, it's the story even, quite simply. One of the best of its kind and a teen cinema classic.
