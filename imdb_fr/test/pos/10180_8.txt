When you watch the 1940s Superman animated shorts, the similarity of intrigues can get a little boring - the opponent is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarters, threatening Metropolis with a malevolent invention - death rays , mechanical monsters, electric earthquake, magnetic telescope, what have you. <br /> <br /> This one is refreshing. The bad guys are walking in a car, shooting and bombarding, but the center of action is the gold train (on which Lois Lane travels, as the only press reporter, it seems). The train films have their own ingredients, from the great train flight of 1903, and some of them are described here: decoupling moving cars, rooftop racing, taking the steam locomotive from the tender at the back, fight with the engineer, switch turned to divert the train on a side lane, the fall (of people or the whole train) of a high bridge ... all is in the few minutes of this beautiful room. <br /> <br /> Would not be a Superman movie if he had not done incredible feats (between balancing and high precision placement) to finally win the day. If you like train movies, do not miss this. It is in the public domain and can be downloaded legally from archive.org.
