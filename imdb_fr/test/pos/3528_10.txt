It was a great film from 1981 that told the story of three men and two girls who went camping and traveled through thick woods and high mountains with a beautiful waterfall. This group of people runs into a property owned by George Kennedy (Roy McLean), who plays the role of a ranger and rides a white horse. Roy McLean warns these kids that they should not camp and that they have to go back. Of course, these young people do not pay attention and proceed to a nude swim near the waterfall, play good music, dance by the fire and drink a lot of beer and wine. There is an old one-room wooden school that attracts girls and boys inside and it's from that moment that the movie starts to get very scary. There is a case where a girl has to climb a tree to get away from a human beast who wants her body and starts to shoot her to capture her. Do not miss this movie, there is a lot of everything.
