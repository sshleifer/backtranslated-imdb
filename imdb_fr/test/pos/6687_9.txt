I usually do not like movies with / about aliens, but K-PAX is different. The actors are excellent in the film - especially Kevin Spacey played his character breathtaking! The film never falls to a lower level - the suspense is still in the film and you absolutely want to know how it ends, what's going on with Prot ... You have to think long after the movie because it There are some outstanding questions ... Does Robert Porter Prot or Prot only use the body of Robert Porters as a means of transportation? How can he see ultraviolet light and how to know as much about astrology? But everyone can make their own idea and decide what they want to believe. Very good movie with an excellent Kevin Spacey!
