I really like this movie. This gives a very real impression. I think it has never been popular because of the subject matter; however, this film makes the film even more important. <br /> <br /> It's a movie "A" and I highly recommend it. . If you liked the book or movie "1984", I think you'll like this one too. <br /> <br /> It's hard, to say the least, including the psychological and physical acts of torture, which are sometimes rather vile. Not for the week in the heart or stomach. Not gore, but his film is so good for projecting mental anticipation that he does not need blood or courage. <br /> <br /> If you are not a realist or a pestimist, I do not think you will enjoy it. This leaves you with a sense of concern for humans, what they are capable of, and the very real possibility that our government does not necessarily have our best self-interest in their hearts.
