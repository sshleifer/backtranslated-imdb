I just thought I'd like to add another comment here. Although there are some visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special moment, physically tender, towards the end. When Enterprise retreats at a critical speed to try to overtake a potentially fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing her life is about to end dramatically, seeks comfort by placing her head on her shoulder Jim's friendly as they watch the instrument approaching their imminent fate on the main viewer. I thought it was nice (and Janice, of course, it's beautiful!). <br /> <br /> (P.S. Goof: - Several times, while he was supposed to light phasors, the film shows the launching of photon torpedoes)
