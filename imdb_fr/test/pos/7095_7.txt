What impressed me most about "One True Thing" is the franchise with which the girl mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the film. Even though the subject was depressing, it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blinded by the revelation about a character's fatal condition in 2/3 of the movie ("Love Story", "Terms of Endearment ", etc.). <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt perform very well and do not go beyond limits. The characters they play seem human; they are not perfect people. (We could say that we may not have said that about the character "Martha Stewart" that Streep plays, but throughout the film, I found that his character was noble of a non-sappy way, she treats her situation in the best possible way.) <br /> <br /> "One True Thing" is an attentive and unrepentant family drama in which the tears of the end have been well earned.
