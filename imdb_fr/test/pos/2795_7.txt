** SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br /> <br /> It is really unfortunate that such a well-produced film proves to be such a disappointment. I thought it was all clichés and <br /> <br /> he was basically trying to be tough. <br /> <br /> To (American) guys, how many of you spend <br /> <br /> your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds <br /> ? To girls (brides): how many of you have gone from one day to the next of prudes to nymphos - but not with their husbands? To the French: Would you really like to ask someone <br /> <br /> to be "in college" when you know they do not speak French? <br /> <br /> Do not you use a more common word like "university"? <br /> <br /> I lived in France for a while and I know and understand in a way <br /> <br /> Europe (and I love it), but my roommate (German ) and I found this pretty insulting overall. It looked like a film funded by the <br /> <br /> European Parliament, and the efforts were too hard on the bottom. <br /> <br /> He had all kinds of differences that he tried to bring closer (it's not a bad thing to <br /> <br /> herself), but the result is at better clumsy, but actually ridiculous-- also <br /> <br /> many clashes that would not really happen. Then, the end of the film <br /> <br /> - the last 10 minutes - ruined everything. Why does not Xavier <br /> <br /> talk to the Erasmus students he meets in Paris? Why does <br /> <br /> just leave? Why does he just save himself from his job, is it <br /> <br /> "freedom"? And in the end, is the new Europe supposed to be based on <br /> <br /> a group of people who smoke and fuck all day? Is that what it's made of <br /> <br />? <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting was rather horrible. I can not believe Judith <br /> <br /> The role and action of Godrèche. Why did she look like <br /> <br /> Emanuelle Béart? At first, I thought Xavier was fine, but in hindsight, I think he was really bad. <br /> <br /> And it's really a shame, because technically (opening credits, <br /> <br /> scenes where he asks what papers he needs) it was really <br /> < br /> good (except for the sound editing around British siblings), and the <br /> soundtrack was also excellent. So, the shape was good, but the content <br /> <br /> was rather horrible.
