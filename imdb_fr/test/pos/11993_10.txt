One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is highly presented as a "nominative" sequel. There is nothing wrong with that, except for this: the return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb. This connects the viewer to this original 1980 Caddyshack character and encourages fans to think or want Caddyshack II to be similar to the first. <br /> <br /> There are rumors that Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to come back. . He was wearing a large part of the first film, so his return would have placed Caddyshack 2 above. Jackie Mason is the 'new' Rodney for this film and does a decent job, even though their comic book deliveries are quite different. Dan Aykroyd was great but not enough in the movie. He should have been involved in determining Bill Murray's screen time in the first film. Robert Stack (Airplane!) Played well in the "new" role of Ted Knight / Villian. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan should have been back. So many others could have come back to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover he suffered. Instead, the characters involved, rather than the club itself, should have been the focus of attention as they were in the first. When you watch this movie, keep in mind that this is not a major sequel and you might think it's another good or bad comedy from the 80s. The fans of the first should see it but do not be shocked when the comparisons between the original and Part II are so far apart.
