Our family (and all the sold-out moviegoers) enjoyed "The Guardian". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as fictitious characters of rescue swimmers by Helicopter Ben and Jake. After watching this film, you can not help but imagine how difficult it is to graduate from the USCG Helicopter Rescue School and participate in real life rescue operations. <br /> <br /> Even if it's a fictional movie. it offered quite convincing teamwork, dedication and bravery from all members of the current US Coast Guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible. You really felt like you were part of a real rescue. <br /> <br /> I think the film could have been shot without the Hollywood bar scene (when you see the movie, you might agree), Coast Guard does not tolerate such behavior. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, very action packed, well worth a visit. Thanks to the US Coast Guard and the real helicopter rescue swimmers, "So Others May Live". I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
