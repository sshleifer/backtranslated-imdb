I liked this series, but I have the feeling that the recording and the mixing sound have dropped. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they had to use a lot of what is called ADR, where the actors replace the sound of the original location by re-recording in a sound booth. <br /> <br /> Reasons for this are usually due to site issues or read errors. . <br /> <br /> It would not be so bad if the ADR was well done, but sometimes it is just embarrassing. The problem is not just ADR, sound mixing simply does not match the quality of performance and images. <br /> <br /> I would be curious to know what's wrong.
