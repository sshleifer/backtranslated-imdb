I can not really criticize this movie. It's literally the first film I remember seeing and that led to a lifetime love for science fiction and horror movies and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, seeing him again years later, he resisted well enough. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths. Nobody believes him, including his best friend, played by CÃ©sar Romero, whose brother was among those killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and presents beautiful landscapes. The acting game is at a high level. I do not think Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor had a bad performance. Mammoths, when they finally arrive, are quite effective. The end also has an unusual twist, especially for a science fiction film from the 1950s. Worth a visit.
