Found a copy in a garbage sale of this classic old time. I played it with dosbox on a Vista machine without any problem. It is highly graphically dated, but what are you waiting for a 12 year old game! The game is a hybrid FPS / adventure game. That's what I call pseudo-3D, you can not look up or down, just turn 360 (think Wolf3D). The game can become difficult with a very limited number of health pots and a rather average interface (Tip: press I), but overall it is passable. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is one of the main assets of the game. The game uses a lot of video in full motion, and although the acting is B and the plot is very unstable, the game as a whole is really scary. It is also a good job to have you interview the "good guys". Are they really helping or are they just waiting to stab you in the back? The other major selling point is the length of the games. There are 18 chapters in memory, whose playing time varies from 10 minutes to potentially hours. My first part took me a week with a serious dedication. <br /> <br /> Dated, yes, but if you missed that years ago and you can find it for $ 5, look at it. Less expensive than a movie and more entertaining than most movies.
