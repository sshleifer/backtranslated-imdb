Neither torturer a small canard is a giant deviation absolument repellent for Lucio Fulci. Contrary to other lukewarm poets, Mario Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci adopte une résolument serrieuse, fondée et sociement perceptive du recécito giallo de ce film. The spells of enfants et la pédophilie limite (une intrigue secondaire 1972) are devolved ici. Fulci takes a deep breath with an eye to light, encouraging the eclat du flash, mélodrame et les histoires de réalisateur. The deviations are more rhythmatic than decriminalizing scenes that are bleeding and immidently hallucinating, who are constantly reinforced by the dissatisfaction of the Realism of Fulci. The scene of "Sorceresses", deeply distressing, especially with the brutal chauve à visage, resembles a movie. The composer Riz Ortolani has cited scenes replacing carnage with sounds of reverb and féroces strings. <br /> <br /> The film is written for a conclusion on the lyric and violent story the theology, morale, fanaticism and superstition are rencontent. That's a fine way to get the ability of the spectator in a clumsy confusion and disarm. <br /> <br /> Fulci n'aurait pas pu choisir un meilleur emplacement pour ce film. Do not Torture a Duckling été photographie à l'intérieur et autour of the old city of Matera, in Italy. While Matera continues to modernize (he envisioned the passage of an economic economy to an industrial economy), he joins with the reputation of mystérieux palaeolithic fantasies, sponsored by UNESCO. The characters of the film reflecting the anguish of Mater Materelle's revenge, who, taking Christianity, sur leurs manches, affront with frénésie toute tradition marginal exotique (à savoir la sorcellerie) who escapes to the norm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Feeling attractive, Matera was also used as a replacement of Jerusalén in The Passion of Christ by Mel Gibson. Beyond that, I still add more of puissance au message de Fulci. The culpability of the Catholic Church and the threat of violence is a combination if it resides.
