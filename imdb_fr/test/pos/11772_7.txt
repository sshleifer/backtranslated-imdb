This is the kind of movie that could give you a nightmare, besides being very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Hardware Wars is the only good parody of Star Wars, other movies like Spaceballs have failed. It's the only good parody film I've ever seen, it does not remove Star Wars, it makes fun of it and it's supposed to be parodontics.
