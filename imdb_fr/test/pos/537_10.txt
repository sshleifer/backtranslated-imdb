Most families will recognize the similarities between their own family and those created by the brilliant interpretations of Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates an image on the screen that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and worthy of a Golden Globe nomination. The control of her emotions is so intimate that at any moment of the film, she can draw and broadcast an unforgettable scene. Susan is also amazing in this movie. She chose a role so different from others and wears it professionally. <br /> <br /> Any fan of Natalie would have seen the movie based on her past success, but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the movie. It is a truly humiliating experience.
