Ninja Hunter (aka Wu Tang vs. Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish because of its outrageous characters, absurd plot and lack of pretension. The filmmakers gave us a real OTT masterpiece that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is centered around the evil Wu Tang, Father White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme. martial artist. To do this, he teamed up with a Ninjas clan, led by three masters ?? gold lame ninja, white mustached ninja and black ninja ?? and managed to destroy the Shaolin Temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are survivors. It is their job to pass on Shaolin's fingerprint skills to a new generation, who must defeat the ninjas and Abbott White if peace and order are to be restored. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Abbott White is a tough guy to beat, as he is able to make himself virtually indestructible by sucking up the life force of hot and naked girls (an excuse for some free nudity!). <br /> <br /> Other candies reserved for viewers include a lot of very impressive fights (despite some accelerations), really amazing outfits (the gold-plated ninja mentioned above, the costumes Yin Yang of Abbott White, and even assassins wearing swastika tunics), a ninja turning into a flying carpet, plus some cheesy gore for good measure. And I almost forgot to mention the really impressive eyebrows exposed in this movie ?? surely a good reason not to miss this gem.
