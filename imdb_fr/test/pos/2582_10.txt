As soon as I saw Black Snake Moan's first trailer, I knew I should see her. I was not disappointed at all in the film, written and directed by Hustle and Flow creator Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a man of broken blues and the nymphomaniac he seeks to cure, not only for her, but also for his own ... Yet, it is much more than that. It's complex and rich, and he manages to immerse you in a sensual blue, sticky and sensual Memphis, without making you feel like you need a bath after. The characters are (for the most part) multiform and very well written and interpreted. The accents and the dialogue unfolded without fail. However, there was a weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best I can say for him is that he can cry ... he's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. However, Justin Ronnie was flat, but as an actor, he was trying very hard. I would certainly give him another chance. <br /> <br /> Lazarus and Rae (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci) have great chemistry and respect for each other. This is one of those films where the quality of one actor is not important if the other is not up to the task and that, fortunately, both actors were up to the task. <br /> <br /> The music was really as good as you expected, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sang the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> On the technical side, everything was great as far as the eye could see. It was well mounted, well shot and well mixed ... everything was great. The characters and sets were perfect, the cast of the secondary characters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was perfect ... loved.
