The best movie, so bad-good, never done. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether for everyday life or for pimping, I can always count on him for inspiration and advice. In terms of blaxploitation, it's Rudy's man. Nobody is more mean. Watch Dolemite as he and his army of all-female assassins kill kung fu to shoot Mr. Big and Willie Green. Super conspiracy, huh? There are so many unique lines that multiple visualizations are needed to improve your vocabulary. If you say a few lines of Dolemite, you are instantly cool. If you're in the mood to laugh, rent this movie. Also check out The Human Tornado, Disco Godfather and Petey Wheatstraw, the son-in-law of the devil. Now, can you dig that? <br /> <br /> "You have no business apart, insecurity, rat soup, motha !!"
