This film by Blake Edwards does not really know if he wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. Regardless, the presence of Julie Andrews is reason enough to see this parody of comedy-drama-musical-spy. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he's more than anything, like Julie's romantic interest. The authentic cars and planes of the First World War are added to the appeal. Overall, the movie is very entertaining. The DVD version is a modified version (by Blake Edwards) of the original version. Supposedly, this is the only version authorized by Edwards; but Turner Classic Movies showed the full version (theatrical release) recently. Recommended.
