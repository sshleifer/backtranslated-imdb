On a scale of 1 to 10, "Suicidal Sweetheart" received an 11 from me and all the others during this screening. The photo was incredibly funny. I said to my wife, "It's obvious that this man walks on the water but on a bed of fire, it's a little too much." It's one of the best mixes of comedy, satire and innuendo I've seen since Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein". I can not believe that this photo was not taken by a big studio. <br /> <br /> The audience of this "Film Festival" was sophisticated and was able to capture all the comic insinuations, whether visual, spoken or implied. The characters are real and the combination of a good script and an excellent cast was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real problems, no matter how successful they are. This allows you to keep smiling while being serious and laughing with all the indirect humor brilliantly integrated into this production. <br /> <br /> To summarize, it's a table "to see absolutely".
