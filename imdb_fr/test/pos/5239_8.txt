I really liked this film. It stars John Wayne in his first starring performance. Even then, you can say that Wayne has a real presence, although he does not really become an icon for which he is known until Stagecoach, 9 years later, in 1939. These are settlers from all over countries heading to the new west to colonize it. Wayne's character, Breck Coleman, joins the group, but for personal reasons. Most of the main actors were theater actors and had never shot a film before, which makes the movie even more amazing.They managed to create distinctive and credible characters and there is a rather strange mix here.Cimarron will come out a year later and had a very similar story, although I did not like it as much as this movie For me, The Big Trail is a powerful 8/10.
