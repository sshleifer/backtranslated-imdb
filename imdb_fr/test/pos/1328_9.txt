Ocean's Twelve is probably better than Ocean's Eleven. I know most people would not agree, but I loved him more. After three years, it was good to see the return of the band. The reason behind the heist is a little more inspired the second time. I see why they stole Beno√Æt (Andy Garcia) in the last movie. This film, they have a little more motivation the second time. Ocean's Twelve is more entertaining and colder than Ocean's Eleven. With a funny Topher Grace cameo saying "I just walked in this new Dennis Quaid movie" and stuff. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best in the series. <br /> <br /> The plot: A year or two after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict (the guy they stole in the last movie) is back and says that if Ocean's Eleven do not pay him back money they stole, he'll call the cops. So Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old cop girlfriend, Isabelle. When she meets him again, she begins to follow them. The gang also learns that he has an enemy who is also a thief who is a bit better than he is. <br /> <br /> With many fun scenes like the one where Tess (Julia Roberts) travels to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a pretty smart movie. It's cooler, funnier and more entertaining than Ocean's Eleven.
