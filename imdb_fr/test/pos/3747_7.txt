I recently saw this movie at a 3D film festival in Hollywood. It was 3D polarized (gray glasses, no red or blue). It was so much fun to watch this movie with an audience, the print was excellent and the 3D perfect. The performances were excessive and it added to the fun, in the end surprised (that we are not supposed to share with other moviegoers, at least according to the trailer and the poster of the film). By today's standards, this is probably more of a comedy than a horror, but with the extra dimension of 3D (with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen), this movie was a fun adventure in the horror of the 50s.
