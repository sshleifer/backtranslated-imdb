I have been a fan of Geena Davis since forever because of this movie. I have always loved Samuel L. Jackson. And both make a nice pair on the screen. That said, I think that 'TLKG' is the best action movie I have ever seen. Forget the difficulties that the public is now waiting for and that filmmakers are now trying (especially to fail) to integrate into their films. br /> 10/10
