The blue planet of the BBC is simply staggering. I do not think I'm exaggerating when I say that it contains some of the most beautiful footage ever recorded in a movie. Familiar creatures on the surface of the ocean and near them, passing by others more unrecognizable and simply bizarre in the dark depths, nothing is left behind. Weighing after eight hours, some people may want to check out the highlights of the movie "Deep Blue", but I strongly recommend you try the series. I do not think it will disappoint, and if your children are enjoying the aquatic world presented by Pixar's Finding Nemo, I'm sure they'll like it too. I just wish all the TV is so entertaining.
