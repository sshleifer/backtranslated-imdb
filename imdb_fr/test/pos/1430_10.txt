The golden-armed man, Otto Preminger's controversial panoramic crime drama, is played among the mental descriptions of his living and architectural occupants, in a rhythmic and whipping arrangement. By opening the film, a close-up shot from inside a Frankie bar looking out the window already indicates the importance that the protagonist's subjective experience will capture. Shot in the direction of increasingly restricted spaces, the film closes, while the local gangster's long-running poker game closes in the light of day, hiding, while Sinatra's Frankie Machine is himself locked in a room of the famous scene of his heartbreaking struggle to overcome his habit. Exploring the shapes and faces of its urban and jazzy paradise, the Golden-Armed Man's visual traffic characterizes asymmetrical psychological conditions, forming an overwhelming environment, as maintained by recurrent pistol shots in the eyes, near the eyes from Frankie. <br /> <br /> The grace of this inflamed tragedy, striking at the first shot of exciting crane, demonstrates the mastery of the perceptible world that allows studio production. The marvelously dilapidated urban complexes define an independent place without beginning or end, an indeterminate state, a kind that actually lasts as long as this line of skidding seems to be before being gentrified or leveled. The flair of certain performances, in particular that of Robert Strauss as head of the wonderfully named sub-world play, Schwiefka, and Arnold Stang as Frankie's faithful four-eyed guard dog, becomes a pleasant surrealistic feature. The premise of drug addiction, Sinatra's performance, Elmer Bernstein's infectious and percussive jazz score, and Saul Bass's famous, influential and controversial opening sequence centered on the paper cut from the arm of a drug addict. the heroine ensured that, in his day, The Man with the Golden Arm insists on the cause of realism in Hollywood still reluctant. It's impressionistic and subjective, I say, but its intent, strength and spirit are much closer to home. <br /> <br /> What absorbs me the most in this movie is its gangster movie aspect. He has illegal card games, storytelling games, fights, firearms, double crosses, characters on the lam, a femme fatale, an incredibly sexy gun moll, shady nightclubs and cityscape , but it does not just exploit this entertainment environment. Really, it's the perfect environment and genre to tell this story, a crime-ridden urban district where it's too comfortable to escape by a bottle or two, three or four or by the drug, a transient dose which really just functions to keep one in the dark of all enlightenment and all the clear scenarios that the world could offer.
