Having worked professionally with young girls on the run, I found this film astonishingly authentic. I would never have found that a friend would not have lent him his videotape. There are classic themes here: The middle age, The mother / daughter alliance, The limited choices of the underprivileged, Who is the good Samaritan, Tragedy is in every life and in many layers or relationships. Flashbacks make sense (when Alice acquires a gun, we know she knows how to use it) and it does not end in clich√©. The cast "really sells" their roles. This is adult material and the audio is a bit too gritty. Allow 15 minutes to attract you.
