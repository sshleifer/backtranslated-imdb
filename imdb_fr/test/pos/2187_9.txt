SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER BY FLEET STREET, by Stephen Sondheim, opened on Broadway on March 1, 1979, with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in lead roles. Although he won almost every conceivable award, the box office did not meet expectations and the original production ended his run at 557 performances. Fortunately, the piece was then shot - and along the way was filmed. The result is a remarkable capture of the play starring George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury, moving closer to Broadway's original staging. <br /> <br /> There is a flaw, however. In simple terms, the plays do not film very well, because a performance that works well must occupy the theater and is therefore very large - and when placed on a film, such performances often appear slightly static, extremely aggressive , or both. . SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen on the film, it has a "stand and sing" quality, and although Hern and Lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the pleasure of the camera, this is not the case with Betsy Joslyn as Joanna; his larger-than-life performance can be read on the film with an unpleasant frenzy and his extremely operatic voice seems out of place in relation to the voices of the entire cast. <br /> <br /> Under this effect of film on stage However, this is an exceptional performance of a unique musical and macabre in operetta style. Lansbury is astonishing, a mix of foolishness, stupidity, and cunning mischief, while Hern truly takes on the role of the psychotic barber whose customers "go to their perfectly shaven graves." The general distribution is quite good and although the film does not let us see the scenery enough, there is enough for the film to be impressive. And the music! Who can argue with what most consider to be Sondheim's best job? History itself is extremely well known, especially in England. In 1846, Thomas Peckett Perst concocted several urban myths for a short story entitled A STRING OF PEARLS; In about a year, he was adapted to the scene as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMET OF FLEET STREET - and, at a time when copyright was little known, variations of the play were soon played in all England. However, everyone was pretty much the same: Sweeney Todd, a barber, kills the men who come to see him for shaving; Mrs. Lovett, her partner, prepares them in pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. Sondheim's version is especially inspired by Christopher Bond's 1973 version. <br /> <br /> The story is very big, with lots of blood, falling bodies and grotesque humor; at the same time, however, the music, the lyrics and the intrigue of an innocent man under the influence of evil open the subject to many lyrical charms that one would not expect. Sondheim's words are often ironic, but never more so than here; he mixes a lot of unhealthy satire about industry and capitalism along the way, and one can certainly not blame the strange Victorian elegance of his intricate music. <br /> <br /> Like the "concert version" featuring Hern and Patti LuPone, this particular film also provides us with several selections from the 2007 Tim Burton movie, especially the opening "Assist to the tale". of Todd Sweeney ", which unfolds as a common thread throughout the play. It is also, in my opinion, considerably more comic than the film, which tends to minimize the comedy in favor of an even larger blood show. Anyway, if you're a fan of history, this is the legendary Broadway show on tour, and it's a coup de grace. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon review
