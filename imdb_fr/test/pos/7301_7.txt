A Jane Smiley novel, freely inspired by Shakespeare's KING LEAR, about the Cook family and its dark secrets. Director Moorhouse seems tame in her approach, allowing characters to come forward and greet. And how could you go wrong with the talents of Pfeiffer, Lange, Leigh, Firth, Carradine and Robards?
