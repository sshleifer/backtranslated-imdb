I've always loved Barbara Stanwyck, who was perhaps the most hard working actress of the '30s and' 40s, although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today, we remember her especially for the television show "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked a lot because she was resistant. it seems that she would accept almost any role and make the most of it to make the film a success. The filmmakers loved him and much more than an ordinary image gained in credibility thanks to his presence. <br /> <br /> And it was for "Christmas in Connecticut" is a very ordinary endeavor whose plot impedes credulity and does not even really concern Christmas. However, he owns Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan, as well as some of the finest characters, including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall, so there are twists and turns of fun that seemed more real in 1945 than they are today. For starters, the plot is about a writer (Stanwyck) who, according to her readers, is a domestic goddess married to a child and lives on a farm in Connecticut, but who is truly single, lives in New York and has no idea from the kitchen or the kitchen. Housekeeping. Could someone get away with such fraud even then? Apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived, although one might think he would have long since seen the deception, but the story goes on and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a recently survived sailor from his sunken ship ( Morgan) and Stanwyck's Restorative Friend (SZSakall) finds himself spending Christmas in Connecticut on a farm owned by his fierce boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities for that while the fraud is going well. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry her to keep waking up, but we wonder how she can handle it. Morgan and Stanwyck fall into each other, but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married. Anyway, they start what seems to be an imaginary adventure dancing from cheek to play and flying off in a horse-drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who saw Stanwyck and Morgan go out together but still do not understand one of the neighbors, picks up a borrowed child for deception and calls the cops to report an abduction. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unfold. <br /> <br /> At this point, the movie is funny as in a ridiculous or an absurd, not funny, ah, ah and it always ends up as vivid comedies does. The brave boy gets the girl and presumably he will live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> I watch this film every year at Christmas to make the most of these actors in a story like what it was in 1945 of a long-time fascination for Barbara Stanwyck. Thank goodness, it was shot at Christmas or, like 95% of Stanwyck's movies, it would have been forgotten a long time ago and we would not have the opportunity to see it again every year.
