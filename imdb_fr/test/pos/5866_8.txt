There is only one racist joke in this short film Daffy Duck, which is essentially, when Daffy rides Black Beauty, it's a black woman. I can understand in part why this joke was included because at the time, few people knew how rude it was to be racist and it was not even illegal to discriminate against black people. <br /> <br /> Outside of this point, "A Coy Decoy" is basically a fun and interesting short film where Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I really liked this short circuit (despite the other commentators here). The way Daffy so loves mechanical duck is vaguely disturbing, but very entertaining at the same time. Porky is a beautiful edition of the episode, although it was not vital for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people thought about the wolf at that time too, terrible and bloodthirsty animals, which of course they have never been (unless they are very hungry). I also liked the animation style used - and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For people who totally love Daffy Duck and those who do not fear occasional racist jokes in cartoons, enjoy "A Coy Decoy"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
