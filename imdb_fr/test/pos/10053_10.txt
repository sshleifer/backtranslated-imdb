I saw this movie when I was a child and I loved it. I loved the fact that she is brave and full of energy, and especially her way of ruining Louden's perfect life, corrupting and adopting it. When I was a kid in the 80s, I saw New York exactly like in this movie, the realm of Madonna's character, with wild animals running around and bald and hideous men chasing people and wreaking havoc. As an adult, I discover that I love the film for the same reasons, and more so for the love story woven into Ms. Nikki Finn's crazy antics. Although I would always go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie. Pure beauty and genius.
