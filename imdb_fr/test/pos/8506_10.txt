I like both this version of DORIAN GRAY and the MGM version. The two add a little girl at the beginning of the story who grows up to have an association with Dorian (it's not in the original book), and that's my only complaint. I particularly like Angela Lansbury as Sybil Vane and George Sanders as Harry in the MGM version, but Shane Briant as Dorian in the TV version is much more beautiful (I think) and much more ruthless than Hurd Hatfield in the MGM version: I think Briant is more faithful to the Dorian of the novel. In the end, it is a very good adaptation of the novel (it even refers to the connection of Dorian with men, as does Wylde, which was not possible in the MGM version).
