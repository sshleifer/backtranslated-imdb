In Landscape after the Battle, Andrzej Wajda describes the emotional and psychological confusion in a former Nazi prison in Poland, released immediately after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> A hand-held camera explores many extreme close-ups and bright colors. The final credit as graffiti on the flanks of freight cars symbolically completes the film. The soundtrack is excellent, with the exception of Vivaldi, who sounds in the opening sequence in a pop-art way.
