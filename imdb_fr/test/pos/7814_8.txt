I saw it for the first time a few nights ago on TV. I only thought to listen for a few minutes, but I found myself intrigued by the film. I ended up watching everything and found it surprisingly convincing. The game of three American stars was very good, especially that of Alex Cord. He plays a bandit with a fairly high vulnerability. Very different from the way most of them are described in westerns. He found himself in several situations where he was at the mercy of bounty hunters. The final shooting between the three leaders and the bad guys was very good, as was the scene where the doctor pulled a ball out of Clay McCord. A little horrible, but realistic. I must admit that, despite my initial reluctance to watch a "spaghetti western", I ended up enjoying this film. I would recommend it to anyone who loves westerns.
