Having seen this without knowing all the thunder surrounding the main character, or even without knowing that it was based on real events, I must say that I am impressed. "Murder in Greenwich" is an above-average production for a TV movie - acting is always excellent, Christopher Meloni in particular plays a remarkable role and teen actors excel in difficult roles. The idea of ​​the deceased narrating the film is a stroke of genius that makes the film from good to excellent. The scenario is exemplary for what is essentially the filmed fodder of the week and the cinematography is magnificent.
