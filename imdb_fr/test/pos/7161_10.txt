I just got back from the GLBT Film Festival at the 34th AMC Loews Conference in New York. A friend told me about this movie. The reaction of the public was very positive! Many good laughs and some quiet moments of achievement. Top notch in all areas. A film that makes you think and then makes you understand how lucky we would be if we could go back in time and live without shame or guilt. I imagine it will come closer, if not win, the public's favorite prize! What was most amazing is that the film begins as a satire, then slowly turns into a real comment on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the group that he began to do satire. There is no petty humor at the expense of a group, but a slow realization that we would all be better off if we returned to the sweet innocence with which we all started.
