Keys to the VIP, an original series from the Canadian Comedy Network (comedynetwork.ca), scored points with this entertaining and inspiring game show. This show is animated by four funny and beautiful guys who judge others on their "game" (ability to look for women). Each episode features two guys competing in various rehearsal games. There are three different sections and the winner wins one night as a VIP at an exclusive Toronto night club. <br /> <br /> Being a guy, I naturally find this show hilarious. We all know that it is difficult to confront women and that to look at these men naturally arouses the curiosity of men. The guys who participate in this show could even give you some advice - if you pay attention.
