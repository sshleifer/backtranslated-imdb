Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Gerald Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney), decided that the city was too busy and too dangerous for their family. They packed their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and his daughter (Tammy Lauren) and returned to a lake like this. Rachel lived in her childhood. <br /> <br /> It is said that you can not go home but it is an ideal rural home with what seems at first a Mayberry atmosphere. Later, the residence seems to be more like the inhabitants of Deliverance. Soon the bodies begin to appear and everyone looks suspicious except for a few friendly faces. This does not prevent the family from running and having fun in the woods. <br /> <br /> We find that they must be extremely ignorant to find the secrets and say nothing to anyone until they are recognized with the ax. antagonists. <br /> <br /> Can ignored young Stevie save his parents or will his pursuers step in? <br /> <br /> This movie is more than most parodies as it was played with straight faces. They could not have chosen better actors and Daryl Anderson was exceptionally scary. An added bonus is that they let us know what's going on before the characters discover it, instead of taking a hint of the hat after the fact. Anyway, this movie made for TV is good for some laughs.
