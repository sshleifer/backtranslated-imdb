Unlike Bond and other detective films, Alfred Hitchcock's hero was an ordinary man who was getting into trouble and who, with his insight and courage (and luck), was doing well. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle. This is, so to speak, the tribute paid by Vijay Anand to the master of suspense. The tribute, though it may be, but it is based on its own foundation and makes Vijay Anand a great director himself. <br /> <br /> This is the story of an ordinary man, Vinay, who realizes one day that he has a double called Amar. who is in fact a thief of jewels. Suddenly, Vinay is in full bloom. To save himself, he goes in pursuit of the wild goose and finds this Amar who still has a leg up on him. The suspense kills almost throughout the film and, as the plot unfolds, you are struck by the genius of the stratagem. Like Hitchcock's films, Jewel Thief can boast a great climax shot inside the grand palace of Sikkim. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I want to say everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri, etc., are at their best. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.
