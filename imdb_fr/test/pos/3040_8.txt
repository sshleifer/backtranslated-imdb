I just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the film leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and comforting study of the evolution of a man who aims to defeat his youth and his education in a South marked by prejudices, as well as the creativity of the teacher to get in touch with students despite different contexts and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all the challenges of life, not just the lessons in textbooks, is a valuable concept that needs to be remembered to all. The thread surrounding the Vietnam War still rings today. Well worth a look.
