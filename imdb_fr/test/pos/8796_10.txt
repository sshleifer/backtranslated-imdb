hello everyone, all I have to say is that Human Traffic and all its characters are so real that it's funny. I live in Australia (Melbourne) and I am finally out of clubbing and I stay out all the life of every day. This film explains everything that is happening in the world today. So, exactly, I can not stop looking at it .... I was exactly like Moff, so my friends told me and I did not even see the movie .. I left the end of week to party behind about 3 months ago after 4 years of intense partying to change my life .. I was in a DVD store when I saw Human Traffic and I remember my old friends who were talking about it, so I bought it to see what everyone was worried about .. I was so adept I watched it 4 times in a row because I could not believe that someone had made a movie that explains everything to a T. Anyway, this movie is by far the best and the funniest I've ever seen .. It's funny because it's so honest in everything that's going on in the movie .. ET Moff is a legend !!! That's all I have to say .. :) Enjoy 11/10 blew my socks how real it was, that's exactly what's happening in the world .. hr rm i jabber a lot <br /> <br /> take care of all people ...
