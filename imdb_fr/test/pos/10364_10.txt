In my work with the only national non-profit organization, Security On Campus, Inc., which focuses exclusively on crime prevention on university campuses and student outreach, I too often see the type of violence and concealment on secret campuses. the courts portrayed in the film "Mary in silence". In fact, we receive numerous calls and inquiries every month from campus reporters, such as "Mary," who face similar situations. <br /> <br /> He describes a rape on campus and the subsequent crusade conducted by "Mary," The victim's roommate and a student journalist were extremely well performed by Melissa Joan Hart, as justice has was very well done and was the subject of specific research. <br /> <br /> This was the first TV movie I have ever seen and that I really felt reflected and encompassed all the complex issues related to how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with in colleges and universities of our country. Although it is not possible to tackle all these questions in depth in 2 hours, this film is closer than all the others I've seen.
