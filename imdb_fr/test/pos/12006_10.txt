Probably grossly underestimated by all those who have never known the hell of living under the communist regime. Although it seems hard to believe, everything happened, but the reality was even worse than the movie. It sounds like an Orwellian fiction, but it's not a fiction. John Hurt is excellent as always. Yes, the scenario is not filled with action, but life is not. Land is breathtaking. Yes, people have been shot, yes, thousands of them. Their "crime" was to have wanted to leave communist "paradise" without the authorization of the government. Sometimes the film gives you tears in your eyes. We need more movies like this to really appreciate what America provides us. Excellent movie, highly recommend! God bless our country, USA!
