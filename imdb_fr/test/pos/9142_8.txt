I already commented on this movie as BruceV3. Now, under BruceV13, I want to add something! Now, after a long time, I have seen many so-called heroic bloodshed titles! But few get closer to the action shown in John Woo's movies! That's why, after all these years, it's strange that "China White" does not get the credit it deserves! No matter what version you saw! The action is top! The landscape, China Town in Amsterdam is very unique. You feel like it's a big district. But having lived in Amsterdam myself, I know it's only a small part of the red light district that has many Chinese shops and restaurants! But because of the way they shot the film, it actually looks like a big and important territory where people know that you should not spoil the triads (Chinese mafia)! In addition to the action "China White" is a convincing gangster drama with some good actors! For that, I must give credit to Russel Wong! Too bad we did not see him much lately, because he has a lot of potential! Must see the movie!
