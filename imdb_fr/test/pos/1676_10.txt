After five years in prison, Tony the Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dearest friends, Jo (Carl Möhner) and the Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel). They invite Tony to steal some jewelry in the window of the famous jewel. Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he refuses. Tony finds his former girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who has become the lover of the gangster owner of the Golden Age nightclub Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and he humiliates her by hitting her on the back and taking her jewels. Then he calls Jo and Mario and offers a burglary of the safe of the jewel. They invite the Italian safecover specialist and the elegant wolf César (Perlo Vita) to join their team and plan a perfect robbery. They succeed in their plan, but Dr. Juan Cesar makes sure that things do not go well when he gives a ring of great value to his mistress. <br /> <br /> "Rififi in men" is a beautiful film noir, certainly among the best I've seen. The screenplay has credibility, backed by a brilliant direction from Jules Dassin, breathtaking performance of the cast and excellent cinematography. Jean Servais has an outstanding performance in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the rules of the underworld. The famous long silent sequence of the band is amazing and extremely tense and certainly among the best in the history of cinema. I list this great movie in my list of favorite movies ever. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rififi"
