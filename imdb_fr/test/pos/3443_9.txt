Absolutely, I agree with my previous comment to describe this film as a fascinating film, fascinating and certainly beautiful. It is not necessary to see all episodes, because the first are the best, while the last are a little tiring, but for all those who love German and their playful manner, all episodes are worth seeing. Values ​​are constantly questioned, even if his murderous past is confronted in the last episodes, rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany, preferably in the original language! <br /> <br />
