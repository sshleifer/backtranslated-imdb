Graphically, this is the same game as the first, namely different levels and new features added for fun. <br /> <br /> The PS1 version still does not have the ability to give skaters enough air for a few laps. The Dreamcast version, which is rarely seen, was the best version of the 4 versions (the Xbox was finally released with a 5th with 2x), it had a clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed than the PS1 and the N64 could manage. <br /> <br /> The levels are really incredibly successful, from start to finish, like the first one, the school was my favorite, I liked it so much, not just for the golf cart that knocked you over sometimes but for the length. That's what I liked about the first two games. They do not improve graphically these games, they focused on the length of the levels, which is cool. <br /> <br /> Overall, as good as the first, and well worth it.
