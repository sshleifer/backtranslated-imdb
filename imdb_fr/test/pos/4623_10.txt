First of all, I have to say that I really like watching this movie. The way we follow different people at the same time works perfectly, and it's one of those movies that really makes you think. <br /> <br /> Spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> The fact that girls who kill themselves, is the one you do not notice, that's what pushed me to ask questions, because that's why she's committing Suicide in the movie. The director impressed me with that. public and also convey the message that not many people would have seen it coming. Some people might start talking about why nobody did anything to stop her before she did, but no one noticed her, just as no one who watched the movie did neither ... I do not know about you, but I did not guess. that she is the one who committed the suicide .. Do you have it? <br /> <br /> Greetings Jan
