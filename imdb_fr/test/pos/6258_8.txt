This little film recalls several other films, but manages to retain its own style and mood. "Troll" and "Do not be afraid of the dark" come to mind. The suspense builders were good, and just crossed the line from G to PG. I particularly liked the non-clich√©d choices with the parents; in other films, I could predict the dialogue textually, but the writing of this film allowed for better selections. If you want a film that is not disgusting but gives chills, it's a great choice.
