I am a fairly jaded white man of 55 years old. Since I do not watch television, I watch at least 250 films a year, most of them on DVD. I keep notes on all the movies I see and note them. Since December 2003, I have only seen five films as big as EIGHTEEN. So I rated EIGHTEEN better than at least 700 other recent movies. Mr. Bell is far too modest in his movie commentary. EIGHTEEN is a great movie. And that also gave rise to two "firsts" for me. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie for the first time and was completely moved while I cried, during the last half hour, something that happened to me only three times before. (Five minutes into the movie, I knew everything would be fine.) When Jason started reciting Whitman, I lost it, and then ... The Kiss. This is one of the big kisses of Film and this scene is one of the most poignant and unforgettable of Filmdom. When Pip turned off the candle at the end and the credits rolled, I applauded. I applauded. I like happy ends. I cried. <br /> <br /> Then I watched TLA's trailer and previews and thought, "OK, is this $ 800,000 or so really so big?" So, I immediately looked at EIGHTEEN again, something that had happened only three times before. And, EIGHTEEN blew my socks again, even more. Then I watched the documentary "The Making of EIGHTEEN" and was completely seduced by the cast and by Mr. Bell. <br /> <br /> So I thought I would look at EIGHTEEN again with the director's commentary. I have never watched a movie three times in one night. After the third time, at 3 am, I knew I had just had a great movie. EIGHTEENTH now ranks 10th in my Top 20 films of all time. And, in the very small universe of big gay movies or homosexual sub-texts, are Brokeback Mountain, EIGHTEEN, Mulholland Drive and Maurice. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr. Bell! EIGHTEEN is bright and fully realized, with a wonderful distribution, a wonderfully poignant and understated score, excellent cinematography, a fun song, touching, very appropriate and hummable. I can go on, but I will not let go of anything else. <br /> <br /> This film should have been nominated at the Oscars, certainly for the best film. The performances, without exception, were all wonderful. The beautiful, stifling voice of Mrs. Gill was a surprising epiphany. And Sir Ian McKellen? 'Nuf said. Awesome. <br /> <br /> EIGHTEEN is why I have traveled more than 200 mediocre films in quite horrible (some of which exceed 150 million) a year to find this treasure, this exquisite, magical , unique and enchanting "Faberge Egg", perfect, enveloping an unforgettable heart. <br /> <br /> Finally (I promise you), my second "first" - I had never posted a comment on a movie I have ever seen. Thank you again, Mr. Richard Bell! A breathtaking genius. Give $ 100 million to this man for his next movie! He won $ 700,000 in one of the 50 best movies of all time. If I had the money, I would give him $ 75,000 per year in living expenses and I would equal all the funds raised for his next film. Mr. Bell is already an excellent director at age 31. Can you imagine it at 45? <br /> <br /> Wise and spiritual, tender and brutal, posed, poignant, sober and nervous, scary and moving, bewitching, haunting, unforgettable: EIGHTEEN, THE MASTERPIE.
