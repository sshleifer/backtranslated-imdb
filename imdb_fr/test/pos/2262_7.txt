Everything is illuminated A young American of Jewish origin looking for the woman who helped his grandfather escape the Nazi persecution while embarking on a European tour with some unlikely associates. <br /> <br /> Liev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with a mischievous anguish associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually have a biographical overview of the souls under the mask-actor. We usually have a hodgepodge of genres - Check. But what we do not get in general is an original film insightful, credible, intelligent and moving. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, a curious young boy who collects pieces of his life as he goes. He is on a mission to find a woman on a photo. The sepia photo carries his grandfather (who strangely resembles him) and the woman. To make his trip easier, he uses travel guides that include Alex (Eugene Hutz), a hip hop hip-hop dancer, his apathetic and vexed grandfather (Boris Leskin), and his dog, Sammy Davis. Junior Jr! What follows is essentially a comedy. There is a simple introduction with voiceovers. Alex is particularly funny when he teaches his younger brother the year 1969, proving how popular he is with girls and break-dance, placing him in the antithesis of Jonathan. <br /> <br /> Schreiber begins to demolish the characters as they progress and the comedy acts as an intentional veil on what is a story about three Holocaust-related people who do not know each other really. All three are holding the film with tenderness and authenticity, something that Schreiber probably would not be wrong. As fascinating and fantastic as the film is, the horrors it is permissible to break through, that is to say that the past is presented in an almost pleasant tone (fortuitous music, cinematography) which makes them all the more disturbing. . <br /> <br /> When the improbable group finally finds the city they are looking for, they discover the real atrocities that have occurred and find out who they really are. <br /> <br /> The Elijah Wood is as authentic as usual and brings to the screen its usual innocence and strength. Usually a good resident of Lord of the Rings and a villain in Sin City, he plays Jonathan with a steadfast grip as he is bombarded with cultural shocks and a quest for the truth. Boris Leskin, as a grandfather, also expresses his anguish and frustration towards the young with a lot of humor and conviction while his own past is erased. However, it is Eugene Hutz as Alex who makes the show. The director used this old translation profession to create and maintain a funny and unadorned humor. <br /> <br /> Schreiber has delivered an enchanting start that has heart and soul. The continuous score and beautiful photography create a fairytale veil around a story about identity, truth and family. If there was a complaint, it would be the speed at which the film changes direction; Although it may have been intentional, it might not please everyone. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable effort that provides a great comedy and creates links between an improbable group while dissecting the horrors of the Second World War in a completely new way. <br /> <br /> -Chi & Ojo
