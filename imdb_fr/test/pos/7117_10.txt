My sister, my dad and I love D & D a lot, and one night we went to Netflix to find a movie to watch when it aired. We thought we were going to try and I ended up laughing. The writing and the game in this movie are so incredible! Wacky characters, great interaction and hilarious moments got us all the time. I love that movie! It may not make much sense to those who do not know Dungeons & Dragons, but it's still a good movie. This only shows that movies do not need astronomical budget and big actors / actresses to succeed. Check if you want a good, clean comedy.
