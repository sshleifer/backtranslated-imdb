This is an excellent family film that treats simple people who love their local interests, mostly horse racing. Lloyd Bourdelle (Walter Matthau) is a farmer who also raises local horses and has a young son, Casey Bourdelle, who loves horses. Lloyd is able to raise an adult horse he calls "Casey's Shadow" after his son. This horse beats all speed records and is a potential winner of a million dollar race. Sarah Blue (Alexis Smith) is interested in this horse and offers to buy it for 500 000 dollars. However, this horse is seriously injured in the legs and Lloyd receives a serious setback that upsets the whole family. Walter Matthau has given an outstanding performance and it is an excellent film to see and appreciate.
