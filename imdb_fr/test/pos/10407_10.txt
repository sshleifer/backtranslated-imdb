This review contains some small, but significant, spoilers. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I just watched my copy of Noroi ... <br /> <br />. ..and it was great! It may sound corny, but several times during the movie, I forgot that it was not real XD The acting is convincing, even if the game of Masafumi Kobayashi (to play, I think ...) sometimes seems a little hokey. Marika Matsumoto (Yuka in Takashi Shimizu's Rinne) seemed to change her level of credibility throughout the film: sometimes she's REALLY good, then at one point she's really lame (especially during the final exorcism and later reappropriation.) At first Mr. Hori was a ridiculous figure, a man covered in foil who believed that "ectoplasmic worms" came to eat everyone. At first, it offered an involuntary comic relief (acting as an alien extraterrestrial abduction type victim) the end has really scary scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot was very interesting and really made me wonder how everything was related. Some things are not really explained (like mass suicide in a Tokyo park). and where the boy Kagutaba was born reincarnated), but everything is going well: the end must be one of the most disturbing, if not the most frightening sequences I have ever had the pleasure of attending. <br /> In the end, Noroi is a fu A way to spend 2 hours and the new Hong Kong R3 DVD provides a picture and sound quality (the most important being the English SUBTITLES - Engrish free! ) for a superb J-Horror experience. I highly recommend picking it up.
