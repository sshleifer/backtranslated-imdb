I really liked this movie. I watched it last night on the public broadcasting system. What I liked was the fact that they deal with today's issues, neither in the future nor in the past. Some terrorists took a van or two and hired them to be car bombs. I think the film could have shown people from different countries at the same time. This shows that England, or any other country, is not prepared for an attack of the magnitude they have demonstrated. I have never heard of actors or actresses in the film, so I can not really say if they are normally part of their roles. After the movie, this group of experts asked if anything like this could happen here in the United States. It was a discussion that provoked reflection!
