It was very refreshing to watch this beautiful movie. The director continued to focus on the main subject without embarking on secondary intrigues (the doctor's family or the story of other patients in the hospital), features of the Bollywood assembly line products. He kept the story simple to understand and ensured that all actors were faithful to the characters they are supposed to represent. The grandfather's rustic manners in the clinic, the surfer's cold, unaffected behavior, the social worker's zeal, gave the film an impression of authenticity. I'm also happy that the director did not fall for the addition of songs or special effects and does not reduce it to the level of Anand or Safar. Some scenes near the end of the film, such as the boy visiting other blind children and the workplace of a blind worker, as well as the final scene where the boy applauds the sound of splashing and chirping birds make that your eyes blur. /> <br /> Many Bollywood players do not realize that Oscar committee members place more importance on the simplicity of the subject and the authenticity and brevity of the film than glamor and glamor. Shwaas is certainly a better appointment than Lagaan, who was dealing with a subject that has already been beaten to death. No member of the MPAA will suffer 4 hours of jingo drama, songs and dances. <br /> <br /> I look forward to waiting for new films from director Sandeep Sawant.
