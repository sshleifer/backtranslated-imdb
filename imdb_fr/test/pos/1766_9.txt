I was surprised, "Once again, my darling", had not generated enough votes (at the writing of this day) for a "user rating". It's a crazy comedy that I've enjoyed a lot over the years. Robert Montgomery's mission places him in very unlikely situations, and he is the man you need. He maintains his trademark "confused" throughout the film and hysterically. Ann Blyth plays her precocious / eccentric pursuer, who assumes a relationship that does not exist. His character is awesome enough to justify the unmerited nickname "Killer", but remains cute and cuddly. <br /> <br /> Among the overabundance of "B" films from the late 1940s and 1950s, "Once More, My Darling" is a standout. This one is worth looking for ....
