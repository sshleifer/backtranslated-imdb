It is characteristic that this film is not better known. It lacks most of the elements needed for a successful theatrical film: heroes, villains, conflict and resolution, romantic love interests. <br /> <br /> Here, everything is amazing, nothing works as it should, everyone is clumsy, sad, angry, hurt and hungry and nobody has the solution to anything. In short: it's war and it's hell for everyone. People try to do their best, but interests, allegiances and so-called duty interfere. The photo brings us back to the civil war with an intensity rarely seen in today's cinema. Simple honest pictures of intense beauty. The actors are very well chosen for the story and they make the characters really alive in front of our eyes. <br /> <br /> A silver dollar in a pile of nickels!
