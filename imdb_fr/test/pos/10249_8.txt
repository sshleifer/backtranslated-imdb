On the surface, COOLEY HIGH is a catchy comedy that pretends to be a vintage piece (in the early '60s, with a perfect Motown soundtrack). But there are SO MUCH things in this movie: it gets better every time I see it. The cast of unknowns (at the time) is excellent, and it is remarkable as a movie shot entirely in black that does not fall into Blaxpoitation's clich√©s - sometimes COOLEY HIGH almost looks like an urban neo-realistic film set to Sometimes there is a rather tight budget, but the constraints serve the film well: there is a certain emotion and a sincere emotion that gives the film an immediacy that is lacking in most similar films (as CAR WASH later Schultz, who was more popular, but largely useless) Warm but realistic, it could be one of the 70s sleepers - celebrated at the time, it seems that few moviegoers know this one today. Their loss - it's a very beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> The "pan-and-scan" DVD (no big screen!?!) Shows just how good this great movie is.
