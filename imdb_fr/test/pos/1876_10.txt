Okay, well, no one in their minds could pick a movie called "The Man with the Crying Brain" and expect him to be serious. It's a scandalous movie, and it means a really hokey plot, strange characters, clich√©s, overflowing action and ridiculous dubbing. For this small group of people (including myself) who loves this kind of thing, it's a jewel. <br /> <br /> The acting game is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in her character. Bruce Campbell brings a catchy and convincing performance. Her talents as a physical actress are really impressive in this film and refer to the films of "Evil Dead".
