This neo-film noir is part of the genre of American films of the late twentieth century, all of which seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a highway ribbon and, of course, many firearms worn by people who seem to never have taken the security course weapon. The actors are the best reason to see "Black Day, Blue Night". There is the late, great JT Walsh ("Swing Blade", "Pleasantville", "Red Rock West", "The Last Seduction" and many others), who has directed many neo-black films (See also " Breakdown "). Then there's Michele Forbes from the television series "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Homicide". (In a supporting role, there is even the late Bejamin Lum who also appeared in a Star Trek episode entitled "The Naked Now".) A kind of spoiler - a clue in reality: only the most innocent survive, term relative in a film like this, and you probably will not guess who is innocent before the last reel.
