Disney's first animated film without the strong involvement of Disney himself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (it is, I believe, the only animated film Disney since the 1940s that is NOT based on a book or other work, but it is rather an original story). As others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between Lady and the Tramp's novel and the story of the removal / return to 101 Dalmatians. <br /> <br /> But to remedy this problem, filmmakers have used many of the best features of most Disney animated movies of the last 10-15 years: Phil Harris (from the Jungle Book) expressing one of the main characters, follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous movie with another here with Scatman Crothers. The visual quality of this film is practically that of "Dalmatians" (with some pretty signs of French Impressionism, it seems), and the villain here (the butler) also strongly reminds the henchmen of this film. (This is probably one of Disney's less memorable villains.) The main story goes back and forth between the cats and the butler's persistent difficulties with two rural hunting dogs (with excellent vocal work by Pat Buttram and George "Goober" Lindsey ".) The various animal characters are also familiar to those who have seen" Tramp "and" Dalmatians. "The owner of the cat, while visually resembling Sleeping Beauty's wicked stepmother, presents none of the this character's character and seems very warm and generous. <br /> <br /> The real strength of the film lies in the work of the voice, after being used for the first time by famous actors of the movie The Jungle Book , the tactic is pursued with force in the veterans of Disney, Harris and Sterling Holloway of The Jungle Book and Eva Gabor (which would make a very similar character in the latest movie The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp, all excellent here, especially Harris and Gabor in the lead roles. The ation is as excellent as one might expect, showing a variety of emotions. <br /> <br /> The smaller children can be upset by some brief episodes (a flight off the trail of a high-speed train, a drowning one of the children), but these are not not presented in a particularly scary or dark way and end very quickly. Overall, there are very few more scary scenes than many other Disney classics. <br /> <br /> A minor peculiarity is the way in which certain visual aspects of the culture of the sixties are portrayed in cats who perform jazz in 1910 Paris; we can not help wondering why history is not going well in the present, apart from the fact that Paris has changed a lot since its appearance. It really would have made more sense that way. <br /> <br /> The songs, although enjoyable and sometimes very pleasantly interpreted, are not particularly memorable. Nevertheless, the general energy applied here, the excellent work of the voice and the good animation help to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses. Far from the grandeur of the "10" classics such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not quite up to the "9" that could be given to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, it is probably a question of a marginal 8 out of 10; maybe a 7.
