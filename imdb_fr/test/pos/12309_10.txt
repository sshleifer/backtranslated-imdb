James Joyce could perhaps write some of the best phrases of the English language and his short story, "The Dead", which ends his collection The Dubliners, contains "in his final" perhaps the most perfect paragraph of the version English. language. It is normal that John Huston, who tried to film this story, ended his career. Like The Red Badge of Courage and The Man Who Wants to Be King, Huston loved the literary source but made the film adaptation. And with "The Dead" (completed after Huston's death by his son, Tony Huston), we get something almost perfect in the marriage of literature and film. <br /> <br /> Valuing all that cinema can do, both commentators point out that "it's not the African queen" (it's not necessary), it's the kind of movie without compromise for the public. The portrait of an artist at school has guided us all. We must have the maturity to appreciate how much words and images can affect us. As with silent films, Huston is looking for something pure here. He works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece equal to that of Joyce. <br /> <br /> Many veterans of the Irish theater world are recruited to tell the story of a man full of self-importance (and shameless self-doubt), reinforced by the hosts of a party annual on the eve of the Epiphany Day. Gabriel Conroy waits for an evening of celebration, song, dance and poetry during which he is asked to bring his annual toast to the two sisters and their niece, hostess of the party. He is distracted by the task at hand and this distraction makes him vulnerable to an overwhelming experience that his wife sends him. While his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife's past, it's also a gift where anything that seems to have imported during the evening is washed away by the awareness of impending mortality for all those who live. <br /> <br /> And rather than trying to make the last paragraph famous in "cinematic" history, Huston intervenes and we hear these incredible words recited as we watch "the snow falling weakly into the universe and falls slightly ". This is the ideal solution for adapting a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> We simply hope for distribution. Since this is essentially a testament to the power of writing and the way it brings us together through a common experience, each performer seems to be enhanced by its role. Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy has a wide range to play and her story of a young boy who once loved him not only Gabriel Conroy, but also the audience. <br /> <br /> When I think of Anjelica Huston, it is the transformation she makes in this film; and when I think of his father, this is the film I remember first.
