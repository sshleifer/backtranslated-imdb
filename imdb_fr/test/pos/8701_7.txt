King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) of Romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with humanity. But his son, Radu (Anders Hove), is a cruel creature for his heart (which is pretty obvious as soon as you see it). Three students came to study local folklore, but found themselves attracted by the vampire legend at the wrong time: Vladislav was killed. <br /> <br /> Who can say something bad about a film featuring Angus Scrimm cameo? I can not I mean, I had little expectation after seeing other images of the Full Moon ("Puppet Master" in particular and "Demonic Toys"). But despite the very bad animated effects of the demons, this movie was actually very well done and very fun to watch. A lot of blood, a good plot and a good backdrop (the story of Bloodstone was surprisingly refreshing) and even new angles on the myth of vampires, which you think would be dead now. (Maybe I'm wrong, but it's probably the first movie to show beads from a gun.) In addition to vampires and blood, you get a share of nudity (free, but welcome ) and I must have noticed the excellent score of the composers (we do not really know who deserves, but Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis and John Zeretzka). This is Horror 101 all the way. Heck, you even have two suites, which is a sign of a real horror movie. (Of course, some bad movies also have sequels - did I mention "The puppet master"?) The Romanian theme was well done, and the film even seems to have been made by Romanians if I correctly guess their name. And the score - the music - really marked me as a good change of pace, a very relaxed atmosphere. I like Richard Band, but I'm glad another composer had the chance to play because he nailed the atmosphere on his head. If you like vampire movies and want a slight variation (one of the varieties from Eastern Europe), it's worth the detour.
