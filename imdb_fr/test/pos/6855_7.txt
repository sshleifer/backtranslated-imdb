I saw Anatomy a few years ago - doubled at a friend's house, I do not remember much, then I saw at the second store a video - there is no real connection with the first, Franka Ponte makes a small cameo. And that one was ok not as good as the first one. I see you again tonight - edition not nicknamed collectors. I really like German movies like this one, it's very interesting and people and cults like this could exist, I think, I do not know. But it's very grossly entertaining and scary. Anatomy 2 is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first one. But if you really thought that anatomy was interesting and good, you should see the second one.
