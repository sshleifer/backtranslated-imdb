I watched a lot of shorts in my day. Often, I find them either too compressed (providing too much information to the viewer in the short time they have to run), too "artistic", or lacking a clear vision. I can not say any of these things about Starcrossed. In this review, I will do my best to avoid the dramatic damage, but I also assume that the reader will understand that the theme of this film is fraternal incest. <br /> <br /> Like any short film, The story is simple enough, straightforward and easy to digest. It is clear that the film tries to highlight one of the deepest taboos of modern society. This film succeeds in all respects. In fifteen minutes of running, I found myself feeling a whole range of emotions. With only a small dialogue, the viewer is quickly drawn into the most personal moments and thoughts of these accursed brothers. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene that unfolds in their infancy, one can see the very close relationship the brothers have. When the film progresses to the present day in the next scene, the excellent acting and sincere and sincere interpretations remind the viewer that love can be born in the most unexpected and hard way. As the relationship progresses, any disgust that the viewer may initially feel is quickly replaced by sympathy and emotional distress as the viewer realizes that there can only be one solution. possible. And the consequences of this resolution are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Anyone with an open mind would do well to watch this movie and absorb his message. At the very least, he boldly and honestly challenges the viewer to re-examine some of our deepest beliefs about the taboo of incest, which is filled with shame and secrecy. Although the film only lasts fifteen minutes, it resonates long after the credits. It may be my favorite short film I have ever seen. I can not recommend it strongly enough.
