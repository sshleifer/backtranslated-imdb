Fearing that Hitler will call him back to Germany to help him prepare for the war, Zucher and his slippery assistant Heinz (Eddie Marsan) are evacuated by British authorities to a distant island in Scotland. They are entrusted with the task of building a rocket mailbox that will allow islanders to communicate with the continent. <br /> <br /> Mocked and intimidated by the inhabitants of the island, they set up home the local girl Catherine Mackay MacDonald), with whom Thomsen begins an affair, but complications arise when Germany calls. .. <br /> <br /> The central romance between Zucher and Catherine is subtle and genuinely played and the secondary cast is a colorful group with an array of famous Scottish actors, including Gary Lewis and Clive Russell. <br /> <br /> A cinematography of quality and a brilliant central song sung in the local dialect complete this film. <br /> <br /> Smart but not demanding, it's good for a quiet evening out.
