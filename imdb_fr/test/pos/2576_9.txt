I was surprised to see how much Black Snake Moan turned out to be great. Being a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson, I think I could try it. When it was over, I was stunned by the quality of this film. This film shows how the great director and writer Craig Brewer (who made Hustle & Flow another great movie) can just take anything, even something that seems to be ludacras and make it this.Well, I I like the fact that it's a good time, as if it were a film that makes it clean. Plus, I like the fact that he does not show the big steroids in the south and how he is described in things as the most disgusting place, but not this movie, it makes it very accurate and because of it's very recognizable. Quote in this movie was simply phenomenal, especially Christina Ricci (who deserves an Oscar for this role), the always so great Samuel L. Jackson and even Justin Timberlake have also done a great job. everything is great about it, and although its type of movie is not popular, it's definitely worth watching for anyone who can have a good time. Three cheers for Black Moake Moan !!!! <br /> <br /> 9.3 out of 10 stars
