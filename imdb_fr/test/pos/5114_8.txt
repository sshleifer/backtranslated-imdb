It's a very good movie with great humor. As we know, Jim Verney was very good with facial expressions and demonstrated a lot in this film. It's certainly the best of Ernest's films. I would surely recommend it to all Ernest fans. I find myself having a good taste in movies and I'm sure anyone will enjoy this movie. In the film, Ernest plays 2 roles, a villain and a good one, and interprets them quite well. I really appreciate the exaggerated type of humor where things seem impossible, like in nude movies for example, and there are many in this film. I bought this movie just after seeing it. Good achievement, good scenario, deserves to be praised.
