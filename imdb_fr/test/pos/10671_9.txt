I'm a space enthusiast, and at almost 44, I just discovered this movie for the first time. I got there in a roundabout way from Space 1999, then from UFO. I went looking for other Anderson creations and discovered that it was their first real action job. What a home run! In fact, I heard about this film many years ago, but I did not know what it was called. I am happy to have found it by accident. <br /> <br /> These Anderson were nothing less than their writing performance models quite believable and realistic, quality of the game, etc. <br /> <br /> I do not think it looks old-fashioned. Let me tell you ... I'm going to take some good old models out of CGI's damn imitation of today EVERY HOUR! Seriously, most of the rocket scenes looked real. They had it at a science! If you choose to think about what you consider to be real, it is not hard to believe. <br /> <br /> In addition, the amount of detail in the sets, the beautiful photography, the look as a whole. .. man, I wish I could go back to that time! They made good movies in the 60s. Personally, I lost interest in Hollywood movies today. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate that! Bring back the models! Think of all the people this style uses! In any case, I plague. :-) If you like good science fiction that is very well done, you will do a service by watching this.
