I watched pp the other night. I must say that I was very impressed by the reality of the film. It looked a lot like a documentary. I also think that the film has presented realistic possibilities. In the film, the war in Vietnam intensifies to the point of involving China. What if it happened? I think the scenarios would be similar to the one described in the movie. We already had camps in this country ... and we still have ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for everyone ... especially the radicals ... <br /> <br /> > I kept saying that if I was in the position that these kids were in that I would just lie to my ass. I love America and its great wars (wink wink)
