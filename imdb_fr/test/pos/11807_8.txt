There was nothing else on television yesterday afternoon, so I thought, "Okay, let's look at that." I did not know the plot and I was not expecting anything, I thought that in a few minutes, I would come back on the channel. But then, the story began to unfold and the characters were beautifully interpreted by both boys. The story had unrealistic scenes and scenes, but overall it was a very good movie. Very good to watch.
