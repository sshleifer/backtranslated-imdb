Miles O'Keeffe again assumes the role of the powerful Ator in this first sequel of the original film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - That's about B-Movie Nirvana! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the script is terrible, the acting is martial, the special effects ... well, let's not even go! - Overall, this movie is a real treat! <br /> <br /> Ator and Thong (his mute companion, not his underwear) are attacked by unseen attackers in a cave (certainly saved on the personal effects budget!), Ator fighting against what must be the most unconvincing giant snake ever engaged in celluloid and, of course, the infamous drifting fishing scene! <br /> <br /> There is a question I asked ... at the end of the film, we are witnessing a huge atomic explosion when Ator is supposed to destroy the Geometrical Core (as it says the narrator) ... how did Ator destroy him and did he manage to escape alive ?! Did he make some kind of primitive timer / detonator or something else? <br /> <br /> Well, such an illogical end only adds to the overall charm of the movies - they do not do that anymore!
