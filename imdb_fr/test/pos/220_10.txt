After reading all these reviews, I am very surprised that no one even noticed once that this show was based on the NBC's "M Squad" television series from 1957 to 1960, with Lee Marvin. I read reviews that compared it to "Dragnet". and some of Quinn Martin's police shows, but if you look at M Squad, you'll see that he's based on this movie. In the episodes of the end of the 1958 series M, Lee Marvin, who plays Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger, gets out of his car and gets shot. He pulls back, the beginning of the font is pretty much the same (including Jazz Music) and then Lee Marvin tells what's going on (Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger, M Squad, a special police department in Chicago) and in the police squad Leslie Neilsen does the same (Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin, the police squad, special division of the police department) and so on, in one of the episodes of squadron M, there is even the character of Johnny the Shoe Shiner and in an episode of squadron M entitled "More Deadly", there is an episode of the police squad entitled "A Substandard Gift (The Broken Promesse)" which is the same history!
