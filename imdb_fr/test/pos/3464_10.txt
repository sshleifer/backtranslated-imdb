If you want a movie with the full range of emotions, look for NO; dramatic and funny, and scenes of heartbreaking emotion; I can guarantee that very few people will be able to see this film warm and very human without shedding a tear from time to time. It is hard to believe that the two leaders are acting; you swear that the two young men are really suffering from muscular dystrophy (Rory) and cerebral palsy (Michael); simply two of the most beautiful performances I have ever seen; They are also two very credible characters, and you never feel that things have just been "incorporated" for dramatic purposes or to generate sympathy. In the DVD version, they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternative end) and an "extended group sequence"; It is difficult to understand why these clips were not included in the final film because they are perfectly related to the rest of the film and are by no means superfluous. But without reservation, I can recommend this movie to everyone. one of the best I have ever seen.
