'Opera' (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) Script: Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (The Church, sleepless, demons) Photography: Ronnie Taylor (A choir line , without sleep) Music: Claudio Simonetti (Phenomenon, 'Goblin') <br /> <br /> History: Betty (Cristina Marsillach) is the lining of Lady Macbeth of a very stylized staging of the opera Macbeth Verdi. Betty's time to shine comes when the star of the diva breaks her leg before opening the room when she is hit by a fleeing car. The famous curse of Macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turn when, immediately, the count of the bodies begins to increase. It seems that Betty had her first fan via a stalker who ties her up and taps her needles in her eyes to force her to witness the horrifying murders of the people around her. History: 3 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Actors: It is sometimes difficult to act in many of these Italian films. English, Italian, French, German and Spanish may all be in the same movie, as they usually speak their mother tongue, making dubbing difficult to judge. As a result, I leave them a little slack in the area. Acting: 4 of 5 <br /> <br /> Directed by: Giallo maestro Argento enters the assisted genre. 'Opera' shows it at the top of its game with an exquisite mix of gore, tension and beauty. Director: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: This film must be one of the most beautiful Argento films. Beautifully filmed by Taylor, "Opera" presents a breathtaking and inventive camera work that allows the film to turn fast and strong and keep the candy for the eyes. The camera always seems to know if it's a beautiful photo of the camera that climbs a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of the bird's eye view of the bird surrounding the crowd at the opera house. Visual: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Audio: Frequent collaborator of Argento, Simonetti (with his different groups Goblin, Demonian and solo effort) compliments the action on the screen with zeal while his score is mixes with classical reflections (Verdi) and metal. (with a little help from Brian and Roger Eno and Bill Wyman) and gives muscle to the bloody creepy screen. The sound design gives you everything you need, from stabbing to gunfire, shouting and masterful remastering on the glorious 6.1 Anchor Bay disc for every crack and crunch. Audio: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Technique: the editing allows the film to remain fluid and fluid. Combined with the work of the camera, editing helps to keep the dream surreal surrealist image. This exquisite opera is a favorite place and is perfect for staging the horror version of Macbeth. You can not finish a review of a Argento movie without commenting on the murders. Argento portrays the characters with joy this time with a brilliant sequence of punches, a raven's mouth and the nail of the film like a gun burst through a keyhole in the eye and in the back of the ball in the head that sends again the ex-wife of Argento, Daria Nicolodi to the mortuary of the film. Invaluable! Technical: 5 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Conclusion: An almost flawless giallo, which suffers from a somewhat useless epilogue in Switzerland and offers all the visual thrills that Argento fans are looking for. <br /> <br />: 4 out of 5
