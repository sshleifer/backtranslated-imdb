Hey, it's only TV. Of course, it's STAR TREK, the most beloved blah blah, and it's a great project, but it's all relative. It comes down to a guy with leprechaun ears who crackles with a sample of long-haired carpets like pizzas. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of darkness of THIRD MAN in the tunnel hunt, and it's more scary than many episodes of this is after all one of the best TV shows. The suspense is really suspensful. The danger is really dangerous. When I was little, I think I cried when Spock told me that this hideous creature was as sad, scared and horrified as the people she ate. It was one of my first lessons of empathy, reinforced by the episode of EMPATH, which was, even if it was less moving, even more melancholy. <br /> <br /> What bothered me at the age of five is that this thing looks like meat and tomato, it sort of consists of more or less rock . Now, this kind of choice may seem visionary, the idea of ​​a designer hippie of a universism through the eyes, but it could also be reminiscent of the time of the drug.
