First, let me tell you that I find that movies like Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile and most of Spielberg's movies are absolutely horrible and that the stomach turns. Although National Velvet on the surface seems to belong to the same genre and present deserving moments, I really enjoyed it, laughing and screaming throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the plot, a girl with an unknown horse from a small village entering the Grand National is certainly as unlikely as possible, but that's the only thing you must accept to make it work like a fairy tale or an allegory. The characters have depth and grow throughout the story. Ann Revere gives an absolutely staggering performance as the wisest woman ever described in an American film. His interaction with the good heart Donald Crisp is funny and sweet. While Liz Taylor makes a little too much effort to be even more cute than Margaret O'Brien (she succeeds by the way), her passion and love for her horse shine through her face. Mickey Rooney gives a wonderful, nuanced performance to the coach. <br /> <br /> It's far from being a perfect movie. Some situations and scenes are a bit dated and dated (children's antics and scenes of Rooney on the track and in the pub for example) but it does not matter. The plot remains true to the characters and leaves a little unsaid. We do not have supernatural moments that are too dramatic and predatory - sometimes more is less. The final scene is an excellent example: the emotional dialogue is left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Discreet performances, rounded characters, simplistic dialogue, intelligent and coherent scenario. We believe in the characters and are moved by their story. Yeah - they do not do that anymore ...
