This film has 4 parts and lasts about 170 minutes. It's based on the real life story of Joe Bonanno and he tells everything he's seen. So, in some cases, we can notice that we have heard about it differently. The movie makes you tie up for the chair until the end, I think it's possible to watch all 4 in a row, and do not notice that I watched 2 in a row and 2 the next day in a row . Playing in a movie is acceptable in some scenes. Awesome, but in general, it can be difficult, but this movie does not talk about actors, special effects or glamor, this show shows a real story and story. So, those looking for the same spectacular Rambo / Matrix / Titanic movie can pass this one. The good thing about the movie is that you follow the main story so that you do not have long and boring love scenes or any break with anything important for Bonanno's crime.
