Nazarin, a black and comical account of an overthrown priest, shows the economy that Luis Bunuel managed to achieve by telling a profoundly humanistic fable with a minimum of noise. This is an invaluable talent to own, with little money and extremely tight schedules. Nazarin, however, surpasses many of Bunuel's previous Mexican films in terms of acting (Francisco Rabal is excellent), narrative and theme. three years later in Spain. It concerns the struggle of the individual for humanity and altruism within a society that rejects any notion of virtue. Father Nazarin, however, is described with more sympathy than Sister Viridiana. While the latter seems to choose charity because she wants to redeem her (perceived) sins, the whole existence of Nazarin and its raison d'Ãªtre seem to be to help others, whether they like it or not. The last scenes of the film, in which he casts doubt on his behavior and must choose in a split-second between the life he led and the expected conventional life of a priest, are so emotional that they concern his integrity moral and we never know for sure whether the film remains intact or not. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable film and I encourage anyone interested in classical cinema to search for it. It's one of Bunuel's most moving films, and he sums up many of his obsessions: frustrated desire, crazy love, religious hypocrisy, and so on. certainly at the top of Bunuel's list of film productions.
