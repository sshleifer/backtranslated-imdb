Freely, from one scene to another, from one story to another, as during a walk, from a dark path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from a tree to a tree. other, how many different sounds? Like traveling, people meet and tell their story, then separate forever, who knows? And just like when you walk in these places full of lost expectations of another time, the human thickness of the world is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with friends of mine, not all they liked, maybe they were also used to ready-made stories based on scenarios, I do not know. This film is intended for stupid people who like to watch the sun shining on the sea, to walk unhurriedly in the hills or in small villages, listening to the growing grass, which tells the story of those below, six feet underneath, in the hot summer wind.
