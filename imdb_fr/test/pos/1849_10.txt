I LIKE THIS FILM !!! <br /> <br /> This beautiful and charming love story immediately attracted me to her adorable characters and her comforting romance. I became so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt I knew them personally. The scenario is very enchanting and it made me cry a few times. Duchovny and Driver have a very cute and chaste relationship in which you can not help but get involved. It's worth being watched more than once and show it to all your friends. I'm just curious why this is not a big hit? <br /> <br /> I give him a 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And this comes from a guy who thinks 9 out of 10 movies are not even worth watching.)
