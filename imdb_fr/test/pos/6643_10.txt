Shame is rather unique as a war movie (or rather quite an anti-war film) in the sense that it does not focus solely on the soldiers or the policy in question (there is politics but not how you think it would be shown), it deals with its two main subjects as the only two beings that can actually be dealt with in this brutal, decaying society they inhabit. Ingmar Bergman, in the middle of his heyday, and after two other very psychological films, Persona and Hour of the Wolf, is much more interested in seeing what effect the war has on habitually civilized beings than in bring out the worst. , and also cathartically, is a reminder of what is really crucial in life. His two main actors are frequent collaborators and friends, Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman (like the Rosenbergs), musicians living on a farm located on an island (quite close to "Wolf" when you think about it). <Br /> <br /> They see the chariots go by, and a couple of old friends have already exhausted themselves, but they try not to put it too much to heart; there is a beautiful scene where the couple speaks, rather frankly but with heart (only one shot, as we repeat in the film, perhaps to create a sense of provocation) ... Then comes the problem, including a fake propaganda film made under the threat of the Rosenbergs, the psychological agitation of being a prisoner of war and the terror of a "friend" in the army (one of Gunnar Bjornstrand's most subtle works with Bergman). Needless to say, this is not one of the easiest films to do in terms of Bergman's filmography, although for some it's one of his most accessible works. His religious themes this time are very discreet, even if the idea of ​​keeping a kind of faith permeates the atmosphere of the film. When there is a war action, it is done quickly and unconventionally (via the great friend Sven Nykvist). <br /> <br /> And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva successfully matches the context of a chaotic war. where the lines are never too sure drawn. In a way, this film, shot during the worst of Vietnam's worst times, is even more relevant today. I could not help but see chilling and uncompromising coincidences between Iraq and elsewhere with some of Jan and Eva's scenes with the fighters, or those "in charge". The very last scene, by the way, is one of the best in Bergman, all around (play, direct, enlighten). This is not the kind of picture of war (or anti-war, I find little John Wayne spirit in this production of Svensk) that I would recommend to my friends in Saving Private Ryan - it has a little more in the kinship with Paths of Glory, watching the effects of the hypocrisy of the war. But in reality, like all genre films by Bergman, this film is unique, but it's a film that will enchant many artists.
