Now, being a science fiction fan, the trailer for this movie also looked a bit, how can I say, hollywood. But after looking at it, I can say with pleasure that it impressed me a lot. Jude is a class actor and Miss Leigh does better than Delores Clairborne. This evokes films like The Matrix, 12 Monkeys and The Cell, which may seem unappealing, but it's really one of the best films I've seen.
