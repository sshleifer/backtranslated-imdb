"A Fare to Remember" is a totally derivative movie, almost ridiculous, but it has a heat that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie. It features a pretty newcomer, Challen Kates, as a very dynamic leader who, just before her wedding, has to travel from LA to Seattle to keep a client who has rejected all other presentations. She has transportation difficulties since the beginning and apparently no money. That's the first stupid thing - were there no ATMs? She must make a fortune. In any case, she meets a taxi driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless person. He leads her to her presentation and when she comes out with a huge box of dried beef (the client's product), he is there to take her home. airport. All flights are canceled. She must therefore be engaged by L.A. for her marriage. <br /> <br /> Along the way, they bond and learn from each other. It's a very nice film although there is absolutely nothing new in it - it combines "Six Days and Seven Nights" and some other films. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they are nice and the acting is good. Look for Jerry Springer at the helm of Karl Malden's dried beef company and cameo. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch during the holiday season. That's life.
