Before I looked at Freak, I had never attended a stand-up of John Leguizamo, and after seeing him recently in HBO comedy, he was better, more alive and with things that, at age 14, I did not quite understand. Spike Lee did an excellent staging job, keeping the visual angle at the height of Leguizamo's theatricality and personal narrative style; it is substance and style that blend together but discreetly. Of course, we heard Leguizamo's speeches about race and sex (the notions of sex are classic), but most of them are about the family and what I still have in mind is his father's. Even when the reality is dark in some stories, there is something new, crazy or random that Leguizamo offers to laugh, and it works more often than not. If something falls flat (for me anyway), it could be his personality twitches here and there. But overall, it's the kind of fun material that does not look gray, but is so true to itself that it stings. Find it if you can!
