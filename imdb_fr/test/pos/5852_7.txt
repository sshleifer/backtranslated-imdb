Sandra Bullock portrays a credible image as a troubled detective, although seeing her as a cynical victim, become a persecutor become maniacal, requires an act of faith (or two). Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt adequately describe the two troubled and troubled children. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of trouble getting Ben Chaplin to the equation (the same problem arose when I looked at "The truth about cats and dogs" (http: // us. imdb.com/title/tt0117979 /) I mean, when you put an Englishman in an American movie, should not there be at least a reason to put him in there? Should not there be a history leading to the fact that an Englishman is serving a detective in an American police force? Should not there be a dialogue highlighting and explaining this rather obvious fact? Or even some jokes about him being this English? <br /> <br /> It seems out of place here, it looked out of place in "The truth about cats and dogs." Producers must really be aware of it, it distracts and annoys the public (at least me.) Nothing wrong with playing Chaplin, it's just a matter of making an actor who is "moved" credible and not putting it that leaves without a good reason or a scenario. <br /> <br /> The film itself: well, thrillers, especially those who are dealing with a complicated crime, must suspend disbelief. This one is no different. in reality, it takes a little more effort than usual. In order to make Bullock smart enough to solve the case despite all the pressure to let go, unrealistic assumptions about the evidence were made, and I'm sure many of those who watched them had a few moments. "Go, it's very unlikely in the circumstances" or even "Hey, you can not dismiss evidence like that to pack this movie!" <br /> <br /> As I said: quite entertaining and listenable. Just do not use this as a visualization required for detective exams. There are no shortcuts there.
