The Residents is a group known for its strange appearances and strange musical styles. It is therefore obvious that their video clips will not be quite normal. In fact, these little videos are abnormal and weird, but have a huge artistic value for them. The atmosphere is built with lighting and reflective visuals. It's an excellent viewing experience. <br /> <br /> By and large, Icky Flix consists of many resident video clips designed for their songs. The music itself goes from rock to synthesized music that resembles that of a horror movie of the 80s. What does not change is the quality of these videos. They are great! <br /> <br /> All fans of art movies will love this. They are so original with their visuals and the angles in which they are filmed. The lighting makes them particularly interesting. The music is scary and catchy and very original, and these shorts are mini-classics that deserve to be viewed several times. It's an almost perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My note: **** on ****. 56 minutes
