'Heaven's Gate' is not a masterpiece, which apparently was what it should have been on the first outing to justify its huge cost and, more importantly, the fact that Hollywood remained uncomfortable relying on the Author movie model. Yet "Heaven's Gate", which we finally see today on DVD in 229 minutes, is a superb film. It's a bit lethargic in the rhythm. But at least it's rhythmic. Regardless of the incompetence of the construction that characterizes many films today, there have been many that, deliberately in their form, have been severely damaged by the fact that they were cut without regard to the rhythm, so that the movies become shapeless and confused. Beyond this, the criticisms addressed to the film have become retrospectively rather lame. If the good guys and the bad guys are too blatantly pronounced for a serious movie, and yes, Sam Waterston's villain wearing fur and mustache is a comic-opera (and not the multi-level way Bill The Butcher of "Gangs" of New York "), and yes, the city-dwellers sometimes seem a little" Fiddler On The Roof ", then dozens of serious films made since, including" Titanic "and" Graceless "," Cold Mountain "(which has some similarities and which is remarkable lack of convincing qualities compared to this film) can be blasted for the same reason. <br /> <br /> Also, despite the accusations, the film has a plot, a plot quite well tried to that. He simply does not want to give in to the standard "epic" quality, providing the Titan Heroes, subplot rafts and confusion. He is experimenting with a way of telling more like much smaller, more modest films, with carefully captured moments of character interaction and community-like pageant explosions, such as with the Harvard overture and, more specifically, , the wonderful scene. where the people of Johnson County, like a brilliant-looking fiddler, party on roller skates. <br /> <br /> "The Deer Hunter" was a critical and commercial success, but abandoned the mosaic inspired by the first half - as an accumulation of details, and I think in a similar way to the criticism of the novel of Robert Penn Warren "All Men of the King" and his dictionary of the Jacobian cascades, if Cimino had not had such an understanding of the conventions of the Hollywood epics, he could have achieved a rare and particular work of art based on a honest viewing of people in their community. On the other hand, "Heaven's Gate" manages to empty its narrative momentum and tension in a slowly expanding arc, until the explosion of the finale, without abandoning the mosaic approach. <br /> <br /> The central romantic triangle, for example, resists standard inflections; James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) is an honest, intelligent, but psychically defeated man who rivals a young gunman, Nate Champion (Christopher Walken), who has identity issues and identity challenges. The hand of a young woman, Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert); there are no unconscious leaps, no slaps, recriminations or typical moments of sadness, but rather a sad and distanced decision of Ella to choose the young man she loves least because he is ready to make the commitment. Ella appears as the real hero of the film (Huppert's performance, although initially embarrassing, is really excellent, balancing a dewy emotionalism with a hard spirit), trying first to save Nate, then to gather the group of resistance of immigrants in an enterprising defense. Afterwards, Averill gets stung when friends die. Indeed, overcoming so many snapshots of clich√©s and style, Heaven's Gate successfully and deliberately eliminates the note of grace of the defeated foreign heroes of so many westerns of the 70s and portrays a possible event, vigorous and comforting. to a compromised victory but still savored. <br /> <br /> The social conflict of so many Westerners in the 1970s finally hardens to become a war in its own right; As the capital attempts an overwhelming final victory over the miscreants who stand in its way, they suddenly discover a massive and more powerful people's army, led by the man who played the very destroyed Billy the Kid a decade ago. This is what led the film to be described as the first Western Marxist, but in reality, it simply deflower a theme of the genre that existed well before the 60s. Old school works as diverse and classic as "The Westerner "by William Wyler and even" Shane "tell terribly similar stories. It is only here that the romantic myth of the armed bandit has been replaced by the romantic myth of the revolt of the people. In a spectacular, exciting yet realistic and chaotic finale, the Cattlemen's Marauding camp is attacked, surrounded by dust clouds punctuated by fallen horses, twisted bodies and shots. Averill finally puts his classic education to work by stealing a Roman trick and bringing the Cattlemen to the verge of annihilation before they are saved by the Cavalry (another seditious but certainly not so shocking touch after the relentless description of Little Big Man in American Indian massacres). In reality, it is difficult to think of a more heroic vision of American-style popular resistance. The film's only break-even point is a useless coda indicating Averill's possible recidivism, a rather punk tragedy. <br /> <br /> Despite some failures and a slow middle part, "Heaven's Gate" is a supreme work, a genuine attempt to create a contemporary western and a new kind of epic. If it is necessary to join again the chorus which estimates that Cimino was absurd in its behavior on the set and its expenses, it is with regret. When, today, flops like "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" and "K-19 - The Widowmaker" see nearly a hundred million dollars flowing in the water, yet a label of infamy is still hanging on this film, one wonders sinister death meant. The original-style attempt, the debauchery of sexuality, the hard-won sense of detail, the breathtaking rigor of the film and what's filmed contrast with what is sorely lacking in so many contemporary Hollywood products.
