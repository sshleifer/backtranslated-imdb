Dallas Stars: Gary Cooper, Ruth Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. It is directed by Stuart Heisler, the photograph is by Ernest Haller and the pen fell on John Twist. Produced by Warner Brothers, Dallas is filmed in bright Technicolor colors at California's Iverson & Warner ranches. It's really a film that has the tongue in your cheeks, the film is a return to the westerns of yesteryear that exist without pretensions or sense of deep penetration. <br /> <br /> The plot sees Cooper's renegade in the Civil War, Blayde "Reb" Hollister, simulates his own death in order to kill his reputation and free himself to pursue in Dallas the brothers who massacred his family. Twist's plot is actually a fun and exciting plot. There are role reversals, dandy modes, horse chases, shootouts, a love triangle, a vigorous dialogue and clever little twists to prevent the piece from just painting it with numbers. which further improves the welfare factor offered. It is true that he is not really asked to do more than to be a laconic dude on a mission. But when called to play action roles, he delivers the goods that his fans expect during his successful career. The villains entertain {especially the vicious and naughty Steve Cochran and Bryant Marlow} because they each have their own small peccadillo to protect them from the usual blandness. The two ladies in the room look beautiful and hold out in machismo, while the high production value allows Haller to really treat the eyes with the lush technicolor and involving camera work around the premises. <br /> <br /> is ideal to be a list. Oater does Dallas, something she simply can not achieve. But it's not for lack of trying and the end result is pure entertainment, which, in truth, should be enjoyed on cold winter days, when the viewer needs to take me back. 7/10
