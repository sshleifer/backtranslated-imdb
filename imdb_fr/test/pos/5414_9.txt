This film is full of little surprises, mostly funny. The fact that it is written and directed by a young man of 24 years shocks me. Some of the scenes where high school students use ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because I have a child of that age and I could see her using it. As a parent of a teenager, I found that the representation of the interactions between parents and children was perfectly accurate. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the many small jokes of the film and the fact that everything is not perfectly logical. and all the problems were not solved at the end. To paraphrase Mark Twain, the truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction is necessary to stick to what is possible, while the truth is not. <br /> <br /> It's a film that plays with the viewer, allowing us to believe that people are what others think, but only to allow us to realize later that the people we had supposed to have reason were completely ignorant of the real situation. One of the strongest scenes in the film, a scene where we feel very relieved and sympathetic about what the character does, turns out to be based on a totally false assumption, and the character, though admirable , is totally wrong. It's very subtly done, I think. Very realistic. </ P> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> </ p> p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> The score of the movie has a lot of positive moments, and the background music helps to establish. <br /> <br /> The farewell speech is a joke and a half - had a big laugh! The movie is really in my head right now - I saw it this morning. I will try to see him again, weather permitting. Dozens are hard to find, but a solid nine in my book.
