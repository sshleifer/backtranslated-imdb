Giorgino is a long and painful journey worse and worse in the life of the character who gave his name to the film. Young soldier of the First World War demobilized and poisoned by gas, very fragile in the field of health, who was formerly a doctor in an orphanage for children suffering from mental disorders, goes in search of their new location and discovers much more than all that he intended a different nature. A depressed atmosphere of ultimate despair, where fools are much less horrible than healthy people, where madness is a kind of poetry, will keep you hypnotized from the very first pictures of this film to the last. And all the beauty: the beauty of winter and the mountains, the beauty of snowy landscapes and wild woods, I do not even know how all the sorrow and sadness of the last days of the war could be made so beautiful.
