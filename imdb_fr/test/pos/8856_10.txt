Following the lines of the classic formula to the point of making another leap into the material, The Thing's remake became one of the coolest remakes of his day. John Carpenter comes out of what must have been a rather vague (or perhaps very descriptive who knows) scenario, producing incredibly miserable and brilliant puppets and animatronics from Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team) . These effects help set the tone for the hard and loose environment that Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film tells the story of a group sitting in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, opposed to a malicious force that takes the form of others. The choice of tones and surprises of Carpenter gives him all his life. For those following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more confidence and talent in making the film than most of them have the chance to play again with an old movie. <br /> <br /> With the special effects working to the maximum - in the middle of what could follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become excessive, but everything goes into suspense after a while) - the actors train as a beautiful ensemble. Unlike the Predator team, they are usually just regular job guys, the leader coming from MacCreedy from Kurt Russell (very good role for his style, excellent actually). Juicy support roles are up for Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it's refreshing to see how the kind of nonsense of what's happening in the movie (an alien who starts with dogs and then moves on to others in a form of gore and demented transformation) goes against such timing tone with everyone. I loved the long silences sometimes, with Ennio Morricone's phantasmagorical and curious music in the background (and this bass line is equally deserving). <br /> <br /> This is tantamount to being, if nothing else, to deliver what he aspires to his genre / public cult. He remains one of the best carpenters; A rare species of horror film where the story is told clearly and precisely through the position of the camera, the dialogue and the timing with the scenes. This does not mean that the film is not full of violence, it's true, and in fact, it's twice as funny. But since this goes back to what seems ridiculously like a bygone era, the creatures / makeup, as well as the regular and well-calculated script, were made completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a T.
