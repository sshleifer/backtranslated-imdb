I saw this film when it came out for the first time and I really enjoyed it. Which movie I'm in my forties and I have two teenage children. I would like to see them see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a love movie or an older Elton John music. <br /> <br /> I consulted most stores selling old and new movies, but having found none. <br /> <br /> I bought old movies like "Melody" in Hong Kong, which had a collection of old movies, but they did not have any. <br /> <br /> I also look at the rest, Paul and Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me how to get a copy of the VHS, DVD or VCD. <br /> <br /> really appreciate. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
