I really like this show. There is drama, romance and comedy at a time. I'm 28 years old and I'm a married mother, so I can relate to both Lorelei and Rory's experiences in the series. I'm watching Family Channel reruns lately, so I'm not aware of what's going on right now. I think women would love this show more than men, but I know some men would like it! I really like that it lasts an hour and not half an hour, because the time seems to pass when I look at it! Give a chance if you have never seen the show! I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters in the series, mainly because of the way they look alike. How could you not see that there was something (or take as much time to see it, I guess I should say)? <br /> <br /> Have a nice visit!
