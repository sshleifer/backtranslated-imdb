Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was very kind and I really fell in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best film of my youth. Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster's "Season's Rise" sings in my head forever ... Please, if you know where I could find a VHS of the movie, send me an email !! My 26 year old husband and I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend at the time and continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes. I think we may have been drawn to the movie by Elton John's music, but then we were swept away by teenage anxiety. Paul and Michelle were about our age when we saw the movie, so very easy to identify! It's wonderful to hear that Sean is doing well, I'm also in the "helping professions" (a nurse). I thought his performance was good and very believable. "Michelle" seemed very sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main theme is that if they did not have to deal with the "real world" then they could be happy and continue to love. How many times have we all wanted to have just one "Calgon moment". If we did not have any outside concerns and could only deal with our "basic needs", it might be a little easier. I have a 15 year old daughter and I would have no problem seeing her film. Children see so much worse these days that it's very tame. For those of you trying to locate the CD, my husband (a big fan of Elton John) was able to get a 2 CD game released in 1992. His name is "Elton John-rare masters", Polygram studio . This has all the songs of friends, as well as many others. As far as we know, this is the only CD containing the "Friends" music. We also had the record a few years ago and we were delighted to find it. Good luck. I recommend this film to anyone who loves the theme of "young love". I only wish it is on DVD now !!
