It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Jason Shepherd, a 14-year-old boy, wrote an article in English entitled "Big Fat Liar". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to school on time and hit a limousine. When he entered the limo, he met a famous Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limousine, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie! When Jason admitted that he had left his paper in the limousine and that Marty had taken it, his parents and his English teacher did not believe it! Jason and his friend Kaylee had to travel to Hollywood to Hollywood and admit to Marty that he stole his story from Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to call his father for Marty to steal this paper, Marty trapped him and burned his paper! Jason was so angry that Marty burned that newspaper, so Marty called for security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kaylee realized that Marty was not going to admit the truth. In order to take Marty in Phase 2: The Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put a permanent blue dye in the pool and when Marty jumped, his body turned blue and he did not go out! Then they put permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo and when he uses it, his hair turns orange and they do not come off too! Finally, they put a lot of glue on Marty's headset so that he calls Jason's father and when Marty uses it, it sticks in his ear! It was funny when Marty's hair and body became blue and orange and his helmet was stuck to his ear! After that, they tricked Marty into telling Marty's assistant Monty that Duncan had moved to a house where a party was taking place. When Marty went to see Duncan, he was in the wrong house and all the children of the party beat him! When Marty was home, Jason and Kaylee exchanged orders for his car. When Marty drove his car, he knew that all the controls were switched and he did not know which button to press. He's stupid enough to crack. When Marty hit the back of the potato masher, he destroyed his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts calling Jason's father and cheating on him again! He was on the phone, but it was not his father, he called security! Once the security services took Jason and Kaylee out of the Marty site, they suggested they go home. Monty was going to be on the side of Jason and Kaylee, knowing that Marty was a liar and a fool, so she informed Rocco, one of the security agents, that she would take care of the children. Jason told his father the truth about what he had been doing for two days and had invited his parents to go to jail. When Monty speaks to children, she will help them move on to Phase 4: Return on Investment. Jason divides the crew into 3 teams for Phase 4. A team will entertain and deceive Marty until his parents arrive on the board. Marty first raced with Frank Jackson, but his car broke down, so he rode with Jaleel, but he took him to the desert and left him there. When Marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. After that, one of the blades is stuck, so Marty and the pilot get off the helicopter. After that, he was on the way to the plateau and when Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw what Jason had: his monkey! So Marty went after Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester, he released the water and when the water came in, it repelled Marty. Marty was still looking for the kids and when Kaylee went the other way, Jason led Marty to the top of the building. At the top, Jason challenged Marty to admit the truth and Marty will never tell the truth. When the crew caught Marty, all the people, including Jason's parents on the set, knew what Marty had done. Marty was going to kill Jason but the only way for him to escape is to jump up! After that, his parents thought him that Marty had taken his story. When the people who were on the set left, it's the end of Marty. At the end of Jason's story, Big Fat Liar was a movie. I can not get enough.
