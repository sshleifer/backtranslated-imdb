You have to love the western world of spaghetti. The vision of a west where good guys are slaughtered without warning, nasty cartoonists make up the landscape very closely, and the anti-hero moves away from the girl at the end. Many people say that Corbucci's films are "depressing". I find it a little risky with regard to descriptions. I think that dark and ruthless things are more apt especially because "depressing" suggests a sentimentalism almost ignored by all Eurowestern filmmakers in favor of painting characters in broad strokes. <br /> <br /> GLI SPECIALISTI must be seen in all its splendor of wide screen before he can occupy his rightful place in the barrel of Sergio Corbucci. It's a beautiful movie. And it is logical that Corbucci wanted to let off steam with COMPANEROS after the formidable punch of THE GREAT SILENCE and this (although it comes back later to its usual tricks with SONNY AND JED). There is still a certain caricature that weakens the overall sadness of the film, but it is more painful than having a useless inclusion of three children dressed as hippies who hang out in town in search of gold and problems. And it is painful that Mario Adorf plays the bandit with a Mexican hand El Diablo as unconditional as he always plays his characters. <br /> <br /> These small minor reproaches aside, there is more than enough to wet the palate spaghetti aficionado. Shootings galore, the population of an entire city reduced to crawling naked in the mud, the iconic badassitude typical of the laconic antihero (played by Johnny Halliday), the moral bankruptcy of almost all the characters in the film. Corbucci may never receive the applause of the most famous Sergio or American patriarchs of this kind, but you and I know it's a blatant injustice for a very talented director. His choice of dynamic shots, in-depth staging with sticky objects near the camera and retreating into the background, his flair for a fast pace and feverish energy to move a story that does not has not always been so long, his way of photographing open spaces, everything in his work, I'm sure that if Corbucci was American and had emerged 15 years later with Mann and Hawks, the critics of the Cahiers du Cin√©ma would have rented him as an author worthy of serious criticism.
