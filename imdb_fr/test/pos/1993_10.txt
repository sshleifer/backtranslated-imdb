Who should watch this movie? If you have already taken acid, read Philip K. Dick, consider that Matrix matrix is ​​preferable to special effects, is interested in philosophy or likes to see his perception of reality disturbed. This film made me laugh out loud, just because it was so outrageous and so stupid. This movie is great. This film is cool. It's better than Matrix, by far (I did not fall asleep in Existenz, for a kickoff: the action / special effects movies annoyed me, and despite a plausible philosophical glossary, that's exactly what what is the matrix). Existenz is disgusting, disturbing and fun. David Cronenberg has done some glitzy stuff (Rabid) and some engineering work (Videodrome is another site to discover, as is the adaptation of Stephen King, The Dead Zone). But it's one of my favorites of all time. I do not remember the end, which is a good thing, because it means I can watch it again. Or maybe I have never watched this movie at all. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe that's really what happened to me. I do not know. In any case, it is now perfectly integrated with my illusion of reality, and I am happy.
