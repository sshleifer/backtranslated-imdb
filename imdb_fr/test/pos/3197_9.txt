Awww, I love it! The tale of the cat and moon does not really need a synopsis, because that's what it is ... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's art that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short film entitled The Fan and the Flower which won an Oscar (2005) ... yes, it's almost the same, which leads me to believe that it could be a scam . <BR /> <br /> But it's a very good short film, with striking black and white shapes that transform and transform into beautiful movement and poetic seduction ... If you think cats are a poetry in motion, see it and you will believe it more. <br /> <br /> In addition, its end is so touching. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
