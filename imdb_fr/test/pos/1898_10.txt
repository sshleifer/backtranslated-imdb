Yes, it's one of the biggest of the kind of black action. A confusing mix of racist comedy and racist violence (sometimes reaching a troubling tone, even for a fan of the genre), this movie is not your Shaft in the park. Great clips from Rudy Ray Moore's comedy do not seem fun, at least not to a white boy like me, but they are great in their context. Much better than his sequel unlike, "The Human Tornado"
