This film will bring you a rich experience. <br /> <br /> This is the seemingly simple story of a talented student, Yiu Kwok, who will later become a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married and has two sons, and things at home seem normal. After twenty years of marriage, he still loves his wife and his sons fill him alternately with pride (the oldest) and disappointment (the youngest). <br /> <br /> His passion for poetry makes him an object of craze for a senior student in one of his classes. The student, Choi Lam, draws pictures of him during class, significantly, one of them with a flower coming from his mouth. She teases him more with his intelligence than his sexuality, although it is also an element. Of course, he is not immune from his attention, although he tries for a moment to maintain the line of demarcation between the teacher and the student. <br /> <br /> The reason he does not succeed in the end is complicated. First, the communication between him and Choi Lam is very deep. It becomes clear that she really loves him and it is mutual. Secondly, there is a long-standing problem in his marriage that comes to light when an old friend of his wife and wife get sick. The consequences of the wife's involvement with this friend, past and present, are almost too sad to bear. <br /> <br /> Nothing is treated trivially in this film. All characters have a living internal life and an easily discernable story. The two leaders, Jacky Cheung and Anita Mui, are remarkable, as are Karena Lam, student of Choi Lam, and Shaun Tam, the eldest son of On Yin. <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservation.
