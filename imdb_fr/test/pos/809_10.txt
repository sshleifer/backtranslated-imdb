In a better civilization, this film and many other films by David Suchet would be shown in cinemas. The intrigues are fabulous (no, I do not know who did it, but the clues were there if I had been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the amazing production values, the cast of actors (from Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Anthony Lysette, Megan Dodds and of course David Suchet (Hercule Poirot) are just perfect, the dialogue is wonderful, the music and the sense of suspense and tension are wonderful things. <br /> <br /> One of the pleasures of Hercule Poirot's movies for a man is how many beautiful women play here, we have two: the sexy curvy Megan Doods and the gorgeous Lysette Anthony. <br /> <br /> You really can not go wrong by renting these rooms - they are just fantastic - like the most beautiful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind is constantly working because all there is and you struggle but keeping your mind constantly thinking, you can follow everything - and the settings are beautiful. <br /> <br /> I can not Think of movies that stimulate thought more than those films by Hercule Poirot / David Suchet. It's impossible to praise it too much - and I've never seen one before or read Agatha Christie.
