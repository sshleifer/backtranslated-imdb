Men's Rififi is a brilliant film that studies criminal minds and allows viewers to better understand criminals who are fundamentally no different from ordinary people like us. What director Jules Dassin shows is that criminals have families. That's why they adhere to a strict code of honor. For them, a family is not just made up of wives, mistresses and children, but also casual acquaintances and close friends. Contrary to what many people may have difficulty believing, Jules Dassin did not seek to glorify crime in his film, as the clear claim that crime never pays. He shows that all kinds of bad activities lead to a sort of human loss. Apart from his philosophical position, Rifif deserves to be watched for his technical finesse. Looking at one of the most brilliant sequences of the film on the breaking of a safe, it would be hard to believe the meticulous precision with which criminal minds execute their plans. It's a scene that no one has dared to copy to Hollywood.
