I am happy that it is the work of foreign filmmakers because we can not accuse him of unfair partiality. For no reason, the Jacksonville cops rush to judge and choose the first black suspect to blame for the murder of a foreign white tourist. They chose a 15 year old. old kid who is almost as close to a saint as you might find at random and then ridicule himself by trying to put an unlikely case against him. In addition to the injustice resulting from flagrant prejudices, there is the sentence of six months of unjust imprisonment of a perfectly innocent black teenager. It is questionable whether, as a society, we should compensate those who are accused, imprisoned and found innocent. This docudrama is well produced, professionally recorded and presented in captivating packaging from which you will not want to take a break of a minute. If you care about social justice, do not miss this one. He certainly deserved his Oscar.
