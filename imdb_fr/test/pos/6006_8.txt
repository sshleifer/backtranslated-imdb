I saw this for the first time when I was a teenager in my last year of college. I was riveted to that! I loved the special effects, the fantastic places and the narrative method of story based on the test and the flashback. Several years later, I read the book. Although it was interesting and I could really see what Swift was trying to say, I think that although it is not as perfect as the social commentary book, the movie is better than a story. It makes more sense to have a long adventure than to bring back Gulliver after each trip and make a profit by selling the tiny Lilliput sheep or something like that. <br /> <br /> It's even more striking when everyone thinks they're crazy and the sheep make a cameo anyway. As a side note, when I saw Laputa, I was stunned. This is very similar to the zeal of the video game Chrono Trigger (1995) which also made me love this miniseries even more. <br /> <br /> I saw him about 4 years ago and realized that I have always loved him so much. Very high quality and start of an excellent series of mini-series Sweeps for NBC, followed by the solid Merlin and the interesting Alice in Wonderland.
