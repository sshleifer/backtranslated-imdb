This film is about a teenager struggling with his social status at school. He is a "good Christian" and feels that he misses all the pleasures of high school. He therefore wishes never to become one. After realizing his wish and having tried a mundane lifestyle, he realizes that his quality of life has been considerably reduced and wants to become the person he once was. Good family oriented movie with a positive message: be proud of who you are even if you are not the most popular.
