Finally, I watched this shocking film last night, and what a disturbing spirit are incredibly bloody and unforgettable scenes, and a total onslaught on the senses. It looks like a film of the spirits of Lynch (especially ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit and even a bit of "Begotten". What this guy does to his pregnant sister is amazing, but again, is this really happening or is it the brains fighting on both sides of his brain? This is the main theme of this work of art: to draw a delicate dividing line between fantasy and reality, and what would happen if the right side of the dreamy and fantasy brain went beyond logical reasoning and the left side. And the music of this film is incredible, a kind of absolutely perfect electronic score. Even though this movie is totally shocking and quite disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard core sex) that you'll ever see in any movie, I saw it as a work of art and I I loved And this music always surprises me, I must try to find the soundtrack if it is available. Watching "Subconscious Cruelty" is a real event, and the viewer will not easily forget it. And a note to gorehounds, it's a must-have. <br /> <br /> Caution ... Be careful when buying this movie, as some prints are fogged on the graphic and extremely gory sex scenes, especially the movie copies. Japanese release.
