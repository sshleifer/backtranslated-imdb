"Do not look in the basement" is so easy to hit, but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horror's true underground stars and that my humble opinion is really late. "Do not" is his undisputed masterpiece. This disgusting psychodrama immediately drives the viewer into a world of transpiring madness so strange, disjointed and claustrophobic that you have no real idea of ​​what is happening. It manages to make you feel strangely filthy, just dirty, because Brownrigg's world is that crazy, unwashed and disgusting prison cell, made up of delusions, obsessions and all the nuances of mental illness. And he uses his low-budget palette to wrap his boot blanket around you like a bad memory. There is just something so wonderfully strange in this damn thing. In a nutshell, classic ... Similarly, if you first look at "Do not", you'll get an idea of ​​the crazy psychodrama style that characterizes Brownrigg's other films. In summary, they are really no more esoteric than these - well, in fact, they find "Keep My Grave Open" by Brownrigg. Crazy genius. Do not accept any substitute.
