Despite all the comparisons with House of Frankenstein, this film surpasses its predecessor and is one of the most entertaining monster movies in the Universal Monsters series, and unfortunately the last. Okay. so it does not really correspond to anything like Frankenstein's Bride as a classic to venerate fans of all movies, but with a cast of Dracula, The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster (What? No Mom?) you can not help but enjoy this schlock party! And unlike House of Frankenstein, the monsters in this movie interact a lot more. But this film also features unique stories for Dracula and the werewolf, both of whom go to Dr. Adleman for treatment. While the werewolf actually finds a cure, Dracula injects his blood into the doctor and that's when the real fun begins! I highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. But remember, I never said it was good, just fun.
