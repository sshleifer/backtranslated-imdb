I saw this piece of perfection :-) during the filmfest fantastic in Berlin and when I came out of the cinema, I wanted to be "drugged"! I have seen a lot of movies, but there are some that I would call perfect, like koyaanisqatsi or fight cruelty against the sub-conscious club, it's definitely one of them !!! half of the people are out of the projection in berlin and i can understand them absolutely! This is not a film for "normal" people with dreams and illusions! a person who lives from day to day in his dreams and who does not want to see all the horror of our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this movie! if anyone reads this now who saw s.c. and also thinks it's great: contact me - so far I have not met anyone who shares my opinion - it's cool !!! this film wins 10 points out of 10 !!! finally I am really sorry for my bad English - I am not a student !!! (und das ist au gut so * g *)
