after the birth of my daughter in 1983, I needed to lose weight. I tried the 20 minute workout and was hooked. I lost about 50 pounds. it was the most weight I ever lost in my life. I can not believe this show is forgotten. it would be a blessing to start a cable channel only for exercise and to include the 20-minute workout. I think it was the best training video ever made. I wish I could buy it one way or another. the routine was easy to learn and you worked a lot. the training they have today is too complicated and too difficult to learn. Do your best to make this video available again. I pray that it will be a blessing for all who see it and use it.
