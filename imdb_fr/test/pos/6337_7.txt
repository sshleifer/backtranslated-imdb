Episode # 13 of the television series "Supernatural" (excuse the incredibly cheerful terminology) moves Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri where they were summoned by a former Dean flame to investigate a series of mysterious murders occurring in their little city ​​. In the end, a big truck with an invisible driver devours African Americans on a desolate road ... As Dean tries to revive his past love story, more and more city-dwellers are on the road. The cause seems to be due to a racial incident in the 1960s, which left a frustrated redneck spirit in ghostly limbo, seeking to kill black motorists. "Route 666" is another good album (which is not uncommon, I noticed) that contains some notable aspects related to the pair of main characters such as Dean getting laid in the air and Sam's confessed regret to have left the university. The killer truck does not seem to be the most terrifying thing in the world, though, for a one-hour show, it does its job well. Not a fantastic episode, but a solid concept with more horror film references.
