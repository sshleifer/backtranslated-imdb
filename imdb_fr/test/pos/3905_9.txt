I remember watching a movie from Elizabeth Montgomery when I was maybe 5 years old (and even though) and, to this day, I remember that movie (in pieces). it's the movie I remembered all my life because I was so scared. I think I remember the story and the house was constantly dark. The main part that was the scariest for me was Elizabeth walking in the house all night and then there was someone in the field outside. At the time, I thought I was an old witch, but the memory is now very vague, so I do not really remember who it was, but it was someone who was hiding in a field outside ... and that's what scared me the most. I really wish I could see this movie again. if anyone knows how to get a copy, email me at valid908@yahoo.com
