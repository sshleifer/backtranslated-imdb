I found it to be a Western Spaghetti (also known as DEAD OR ALIVE), underestimated and convincing. Despite modest references (apart from the co-writer / versatile producer Albert Band, the composer Carlo Rustichelli is the only member of the team), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three American stars (the newcomer, Alex Cord , is an ambiguous anti-hero.), while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan confer a mythical quality on the procedure) as well as an unusual plot (involving a crippled protagonist, an amnesty ruse covering a strategic cleansing of the city, and who finally did the law ... artillery shooter against a horde of Mexican bandits). <br /> <br /> Several challenging action scenes are waiting for you ?? the film is crowned by a tremendous climax in which the trio of stars is besieged in a flaming cabin ?? plus some scandalous moments that are a hallmark of Spaghetti Western: from the middle of the street, Cord sees an armed man hidden at the window, reflected in a bottle of whiskey; a man who helps Cord run off is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the wicked. Nicoletta Machiavelli also makes a good impression as a villager where Cord lodges; the support distribution is then dotted with familiar faces (so largely anonymous) ?? All were essentially genre scenes. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of the fact that the version of the film dubbed in English on MGM / UA DVD R1 was cut off: bad weather was badly shot to be written on the back cover ; the film was only 99 minutes and not 118 ?? apparently, Cord's character is killed in the longest Italian version!
