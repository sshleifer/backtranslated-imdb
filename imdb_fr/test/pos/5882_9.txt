Although the wonderful soda counter in the local pharmacy no longer exists, and the clothes are really immediate l946, the post-war vintage and the good and the bad are easy to understand, and <br /> <br These old planes are really old-fashioned, this movie will never be out of date. <br /> <br /> Adjustments and human problems after the war, the beautiful love stories <br /> <br />, the dramatic game (notably Harold Russell and <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews) are moving today in 2002 as in l946. <br /> <br /> I was one of the young women who welcomed our wonderful <br /> <br /> veterans home after the Second World War. Like so many others, my memories <br /> <br /> of war and homecoming are as fresh today as if they had <br /> <br /> occurred yesterday - this film is very relevant for our time.
