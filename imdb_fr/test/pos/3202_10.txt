This movie blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the riot in Attica prison. After watching this, I see that I did not know anything. The story is told through the relationship between the lawyer and the black inmate. The personal story of these two men and the drama unfolding in front of the courtroom were fascinating. The flashback sequences in the prison were great. It's hard to believe that it was not a documentary film, it was so real. It was not just a big drama, it was an incredible lesson from an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper. I give him two inches.
