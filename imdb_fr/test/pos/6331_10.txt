Although it is not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word, this film is more rewarding than any film that is full of laughter, but devoid of substance. I do not think that Bergman's films can be easily categorized into narrow genres, even the lightest ones are quite complex. Despite its lightness, this film poses a series of problems related to marriage and its defects, as well as what happens when the flames begin to die, etc. But the mood of the film is extraordinary, you almost want it does not end. I must admit that I was swept away by the Bergman of the 1950s, who learned about most of his efforts, which took place afterwards. Before Nykvist, von Sydow, Ulman, etc., the master produced some of the richest, warmest and most touching films I have ever seen. Although it is a long shot, I saw this kind of love for the human race, in its complexity, only in Fellini's films of the same period. A love lesson alongside the smiles of a summer night is worth the detour for Bergman fans, to get a full picture of man's abilities and for those who love cinema with heart. May he rest in peace!
