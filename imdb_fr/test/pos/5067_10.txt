To solve a difficult problem, you must start by asking the right questions. Without these, even the largest library of information is useless. That's exactly what this movie does - where other movies guide your thinking through a screenplay, this film draws on your emotions and your understanding of justice and what is allowed. These questions will bother you all the way, challenging your assumptions as the characters develop. This film is important. It is relevant and unavoidable for anyone who stays up to date. The fact that it is very entertaining and that a lot of movie stars only improve the performance. My advice: look at it with a serious crowd or, better still, alone, as you would read an editorial of your favorite news magazine. In this case, there is a difference: the answers will be yours.
