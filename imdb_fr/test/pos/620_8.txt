Well, this movie happened a day of work at 230h. The pretty little actress who played Billy caught my attention at the beginning and after 15 minutes, I remained captive until the end of my television. He has you on the edge of your seat, then throws clever comedy pieces over the most strained sequences. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that the story was not substantial enough to fill a half-movie, causing some sequences to slip a bit. Nevertheless, it was still very fun and I recommended it to all my colleagues the next day.
