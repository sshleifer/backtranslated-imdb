"Nobi" or "Fires On the Plain" is a film so excellent at so many levels that it is impossible to say enough. My only regret is not being able to see this movie from 1959 earlier. <br /> <br /> Being sort of a purist of the film, I tend to watch the films for their artistic merits based on dialogue, theater, photography and even efforts to stay true to the period in terms of costume. In the end, I want to know if the film is sufficiently "truthful" to reveal the human condition and make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think. <br /> <br /> "Fires on the Plain" is a great film because it paints a picture full of realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical disaster. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war at all levels - like any good war movie should be. . The war is horrible, bloody and destructive. It's also deadly on the psyche. However, what is fundamental about "Fires on the Plain" is his uncomplicated gaze on Japanese soldiers. This shows that they are slowly collapsing under the weight of the United States' superior firepower and the inability of their country to wage their own war. A fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such an honest and brutal look at the bitter fruits of Japan's military misadventure made only 14 years after the end. what the Japanese call "the Great Pacific War". Ichikawa reveals what the Germans have called "the life of war", the tragic fate of the private soldier. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's film is interesting because, today, Japan is struggling to fully accept its fanaticism of war. its subjugation of the conquered peoples, the racism of its war against the Chinese and its war crimes which included the cannibalism of soldiers and officers practiced not only against each other, but also against allied prisoners of war. <br /> Ichikawa produces a brutal representation of the victimization of soldiers through a convergence of bad political decisions and cultural pressures. <br /> <br /> This brutal examination is skillfully done by describing the doomed soldiers as human beings who manifest, at various times, fear, with brilliant laconic humor, dialogue enriched by its thinness and intrigue. whose complexity is belied by the sinister and wild scenery. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's portrait is a torn and painful mosaic of vanquished men. The Tuberous Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi as a sweet and gentle soul, is a good soldier who can not give up his humanity, although he is as scared and lost as his comrades. Before leaving for a hospital that rejects him as too healthy, Tamura receives a hand grenade from a superior who, recognizing the desperation of their situation, advises Tamura to kill himself. <br /> <br /> Why is Tamura hopelessly sick? - The unit supplied and militarily incapable was not ordered to go to the beginning of the film, they say. Ichikawa makes it clear that the war is over and everyone is just waiting to die. As Tamura leaves his unit for his desperate search for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his comrades digging a shelter for an air raid. They appear as corpses looking up from their own mass grave. <br /> <br /> We will see the overcrowded hospital medical staff later abandoning the dying patients to a devastating barrage of American artillery. The pathetic patients, who crawl out of their huts in a vain attempt at survival, appear as pathetic and serpentine creatures who extricate themselves from an omnipotent force. You know they will not survive. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa explains that the only thing worse than a defeated army is the one that has lost its honor by giving up its humanity and its comrades. As Tamura crosses the jungles of Leyte, we meet the nobles, the dying and the exploiters. Cannibalism is emerging as soldiers begin to eat each other rather than go to "American salted beef". <br /> <br /> When men talk of capitulation, the propaganda that Americans kill prisoners is fought by a man in the world A shallow soldier who reveals that approaching Americans feed and care for prisoners of war because , unlike the Japanese, they respect the brave soldiers who are forced to give up. It is the Japanese who intend to die fighting for the emperor long after the resistance has lost all meaning. Those who are ready to fight until death will be killed. It is the calculation of the war. <br /> <br /> After slaughtering a killer and cannibal comrade, to whom he previously offered his own body as food, Tamura's negligent capitulation also appears to be an intentional form of suicide. His death is a lonely image. Did Ichikawa try to tell us about the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped in the suicidal cultural codes of his nation? <br /> <br /> If anyone looks at this film carefully, he or she will want to see that absolutism and fanaticism are the enemy. Americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people, willing to use this technology in the form of inexorable military power - a lesson that has transformed post-war Japanese society. Ichikawa's film is not so superficial as it represents America. Ichikawa instills the sedimentary layers of the destructive politics of Japan that created the war and then pursue it when everything was lost. <br /> <br /> Ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He is not obliged. The idle destruction of the Japanese imperial army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japanese self-immolation.
