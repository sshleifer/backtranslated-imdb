"The apartment" must be one of the best French films I have ever seen (with "Hatred", also played by Vincent Cassel and the great Gérard Dépardieu / Pierre Richard films). Cassel and Bellucci are incredible in the lead roles. Apart from "Brotherhood Of The Wolves" and "Dobermann", I have not seen a bad movie yet with this couple. "The apartment" sucks you from the beginning and the twists delight you until the end. The narration of fragments has not really worked well since "Pulp Fiction". Let's hope there will be no monstrous American remake of this unique romance / mystery-thriller. (EDIT: Guess what, a monstrous American remake has been made!)!
