During the last Vitnam War, our central character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), was sent by the CIA as part of an illegal individual mission to assassinate a renegade US Navy commander, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando ), who would have become completely insane, but who is successfully leading a private cross-border war from its base in Cambodia, a neutral and therefore forbidden country. <br /> <br /> The whole story told of what Willard sees and does as he is being transported by an undisciplined and terrorized naval patrol crew, Kurtz is a great metaphor for excesses, decadence and finally the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: if we do not understand something, and we are unable to control it, exterminate it. Kurtz had finally found out. <br /> <br /> Unless you pay particular attention to each emotional gesture, every word of dialogue between the protagonists, especially in the scene where they are alone in the darkness of Kurtz One of the central themes of this incredible movie you will miss. Kurtz's subtle agreement with his executioner, his unilateral "surrender" in exchange for Willard's acceptance (did he nod?) To say to Kurtz's "son" (another metaphor for us, the next generation, those who watch the movie) the truth about all the links between the two men while Kurtz cross-questions Willard - intertwined with some of his own horror stories, are incredible, no, genius, movie. The closing scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the most powerful symbol. Coppolla did, intentionally or not, the ultimate anti-war statement, a statement that should resonate through the ages.
