Created by Dennis Spooner, 'Department S' is a brilliant thriller on a branch of Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve puzzling mysteries that the police can not handle. If a plane lands in Heathrow without anyone on board, if a man wandering around London in a spacesuit, if the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly metamorphosed into a skeleton, if a train parking in a metro station proved Counter the dead commuters, you asked department S to fix the problem. <br /> <br /> Peter Wyngarde has interpreted the role of "Jason King", a flamboyantly flamboyant and flamboyant crime novelist who has solved many strange cases. King seduces the public and is then awarded a spin-off. He was assisted with talent by the American Stuart Sullivan (Joel Fabiani) and the delicious Annabelle Hurst (Rosemary Nicols). Unusually for a 1960s show, the department was led by a black man - "Sir Curtis Seretse" (Dennis Alaba Peters). If the show looked a lot like "The Avengers", it was hardly surprising. He shared many of the same writers and directors! The colored titles were designed by Chambers & Partners and deserve to be granted alone. As was the case with so much It.C. series, the music was composed by Edwin Astley. His theme for 'Department S' must be among the best TV themes of all time. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the show looks a bit sexist and dated now, but do not be deterred from tuning. Imagine a hybrid of "Jonathan Creek" and movies "Austin Powers" and you get "Department S"! <br /> <br /> Useful note: the episode "A little war of nerves" a young Sir Anthony Hopkins in a major role!
