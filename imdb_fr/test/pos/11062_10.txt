I would rank this film in a good position on my list of films by Ingrid Bergman. Ingrid's beauty aside, her talent is obvious scene after scene. She was sad, naughty, witty, <br /> <br /> snobbish, flirtatious, deliciously funny, loving, tender, sad, distressed, happy, etc. You name it, she was all these things and more. -And if <br /> <br /> convincing. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Clio) who returns to New Orleans and falls in love with a Texas player, Gary Cooper (Clint). I particularly liked the scene where they sit at the dining table without saying anything, just looking at each other. She, in an elegant white dress and him in a beautiful white cowboy outfit <br /> <br />, sitting there, looking at her with adoration. What chemistry! What love!
