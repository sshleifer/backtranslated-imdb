Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a weak soundtrack, it is far superior to its competition of the time, "Octopussy". Never Say Never Again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (Connery's most popular bond movie). The NSNA is rich in intelligent dialogue, intelligence, intelligence, sex appeal and one of the best and most convincing villains in the entire Bond series. In addition, NSNA stars a young and beautiful Kim Basinger very talented. British comedy fans will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as "Mr. Bean". I will not trade any of Moore's images against this one. However, Connery / Bond's previous efforts (with the exception of "Thunderball") are superior. <br /> <br />
