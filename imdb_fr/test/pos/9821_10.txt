A film for a mature and educated audience ... <br /> <br /> I saw "Random Hearts" during a preliminary screening shortly before its release in North America. This romantic drama was a real treat. I'm sure this story will not please everyone, especially considering the dark premise of the film. <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford box office raffle ("Star Wars", "The Lost Ark's Adventurers", "The Fugitive", "Air Force One," "Patriot Games") is at the top of his game as a harassed and desperate Dutch Home Affairs Officer. Ford's very moderate and nuanced performance shows all the reach it can achieve with class and determination to bring the public into its world of loss and betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and the very different type of film that Harrison Ford has chosen to adorn the screen with his blockbuster movies. Next year, Harrison Ford returns to the game, first for director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump," "Back To The Future") in his 2000 summer thriller, "What Lies Beneath," and later in the year, in Tom Clancy's film adaptation "The Sum Of All Fears." "Fears" will be Harrison Ford's third outing as an active CIA member, Jack Ryan. <br /> <br /> Director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa", "The Firm", "Tootsie") plays a leading role on this issue, a political advisor to the member for Scott-Thomas. It is a very clear and energetic representation for Pollack, not only is Sydney Pollack a talented director, he is also one of the most credible, natural and charming actors in the world (see also "Eyes Wide Shut" ) <br /> <br /> Kristin Scott-Thomas ("The English Patient," The Horse Whisperer ") shows that you do not have to be eccentric or mundane to be considered sexy. This is one of his best films, and it gives an extremely worked and softened performance that works well in front of the harshness of the quiet man of Ford. <br /> <br /> The subplots work wonders, especially the plot involving the investigation of Ford's character on police corruption. . Dennis Haysbert, actor of the movie "Heat", plays the detective George Beaufort, a hurdle to overcome in the Dutch investigation of police corruption. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is fantastic. delight. Charles S. Dutton (whose leading role was long overdue) will show that he is one of the best character actors, and Bonnie Hunt, whom I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with this wonderful, charming smile like Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of Pollack's thriller is remarkable. From Dave Grusin's Dave Grusin (The Firm) (a perfectly surrealist score to sensational jazz), to Philippe Rousselot's sharp photography ("A river passes through"), to the layout that allows the film to feel fresh despite the unfortunate premise of the film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to all those who love mystery, well-paced plot, character stories and romance. It's a fantastic story about betrayal and forgiveness. It also offers one of the most surprising, but also poignant and controversial endings for a Harrison Ford movie lately. "Random Hearts" is certainly one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 on ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)
