THE SEA INSIDE (2004) **** Javier Bardem, Belen Rueda, Lola Duenas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Joan Dalmau, Alberto Jimenez, Tamar Novas, Francesc Garrido, Jose Maria Pou, Alberto Amarilla, Nicolas Fernandez Luna. : Alejandro Amenabar) <br /> <br /> An inspiring story of a living death; Bardem is superb <br /> <br /> The story of the life of the Spanish quadriplegic Ramon Sampedro and his request to realize his desire for euthanasia by the right to die may not be a source of inspiration, but this movie is just that. <br /> <br /> Sampedro (superbly interpreted by Bardem) was an energetic and virile young man who lost his job after a tragic diving accident (recounted with horror in a flashback with a visceral jerk of the senses) and for almost Thirty years remained paralyzed in bed while her loving family cared for all her needs. Although his movement abilities were nil, his mind was very active and proved to be skilled as an inventor, poet, author and artist who kept him busy until he could no longer stand the thought of live longer in his state of stunting. <br /> <br /> Entering beautiful but also afflicted with a disabling disease attorney, Julia (the ethereal Rueda who corresponds to Bardem as if they were really soul mates) is committed to see through the final wish of Sampedro to end his life and becomes an aide-de-camp when he begins to open up to her as to no one before. Shortly after, Julia begins to investigate the past of her accusation by discovering many letters hidden by her family. When Julia confronts Ramon with this, he is initially reluctant to discuss anything with her, but finally, he agrees with her that it can help her case and that the project becomes a book in the making ?? a memoir / biography in the form of poetry and prose of free style. <br /> <br /> The film is a heartbreaking story of the human spirit and how love ends up triumphing with heartache, including for Ramon the unlikely love he shares with a stranger , Rosa (Duenas), a single mother who sees him on television one day suggesting that she go cycling to her isolated farm in Spain to get to know him and possibly change his mind about the end of his life. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker Amenabar, who co-wrote with Mateo Gil the fascinating scenario, leaves a little fantasy in the mix when Ramon imagines magically leaving his bed and flying over the bucolic landscapes up to the sea where he suffered so many years ago from the cruel twist of fate that has imprisoned him for three decades. The film is not totally depressing, with a devious spirit and sometimes a humorous tone that does not dilute the impact of the last act of history. We would also like to congratulate James and Jo Allen on their remarkable makeup work. They did a remarkable job in aging the vibrant Bardem as an aging man. <br /> <br /> Bardem and Rueda deserve to be nominated for Oscars as people with so much in common and although Julia de Rueda is married to a loving and loving husband, it is impossible for a pair people did it so they were never together to start. This is just one of the cruelty that sounds right, but it is not by definition the film as a whole; it is a must and one of the best of the year.
