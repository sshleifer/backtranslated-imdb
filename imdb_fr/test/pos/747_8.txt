Yet another long list of "Do not" movies from the late '70s and early' 80s, but this one is so much more than that. This film is a very underrated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and weird soundtrack that characterizes the horror movies of the time, but it is the very underrated performances of the actors / actresses with the amazing talent that make this film is good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens' progressive psychiatric hospital right after the murder of one of her patients and everything does not look like it seems to be. It seems that Dr. Masters, a rather ambitious medical doctor, has resumed her duties and is starting to implement her own ideas. Each patient adopts their own personality and has their own personality traits and flaws, making them extremely entertaining interactions. There is the nymphomaniac, the crazy old woman, the woman who has an unhealthy obsession for infants and a man who has returned to his childhood among others. There is also a strange little twist in this weird story that later finds the young nurse stuck inside the asylum with the patients running loose and the bodies piling up. If you are a fan of sleaze 70's cheap, this movie is for you!
