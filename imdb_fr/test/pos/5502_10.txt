For some inexplicable reason, Jerry's films often seemed to receive diatribes from some quarters, although they were rarely box office disappointments. This is one of the great mysteries of my life, because his films have always had for me a factor of "well-being". But this film is not only not bad: it's an extremely good and intelligent comedy. Do not see this film that will appeal to the humor raw or cruel "modern": you do not waste your time and you will lose your time. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie once on TV. I've waited since to see him again and it's been several years. You might think that the idea of ​​an arrogant millionaire businessman going to win the war against the Nazis with his own small army without subordinate employees would be boring, would not it? Well, only Jerry Lewis would dare to try such a scenario for a comedy and it works, I must say brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I think that, as in "The Nutty Professor" and most of his other films, this film is a testament to his comic genius, both in design and execution. I think Buddy Love could have said, "You know, real comedy can not just make a six-year-old hysterical, it will do it for his father as well." Maybe some Nazi generals with monocles and a limp would not like this movie, honestly. If you only see one other comedy in your life, check it out. Be careful though, you could die laughing. And I'm not kidding!
