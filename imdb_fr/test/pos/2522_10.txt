This film has an exceptional acting, Marilia PÃªra, and a breathtaking dicretcion of Argentine Hector Babenco. It is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian film ever made. The film was shot with children from favelas, Brazilian ghetos. The children were not actors and had been chosen by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children being arrested in the correctional prison, which looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the police. Unfortunately, this is not pure fiction, in Brazil it is happening until today. A must for those who love violent movies. But move your mother away from the room because it's a difficult film.
