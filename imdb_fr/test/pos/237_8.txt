Another great musical from the golden age of Hollywood! I loved this story of movies about a trio of friends performers in a small disco far away from Broadway and all its glitter. Although this is not the case, they are very satisfied with their lives and the small club where they occur. Gene Kelly plays the role of owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of her dancers, Rita Hayworth, who catches the attention when she has the opportunity to make the cover of a magazine. The problem begins for Gene Kelly while his girlfriend is now the star of the city. Phil Silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job. Of course, there is music and dance. A dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out. He walks alone in the street at night and sees his reflection in a window. His reflection soon begins to dance with him in the streets, a great cinematography. Do not miss this one, great entertainment.
