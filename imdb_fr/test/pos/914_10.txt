Irene Jacob is fascinating in this last part of Krysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is extremely satisfying because she manages to link the three films together. I'm just amazed at how much talent it took to make one of these stories, not to mention the three. Everything seems to fit together so precisely, all the elements of the cinematic realization have been performed with so much eloquence and the final result is much greater than the sum of the parts. Three Colors is epic in nature and belongs to all great cinematic productions. Just awesome!
