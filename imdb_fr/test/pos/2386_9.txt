I saw some Fred Carpenter movies on SHOWTIME, Pay Per View and video / DVD and I enjoyed most of these movies, especially with a few beers, (Carpenter knows how to entertain) "EDDIE MONROE" and "MURDERED INNOCENCE" are my favorites. I recently watched a promo DVD of "EDDIE MONROE" and everything, from casting to scripting through the realization, went off without a hitch. (The musical score of Doug Brown was sensational.) I loved to see Frank Sivero ("Goodfellas", "New York, New York" and "The Wedding Singer"), he is an incredible actor and very little known. But I especially liked the performance of Paul Vario, who played Uncle Benny, I looked at his credits on IMDb and I learned that it was his first role. Where is this guy! Confers Fred Carpenter the merit of discovering Great New Talent. It's only a matter of time to see this guy with Pacino and DeNiro. As I mentioned, Carpenter knows how to entertain and when you work on a limited budget, it's amazing to see what Carpenter can produce. (I read the interview of VENT MAGAZINE and Carpenter has never shot a movie for more than 400,000 dollars). MONROE "I saw" Rocky Balboa "and" The Good Shepherd ", two great movies." Eddie Monroe "led me to a surprise ending due to a very good script, good performances from the cast (Craig Morris is a movie star waiting and main actress Jessica Tsunis was hot!) Great Picture, Direction and Music Score by Doug Brown As I said, I recently saw "Rocky Balboa" and " The Good Shepherd "If I had to write a comment about these two films, I would say some of the things I already said about" EDDIE MONROE. "Two very good movies do not have in common with" Eddie Monroe ", they do not cost a few hundred thousand dollars.Excellent film and I did not even drink beer.
