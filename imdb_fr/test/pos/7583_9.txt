In the history of cinema, every great filmmaker had to create a first film. Often, after being seen as a success, a light bulb stays on in our heads. The connection is established and we see the solid foundation from which they started. So it's with HORSES ON MARS. It's the subtle humor woven around a seemingly simple narrative that tells a great story, while allowing you to enjoy the images at the same time. In the pictures, I found great attention to detail and a production finish that is rare in any student film. <br /> <br /> A young filmmaker always has improvements to make. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this path, I think we will see one day in this movie the beginning of a great career. <br /> <br /> You should definitely watch this movie. Nothing beats the grandeur of the big screen.
