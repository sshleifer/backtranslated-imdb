I had the privilege of being one of the still photographers of the "Grand Champion" shoot and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the film. I have been working in the photography industry for 25 years and worked on 16 films. I can not think of a time when I had more fun offering my job. It was great working with the kids and the little Emma Roberts has so much energy that she is a real trip. She even caught one of my cameras during the rehearsal of the exhibition scene and started filming. Some of his images were used for public relations. I could have made more money working for a production with a larger budget, but I doubt that I could have had fun and rub shoulders with so many great actors and great people from West Texas.
