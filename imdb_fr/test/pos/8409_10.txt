First of all, nothing will be comparable to the original movie, but damn it, they do not try. This is just one person's opinion of what might have happened after Rhett left Scarlett at Tara's. For my part, I thought it was a fantastic movie and I would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The landscape alone would make me want to watch the movie. See this movie as an extension of the original and do not think they are trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable and you will enjoy it a lot. They really captured Scarlett's spoiled selfishness in many scenes and you can see from Rhett's longing that he's still in love with Scarlett. The fact that you can recognize many actors in the film is an added advantage, even if some of them were only seen on television. I always wanted them to have other children after the death of Bonnie Blue in the movie and it perfectly met my needs. <br /> <br /> Lore60
