Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim towards the boat and find a Desmond completely lost. His traumatic experience before sailing on the island is revealed by flashbacks. Sayid prepares a plan with Jack to surprise "The Others" in case Michael doubles the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not to press the computer button to see what will happen. <br /> <br /> This episode is one of the best of the second season. Unfortunately, we fans of "Lost" can see the lack of respect of the producers of this breathtaking series with fans. In the United States, the date of broadcast of this episode was May 24, 2006. Therefore, throughout this period, fans have to wait for the third season in a very suspensive situation, with Jack and his band surrounded by "The Others "and the search for the truth. about Michael and the death of Ana Lucia and Libby; John locked inside the hatch without the intention of pressing the button and Mr. Eko desperate outside the hatch. I hope that the fate of "Lost" will be better than "Angel" and that its conclusion (or lack of conclusion) very disappointing after five seasons. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
