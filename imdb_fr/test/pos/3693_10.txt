I find this film extremely delicious.I am biased, I guess.I love Kathy Bates.I find it singing with additional pleasure.It has a very beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Bates plays Grace Beasley The film takes you from her married doledrums life to Chicago, England, to her recently murdered singing idol, Victor Fox. She meets her remaining three sisters. She also discovers that Victor leaves behind a man, Dirk Simpson. The story leads you to surprisingly comical and comforting situations, while Grace and Dirk develop a strong love for them, after a pretty brutal rejection on their part. They get back to Chicago where they'll be. associate with Grace's hilarious daughter-in-law, Maudie, in search of the serial murderer who murdered Victor. <br /> <br /> Everyone on the photo did a great job.I particularly enjoyed Julie Andrews, Lynn Redgrave and Barry Manilow.This movie was fun.It makes you cry.The music is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> The other posters here that have had problems with any part of this movie have no idea. <br /> <br />
