(Maybe spoilers included, but nothing critical is given.) <br /> <br /> I just watched this classic low-budget movie on video, and I was stunned by the level of energy on the screen. All the actors are proud, especially John Daniels, who must see another of his films. Not only does this film offer great performances, but it also manages stylish sequences, such as when the baron casts someone through a window and we see glass shards falling into a pool that gushes out under the impact of the fallen man. , I like slowness Moving photography has been used in the cinema of the 70s, dreamy and hypnotic. Cool and witty black guys gush in a single liner while sloppy, slimy work of white garbage arrives for unpleasant purposes. I like it, my rating 10/10. If it ever happens on DVD, count me for a purchase.
