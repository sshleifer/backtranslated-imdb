Shiny film! I'm sorry to say it sounds a bit like Pulp F. but it's like that with the post-pulp era. Many images are automatically assimilated to this movie only for a gangster movie. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are fathers of families look like something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film speaks of a guy in Australia who is confused with a gang of hardened criminals, and leads to debt and a deep debt. With his help, his dead brother (everyone remembers Val Kilmer in True R.?) To pay off his debt and escape the gangsters who borrow him. Gangsters are cool, but take the time to play chess and focus on educating their children! They also receive tea from their grandmother when planning a bank robbery and have trouble doing what with their children during the flight. So, a humorous gangster movie with Heath Ledger in good shape (though I'm not a fan) and Bryan Brown in action as a gang leader.
