Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinematic experience of all time: 1) It's a visual odyssey that can only be told on the big screen. The special effects that earned Kubrick his only Oscar are the most amazing effects before the age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to provide a precise (or at least the most precise) description of the space voyage to date. The silence that fills the scenes of space not only serves as a precise science, it also adds to the mood of the film (to be discussed later with HAL). The fact that Kubrick turned the moon before landing Apollo is a courageous and yet fulfilling gesture. Many said that during its original release, it was a favorite "travel" movie. I can not think of any other movie that has such incredible graphics for its time and even for all times (sorry, Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's style is great. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera to deepen the psychology of his characters and his intrigues. His camera is not as mobile as other big ones, like Scorsese, but stays seated and watches the story unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick movie. Like classic movies, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the faces of characters to give the audience a psychological perspective. Even he uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red "eye" to show the coldness and determination of the computerized villain. I could go on, but in summary, Kubrick lives up to his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the ugliest characters in the history of cinema. I strongly agree with Gene Siskle's opinion of fire on HAL 9000. Most of this film is in space. The use of silence and the darkness of space itself creates a climate of isolation. Dave and his crewmen are isolated between the land and Jupiter, having nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you get the craziest villain you can imagine. Even though, having seen this film many times, I feel my chest tightening in a particular scene. 4) The controversial end of 2001 always diverts people from this film. Instead of trying to give my opinion on what that means and what I think of the general meaning of 2001, I would like to talk about the fact that the end serves to leave the film endless. Kubrick said he intended to make the year 2001 open for discussion. He left his meaning in the hands of the spectator. In keeping with the public's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his film to be the beginning, not the end, of a constructive discussion about the past, present and future of man. The beauty of 2001 lies in the fact that the end does not have to mean anything profound, it can simply be a purely plot-based explanation and the entire movie can be considered as an entertaining journey through space. No other film, except the great citizen Kane, can be discussed as in 2001. It is truly a surrealistic journey that involves not only the eye but also the spirit. Instead of waiting in line for the Phantom Menace, rent a 2001 big-screen edition and enjoy the best cinematic experience.
