I'm sorry to see that many people have judged it so low. The series started very well and after the first season it was not so good. <br /> <br /> People tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end. This is not good to do, you should look at the total, not the end result. It's unfortunate that a lot of "usual" characters are dead, but damn it, we've had a lot of nice new characters. <br /> <br /> Do not focus on a few characters, but stick to the series, the plot. Please, understand that I did not like it when Boone died, when Augur died, but hey ... it must be done. Can you imagine that everyone continues to live the whole series while he is always in danger? Come on, face it, if they did not die, they would be invincible. In this way, you will always keep the tension, will it survive, will it die? I realize that people attach themselves to characters, I do it too. My favorite character was Augur, the one who could access all the computers he wanted. It was him who was mysterious, he could do things with the computer, no one else could do it. <br /> <br /> I wish to make a statement to all the people who voted against, did a series that started so well deserve to have such a low score? Should we watch the last season instead of the total? Should not we see how good the show was at the beginning? Should not we see how much we enjoyed it?
