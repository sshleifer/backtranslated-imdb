According to the users of IMDb, I was watching the last 100 movies by looking if there was something to revise that I have not yet and I found this gem of screen. One of those occasions where you see one of the worst movies and you just have to be one of the few to really like it. Damn it, well I guess I'm going to be ridiculed and spit on, but for me it was a very good movie when I saw it. It's been a long time, however, I remember that HBO was airing late at night. I watched it two or three times. I have not really seen him since and I would like to watch him again now, knowing that Jolie was there. The story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this company and bounty hunters after them. I think that's basically all there is to it. Add some scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie. Good deeds here and there, blood and violence too. There is also a love story at stake, as well as the cyborg woman and the guy who trained her to fight to fall in love with each other. Sometimes the dialogue becomes pretty bad and it's by no means a first rate movie, but it's really good for a B movie. I do not know if it was a theatrical release, because it's not It does not seem to be of sufficient quality for that, but it makes it one of the best films directly for videos if there is one.
