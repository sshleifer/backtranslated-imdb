I hate movies about sports. I guess the prefabricated Hollywood sports film is a bit hard to swallow because it follows the most identical ideas every year. What I'm trying to say is that there is not much creativity in this genre. Use room "A" ?? "The game plan" as proof of that if you want. So, needless to say, I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sport theme, but I was impatient because I like surfing documentaries like "Step into Liquid" and "Billabong Odyssey". I took a step, I plunged into the unknown and, to be honest, at first I was not happy. I did not like the direction, the people or the style that the film included to present these young sports entrepreneurs. During my first viewing, I thought the story could not be fully recorded. So I thought Stacy Peralta stuck footage with fake actors acting as if they were in the late '70s. The music was intense and fit. To our delight, Peralta had created a mixed band of this generation, but the visual effects were anything but stimulating. The elongated scenes, while using amazing music, just seemed too red and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went when they became famous and where they were now. It was as if I was watching the birth of our country with a good note for the settlers who rowed their boats all day long. I wanted to know the authors of the myths. <br /> <br /> Then, thinking I had another negative criticism to my credit, I watched the movie again with the audio commentary of Peralta. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do for this film to be accomplished seduced me. It suddenly turned into a movie that I wanted to see. Peralta allows us to know more about the current situation of these children, what they are still doing and the difficulty of some of them. He had not seen much for over 20 years, so in light of these challenges, he brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was friendly, yet he showed a lot of dedication to this project. Although I do not agree with all that he chose to do (that is, Sean Penn's bazaar is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me. It is because of this comment that I attach much more value to this film than it was thought. <br /> <br /> Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the names that need to be mentioned and must be continually praised if skateboarding is to continue the trend of rapid growth that it is currently seeing. While the name of Tony Hawk sells products, it's these guys, those slackers of soft-fitting roadways that have redefined a whole sport. Of course, others probably did it in the Stone Age, but these guys did it in style, grace, and pushed it to the next level. It was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction that, in my opinion, was not ready. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted and talk about friendship. We have seen so many stories over the years that show the progress of humanity, and it is certainly a story that deserves to be added to that. I can not say that I liked this movie, and I will not like it, but it should be a standard view for anyone who learns or wants to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys are not yet multimillionaires ?? They are passionate people, and this is rarely the case in documentaries. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not watch this movie anymore, but I will suggest it to my friends and family. I think the fall of this film was for me the filming ?? attempts to be at the forefront with style, which has finally moved away from characters and events. As mentioned earlier, some elements dragged on too much, leaving us little or no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta obviously had a passion for the sport, for people, but it sometimes seemed blurry. The music was intense and worked perfectly with the movie. Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voiceover, was not needed at all. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the plus side, the audio commentary captures everything that was missing from the regular movie. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene as he tells us better stories about people, places and events. Watch this movie, but do not expect to be blown away. Listen to the audio commentary. I think you will be impressed. <br /> <br /> Note: *** Â½ on *****
