"Two Hands" is a fun and funny story about life in Australia. The scenario compares the world of fast money and murderous acts to the inexplicability of fate and circumstances. In a subtle way, we are asked to reflect on the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of destiny and circumstances lead Jimmy, the main character, into situations conducive to the realization of his superficial dreams and, ultimately, to the understanding of a more personally promising world. <br /> <br /> The distraught Jimmy, described with a keen sense of Heath Ledger, is a child who grew up without opportunity. The world of well-paid crime offers the greatest appeal to its blunt senses. Love and help from friends lead him to a higher plateau. <br /> <br /> The film is well done and well played. The gang of criminals oscillates between friendly and despicable, keeping us interested in their crazy antics throughout the film.
