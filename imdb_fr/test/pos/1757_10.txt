For years, I remembered a song "JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE" ("N Â° twenty squares of moonlight, just a couple in a castle in the air"). I could not find the song, but I remembered that it had to do with cartoon bugs. I found a reference to the movie on the web. I had seen the movie when I was only 9 years old at Ligonier PA Theater. I was delighted to find that there was Kenny Gardner, the singer of Guy Lombaro (I am a fan of Lombardo). And then, see that it was produced by Fleisher Bros. who made another very good comics feature from "Gullivar's Travels" (which is also fondly remembered). The songs have also been associated with Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, who are among the best. No wonder I remember the movie, the song and the colorful animation. As a complete musical, it is a film that should be considered one of the best among early musicals. Now that I remember it well, the plot may not have shaken the earth, but it was very well presented and is an easy-to-see and delicious movie.
