This helps that the characters on which this series is based are among the best that Disney has ever created. Writing is what really makes this show. It's a total classic. Since you have to appreciate the type of humor to appreciate it, it's hard to explain. The humor is akin to the Old School Disney scenarios of the 40s and 50s, with modern towers. It never goes down in pet jokes or anything of that type. It's not Adam Sandler's humor, though I enjoyed that. It's exactly the same humor of the film, developed only for the duration of a television show. So, if you do not like that in the movie, you will not like it here, but IMO The Emperor's groove was Disney's best thing to do since Gargoyles. <br /> <br /> A +
