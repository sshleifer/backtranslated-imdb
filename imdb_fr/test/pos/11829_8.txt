Interesting story and compassionate treatment for racial discrimination, Son of the Gods is a bit too long and contains a bit of acting, but overall remains a fascinating film. <br /> <br /> The story of a White man who passes as White) begins when Barthelmess leaves college after being insulted by a trio of brainless students. He embarks on a world tour to discover himself and eventually become secretary of a British playwright (Claude King). In Monte Carlo, he meets the beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and they fall in love. But when she discovers that he is Chinese, she becomes madly furious in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Alanna is in a spiral of guilt and love and makes some attempts to contact Barthelmess. After the death of his father, he takes over the business (bank?) And puts on a Chinese outfit as a symbol of his hatred of the white race that despised him. After a police officer in San Francisco told him the truth about his birth, Barthelmess made the decision to honor his Chinese father and mother. <br /> <br /> And I agree that a critic here has never seen this movie. Alanna declares her love for Sam BEFORE he tells her about her recent discovery. And that makes all the difference in this film. <br /> <br /> Barthelmess and Bennett each have a few scenes in which they decorate the landscape, but overall, it's a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is good as the college boyfriend, Claude King is as solid as the playwright Bathurst, Bess Flowers has a scene as an Indian from Oklahoma and E. Alyn Warren is the Chinese father, Dorothy Mathews is a nasty Alice . Anders Randolf as Bennett's father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen are not so good. Also note the gorgeous blonde to the right of Barthelmess at the roulette table. What a stunner, whatever it is!
