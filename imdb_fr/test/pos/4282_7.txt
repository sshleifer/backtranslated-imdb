I gave him a seven only because the acting is good. And of course, I mean Wilkinson. The other two directors were "decent". But the characters themselves ... what made it so bad for the character played by Wilkinson (James Manning)? I did not see him behaving like the whip that Emily Watson accuses him of being. Bill Bule, meanwhile, was an insupportable idiot who, I would pray, would face an extremely brutal and prolonged death. I did not care who? Tom Wilkinson is not Paul Bettany after all. So what does the character of Emily Watson (Anne) saw at Earth ???? She herself admitted that he was pretty much a piece of offal in her treatment of her. Why would she even want to be in the same city as him, without saying anything of the same "room". <br /> <br /> I noticed other reviews, a person said that she "cried" at the end, attend the tragedy of James. ??? What a tragedy? What, do you mean to lose a fool who finds someone like Bill Bule AMUSING ??? !!! Give us a break.
