This is the first movie I ever recorded on video, and 14 years later, I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was as radiant at age twelve as ever, Mickey Rooney gave Mi Taylor a real dimension and Donald Crisp was as strong as Mr. Brown. The amazing Anne Revere, as Mrs. Brown, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. After almost 60 years, the heat, humor and excitement of this film still affect the viewer. we still laugh at jokes, root of The Pie and love Velvet for the spirit and the capacity of love that she displays. I love him as an adult as I loved him as a child. A must for every collection of family videos.
