Of course, critics hated him. This is not a film that is very successful. But the fact is that it's really very good. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you do not like the physical comedy brand Chris Farley, or the extremely dry mind of David Spade, you're not going to like it. But for the rest of us, the movie has a lot of hilarious, and besides quotable sequences, and the plot is not as stupid as that of "Black Sheep". Roles that are not supposed to be humorous are actually well done, not what you expect from a movie of this ilk, and the acting is really good. "Tommy Boy" is without question Chris Farley's best film. I give him an A and suggest that you give him a view.
