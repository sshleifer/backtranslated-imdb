Since many other users have already explained and commented on the scenario, I will not do it. <br /> <br /> However, I want to reiterate that Bardem's interpretation is excellent, as well as those of other actors and actresses in this film. <br /> <br /> Reading the previous comments, I noticed that some people criticized the fact that the film does not show the opposite views of euthanasia and that these little gifts are ridiculed. In my opinion, this is far from true. <br /> <br /> Many characters evolve in a gray area between loving Ramón Sampedro, wanting to stay and understand his desire to die. The most obvious of these are the family. For example, Ramón's sister-in-law never speaks for or against euthanasia. Gené (the defender of social rights) is another of those characters who, at the last minute, asks Ramón to rethink everything. The scene clearly shows that she does not want him to die. <br /> <br /> Then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia. Ramon's brother is clearly against it, as is his father ("There is only one thing worse than the death of his son, and it is to have a son who wants to die.") Others Users commented that the discussion between Ramón and the priest was ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ramón is GOOD and the priest is BAD. Well, no doubt the scene is comical, but that does not mean that the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest tries to convince Ramón to continue to live using arguments totally foreign to Ramón's thought. The priest's speech goes in the direction of "God gives and God takes", "We do not own our own lives, they belong to God" ... and so on. The comedy stems from the fact that Ramón is an atheist and that all that the priest tells him is therefore nonsense. <br /> <br /> This film is the antithesis of Manichaeism, it gives the viewer the opportunity to reflect on the subject and make his own opinion. And above all, there is a FREEDOM song.
