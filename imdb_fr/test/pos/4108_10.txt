I do not really see the problem with this film. Certainly, the main singers may not be Luciano Pavarotti or Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a melody. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I love their songs, especially "The world is a circle", "Things I will not miss" and "Question Me An Answer". Some claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is appalling and that the snow-covered mountain scenery feels like plastic. I do not agree on both points. I have already seen powdery snow and the snow in these mountain scenes seemed realistic to me. And especially, for the defense of this film, it is suitable for a family audience (at least I remember that this is what I saw on Christmas Day, a few years ago.) With all the outcry caused by the sex and violence in movies These days, I find it refreshing to find that this film deserves its popularity rating. And they do not say that nasty word "F" every ten minutes like some movies I've seen. Thank God. So while this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, it has some redemptive value and I give it ten points out of ten. This is my story and I want it.
