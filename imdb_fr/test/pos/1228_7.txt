I'm not here to tell you that "armored" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. Nope. The referenced directors are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("The Warriors"). These two pilots have not done any stupid things like putting women in their movies. No skirt should apply. They made guy movies without complex. Firearms, a lot of guns. The men met violent death with a contraction of the jaw. Their films were like a sap to the head. Do you want a friend? Get a dog. <br /> <br /> "Armored" is a guy movie. Dueling armored trucks? Bloody gunshot wounds? Explode money? If that does not excite the lizard in your brain, then move away. <br /> <br /> At 88 minutes, "Armored" means all muscle without an ounce of fat. We meet six security guards who drive armored trucks, three by truck. The six, led by Matt Dillon, organize a false diversion involving two trucks. Their mission one day is to provide $ 42 million from the Federal Reserve (I think). The idea is to drive the two trucks into a warehouse, store the money and then organize a diversion. Of course, the cops will suspect them, but if they stick, they'll be fine. <br /> <br /> The problem is one of six, played by Columbus Short, who is struggling to survive. First. But he risks expulsion. And he is the guardian of his younger brother. He needs bad money. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon cajole, plead, persuade the field. No blood on anyone's hands. A clean getaway Everything is fine, not bad. You will be rich forever. Blue sky smiling at you ... <br /> <br /> Good. <br /> <br /> Everything goes to hell, of course. It's a damn thing after another and the stakes keep rising. And almost everything goes claustrophobically in an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact, the film does its utmost to project a context of industrial urban degradation. I like industrial urban decadence. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Matt Dillon, who plays the big bad dog. It goes from charming disappointment to frustrated, even outraged to totally crazy during the movie. I love this guy. <br /> <br /> The credit is also due to the threatening, throbbing, blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack of John Murphy. I guess he heard some Tangerine Dream records. <br /> <br /> It's also surprising that this is a PG-13 movie. I caught one ?? a! ?? F-Bomb in all this movie about violent thieves. At a certain level, I like that. Take the children. <br /> <br /> The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian who made a beautiful black set in the Budapest subway, called "Kontroll". The screenwriter is an extravagant guy named James V. Simpson. <br /> <br /> Many people in this movie have just started. I'm willing to bet that the esteem given to this film will increase over time and that these filmmakers advance in their careers.
