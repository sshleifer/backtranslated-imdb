Some said it was a film glorifying the nose, but apart from Dr. Hyde's original blend, no drug has yet been developed to provide this effect. If Viagra was the stage of slimy mold, this sparkling white powder is the evolutionary bar of Stephen Hawking (or at least the branch of the silly pharmacist scientist). This reality show is actually about the sacred cows of medicine, seen as the emperor without clothes. Few of us want to question the field of health; both because most of us would not have lived in our time if we were born before "modern medicine" and because our subconscious hopes we will continue to live if we believe in the helping professions. Thus, the geniuses who produced this film made jokes to those of Calcutta Bessy, giving us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern medical institution. The timing was right and many could see the commercial side of the healing societies behind the Oz curtain. A decade ago, when George C. Scott had whistled the film The Hospital, my wife and I were seated at the premiere in Oklahoma City. Just like in the Jekyll & Hyde remake, we were almost unable to drop from our seat and we laughed and screamed uncontrollably for the duration. Hundreds of other members of the audience were deadly silent. They were shocked by the mockery of doctors, nurses and the hospital. It was as if the Pope, Billy Graham, and Gandhi were sitting in the animal's house, beer-stained t-shirts and everything, competing to see who could tell the funniest jokes of God striking. If the Hospital had been a crazy comedy rather than a satire, they might have seen what was shown to them. Unfortunately, they were like Republicans in the September 11 screening of Michael Moore. Smaller gold parachutes may have been handed over to corrupt medical company leaders, health insurance companies would have had more difficulty refusing medical care, and health care providers would have been debunked sooner, if George C. Scott had slammed into the tutu while delivering his terrible truths. But forget all that I just said. Watch the movie, be consciously happy and happy and laugh like the best Saturday Night Live skit, and let the subconscious take in the documentary about the underlying reality. Do not blame me when "Got to Got to Got to" becomes one of your words, or when "Hyde has nothing to hide" occupies that part of your brain now paralyzed by "It's a little world after all ". Or when you call your local hospital, Our Lady of Pain and Suffering, instead of Our Lady of Eternal Construction. Even the Oklahomans were changing their favorite boss's favorite revenge for "Pissing on him and leaving him for dead," in "Body in a well, you're there ....." The smell of death ... she left! Sushi with chicken! Married. MARRIED. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
