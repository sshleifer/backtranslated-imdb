OK, so in all the caricatures of Wile E. Coyote-Road Runner, we know that the WEC will install all sorts of traps for RR, but always mutilates in different ways. It certainly happens in "Beep, Beep". Predictable? I guess so, but when you think about it, these cartoons show that the more you try to hurt someone else, the more you hurt yourself; It's a bit like Daffy Duck was still trying to undermine the integrity of Bugs Bunny, but that Bugs sees around him. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is another classic of the Termite Terrace crowd. Sometimes I think that if we had really wanted to appease the Cold War tensions, we could have just let the Soviet Union see the Looney Tunes drawings; I'm sure they would have liked them. Another big one. <br /> <br /> PS: I learned about "Jeopardy!" Wile E. Coyote's first name is Ethelbert.
