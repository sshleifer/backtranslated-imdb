I hate vampire movies. with that said, this one was very interesting for me. I want to emphasize a tho thing. "bakjwi" literally means bat in Korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see Count Dracula where vampires turn into bats and fly away or wuheva. We also know that bats are mammals capable of flying, which often qualifies them as exceptional. Watching the movie, I realized that the bat theme was deeply ingrained in this film, more than to link bat and vampire. <br /> <br /> Duality of human nature = If you ever read AeSop's fables, there is this fable in which mammals and birds fight and where a bat just does not seem to take gone and tries to play both sides to his advantage. Mammals and birds discover what this bat did and banish it from their land at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> The two contradictory aspects of human nature are constantly struggling throughout the film. A blind priest of blood-hyun, a blood-hyun effort to quench his thirst and sexual desire, tae-ju playing on both sides, his life banal and boring against his thrill in search of vampire adventure, etc. (That will not spoil you too much, you have to watch the movie) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance, sex, violence, religion, dark comedy, tragedy, revenge, name it. the! <br /> <br /> I find this film boring and too long, but this movie is very new and new, something I have not seen yet b4. I would not say it's the best job of CW Park, but it's a lot. def. the strangest to understand and yet very intriguing!
