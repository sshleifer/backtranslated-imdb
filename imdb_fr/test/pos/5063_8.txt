The tense and topical political thriller attacks the controversial US policy on "restitution", another dreaded Orwell sentence (collateral damage, whoever?) To illegally interrogate even the torture of terrorist suspects bypassing court proceedings. The inhuman interrogation is overseen by the Egyptian police chief, himself the target of a fundamentalist suicide bombing - a bombing, blending the two main intrigues of the film. Both work very well, the graphics of the bombing game and its frightening realism, with its denouement revealed in a stylized flashback of the Tarantino type and the scenes of torture on an innocent man also portrayed flawlessly in all their bloody details. The film reveals evocative points about the use of torture as a means of credible intelligence - a rally in the war against terrorists and against the faceless and uncontrolled bureaucracy (embodied here by Meryl Streep, a woman with a cold, deft body, like the CIA leader who gives for restitution) that can ruin innocent lives. Regardless of Kafka's fiction, think instead of the assassination of the innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, with the head of the Metropolitan Police still in office and no one having been tried for the murder of the poor. The acting is excellent overall - the two key roles of the innocent and the terrorist terrorist are interpreted in a realistic and revealing way by the unknown actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. In the same way, Yigal Naor as intimidating police chief and Zineb Ouhach as his idealistic girl in love just ring with their performances, their lack of familiarity (at least for me) adding to the credibility of their characters. Among the biggest Hollywood names present, Gyllenhaal's size grew over the following films. Here we see the character of the government, initially detached but later struck with conscience and anguish, who ends up making the right decisions. Witherspoon plays her role as a desperate woman mainly in one key, but is still credible, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin convincingly show egoistic senators and their lackeys who will go so far as to help you until their career prospects are compromised. There are some weaknesses in the plot; There is hardly any dramatic need to create the "suspense" surrounding El-Ibrahimi's escape and the character of Streep may be too obvious as a man / woman. Worst of all is the insignificant inclusion of Gyllenhaal's on-site girlfriend, solely for decoration and a brief free love scene. Overall though, a captivating cinematic experience.
