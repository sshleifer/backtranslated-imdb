Just before dawn is an excellent horror movie. It is atmospheric, filled with tensions made of beautiful clich√©s of wild nature, in which few young people meet their destiny, in the form of two bastards crazy and fat, who massacred them. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent director, unfortunately unknown. He managed to create tension not by force, but to show a threatening natural environment. Lieberman manages to create a tension in a very linear and simplistic way, which is also the best way not to show the viewer the gore, but to let him imagine the worst thing that can happen to the characters. <br /> <br /> Just before Dawn has always been compared to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance and Hills have eyes. It's as beautiful as Deliverance, better than Hills, I hear more scary and better designed, and it's scary like the chainsaw massacre in Texas. <br /> <br /> JBD is one of the best horrors of recent decades. finally live on DVD!
