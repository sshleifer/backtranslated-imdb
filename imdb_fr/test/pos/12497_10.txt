Seeing this show gives me respect for MTV, although I imagine that MTV considers this material toothless at random as its main selling point and is much less concerned about the relevant truths it expresses. <br /> <br /> I write and play music to make a living and this show makes me really emotional. For me, Wondsershowzen fulfills a function totally different from that of most televisions. Instead of bothering or distracting the senses (which can often be very pleasant sometimes), it wakes up my mind from good and bad. It makes me very uncomfortable, but in a very comforting way. <br /> <br /> I think that few viewers absorb most of the content of this show, but if they do, congratulations to viewers around the world.
