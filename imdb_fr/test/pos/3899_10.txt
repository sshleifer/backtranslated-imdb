William H. Macy is great in this Alfred Hitchcock film. Macy plays the role of film critic who accidentally kills one of her friends. The characters that follow are hilarious. James Cromwell gives an excellent performance as a private investigator in blackmail. As always, Macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal performance. See this movie when it's on TV and check your video stores because it's the one you do not want to miss.
