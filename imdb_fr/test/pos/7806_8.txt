It's a parody, it's a clever comedy, it has a pathetic action and choreography (and it's intentional), good hummable songs, good performances from the whole casting, brilliant of Amir, Salman and Paresh and especially a screenplay that is so rare in Indian cinema as in comedy (look David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra, etc.). The story tells the story of two gorillas whose sole purpose is to become rich and famous by all means. They encounter such a problem when they discover that a rich NRI is getting married in India. The rest of the story is about entrepreneurship and how these escapades are trying to make their head. The entire distribution is perfectly planned from Deven Verma to Viju Khote. The songs are properly placed and are funny. The surprise package is Salman who acts with perfect timing and this act gave him his comedy style. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is a smoked movie that you should not ignore if you like and watch Indian cinema.
