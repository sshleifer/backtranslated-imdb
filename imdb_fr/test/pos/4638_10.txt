Midnight Madness is the ultimate treasure hunt movie for all time. michael j fox and paul reubens respectively make pre-renown appearances. Laughs abound everywhere and the plot of who will come out victorious at the end of the big white night will keep you on the proverbial edge of your seat. a real one to see!
