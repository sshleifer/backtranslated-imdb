My companions were stunned to find that this film was a documentary. It was so funny, it seemed to be written in a script, but it gives a moving picture of real life in the independent film. We felt pushed to buy Coven and we wanted to meet Mark and Mike. As students, this film gave us an indispensable insight into real life.
