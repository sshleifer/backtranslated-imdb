It's hard to judge "Imaginary Heroes" without mentioning the fact that director and screenwriter Dan Harris is only 25 years old. You have trouble believing that this film was made with a lot of maturity, professional and profound, but also some routine flaws specific to the old directors. <br /> <br /> The decor is that of the American suburbs, too familiar with "American Beauty" or "Desperate Housewives". As in "American Beauty", the film revolves around a suicide, but here, it happens at the beginning of the film, and we are still watching a family of middle class facing the death of the brother and the talented sports son . Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are excellent at trying to cope with the loss, to find the reason and the motivation to survive. Harris leads his actors with a sure hand, and the first two sections of the film (there are four in total, like the seasons of the year) create a wonderful tension, with credible dilemmas and real questions. This is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly, it looks too tired and too conventional, and I suspect that the producers may have been ingested in the work of the young screenwriter and director, trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood convention. That's why this film fails to be a dark version of 'American Beauty', with a different purpose. I am convinced, however, that we will hear a lot about Dan Harris in the years to come.
