I just got home after seeing "Radio". I have not seen such an inspiring story for a long time. My children are 8 and 5 years old and I would like to take them so that they can "feel" the message as I did - you should look for the best people and love them for who they are, not for them judge for their differences. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris both deserve Oscars for this film. I do not know why we can not have more movies like this, rather than junk food served daily in movie theaters.
