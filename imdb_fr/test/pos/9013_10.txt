Original movie lovers can really enjoy this show, if they stop complaining all the time. <br /> <br /> The new school of the emperor offers some old jokes of the film, like pulling the lever towards the lab of Yzma and let Kuzco suspend the episode. But as it is a children's show, it's a classic and it's in their place. Although the style is much simpler, the animation and the characters retain their personality very well and that surprised me, in fact. Eartha Kitt makes an excellent dubbing for Yzma and J.P Manoux does a wonderful job for Kuzco's voice instead of David Spade, who played Kuzco in the film. Great intrigues, hilarious moments and the incredible look of Kuzco make this show to watch. (Stop complaining about everything!)
