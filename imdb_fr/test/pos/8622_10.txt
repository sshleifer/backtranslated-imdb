I liked the movie but it should have been longer. The actors did a great job. Portia De Rossi is a fabulous actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a hottie. He did not look like John 100% but he favored it from a distance. I can not wait to see more of him on the big screen. He did not have John's charisma, but he certainly has a charm for himself. He has beautiful eyes and a big smile. He reminds me a lot of my boyfriend. Mrs. Bissett was too out of breath for me. She should have her asthma checked. I will not comment on the character of Darryl Hannah. My mother always said, "If you can not say anything nice, then shut up!" This is what I'm gonna do. <br /> <br /> Molly
