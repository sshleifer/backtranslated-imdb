The quintessence "let's get ready for the summer movie". It's silly, clumsy and maybe a bit dated, but my kids saw it and they laughed as much as I did when I saw it for the first time. In the style of all movies "little guys against the establishment", so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's warm and fun. And no, it's not Bill Murray in his Bill Murrayest, but he's starting to expand in his first role. Curious to see how few "fresh faces" of this movie have done much more.
