A notorious big budget flop when it was published. This comedy inspired by Robert Altman has great moments and a sometimes inspired distribution. Even if it lasts a long time, there are enough fun moments so that the curious spectator can look to the end. If you are a fan of actors and character actresses, it will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many excellent little-known performers throughout this film (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), even the kid of A Christmas Story appears in a small part. Rent Netflix if you read this, I bet you'll enjoy it.
