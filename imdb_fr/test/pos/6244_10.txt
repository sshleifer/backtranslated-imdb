This is the biggest movie I have ever seen. Davey / Mr. Slaussen is simultaneously: <br /> <br /> 1) Tortured for his talents (eg, "I can control him, I can, I should not have to control him!" That would be a good thing ! "); <br /> <br /> 2) Desperate to make friends, for example, <br /> <br /> "How's the soup? <br /> <br />" The soup is very good. "<br /> <br />" Would you like some salty biscuits with your soup? "<br /> <br />" I wish I had others, please. "<br /> <br /> "How are you?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the soup is very good." <br /> <br /> 3) Proud of its achievements (eg "A nice tour of boilerplate, huh? ") <br /> <br /> 4) A woman's man (for example," You're so pretty, why do not you love me? ") and <br /> < 5) Sometimes very angry (for example, "You can not escape!") <br /> <br /> The Connors should have received an Academy Award for Best Actor for this I mean, who was maybe better? Tanya Roberts exploded in the stratosphere after her performance in TT, the stars of this masterpiece did not have any bright careers. It's available on amazon.com Everyone should own it, go for one night and get a bowl of soup while you watch.
