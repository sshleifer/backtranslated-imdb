I was surprised and impressed to learn that this film was released in 1940, before the United States entered the Second World War. On the surface, making a satire of something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misinterpreted as reckless. But Chaplin's talent is not limited to making a joke of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message would not have been as valid if it were not for the excellent use of humor in this film and the dramatic moments that were involved. The theater alone would not have the film done. Laughing someone (Adenoid Hynkel) may be the best way to attack, while laughing with someone (the Jewish barber) may be the best way to love them. In the last speech of the Jewish barber, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about took place more than half a century ago. These are words that make sense now and in any period of war. For this reason, I think the film did a lot more good than bad, because it still has the same profound effect today.
