"Pixote" is one of the most powerful, shocking and moving films in Brazil. It deals with the lives of street children in the streets of Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro, and focuses on a ten-year-old boy. The camera follows them almost in a documentary style: the juvenile detention center (where most of the employees are as corrupt as the police) and in the street, without ever turning away from the horrors of the city. These young people witness prostitution, drug use and trafficking, corruption and murder. Yet this is something they are painfully accustomed to. The director Hector Babenco used real street children as actors, adding to the film a brutal reality. Although not for everyone, a movie that I highly recommend. An emotionally devastating film. <br /> <br />
