Overall, Big Bad John was a hilarious and touching movie. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this movie has it. If you're a fan of the song (like me), you know pretty much how it ends. But if you do not do it or if you want to watch it anyway, I highly recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are a hilarious couple with excellent chemistry. However, I would not recommend this movie to a strict city dweller. You have to understand where these people are supposed to come from and we only have a handful left. But even a few city dwellers could understand it and appreciate it for what it is: a good movie at home that will make you laugh, cry and be inspired.
