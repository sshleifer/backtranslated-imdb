"The Aristocats" is Disney's classic at its best. It's not considered Disney's ultimate classic alongside Disney's best-known movies, but it's a well done and entertaining film that certainly deserves to be a Disney classic. "Aristocats" is certainly a pleasure for kids because it contains all the elements of a fun movie for kids. I would have liked it a lot when I was a child. I do not know if this film will surely appeal to adults, who could watch Disney classics for nostalgia reasons, but I still love this film as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Storywise, "Aristocats" may not be so complex or innovative, but it does not matter. This film was shot at this time when filmmakers had the motto that the characters were history and vice versa, which certainly shows "Aristocats". The characters make the film; they are all friendly, fun, have beautiful lines and have good interaction with each other. The actors of the voice also contribute to make the characters so convincing (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley, etc.). A misconception may have been the Napoleon and Lafayette dogs, since they are telltale and they do not have so much to do with real history, but fortunately they are fun and funny characters and their scenes are d pure gold. <Br /> <br /> "Aristocats" is both fun and cute, but it's also a very funny cartoon. The style and the aspect of the animation adapt perfectly to the French environments of the film (in particular the city of Paris looks great). The animation and the character design are excellent. And the songs are really catchy too. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios", but the title song is a cute song, with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and the memorable show-stopper "Everyone wants to be a cat". And George Burns' score fits the film perfectly in fun and emotional situations. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Aristocats" is in my opinion the best Disney cartoon of the 70s and it is a film that deserves to be seen and remembered at the same time. So what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and share this Disney classic with your kids. It deserves to be in their memories.
