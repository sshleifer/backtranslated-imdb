I guess we're all car fans and we hear the sound of a Dodge Challenger grumbling along the road, the sound the 57 Chevrolet makes when it screams ecstatically when it tears a corner and , more than anything, the sound of a classic car ignites when it explodes. I'm not the biggest car enthusiast ever, but none of these things really drives the engine! We can not deny the importance of transportation for the cinema. It has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the greatest influences of the beginning of cinema (to look through a window almost like a moving image and to be transported in a different space / time). But the car remains the most popular and the most appreciated, it even has its own kind: the kind of car-exploitation. A genre that focuses solely on the beauty of cars. Indeed, it's just porn! Because porn! And I'm not talking about this rather nasty documentary about Channel 4 in which men have actually had sex with cars. What's floating in your car, I guess. Let's move on to something else ... while RUNNING ON VIDE is not as pornographic as VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971), for example, with its close-ups of the moving car, its bumps and curves (! ), does not mean that the car is not the main object of this film. In fact, the cars themselves become characters (we'll talk about it later). They are objectified and fetishized as much as women, perhaps even more. And holy saint, these cars are something! All the cars in this movie (apart from those in the background) are just beautiful ?? works of art, there is no doubt. <br /> <br /> As I said, these incredible cars are like characters. You really start to sympathize with the car! SPOILER ?? Especially during the scene in which the car is being destroyed and burned SPOILER OVER. This has become almost a convention of the kind of the automobile exploitation; the evil 1978 Fury Plymouth Fury by CHRISTINE (John Carpenter, 1983), Lincoln Mark III Personalized from Satan in THE CAR (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), the cute little Coopers from THE Italian JOB (Peter Collinson, 1969) to the friendly Volkswagen Beetle of THE LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) and of course every car of DEATH RACE 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970), all of which had their own character. Ironically, this emphasis on the car often takes (!) Human characters! And this is certainly the case with RUNNING ON VIDE, in which a single human character (the blind character who drives his car with hearing rather than sight) has some dimension, the rest is made up of many characters. These are all your Australian stereotypical teenagers of the 1980s; big hair, boring accents and none of them would be out of place in NEIGHBORS, especially the Kylie Minouge look-alike. But who cares? It's cars racing and falling! That's all! If you do not like that, you really look the wrong kind. <br /> <br /> The car scenes are definitely the selling point of this movie and the best thing about this movie. They are fast; very quickly! And we are not talking about the rather boring technique that some movies seem to use to record the car "at high speed" at around 40 mph, then speed it up. Oooh no! Not with this movie, you do not do it. These cars zoom at high speed in real time ?? no sophisticated editing tips here. So, we have the speed. Check. What about accidents? Check, check, check! Although there are no cars crumbling ANYWHERE to the incredible BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980), when cars are written in this movie, they certainly collapse! It seems that they are using gunpowder or something similar to build the cars in one go and that KABOOM is on fire. It made me think of THRILLER: A CRUEL IMAGE (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974) in this sense. <br /> <br /> Between these scenes just great (especially the beginning and the end), there are many scenes that slow down everything that is done and that, in my opinion, do not contribute much to the film . Note: more cars are needed! However, there are some exceptions here that are big scenes ?? SPOILER, especially the attempted rape scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a man movie! A boy movie! Full of vroom vrooming vrooming cars around the backcountry and a couple of breasts thrown for good measure too. I would recommend this little movie to anyone even if they are enthusiastic cyclists (!) ?? it's an excellent film that you can simply turn off your brain, sit in your leather chair and put all your volume! I will give him 3.5 luvs on 5 luvs ?? Bruuuuum! P.S ?? Amazon are selling that for just over Â£ 2? it's a good deal, even if the DVD has no particularity.
