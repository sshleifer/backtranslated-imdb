The third film I had to watch at the Philadelphia Film Festival was this exceptional drama from Japan. After leaving the prison, nine escaped convicts plan to find the "key to the universe" that a tenth convict who escaped told them. Along the way, we know each of these men pretty well. Everyone has their own dreams. For much of the film, it seems to be mainly a comedy, but the film ends up becoming a tragedy. All actors give great performances. I can not say much more without ruining the film, but suffice it to say that you end up feeling for some of these people. At 2 o'clock, this film is a bit long, but still good. I have no qualms about recommending it with the warning that there is a kind of disturbing violence for those who have a soft heart. Toshiaki Toyoda made a trip home this year and it makes me want to look for his previous films and look forward to his future films. <br /> <br /> My note: A
