A flawless descent into psychological and physical forgetfulness that will undoubtedly burn images of the sincere brutality and suffering of war in your cerebral cortex in a way that few other films will have wanted. In fact, there is simply no other war movie like this. <br /> <br /> Director Kon Ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of Hiroshima first-hand only 10 days after the bomb was dropped. He said that from this day on, his mission would always be to express the vain and futile violence humans inflict upon each other and themselves. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in the war ... because the paths leading to victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers who parade without soul on roads that only lead to death and destruction. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa manages to get his message across the world through this haunting movie.
