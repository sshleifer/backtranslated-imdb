While she was watching a modern, banal movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (aged 22), she asked me, "Since watching movies since 1938, what is the biggest film of your life?" Boy! What choice is it! It took me all summer thinking and revamping some movies before making my decision. It is "THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE". This film has no flaws. It is a film in which each of the minor characters participates and dialogue is essential to the whole story. There is not one part of the film that can be left out. The fixation of the girl with the lack of hands of her brother, the man who returns home for young adult children who grew up without him and with different ideas, the portrait of a young man whose sole responsibility was a soda jerk who became the leader group of men, and received medals for his action. A woman who must now adapt to the husband who has lost his life for years. The realization of the people who were in the security of their home secure sacrifices made by these ordinary men on their behalf. Look on life to love and live with a man without hands. A first look at the parents and a reaction to the new deformities of their son. A man used to take life and death decisions in an instant, forced to go back to his own way of walking through the credit structure of a conservative bank. It's not nice, teardrop, heartfelt action. THAT WAS THE REAL LIFE! It could not have been described differently. This, my friends, it's like that !! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, do not be discouraged by black and white, because it is one of the best black and white movies, editing and directing you'll ever see. The cast was perfect. If I could, I would make it mandatory for anyone interested in history, filmmaking, creative writing, sociology, family counseling or psychology to visualize and report on this magnificent example of the art of filmmakers.
