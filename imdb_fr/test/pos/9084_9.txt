A film that reveals the discomfort of modern men and women in life confronted with death. We are beyond mere religious belief in the afterlife and, more so, in every kind of hell or paradise. Religion is declared dead. Yet, human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can repel it long enough. In addition, the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe that we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. It was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. Today, things are changing, especially when the President of the United States himself, Barack Obama, in a speech to journalists, speaks of their search for the truth and calls this truth relative, because it is more a quest as the end, goal or achievement. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thought that began to evolve into an obsession with truth, a haunting conception that the truth was unique and irreversibly accessible. Post modernism had not yet arrived in Hollywood, although today it seems to have reached the White House. Some young doctors and medical students decide to die and come back. Technically, it is possible but the result is not surprising. It reactivates the old feelings of guilt and frustration that had been buried in the unconscious. One concerns the father of a Vietnamese veteran who commits suicide, drug addict, another with a young boy who has been stoned by a mortal, another still with a black girl victim and victim of bullying at school primary. out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear of shyness. It's so naive that you could cry shame for these highly qualified young adults who behave like babies crying for their sweetened fruit juice bottles. The film is interesting but in something very different. The scenery and the shot, and every detail or treatment of a detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, in the style of "Death in Venice" or Greenaway, or other works of art that deal with the friendship with the basic enemy who death is. Of course, it does not save the film but at least it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris 1 Panth√©on Sorbonne University, Versailles Saint Quentin University in Yvelines, CEGID
