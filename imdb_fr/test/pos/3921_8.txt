Admittedly, before seeing House of Wax, I thought it would be just a slasher movie for teenagers of poor quality in the footsteps of movies like The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After watching an advanced performance on my university campus, I can honestly say that people at Dark Castle did a great job with making a slasher. <br /> <br /> From the usual basics of a horror movie for teenagers, such as the small group of friends who go on a road trip, encountering a strange detour driving them through roads campaign, meeting scary premises, after the slow but obligatory story, this film reaches really fast pace. Paris Hilton appears in this film as many already know, but I really have to give it to him for his dazzling performance. It is clear that his role was not worth an Oscar, but filmmakers use its appearance to the maximum by inserting into the film two flagrant satires of her, let's just say a less noble media appearance. Ms. Hilton also claims the title of the film's biggest death scene, not just because it was her death scene. <br /> <br /> This film is jam-packed with restless moments and frights, but Jaume Serra has definitely created a suspense and quality tension between the characters. The causes of horror are partly based on the fact that the public cares about the characters, what we do. By making the usual accumulation followed by a loud noise and the camera jerked off, other scary moments. These standard cinema techniques, adopted in many films of the past, are almost perfected with this film and offer many good frights. In fact, there is not a slow moment after their arrival in the small town where is the formidable museum of the house of wax. <br /> <br /> This film owes a lot to many previous films of this genre and other genres, although I'm not too sure of the result of the original 1953 film of the same title. The references to movies such as Texas Chainsaw Masacres, Saw and even Titanic (see the big scene of the death of Paris Hilton and you will understand what I mean) are common, but in the end, the gain will leave you scared and filled if you are looking for a good scare with some laughter. Not bad.
