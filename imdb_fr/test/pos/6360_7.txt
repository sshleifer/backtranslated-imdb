"The Couch Trip" is one of those silly comedies that they shot in the '80s. In this case, Dan Aykroyd embodies a patient with mental disorders and presents himself as a psychiatrist. He then goes to Beverly Hills to replace Charles Grodin. Most of the movie's humor comes from their satirical look on Beverly Hills and the empty lives of people there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid). <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you just watch good time. Do not expect any kind of religious experience. But you will probably laugh a lot about how the people of Beverly Hills display their wealth. Also starring Walter Matthau, Donna Dixon, Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson (from "UHF").
