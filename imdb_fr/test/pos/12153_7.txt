17/02/09 "More" (1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a film that most viewers thought was rather average, I am impressed by the many interpretations that have been proposed. . I only read the web very briefly and I have already learned that "More" is: a romance in the nineteenth century, an allusion to the story of Icarus, a simple film filled with dull people and who does not interests that Complete Pink Floyd. It is therefore fair to say that critical reception is mixed. I would say that these very disparate readings of Barbet Schroeder's debut in 1969 are sufficient proof that "More" is anything but a pretty average film. <br /> <br /> It's not a masterpiece, of course. I touched on Antonioni's "More" as Antonioni's "Easy Rider" and "Blowup" - as a "time capsule" movie, a snapshot of an era, despite the differences in rhythm, style and content between these films . They all have similar flaws - vague characters or downright unimaginable, a game that seems slightly adrift, a relaxed montage and abrupt endings that have outraged the viewer. These films never try to be persuasive or half-hear the audience: they are what they are, man. In and of itself, this is not a problem as long as we keep a memory of the experience. Fortunately, "More" offers the viewer several images, sounds and suggestions that are truly memorable, and that's what saves him. <br /> <br /> Stefan is a young man who comes to Paris from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he meets a group of French hipsters, accompanies them in parties and terribly cold and shy bars before meeting Estelle. The two characters become sexually involved and lovingly and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where Icarus comes in. She is the Sun, he pursues it. You can now guess how all this ends. <br /> <br /> Ibiza is an idyll so far from the hectic urgency of overpopulated Paris that naive Stefan knows he must be good. . Estelle remains elusive and erratic, and the island has a less desirable belly. So far, I had not cared much about one or the other of these characters and their imprecise quest for a really free place, but once the action is reduced to these two, the movie suddenly becomes poignant. In a single exchange of nostalgic dialogue in the secluded villa they live in, the place where their unstable love crystallizes, I went on watching with an optimism that faded to become completely thrilled. I can not think of many other movies that did that. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human in the sense that we can see her going from the intimacy that defines life to disillusionment and cruel coldness. They take a lot of drugs and walk naked on terraces, rocks and beaches. Their lives turn only in each other and in the beautiful Mediterranean environment. For a time, their situation is the essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience in itself. But Stefan is not in control, and it's the fall of more than his future in Ibiza. <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd's score is perfect for exoticism, intimacy and the hunch of "More". This is one of the most memorable inclusions, with the mosquito net around Estelle's bed and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the cover of the album's soundtrack). A scene in which they take acid to escape the withdrawal of the heroine illustrates the fundamental flaws of the couple: they can not "land" without a crash. Maybe they are too close to what they wanted. <br /> <br /> Stefan is never in touch with a family or friends before he arrives in Paris. We have to assume that they have no idea where he is. While other counterculture films from the 1960s focus on debauchery, excesses, media and voyeurism, Schroeder presented a story centered on a man hiding in a small corner of the world and disappearing. slowly.
