I really appreciate this movie. It is a step backwards when our country was really threatened by countries that attacked us or were defeated by the war, that is to say, the Japanese and the Germans. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane have been excellent in the lead roles. The actors ... Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were also outstanding. The direction, pace and finals have been and continue to hold my interest. So much so that I bought my own copy. Thank goodness, Turner Classic Movies presents many truly classic films, including this one. <br /> <br /> Robert Cummings was certainly not a light weight actor and even though I'm a big fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actors, who we have first offered the main role, I do not see what they would have brought to the role that would have surpassed the performance of Bob Cummings. <br /> <br /> This is a movie I like to watch several times and urge others to watch.
