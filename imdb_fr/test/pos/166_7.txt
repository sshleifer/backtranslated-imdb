Story of three eclipse children (maybe even Indigo, ha) who start to love murder. Oh, and the people who are "hot" on their track. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday, a rather mediocre title for the movie, was a pretty little surprise. I was not expecting a movie about the children of bloodthirsty psychopaths. And I can say that it's also one of the best movies I've seen with kids as bad guys. At the end of the film, I seriously wanted these kids to die horribly. <br /> <br /> It's a really strong horror movie of the 80s, but the way these kids are doing with all the chaos and murder is that you can not not go there think. Even the slightest investigation would easily discover these murders. But it seems like there are only a couple of policemen in town, well, in the end, there's only one left, and he seemed like a fool, so I guess they could have been 'draw. Haha, yes, and I am a Chinese jet pilot. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this film gave birth to devilish kids who were more than entertaining, with lots of pre-wedding sex and a decent amount of boobage. No, kiddin! If the less than remarkable title discourages you, move it away from your mind and fire that movie. It is a horror film of the 80s very recommendable and underestimated.
