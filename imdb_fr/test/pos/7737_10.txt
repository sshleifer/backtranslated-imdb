Congratulations to all the wonderful fans of this film who have not only seen and appreciated it, but (based on the many literary comments), GET IT! For my part, I have always considered Paul Mazursky's "Tempest" as a reflection on Shakespeare's play of the same name, as noted in some of the other reviews here. On the other hand, if you are looking for a simpler adaptation of the room, you should look elsewhere. On an experimental basis, however, he is succeeding dramatically. Charming, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... that's all and much more. Casting, places, script and music are just fantastic Cassavetes and Rowland have never been better. Susan Sarandon's tour has more than alluded to the tremendous work she will do in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her film debut memorable and it only remains to like the performance of Raul Julia ... he steals it in several scenes. In addition, Cassavetes, always great, was confident and confident enough to let him interpret! A study on what the thematic elements of Shakespeare's classic might be life if it were updated in "modern times", Mazursky's "Tempest" burns brilliantly!
