An orphan named Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for a pair of chimney sweeps, is falsely accused of stealing the manor where he works, by Mr. Grimes (James Mason) - the real thief - and continues running. Tom's only alibi is the niece of the mansion's owners (Samantha Gates, a slim, blue-eyed blonde with long wavy hair, which I'm sure was the main reason I've often looked at this as a boy). He and his dog jump into a river and a witch transforms them into cartoon characters breathing water! While underwater, he befriends and rescues a group of water-breathing children called baby-babies from a shark. <br /> <br /> A very interesting and fascinating fable, taking place in 1850, which should please all children. The animation (42 minutes of the 85-minute HBO VHS print) is average, but it's better than the most modern animation - even the computer animation! My only real complaint is a hole in the plot caused by a deleted scene. At 42:06, after the first verse of "High Cockalorum", the film describes a scene with swimming octopus, followed by the meeting of Terence by Tom and Jacque. This leads to a scene in which the killer shark (voiced by Mason) drives our heroes into a trap. The shark then greets Tom with "Young Tom, it's so nice to see your naughty mug again" - but this is the first time in the HBO footprint that Tom meets the shark! Most reference works mention a duration of 92 or 93 minutes. Sultan Entertainment and Nelson had already read it. It is therefore very likely that the impressions of HBO are edited and / or compressed in time. Adding insult to injury, MGM released a 76-minute full-screen DVD copy in 2002! Hopefully a restored version will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> The film is copyright Ariadne Films 1978. "Ariadne" is the baby of the water voiced by Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who plays Mason's accomplice, also echoes the electric eel. ALIAS. Slip Slide Adventures.
