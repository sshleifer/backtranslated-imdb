Someone I know said this movie called Flatliners was probably on my street. I was told about this movie after watching the final destination 2 and watching the extra story about the near deth experience. <br /> <br /> I bought Flatliners DVD at a low price of 5 pounds. I went home and looked at him. And I could not help but smile and feel good about how this movie had not been in my life before. The film tells the story of a group of medical students trying to see what it is like after a near-death experience. But then, sins return to reality and can physically hurt them. <br /> <br /> Act Kevin Bacon and Keifer Sutherland is excellent, as you would expect from the couple. And Joel Schmacheur did this film as he did with the misguided boys. <br /> <br /> This is an original and elegant thriller that will appeal to all types of moviegoers.
