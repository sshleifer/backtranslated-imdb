I saw Fame when he came out. This is the 1980 high school class, which was coincidentally my year of graduation. I saw the film in summer between high school and college and, as an interpreter myself, it occupies a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The most critical critics of Fame are generally about continuity, are definitely stories that are not finished or do not make sense. However, these problems are more than offset by the passion and emotion of the characters and the incredible music. <br /> <br /> I saw her again recently and I was surprised to love her as much as I liked doing it. first time. Fame is often compared to Flashdance, which, in my opinion, is not right. Although Flashdance offers good music and Jennifer Beals is beautiful, I think Fame is clearly superior in the development of her characters and the complexity of her stories. For all those who really love the arts, it's a must-see movie.
