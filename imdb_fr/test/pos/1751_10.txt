Well, I may be biased as I grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now ready to be filmed and I just spent the last few hours retrieving a DVD copy as press support for my dad. The film is so harmless and harmless that it is suitable for all ages ... much better than anything Disney has ever done in my opinion (and I worked in the Disney Store !!!). The characters are nice and the price of the best scene is a link between the disturbed marriage (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly, and Smack the mosquito), and the astonishing scene of the nightclubs. The music numbers still hum me 20 years after I watched it for the first time. There is no other movie that I can better recommend to you by keeping the children seated. In fact, all the children I know (thanks to my loving parents from Hoppity) have seen this movie many times. He will always get the best grades for his fabulous love story, brilliant brilliance and originality.
