I watched this movie quite regularly for most of my life, and it never gets old. Despite all the sneaky remarks and insults (mostly from David Spade), "Tommy Boy" has a giant heart. And that's what makes this movie fun after all these years. <br /> <br /> Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), a master car parts salesman. life. But after the death of her husband on her wedding day, Tommy learns that the company is in debt and about to be bought by Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), owner of a huge spares business. So, to save the company, Tommy has to go on the road to sell the company's new brake pads. Richard Hayden (David Spade), Tommy's former classmate, was Big Tom's right hand man. <br /> <br /> The film tells the chemistry that separates the two stars of SNL. (and best friends in real life) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duo has enough comic energy to propel the world. This is the big dumb guy against the smart little guy. It works and some of their scenes are incredibly funny. Farley and Spade are also decent dramatic actors. Although the film is primarily a comedy, it has a lot of drama, but Spade and especially Farley are just as good there that they make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Forgive me, but I have to talk a little bit more about Chris Farley. I read his biography ("For all those who are interested in it):" Chris Farley's show: a biography in three acts "and his understanding of who Chris was in real life made this film more special for me Chris Farley was really a good person who struggled and finally failed to overcome his addictions.Although this was the first movie in which he played a major role, it was his best film, which really showed who he was and how good he was, knowing Chris's story adds an extra layer to this movie, though it does not make him any less funny. <br /> <br /> Farley and Spade are paired with good screen distribution Rob Lowe is suitably thin like Tommy's "new brother" and Bo Derek is as strong as his mother-in-law Brian Dennehy is awesome as Big Tom Dennehy, it's easy to believe they're father to son. Big Tom is as crazy as his son, even if he is smarter and p Read More Dan Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy the hard truth of the ad. Julie Warner is also good in the love of Tommy, Michelle. <br /> <br /> Peter Segal is for me one of the great directors of comedy. He keeps the pace fast and energetic, but most of all, he knows how to make funny comedy. He does not practice jokes and understands that funny actors know what they are doing and he allows them to do it. But Segal goes even further. He gives "Tommy Boy" a friendly, almost nostalgic tone, which pulls the strings of the heart (really) and tickles the funnybone. <br /> <br /> Critics did not like "Tommy Boy". Shame on them. A movie does not need to be super sophisticated or subversive intellectual to be funny (God forbid, Farley and Spade were forced to do a dumb comedy at the "The Office"). It's an excellent movie and one of my favorites of all time.
