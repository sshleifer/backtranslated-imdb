If we compare the film industry to an ocean, we tend to observe only the surface. Under the impulse of the Hollywood marketing force, we've all seen war movies like Saving Private Ryan, The Red Line Thin, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. But under the splashed waves grow in silence, from time to time, less known pearls. When you choose one and examine it carefully, you wonder why this pearl is almost unknown and why it is not already on the crown. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is such a jewel. Why, he has a bunch of multi-million dollar actors? No, there are thousands of extras? No, it has breathtaking, spectacular and brilliant computer-aided visual effects? Not at all. So, what's so special? In a word, it is a reality of the past purely recreated and transposed to celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the bloodiest battle in history is here. Soldier, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, village fires, collapsing buildings, dilapidated suburbs, gunshots, explosions, tanks in flames, soldiers shot dead, burned alive, stricken by tanks or shredded all . But the real horror is elsewhere. People are reduced to mere pawns, without being able to change anything. The soldiers we follow in the movie try to leave the combat zone and fail. The civilians remain prostrate in the middle of nowhere, shouting only for their children killed. Mercyless, the gigantic war machine, mixes men, equipment, villages, cities and claims even more victims and destruction. <br /> <br /> In all this collective madness, a group of German soldiers is trying to survive and maintain at least a minimum level of normality. They do their duty and fight with courage. But, as everyone knows, the battle is almost lost when people begin to lose confidence and lose confidence. We see how all these people are abandoned, how they plan to desert, how they struggle to catch the last plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how very wounded soldiers were treated as simulants and shot, how they were forced to run a small group of Russian civilians, including a young boy, how they eventually discovered a literally full-ceilinged place of food and drink - meant only for "senior" officers, of course. One by one, they fall dead. The end of the film is one of the most bitter, depressing and touching moments I have ever seen, all on the magnificent score of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The war has destroyed everything in its path. <br /> <br /> This film is a must for everyone. A true movie buff should have it in his collection. The powerful anti-war message must be a warning to all of us. Unfortunately, humanity never learns, nor do politicians. Self-destruction is in our DNA and human pain seems to last forever. Can we be reasonable enough to stop the war?
