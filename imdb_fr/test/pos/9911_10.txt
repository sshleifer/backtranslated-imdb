It may not be the most exciting or incredible episode they've ever made, but in my opinion it's still one of the most original episodes of Star Trek and Sci-Fi. Most of the ideas in the Sci-Fi retro series, including Star Trek, have been reused many times. This remains essentially a unique triumph. This among the episodes that impressed me the most towards the end. <br /> <br /> Another thing that pleases me in this episode is the way it has created such a captivating and captivating story with so many special effects. Now, without criticizing the episode, I must admit that the effects are very dated, but again, what can you expect from a 1967 TV show? But still in this episode, the creature ("Horta") is actually a carpet covered with colored rubber. Yet you forget about it after about a minute and you start thinking about it only as it is supposed to be. In addition, the caves do not look exactly like rock, but again, you forget them after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof of acting quality and a good story, which can make you ignore the visual effects. <br /> <br /> The game of the main actors is, as usual, great. This episode features Spock's second mind feld series and is one of my favorites. So, to put it simply, Leonard Nimoy is certainly a thief and his acting is excellent. It's not that Kirk or Bones do not get their share of the episode, but Spock is the most intriguing of it. I like the fact that the episode does not concern a particular character, but evolves around the trio that deals with a strange problem. It's also nice to see an episode that does not just happen in the Enterprise. <br /> <br /> Like most episodes of Star Trek, this episode tells us to have an open mind. I will not spoil the story, but evolve around what at first seems to be a typical monster story. He has killed several humans and must be killed. But is that really all there is to it? I can assure you that the explanation at the end will not disappoint you. It's still my favorite episode of Star Trek TOS and I give it a 10/10.
