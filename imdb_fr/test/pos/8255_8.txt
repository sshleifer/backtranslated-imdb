I recently bought this movie on DVD at a discount store for $ 5. Although it's a no-frills DVD on the Geneon label (just the movie that starts playing immediately - no menu, no special features), the picture and sound quality was EXCELLENT. The film is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in history. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan, whom I must admit I have not heard, plays the lead role - Pinky Green. A charming young man who spent too much of his few years in prison and now wants to go straight but is not allowed to do it! He portrays an American in England. David Niven plays the role of naughty leader, also with the great charm for which he is famous. Bad, but with scruples when he refuses to refuse Pinky his "punch" for the job. Whack, in England, is apparently the fair share of the catch and not a bullet in the head as in the American gangster movies! All the actors are doing a great job producing a very believable film. <br /> <br /> What is perhaps best for me is that the whole movie is very nice and understandable (I am often lost in the confusion of various characters) without any special effect. No blood. No violence. Not even a single chase by car! Just a story well written, well interpreted, well directed and well photographed! If I had complaints about the film, I would question the music. What does bluegrass music do in a bank story set in England?
