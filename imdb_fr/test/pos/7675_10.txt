The many comments from other people were very instructive and I join their calls for the release of Porgy and Bess, the 1959 film. At the beginning of my adolescence, I joined a record club and this album was a. free ones that I chose to join. I knew that some of the voices were dubbed, but only Robert McFerrin was recognized on the album. Recently, my daughter bought a CD in Austria, I think. The quality is excellent, so I do not understand why it is available in Europe at CBS Records, Inc., while I was unlucky in local stores. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have never seen the film, but for years. have pleaded with local video stores to get it. Now, I know why he was never available. <br /> <br /> I add my voice to others who argue with the heirs of the rights and properties and who agree to release them, even if they perceive it imperfectly - the beauty of the music and the history touched so many of us who would never have experienced otherwise. <br /> <br /> Trudy
