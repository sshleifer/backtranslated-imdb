It's halfway to being a top movie. The first part, which distorts the Hollywood "social message" films, is absolutely brilliant. It's a riot from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The second part, which presents the main characters of the story, is also excellent. We have a lot of great comic book layouts, top-notch performances, and the dialogue is really dynamic. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <br /> <br /> The one who thinks it pissed me off Although the film is the end, which, in my opinion, contradicts all that is passed before. My interpretation was that this film eliminated all the silly prejudices and insinuations of gossiping in small towns and the sensational national tabloid. I loved that the film advocates the cause that a person's sexuality is NOT determined by his hobbies, idiosyncrasies, sense of fashion or anything else. And then the end will reinforce all the gossip and stereotypes that the film was able to get in the first place. It turns out that everyone was 100% right !!! (godamit!) It was very disappointing for what was actually a beautiful story.
