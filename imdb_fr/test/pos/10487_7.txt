HONOR AWARD aka POWER AWARD is an ambitious Western melodrama, a light on action, that seeks to tell a version of the old West of the assassination of JFK. In 1881, the president went to Dallas where he was shot down by a window as he drove through the city by car. Corrupt officials have committed murder and have a humble slave take rap. Our hero, Giuliano Gemma, serious but tender, aims to unravel the plot. An engaging story, daring by its subject, but entertaining despite the rarity of shoot-em-up actions. The film is a 7 out of 10, despite the poor presentation of the DVD, which is too dark with a mediocre sound. Look for a good copy.
