Jack Webb is fascinating as a Marine Corp Exercise Instructor in the Internet Division. Webb plays Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair Marine whose job is to prepare young teenagers for a possible fight. No one would have played this role better than Jack Webb. As a former Marine, I can assure you that this is the most accurate film on basic training in the Corporation. Extremely entertaining!
