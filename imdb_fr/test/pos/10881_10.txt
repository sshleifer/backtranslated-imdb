definitely the best game for N64. I say the most that I was very disappointed never to die tomorrow, but the world is not promising enough to be better than Goldeneye (according to the website). I love Goldeneye so much that I find something to do every time I play it. I even created my own missions for levels. The multiplayer mode is the best of all games and the graphics are breathtaking even now. I remember the first day that I had this, wishing that they come back and transform all the movies on the bonds in games. Can you imagine driving this speed boat live and let it die and do those incredible jumps, or fight ninjas or fight the jaws of the spy who loved me and Moonraker. (I think fighting it in these games would be more fun than in the Aztec). Why not pursue Sanchez in the gas trucks or scalling St. Cerils just for your eyes? oh well let me go back to the current game. All levels are unique and create very fun killing environments. there are many places where you can hide to meet people (especially the statue park) and this game is not worth renting, you really have to buy it today.
