A few years ago, SCREAM had usurped the genre slasher / horror with insightful and timid young people, knowing every turn of the book: what to do and not what to do in a precarious situation, a small film produced in Russia was presented without any pretensions grandiose. <br /> <br /> This film was a silent witness. Featuring a cast of unknowns (with the exception of a very short cameo from Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes would have been filmed eight years before the shooting of this film), the film tells the story of a silent makeup artist , Billie, who works on a film in Russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend, Andy. She is not aware that the filming closed when she goes to collect her stuff and inadvertently falls on an extremely bloody porn shoot. Overwhelmed with horror, she warns the murderers of her presence, a lawsuit ensues and she is finally rescued by Andy who takes her home to alert the police. The problem is that there is no body, no evidence that something like that has happened. Even in this case, a mysterious inspector seems to be on Billie's side .... <br /> <br /> And to say more would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the kind of film that requires a meticulousness comparable to that of the most complex and intelligent thriller, because it is a complicated thriller that pays its royalties to films like WAIT UN DARK and the best of Hitchcock in his film . choice of camera cuts, impassive humor, reactions of Americans in helpless foreign countries, and breathtaking suspense until it seems like something has to break. Even if the story becomes a little too implausible because the story becomes the center of an even bigger conspiracy, the film manages not to deceive the audience with low blows (for example, the sudden appearance of a person with the camera accompanied by a swell of violins) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow. Very clever.
