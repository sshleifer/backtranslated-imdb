Some people do not like the magical elements of ROS, but that is what sets this series apart, and the fact that the producers decided to dress the actors with appropriate period clothing and armor - not hats. anachronistic feathers, multicolored tights and armor plates! <br /> <br /> But I'm really writing to comment on a previous poster article. Uh, Michael Praed did not leave ROS to make Jules Verne! 15 years ago between these two series. Yeah, I agree and Michael could also agree that leaving ROS was not a good thing - but it was a coveted Broadway role that tempted him in 1984 and then Dynasty with his pay megabucks ...
