*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved the scenery and I always laughed all along the movie. The acting was great, my favorite part being that of Howard (Kevin Kline) who wants to become a "manly man". The fiance and the parents did a great job of support. Spoiler Warning: The fact that his conservative family was accepted and tried to be polite was comforting and credible. My only problem with the end was the fact that Howard was actually gay. The film is meant to be "whoever you want", but the film does the opposite. Howard's logic behind his "discovery" is the fact that he loves Barbra Streisand's films and likes to dance to music. His manners and tastes seem to be gay, and it is not until he is noticed that he realizes it. Rather than freeing Howard, it will disturb him. Oh, he likes to dance to music, so he has to be gay. Her marriage confession felt like she was complying with the wishes of society. In the end, the movie becomes a gay rights film, which was not the original course. It becomes almost bland with the rest. I think the film would have been better if Howard had been straight. That would have been more true for the message.
