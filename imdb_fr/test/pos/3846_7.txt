A group of cats tries to find its way after being kidnapped by a greedy butler. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats is considered one of the best 2D animations of Walt Disney with its charming screenplay and its characters. The magic of Snow White or the Book of the jungle have quite the magic . <br /> <br /> The slow opening will raise the eyebrows to the younger ones, but as soon as the cats settle in the story, the entertainment begins. <br /> <br /> Young cats create the most fun with a charming young-hearted rivalry, the special type of bond that any brother or sister of any age can relate to. <br /> <br /> Not the funniest photo of Disney but there are great comic moments, especially involving cats and dogs. The representation of gangsters is very impressive and just as fun. <br /> <br /> The story, after the boring start, is always entertaining and exactly matches the family movie. There are virtually no failures and no boring moments. The trip to find your home is interesting and you will have the sense of exploration, not to mention two very strange British swans. <br /> <br /> With Disney, you always receive a strong and meaningful message. With the Book of the Jungle, it's your place, with Beauty and the Beast, you explore the importance of inner beauty. However, with this image of 1970, it seems that something is missing. The film has the importance and relevance of being at home but is not cemented enough; it seems to go too far and unimportant. <br /> <br /> My sister and I found it very strange to watch this as some of the main characters were cast by the Jungle Book cast. <br /> <br /> Despite the bad start and confusion of his preaching message, it's a fun family film, with a good musical score and some wacky characters that viewers of all ages can understand.
