CONRACK (20th Century-Fox, 1974), following the era of the "Blackploitation" of the 1970s, offered the public a discreet, sincere and ordinary drama. To offer a very different fair to his audience (which was much more general than these "Gansta" films); to be a realistic dose of realism that offered a solitary counterweight to these "shoot-'em-ups". <br /> <br /> REPLACE key characters who were detectives, super-flies and flies / macks / pimps (make your choice in terms of terminology), was a lonely, humble and gentle teacher. The academician we are talking about is the main character, Pat Conroy; who is the one and only teacher hired to take responsibility for some kind of old one-room school on an island off the coast of South Carolina. <br /> <br /> "CONRACK" (Jon Voight), the name that the young people call him finds the conditions in the school terribly late. In addition to the physical properties of this "Little Red School", any systematic and gradually graduated educational system was totally absent. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, by the way, did we mention that new complications for a successful education? company manifested itself in two irrefutable facts. It was these Pat Conroy was both an outsider and he was white; almost all the inhabitants of this coastal island were black and very poor. <br /> <br /> PERPETUATING these unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local school board; being the principal of the school, Mrs. Scott (Madge Sinclair) and the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington (Mr. Hume Cronyn). Between the two, we understand that the teacher, as a man down on the totem, is powerless in almost every respect to make significant and lasting improvements. <br /> <br /> BUT don 'If you tell a young Turk, like Pat Conroy, he can not. (Can not do anything, it is). "Conrack" spends a year of unorthodox indoor performances and makes real progress; but alas, the hard-headed instructor will not yield and recognize the authority of his superiors. While he is, by law and without his knowledge, at the service of the child's pleasure; he disobeys Mr. Skeffington's specific order and prohibition to take his children with them to South Carolina for Halloween, for a ride or treatment; even go to the frantic act of stopping with them at Skeffington's residence. <br /> <br /> NEXT we see a Western Union Telegram messenger singing happily as he travels from the mainland of Carolina to the island; where he gives Conroy the telegram announcing that he had been dismissed from that school and that district. <br /> <br /> NOT SUSPECTING him to go to bed, Pat sues Mr. Skeffington, Director, Ms. Scott, and Board of Education protest against dismissal on the grounds that it was illegal . By impartially reviewing both the offense and the law, the judge asks Skeffington whether there are lesser penalties that could replace Conroy's separation from the school system; to which he receives a negative answer. Appropriately, the judge rejects the lawsuit with his hammer saying, "It's very simple!" <br /> <br /> The story ends with a bittersweet conclusion as the students of "Conrack" see him go to the launch on the continent, while a phonograph record gives us the 5th SYMPHON from BEETHOVEN; who had played an important role in Conroy's educational agenda, as well as in our history. <br /> <br /> IN THE HUMBLE, the author of this story (which we believe to be at least semi-autobiographical, even main character the name of its author), was much more than the narrative of a localized event . For me, my friend Schultz and myself; It is a kind of microcosm that represents the deplorable conditions in which public schools are located throughout the country. (Just a notice) <br /> <br /> AS REGARDS THIS film, it was one of the many films describing the people's magazines; leading a life of "quiet desperation" in the country's great hinterlands, located outside DC Beltway and the urban business and communications centers on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. <br /> <br /> IN HIS OWN Little way, it's a good movie, which would soon be joined in the vaults of 20th Century-Fox by works as remarkable as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. (both of TCF in 1979). <br /> <br /> SEE if you are not yet. Recommended by both Schulz and his friend. * <br /> <br /> NOTE: * Of course, it's me! <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
