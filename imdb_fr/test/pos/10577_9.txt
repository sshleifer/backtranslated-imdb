I had never read Sarah Waters' novels or watched Tipping the Velvet. I only heard of Fingersmith when I flipped through the "The L word" websites. Fingersmith's plot interests me, but I went back and said, "Lesbians in the Victorian era, it never ends well, I'm sick of these series and lesbian movies that go nowhere" . <br /> <br /> However, during Christmas, my local DVD store offered a discount to Fingersmith, I brought the DVD and my life has never been so colorful <br /> <br /> This mini-series deserves to be darling and congratulated. The acting is so great that I call it rare. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton and many others whom I can not name everything have brought light and darkness to their characters. Just by a small gesture, a small look, a touch, they made their characters real and as a spectator, I could not do anything, but bring them home, keep them close to you. <br /> <br /> Fingersmith, settled in the Victorian Quarter, tells the story of Sue, a thief who loves and lives with her "family" of pickpockets. She did not know that her fate was related to Maud Lily - a shy, shy girl growing up in a mansion miles and miles away. Maud's mother left him a fortune, but Maud herself can not touch it unless she is married. Worse yet, Maud's uncle makes sure that's never the case by keeping her in jail at home. <br /> <br /> Enter Mr. Gentlement, a charming thief with such a mean heart. He wants Maud's fortune for himself, and to do this, he places Sue as Maud Lily's maid, asking him to persuade Maud to flee with him. in time, things would be simple if Sue did not fall in love with Maud. <br /> <br /> And things would be simple if the story was the one I just told. I do not want to ruin, so I'd like to stop there. But I can assure you that everything is twisted and turned before you can even be aware of what happened. Once this has happened, then you wonder what will happen next. On top of that, the story is filled with a passion that is unlike any other. There is no questioning about sexuality, the question of sexuality, "Oh my god, I love girls", because the girls of Fingersmith are buried so deep in the dark that they can hardly worry about it. the story with such a twisted plot moves as smooth as water, working passionately, but strangely calm. <br /> <br /> The weeks have passed since I watched "Fingersmith", yet Maud's eyes still haunt me and Sue's words still warm my heart "pearl, pearl, pearl", at- she declared. And such pearl it is.
