I was very happy and at the same time very surprised by other positive comments written by non-Koreans below. This film is incredibly impressive and shows a very "sad but warm" vision of typical Korean life. I thought other strangers would not understand this delicate feeling and underestimated this quiet movie as a boring movie, but I was wrong. The appeal of this film could also be difficult to avoid for foreigners. (Even without subtitles ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some points that others have missed. Of course, this film describes the love between a man and a woman. However, the theme is far beyond that. In fact, it is time, the value of memory and death. In this film, the emphasis is not on "love" between two people. As some have pointed out, they do not kiss, they do not kiss, even without holding hands. So love itself is not finished (either positively or negatively) in the movie. What haunts Jungwon (a main actor) is his impending death. He lacks time, he can not hold it back, leaving a few behind him, including his father and of course, Darim (a maid). So the problem is how he can cope with death and leave something precious in his short life, not how he can make love to Darim. <br /> <br /> This kind of theme seems very familiar to us. There are many films about patients with incurable diseases, such as "Love Story". However, what makes this film remarkable is the way Jungwon treats his death. He is a loser, but tried to do his best during his lifetime, IN A SILENT MANNER. He does not tell his death to anyone around him. He hides something in his mind but without rage, hate, revenge. He just tried to do his best while he was alive. This limited communication and obedience to fate is the typical mentality of Koreans and the point that most Westerners do not understand or, at best, misunderstand. <br /> <br /> This theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film (surprisingly, his debut). Some say he is very influenced by the Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro, who directed Tokyo Story. Indeed, I remember reading in a magazine that the director himself had admitted to being influenced by Ozu. I do not know his style very well to compare it to that of Ozu, but they have similar points and others do not. The weak angles and the static cameras remind us particularly of Ozu's style. But, again in terms of theme, this Korean director seems to have a vision a little more warm and optimistic. <br /> <br /> It is expressed concisely with Jungwon's latest photo. Very well done and really heartbreaking scene, I think. In fact, the director first came up with the idea of ​​this film when he participated in the funeral of a very famous Korean folk singer who died young of a mysterious suicide. They say he saw the singer's picture at the funeral and thought about a film about death and remembrance. (And maybe hope for the remains, I think ...) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone with a keen interest in Korean cinema and culture. In my opinion, this film can be compared to other films like Tokyo history and a kind of American beauty. It's great if without language barrier. The DVD version will hit the market in February, which could be a great help for foreigners with English subtitles.
