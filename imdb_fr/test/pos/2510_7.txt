Although it's really a nice way to spend a few hours and it's always worth watching, this film never quite meets the objectives it needs for two reasons. First, after the first forty-five minutes or so, he focuses heavily on Helen and Johnny, characters much less interesting than most others. Janet, Jennifer, George and Miss Scattergoods are all much more attractive. Although it works at the beginning, since in life we ​​do not always know everything about all the others and that, as it is argued, Helen is perhaps a little involved in life, she wears out quickly and we want to see more characters. . <br /> <br /> Second, the movie seems to be lost in terms of intrigue in the second half. The letter itself is much less important than it was in the first half and, again, while it works well in some respects, it seems odd to leave as much potential in the first half. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is sweet and good-natured, with some really hilarious moments - for example, Janet explaining condiments to an avid audience. Helen's lazy but discreetly desperate atmosphere is heavy and the meaning of life in a small seaside town is accurately portrayed, but the movie is not as smart as it tries to be. I just miss both a light romantic comedy and a clever portrait of life. However, it's always good and if you have the opportunity, it's definitely worth it.
