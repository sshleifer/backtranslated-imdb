KRAMER VS KRAMER has won five Oscars, including Best Picture in 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows a director whose life is turned upside down when his wife, eight years old, leaves, leaving him to take care his son build a relationship with him that he never had. Robert Benton's incisive scenario presents us with imperfect but real human beings with hearts, souls and brains. For example, in the scene where Joanna tells Ted that she's leaving him, she's not just slamming the door ... she's giving him the keys, her credit cards, the dry cleaning ticket, telling her what bills have been paid, and informs her that she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married, no more. This decision to leave was not a whim ... it was a thought and Joanna felt, with no choice but to leave, if she left, she would do it right ... and without a specific plan, she did not think that it was right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing bacon back home that he did not know that his life at home was falling apart. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar performing Joanna, the unfortunate wife for whom we have sympathy at the beginning of the film, but that everything changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at its peak here. I'm still torn during the scene where he's trying to explain to Oscar-nominated Billy (Oscar-nominated Justin Henry) why his mother is gone and does all this in a whisper of the stage or when he meets Joanna on his return and the drags into a wall (a Hoffman moment not in the script and Streep was not informed to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry is right, Billy, this confused little boy who does not know why his mother left and who does not know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also received an Oscar for Margaret, the neighbor of Ted and Joanna, who changed allegiance at the conclusion of the film. It's an intense family drama but there's laughter here too ... Billy and chocolate chip ice cream ... Billy sulky because Ted is late to take him for a party ... Billy catching his father's (JoBeth Williams) one-night stand on the way to the bathroom completely naked, but these are the moments of human drama you remember ... Ted crossing Manhattan with Billy in his arms for himself go to the emergency room after Belly fell from the jungle gym ... Ted get fired just before starting his battle for the guard and instead of doing a scene, he tells the guy in a whisper ... " Shame on you." And of course, the finale where Joanna tells Ted that she does not take Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why would she have so much trouble suing for custody and changing her mind? But this is a small flat about a beautiful film, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and perfectly interpreted by a leading cast. A must see.
