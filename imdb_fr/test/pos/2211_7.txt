We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is kind, friendly, smiles often, but strangely brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot-savant sister recites original poetry, which excites the community for her sister's writing. Unfortunately, this is Evie's poetry. While their mother is happy again and the boy next door is showing interest in Evie, Evie is just trying to figure out what she really wants to do. <br /> <br /> What to keep in mind while watching this movie Evie is really. For such a brutally honest person who does not mind telling the Ivy-League guys that she does not respect them, it seems odd that she is capable of lying. For a person so happy and happy, she has no emotion about some problems. These are not flaws of character, they are the development of the plot, and they mean a lot more than they seem at first. <br /> <br /> It's sort of a melodrama: a character lies, the personalities of other characters propel them through the drama that relationships are held at risk. But in terms of writing, it's very fresh and daring. The acting game makes writing very easy (maybe the silly-wise sister could have been better played), and it's a real pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> Achievement and cinematography are not so good. . They are acceptable, and the world of Evie is wrapped in colors and light, which gives very beautiful images, but it is not very coherent. It is not really a defect due to a low production value, but to this same value are authentic stories and a real concern for the characters. So, even if it's not a perfect movie, it's certainly a nice movie. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
