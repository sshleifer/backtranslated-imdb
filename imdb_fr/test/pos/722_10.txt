I watched this movie without knowing anything about it. I assumed it was a sci-fi movie. How wrong I was. The plot is exciting and intelligent, the cast is charismatic and the whole movie makes you think of a change. Some puzzles left me perplexed, but the answers were rather simple. I'm quite confused by the low rating of this movie because I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix, then you'll like this. There are no major special effects or sophisticated gadgets here. It's about intrigue, building characters, and creating an atmosphere. It's a film that finally gives no answer that may irritate some people, but I thought the ending was great. I'm still not sure if the movie is based on a true story or not .......
