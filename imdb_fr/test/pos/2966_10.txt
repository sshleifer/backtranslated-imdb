I liked this film. I did not really know what it was before I started watching the movie, but I still enjoyed it. It was a girl (Meredith Monroe) whose mother did not want her to turn around like her. She meets and falls in love with a boy (Riley Smith) who is the city for a charity football game. It's a good movie. I just hope it will come back or come out on video.
