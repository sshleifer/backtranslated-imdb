I do not see what the problem is with SOME people and their need for intellectual humor. You have to get your head out of your ass if you can not find this hilarious movie! If it's not your "cup of tea", so to speak, then look at it for what it really is - a damn funny movie. Maybe they tried to do yet another drug movie / T & A, but in this case, they really hit the spot. This is especially fun for fans of Ali G because he delivers everything we have come to love and expect from him. So I say BIG UPS to Ali G, and if it's not your thing, do not moan - BATTY BOY!
