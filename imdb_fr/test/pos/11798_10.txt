I had never heard of this film when I was given to translate, so I did not know what to expect. I checked on IMDb and became curious. It did not take long to realize that it was a jewel. Exceptional performances, a beautiful story, both well directed and well written. It's hard to compare to other movies, but "Stand by me" comes to mind, although it has as many differences as "The cure". The story of an extraordinary friendship between young boys, as well as dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this film and "Stand by me". Apart from that, "The cure" is a good movie in its own right, which deserves greater recognition. It's dramatic, but also adventurous, sad, but also humorous. I can not think of one thing that bothers me about it. That said, I do not want to sound like it's a "perfect movie", whatever that means, but rather that I loved it a lot, that it touched me a lot and that it would not change anything. I will not go into a detailed description of the story / plot, partly because it would be too general or too revealing, and partly because you can find this information elsewhere on the site. In closing, I can only say: wonderful film, see it if you have the opportunity.
