In Wolfgang Peterson's line of fire is cunning and sometimes represents a real ride, even once or twice, we might have the impression that we have taken similar paths before. How not to do it when Clint Eastwood, just after (allegedly) closing the book on his Western heritage, probably closes the one on his sandy detective photos (do not count Blood Work in this place). But there's more to it because the character of Eastwood, here a hard-working secret agent, bitten with demons and hard as nails, has a rather charming side, even the most romantic side that one does not have. has never been able to see on the photos springs his lines of mark. There are complexities here that do not rest solely on the usual boastfulness, and it is worthy of a note for how a story so artificial (which did not save Kennedy from his assassination in 63) is made a bit credible among the rest of his personality, who more than likely hides his wounds, most of the time. Eastwood however goes to town to make a big presence in the film and, under the circumstances, the character seems to have been tailor-made for him. <br /> <br /> But there is the risk that his role in the film is slightly conventional (we still have scenes of the type 'Harry' in which he is smarter and smarter than everyone else in the room , and gets scolded and told by the top official, here a chief of staff), including Here, we protect a president whom we never see nor never know. Even the romantic sub-plot, which is somehow undercooked if there are some macho laughter, would make the picture a little less crisp if the other aspect almost Dirty Harry did not intervene: an indelible villain. This time, there is an additional suspense in Hollywood, but an extremely intelligent suspense (almost smarter than the rest of the film deserves), with the character of "John Booth", played in an Oscar-nominated performance of John Malkovich as someone who is more described as a predator than an assassin. It is possible that the character of Eastwood has a problem, but Malkovich prevails over some of his former naughty counterparts by being extremely cool and uncollected (there is this devastating and crazy scene where he kills the cashier and his mate. As his past is revealed, there is always this element of "what is hell with this guy" that prevents the audience and Eastwood's agent from guessing and become paranoid. This is a classic performance of Malkovich, extremely frightening and always measured according to the level of madness and professionalism. <br /> <br /> It is also, in addition to the conventional points, a neat photo of Peterson and his company, and they are pretty close to the pulpy realism of Don Siegel. But Peterson also has some cinematic tricks that made me smile sometimes. Whenever anyone makes such a blatant but thrilling tribute to Vertigo, jumping from roof to roof, the hero swaying from the ledge, the "twist" still gives me chills in the back. There are also telephone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depths of the game of cat and mouse, probably another kick to Hithcock. But in the end, even with all the excitement and brutal danger and climactic formalism of the climax, it's also an image of the characters in some ways, and everything is done to give the audience a nice amount of thought to reflect film thriller. Eastwod plays a leading role, Russo plays the role of possible female love, sincere and mature, and Malkovich is at the top of the ranking. There are also some notable support roles, as well as a nice studio score. One of the best movies of 1993.
