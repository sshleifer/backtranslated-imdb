Feisty Dianna Jackson (a brave performance by the beautiful former Playboy playmate Jeanne Bell) travels to Hong Kong to eliminate the evil heroine ring that murdered her brother. Assisted by friendly karate master Joe (amiable Chiquito), Dianna is confronted with the challenge of undercover drug officer Elaine (the beautiful and gorgeous blonde Pat Anderson) and Charlie's arrogant and ambitious romance (tried with aplomb supremely arrogant Stan Shaw) then Sid (an efficient and slimy Ken Metcalfe) against drugs. The director Cirio H. Santiago, who works from a cheekily naughty script written by Dick Miller (!), Sinks into a lively and hectic 72-minute race with a plethora of free nudities with cattail and many scenes of poorly organized martial arts fights. (Bell is clearly doubled by a squat wearing a giant afro wig!). The culmination is suspicious when a topless Bell alone beats a group of thugs in his hotel room. Felipe Sacdalan's rough, grainy and scratched cinematography, the clumsy use of sluggish slowness, the funky-groovin 'score, the ridiculously inept combat choreography, and the surprisingly horrible conclusion add immensely to the overall enjoyment of this tiny mincing deliciously mottled. hoot.
