I really liked this movie. I thought it was very well done. The interaction between the characters went wonderfully well, as did the characterization. The actors were definitely credible. The plot was very deep and intriguing. Although some parts are a little slow and sometimes a little boring, it is worth looking at several times. The chemistry between the three main actors was excellent. If you do not want to watch it for that, then at least watch it for the drama between the characters. I mean, it was just "Whoa!" It was as if I could not look away. The whole movie caught my attention and kept my interest even through the slow parts. I loved this movie and almost everything. I loved the end because it was very interesting and, if you watch the movie a second time, it makes perfect sense. But I do not spoil anything.
