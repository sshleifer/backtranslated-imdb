The slogan on the box is entitled "100 PEDAGONED PASSENGERS ... 3 000 VIPERS VENOMES!" You must almost admire this degree of "shit we will never keep our promise". I could admire the hucksterism of The Asylum even more so if they made movies that, well, you know, were good or, at the very least, worth it. Haha, and that's what I like in these movies. They are garbage. You put them in a toilet and then you flush the toilet. This is worth the price if you are a fan of cheese movies. This can become a cult classic among many fans. The scenes gores are effective, there is not much to say, it is a film of Z parody the new film of Samuel L. Jackson, good God, it is perhaps better then who knows!
