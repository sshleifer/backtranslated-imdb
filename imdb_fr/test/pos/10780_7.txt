Talk Radio sees a man stumble into life, an American dream, by chance, no matter what occupation he occupies in a store; presenter of a local radio program before going to the same job as later, subscribed nationally. It's a role he adopts from his own aggression and his natural manners, a crazy approach to freedom of speech while he attacks everything and almost everyone, even those who often call to be d agree with him or compliment him. His role as a man who reigns over all that is good, bad, right, wrong, political, religious, moral and immoral is something that people seem to assume in a form; that of "it is entertaining and deserves to be granted", but also on a plane of rejection and antagonism ?? two things born of things apparently encouraged in professional life in the western world. This, to a man as he reaches the peak of his art through the American Dream and freedom of speech when people indulge in a man but do anything but what he says. <br /> Talk Radio begins with a montage of tall and imposing buildings in a business district of Dallas, Texas. The skyscrapers are turned at right angles and dominate the viewer, as well as everything in the vicinity, while a man's voice tears images, issues statements and information about objects while these buildings monolithic dominate the screen. They are the very physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we are learning to be a radio DJ is the oral representation of the free West; personal speech and opinions on anything and everything. Stone will finish his film in exactly the same way that it started, although the film is anything but a circular journey of sorts, as the characters undergo monumental changes, both in what they see and their livelihoods. The plans of the buildings serve rather as an anchor around which the study is observed. Ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist; people adhere to it, but it hurts them more than good; before restoring the fact that this proud way of life still exists and will continue to exist by presenting the types of people exposed in the film until someone or something radically changes things. <br /> <br /> The DJ is Barry Champlain, a man who broadcasts a radio show at a local Texas station and deals with almost everything. Champlain's somewhat carefree attitude towards a fairly explosive content is established when he steals from a call to an authoritarian man who recently visited a Holocaust museum to a young addict whose girlfriend is supposed to have made a overdose and who makes fun of a pizza shop. For us, the content seems quite shocking; For these people, everything seems to be as if nothing had happened, which has sowed serious doubts about the doubt and the horror in the minds of us, the newcomers in all this. <br /> <br /> What Barry's show is about, nobody ever really seems to establish: everything and nothing. Indeed, the time is taken in the form of jingles or dialogues so that the programs immediately before and after the Champlain show deal with specific subjects; gardening, for example, is driven by calm and methodical people who, I am sure, do not go from one hazard to another or from one extreme to another while increasing the stakes. One wonders what Barry's jingle is, the one who plays around lunchtime during someone else's show: "Coming up, Barry Champlain's show! With the idiot of the village and psychotic addicts! " Indeed, the introductory part of his show is full of clarity, it shouts to the public, since it is accompanied by a cutting rock song. <br /> <br /> Barry's success is part of the national syndication proposal. He was born of confrontation and a relationship built on the contempt he has for his listeners and that they have for him. The deepening of the material and the rise of the stakes should put into question the point at which they think they can go further, and know whether to progress on a track for the pleasure of the entertainment is really worth it. It is when the series reaches this level of diffusion that Barry seems to have been stuck for the first time in his life in broadcasting, when a supposed serial rapist calls and leaves most of the time a little stunned. It is at this point that the camera stops on Barry and, in terms of depth of focus, encompasses the same impending and imposing buildings on which the film started that are outside the window, directly behind Barry. They stay tall and proud. More specifically, the ideologies on which they were built and this advancement of freedom of expression to expand Barry's show nationally as a man climbs the ladder of his profession suddenly collide with the type of content being proposed . Everything is going too far and, with freedom, it should at least cause a sense of clarity rather than just rejoicing. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone talked about radio in the midst of a fascinating and explosive filming period he had in the late 1980s. Meanwhile, he produced a series of films very well received in a short period of time; starting with one of my favorite war movies in Peloton before continuing with the very brilliant Wall Street and finishing with JFK in 1991. One could even say that this race continued until the mid-90s with Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio is like his main character in the sense that he is strong, powerful, violent and confrontational. It is not an anti-capitalism, but rather a distinction between what is perceived as entertainment and what goes too far for reasons of popularity and wealth. Talk Radio is certainly a movie that remains in memory.
