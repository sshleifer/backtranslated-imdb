Oh, I remember watching this show at 4:00 pm during my high school days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching her when I did my homework. <br /> <br /> The show still caught my attention when Alex deployed his special powers and tackled the typical problems of high school. > <br /> But the show was not just about adventures and special powers; Rather, it was an educational effort aimed at a younger audience to become more interested in school and biology in general. <br /> <br /> The lead actress (I do not remember her name anymore and I'm too lazy to stick from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance. She made the show visible. <br /> <br /> They do not do shows like this anymore ...
