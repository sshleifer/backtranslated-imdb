It was a film of which I read and reread the critics again and again; and although it is played at the Film Museum and not at the Pathe Theaters ?? I decided to try this movie. The reasons were many ?? compared to Pulp Fiction, it contained several parallel stories in the film and, finally, he had already won 17 awards internationally in various categories. I was looking forward to seeing this film and, because of my day off at Greenpeace, I decided to make myself happy by going to see this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a story based in Finland. I think it reflected the current life of people in general ?? drugs, crime, sex, anger, anxiety, fear and guilt. Every emotion has been brilliantly captured in the film. There are several intertwined characters and stories but some characters come back in the second half ?? link to the beginning sequences and advance the story. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends ?? one of them is a computer geek and the other is an addict? son of an abusive father. The drug addict boy negotiates a 500 euro bill ?? printed by his friend ?? to buy back his music system, and in the returns gets a huge cash back change to buy more drugs. The trading of the 500 euro banknote continues with bizarre events ?? from the trader to a burglar auto mechanic ?? to a car dealer ?? to a vacuum cleaner salesman ?? to a prostitute ?? to a policeman ?? then to his family and children. How does the beginning of a little thing ?? creates a chain reaction that leads even after 5 years of this first incident to a last depressing note ?? that I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent. The development of the character in the film is first rate. The character that keeps you in mind even after you leave the movie is the one of the seller of vacuum cleaners. All departments of the film are well managed. Here I would like to make some critical comments. First, during the sequence of one event leading to another, I felt that the coincidences were too fast and forced. But this scriptwriting error is a forgiveness when you see all the canvas. Secondly, the track of one character leading to another one brings back one way or another to the first two characters and I found again a forced decision on the part of the screenwriter. It was not necessary that the same characters reappear when there are different causes causing different effects in such a large city. <br /> <br /> But after saying that? it's an excellent movie! It's a dark movie with a lot of sex scenes. The characters have black, white and gray nuances and emotions that change in different situations that are brilliantly captured by the director. <br /> <br /> A movie of superior quality! He has all the ingredients to become a cult movie. I hope that only such films should not become and become cult films and win many awards, because without crime, sex, violence, drugs, etc., we can also make fantastic movies ?? The bicycle thieves and Pather Panchali are his main examples ?? The only thing to do is that they were a long time ago, that times are changing and that movies are reflecting current times.
