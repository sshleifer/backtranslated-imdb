The masterpiece of the silent film Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1905 uprising and make this event the heroic announcement of the October 1917 revolution. Ironically, the director of the film, Sergei Eisenstein, was one of the oldest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to the cinematographic art. Subsequently, Eisenstein's formalism and its suspicious politics would provoke innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on "socialist realism". Influenced by the theorist of Russian cinema Lev Kuleshov and, through him, by the intolerance of DW Griffith (smuggled into Russia in 1919), Eisenstein built his films from a "collision" of fast-mounting images , montage of various shots in length, motion, content, lighting and angle of the camera. Without a doubt, the most striking illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the most quoted and studied sequence in the history of world cinema - is Potemkin's "Odessa Steps" sequence. <br /> <br /> In the structure, Potemkin is a "five reel" divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of the Western drama. In "Men and Maggots", Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and discontent of the working class sailors of the battleship as the situation inevitably evolves into mutiny. Even before the sailors and their officers / captains of higher classes are visually introduced, Eisenstein symbolically establishes revolutionary conditions by colliding waves crashing violently and disturbingly at sea. On board the ship, we witness an overpopulation and unsanitary conditions. Eisenstein insists on the dehumanization of seafarers with arbitrary seizures, forced labor and - most memorable - fly infested meat for the evening meal. The myopic doctor of the ship is led by the other officers to declare that the meat was perfectly fit to be served with the brown soup, boiling like the sailors' rage. In accordance with Marxist maxims, the church also fails men and we see one of them breaking a plaque on which are engraved words from The Lord's Prayer from two different angles of view (perhaps the first one ". jump in the history "of cinema). Identified by the titles between "Drama on the Quarterdeck" and "An Appeal from the Dead", the second and third parts of Potemkin describe the mutiny and the funeral on the ground of its leader and first hero of the Vakulinchuk revolution. . United by calls to the fraternity of Vakulinchuk, the first mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack against the officers. A chaotic scene ensues whose Eisenstein editing techniques serve the violent passion well. The officers' quarters are trampled and the symbols of their privileges are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown into the sea, accompanied by spectacular cross-cuts in the nibbled meat and his hanging glasses metonymically in the rigging. Tragically, the death of Vakolinchuk is the price paid for the revolt (no omelette without breaking eggs) and is deposited with dignity on a jetty of Odessa. Hundreds of ordinary citizens of Odessa gather with the sailors to honor him and promise him "Death to the oppressors". Tight and loose fists signal the birth of a revolutionary consciousness. <br /> <br /> The complex and unforgettable sequence of Odessa Steps is the fourth act of the film. It begins with catchy music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the exalted faces of various people on the shore and selected objects (parasol, sunglasses, pram). Suddenly (as a title card in large letters exclaims), the music stops and rows of soldiers with hand-held rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. Here, Eisenstein unleashes the full force of collision-building as nearly a hundred shots are assembled to contrast with the panicked chaos and victimization of the population with the ruthless assault of the soldiers who lead them to the horses that trample and the flying swords of the Cossacks waiting. The staging is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church below, symbolic metonyms of Russia's oppressive institutions: tsarist monarchy and orthodox Christian church. <br /> <br /> Punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children. In the first, a mother and a boy introduced among the cheerful faces of the crowd are among the first victims of the massacre. The boy is touched, but the mother continues to run until close-ups of her face transmit her horrified gaze to the fallen body of the son trampled by the crowd. With a very slow pace of editing, the camera follows the mother as she carries her child's lifeless body up the stairs to face the soldiers (only represented by a diagonally shaded line). They kill her summarily. After this lull, the carnage continues for several dozen cuts until a second mother is hit in the belly (the belly of Mother Russia?) While she tries to protect her baby in his car. In a scene imitated in The Incorruptible, the car slips incongruously down the stairs. Horrified faces of piled up citizens observe the slow progression of his destiny. When the car reaches the bottom, a Cossack brandishes a sword and a classic Kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see: the slaughter of this pure and symbolic innocent. The last series of shots of the Odessa sequence is composed of three stone lions, one at rest, one seated and one roaring. The montage animates them in a visual metaphor of the awakened rage of the people. <br /> <br /> The fifth act takes us back to acclimatization and brings us back to the battleship while the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await the meeting with other ships in the fleet. Spectators and the spectator expect them to be punished, but at the meeting no shots are fired. All sailors waved and tossed their hats in the air, a symbol of camaraderie. Eisenstein was rewriting history at this stage since the revolution had not been successfully launched before twelve years. Battleship Potemkin is one of the major works of the silent film era and retains extraordinary cinematographic power.
