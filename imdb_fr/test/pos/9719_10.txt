I remember that my father had engaged these episodes in video. My whole family loved them and now that I've been away from home and I'm running my own life, I'm trying to share Jim Henson's fabulous creations with my husband and my son-in-law, but as I'm starting to discover that everything the world is not a fan of Henson. Which is a shame, because it means that they will simply have to support the research of this series. But even if they do not find them interesting, I would strongly recommend anyone to buy the storyteller. You will be lost in a world of tales at a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people should be concerned about these situations.
