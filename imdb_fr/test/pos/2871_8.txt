There is a new killer on the run, and he is doing the work of God. Yes indeed! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like an idiot and Freddy Krueger has a rag doll against this guy. This is Jacob Goodnight (Glen "KANE" WWE Jacobs), a 7-foot monster carrying an ax, as well as a hook and a chain. These weapons are nothing to him that his real finisher tears his eyes from the catches of the victim. It's totally methodical! Four years earlier, at the meeting, Jacob had killed a rookie police officer and mutilated the veteran after injuring his head. How did Goodnight survive after 4 years? Now he is at the convicted hotel called Blackwell. And this hotel has a lot of stories to tell. I thought this movie was haunting and interesting. I enjoyed the part where Goodnight checked one of the girl's tattoos on her back. And Goodnight himself is really upset thanks to his maniacal mother. If you think Friday the 13th was a day, think carefully. This film will leave you on the edge of your seat. And I think the tearing of the eyeball has cooled the bones. This film is the proof, and it was not a waste of time. I liked that. The title does not lie! Reviewer score 2.5 out of 5 stars!
