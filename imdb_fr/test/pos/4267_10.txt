I watch tons of movies and I did not know it would be as good as that. I was looking forward to reading the plot (although I think Nirvana is overrated). It sounded like a lot of fun, but it was more than that. Jansen brings small touches such as books (Kubrick's book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director take his time and put his heart into a movie. And you can really feel that. There are tons of scenes and moments that I really like, I'm trying to think now about other movies like this one and I'd say the only thing I can think of is Cameron's movies Crowe. Take small moments and make them stand out and special. The soundtrack is amazing and each song works perfectly with the scenes and sensations of the movie. This film is incredibly filmed and the editing is remarkable. I could really talk about the film again and again. I can not recommend it too much. If you want a fun story with great melodies from a director who clearly puts his heart into his work, then take a look at this idea.
