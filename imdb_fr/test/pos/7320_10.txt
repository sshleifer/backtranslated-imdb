This is the third short film of Three Stooges that the team has made and, like many of its beginnings, it is absolutely hysterical! Now in possession of this one on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Vol. 1, whenever I feel like it, I look at it! <br /> <br /> In this short film, Moe, Larry and Curly play the roles of these three doctors from a hospital who try to help everyone, but they end up spoiling everything! > <br /> This short film is another one of my favorite Three Stooges shorts. I'm also a big fan of blinding comedy, and the Three Stooges are the kings of the slapstick! <br /> <br /> When I heard that she was nominated for the Best Short Film Oscar, I became really curious about it. When I learned that it was lost, I was very disappointed! <br /> <br /> This short film is one of the funniest Stooges, I highly recommend seeing this hysterical riot! <br /> <br /> 10/10
