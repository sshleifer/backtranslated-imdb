This film has a decidedly strange setting, taking place in a very old school at first, but it certainly does not look like a sterile environment in a medical school. Very Gothic and atmospheric. As for the film itself, well, okay, the principle is a little far-fetched, but hey, that's why we're watching movies, are not we? And it's less far-fetched than some of the garbage coming out today, that's for sure. Medical students experience death "in the short term", including being briefly killed in order to experience life after death. In some cases, it is rather nice for some parties to come back with the traveler and begin to interfere in his earthly lives. I had not seen this movie for years before having it on DVD and I must say that I had forgotten how good it was. And I'm struck by the fact that Julia Roberts is really beautiful in this movie, not like the actresses of today who are supposed to be beautiful but who are dressed and disguised as cheap prostitutes. Ahh, the good old days. Anyway, it's a great movie, maybe not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others can enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.
