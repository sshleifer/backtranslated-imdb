Why is there so much anguish among critics of IMDb who hate this movie? This is not a masterpiece, but watching it twice is a captivating drama in the world of network television. Robin Stone is the epitome of all Dan Rather, Phillip Stone and Brian What's-his-name on NBC. A mannequin of a man incapable of love who succeeds professionally but fails miserably in his personal life. I worked for eight (8) years in Network News and in DO EXIST by Robin Stone! <br /> <br /> The secondary distribution suits me from Cannon (which can be boring, but not in this film) to Greene who plays pathos just to the right) to Wexler (who marks as a young model in love the image Prince Charming and can not reconcile this image with the real ugliness on the inside). It should also be noted the end which, according to some reviewers of IMDb, is an evasion. It's not! Listen to the song "He's Moving On" for clues to Robin Stone's arc, which will finally bring him to face his problems. He realizes that the answers are not based on the life he has lived and that the symbolic distance that separates them from those he has associated with is perfect.
