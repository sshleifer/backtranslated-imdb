if filming concerns vision and real life, this film is perfectly perfect: NUOVOMONDO talks about immigration to the United States from Italy in early 900, but the same goes for the moment, while the emigration / immigration is still at the center of concern. <br /> <br /> Do not be rich to be a visionary movie. <br /> <br /> At the height of the actor, Charlotte Gainsbourg is a star. A good challenge for the Oscars 2007 <br /> <br /> After the first attempt of Crialese, "Respiro", an emotional but too intellectual film, this one learned the lesson of Fellini and Taviani, to name only two Italian masters. <Br /> <br /> The plot is quarreling, the direction precise, maybe a little less melodrama would be more effective. <br /> <br /> If VOLVER (in search of an Oscar) of Almodovar is a mature film directed by an always brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO deserves it more than anything for his good effort to become a European film for the American scene . <br /> <br /> And that's it!
