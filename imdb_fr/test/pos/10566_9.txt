3 hours adaptation of Sarah Waters novel by BBC "Fingersmith". Life is hard without money, especially in London Dickensian. Dark acts lead to despicable dilemmas. Is love only a luxury for the rich and the most free? Elaine Cassidy as "Maud Lilly" and Sally Hawkins as "Sue Trinder" give fantastic performances as leaders asking this question ... EVERYONE else ... while Rupert Evans shines like the deliciously bad "Gentleman ".. with great support from Imelda Staunton's" Mrs Sucksby ", David Troughton's" Mr. Ibbs "and Charles Dance's" Uncle ". The plot is spinning and spinning and I was not sure that I could have to worry about characters who could hurt themselves and use that way ... but anyway ... I care ... and that's because of the quality of the performance ... love is like love ... hate looks like hate ... betrayal ... confusion .. well, hope you will have the idea and I hope you will get the DVD and you will enjoy it. (Elaine Cassidy is just great in this .. gorgeous actually .... I have to declare that I'm in her fan club ... Hi Elaine :)
