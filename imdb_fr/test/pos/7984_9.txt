Tim Burton is essentially an Expressionist director, disinterested in the dimensions of the character and obsessed by the Gothic scope, constantly opting for style rather than substance throughout his career. However, as his style is so endearing, I forgive, like many moviegoers, the innumerable flaws that are found in many of his films, and I am absorbed in what is essentially an art film worth one hundred million dollars. <br /> <It's almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic and emotionally involved spirit in the second tier of a mediocre franchise, especially when the target audience for this franchise is 15-year-old boys with no intelligence. Batman Returns should have been just as commercial as its predecessor, ensuring the box office appeal and cheap thrills (in fact, very expensive), entertaining without ever really engaging its audience. If that had been the result, then Tim Burton would surely have been forced to lead a third installment. Instead, Burton delivers something that can only really be defined by the phrase "over there". <br /> <br /> From the melancholy in which a high-society couple casts a prison-like pool containing their new baby deformed into a river, it's clear that Batman is coming back, it's not a picnic at Buckingham Palace. Cut to thirty-three years later, in a political speech by business magnate Max Shreck (described by Christopher Walken), the attack of the Red Triangle gang in Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returns to role) makes his first appearance with a new logo and saves the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus band and written in black to endorse the baby's political return, having become an adult penguin (Danny DeVito with horribly perfect makeup), whose reasons for return are only suspicious in Batman. <Br/> <br /> Meanwhile, Shreck is trying to defeat Selina Kyle (who plays the role of Michelle Pfeiffer, who deservedly more recognition for her performance) and turns herself into a deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman. quest for revenge and refuge. for some unexplained reason, a deadly vendetta against the Black Knight. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is dark. The design of the production is breathtaking, offering a cold city haunted by Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. The score of Danny Elfman supports the film with brilliance, ranging from invigorating to tragic. The tone and direction of the whole movie itself is extremely dark, turned like a sad nightmare. The direction of Burton obscures what is quite a diabolical scenario with a plot almost completely irrelevant and at the same time perfect for the visual style of Burton. . And while Burton's action sequences fight for the joy of living, the real excitement lies in the directional choices depicting the downfall of each of his main characters, the disappearance of the Penguins, Catwoman's mental state and lonely fate. Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> Warner The brothers hated everything in criticism and the reaction of the public was mixed. After all, they wanted a Batman sequel, not a strange, somewhat horrible horror movie, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan tries to kidnap and drown a bunch of babies, while throwing up what one can not than describe as green mucus. The production company wanted a friendly feature film for the public, an event for the McDonald's clan to promote their happy meals, not a film about dreadfully unrecoverable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and rekindled by a bunch of cats waking her unconsciousness by chewing her bloody frozen fingers. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of Batman Returns. The film never felt like a Batman blockbuster. One might wonder if Burton really knew who Batman was or whether he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film, falling within his usual themes of admiring artistic direction and misinterpreted and lonely characters who rarely conform to the standards of society. expectations. That's why Burton failed to create a great Batman movie. He did it, however; create a nostalgic, stunning and glitzy film, which remains one of my personal and nostalgic favorites. <br /> <br /> This may not be a great Batman movie. But it's a great Tim Burton movie.
