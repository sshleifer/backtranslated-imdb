It's fantastic! All of the score - when will the role of final credits. This film is a masterpiece. It's really scary and its hysterical setting is enough to give goose bumps. It is obvious that the film was NOT rushed and that David Schmoeller (who would later work with Fullmoon on the Puppet Master series) had a clear and concise picture of what he was trying to direct. The professional look of the film is amazing given its relatively small budget. It relies on no-effect alarms (mainly due to budget restrictions), but nevertheless creates an atmosphere of tension. <br /> <br /> Stephen King said it was one of his favorite movies and I really could not blame him! This is one of my favorite horror movies and will always be. This is my favorite movie of Fullmoon since my first purchase a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Money is well spent! I have VHS and DVD versions. <br /> <br /> 10/10
