I saw it for the first time at the theater in 1969, at the age of 9, and immediately fell in love with it. I'm sad that Sony did not see fit to release it on DVD ("but one day, one day ..."). I recently got a VHS copy of this document on eBay and sat down to watch it 39 years later. I am happy to announce that he is still standing the test of time. The acting is perfect, John Williams's orchestrations are lush and the memorable Leslie Bricusse songs ("When I Am Older", "You and I", "Fill the World With Love", "London Is London" are just a few examples Peter O 'Toole, Petula Clarke, Michael Redgrave, and Michael Bryant can not be said enough Terence Rattigan deserves an A + for his update of James Hilton's story. Nothing to dislike in this film, I'm glad they released the soundtrack of the film as a set of three CDs with many extras, if Sony wanted to hurry up and do the same with the movie.
