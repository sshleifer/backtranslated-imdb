It's a delicious type of movie, which does not look like this type of movie. Well done by everyone and populated by actors of interesting characters. An intelligent and witty scenario acting with the right mix of wide comedy and sober humor. Resists repeated viewing (annual?). <br /> <br /> ** ATTENTION ** the redesign of this film by Arnold Whatwashethinking, is an unbearable mess - painful to watch - without a scintillus of the charm and spirit of the original .
