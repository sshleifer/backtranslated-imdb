When we look at romantic comedies, we know what to expect; we have seen enough of them for so many years to know how they are doing. There is a formula that almost always produces films that become popular with the public of the genre ... not always in relation to their real quality. How to play with that and create something more interesting? This film has a suggestion ... and it works pretty well. Instead of simply following a track, we follow it skillfully by helping the unfortunate ones, those who lack the attractive facade that would allow them to reveal the invisible qualities they possess to the women they love. The plot follows Smith as he works on his most difficult self-proclaimed case; Kevin James. In addition to his help from James, we also follow Mendes, who is tired of men who lie to get what they want (a particular scene that inspires great respect for the character Smith is the fact that he meets such a fool) and put it in its place). After seeing Smith help James's disaster, we see him with Mendes ... and despite his talent for helping others, he's wrong ... bad ... with her. Make a wonderful point about the love and impact of our love on us. For a romantic comedy, it mostly avoids the pitfalls of this genre (sometimes almost like a parody of the genre), although the last scenes have the sweetness and emotions of this type of film. Whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review. The pace is pretty good, it never really slows down and rarely moves too fast. The acting is great, just about everyone goes there. The characters are well developed and appear as real people. Humor does not always work ... there are sometimes gags that are not happily performed, and one or two jokes that seem forced. However, for the most part, the movie was funny. I recommend it to anyone who loves romantic comedies and to anyone who loves or has been in love. Those who do not believe in love will have difficulties with the last scenes. 7/10
