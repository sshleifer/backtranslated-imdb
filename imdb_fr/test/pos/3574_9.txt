A smart and well-received movie that is worth exporting! <br /> <br /> In this exciting and truly intelligent film shot entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the full meaning of the word "Bluff" (although this is a Colombian film, the title is presented in English); ! <br /> <br /> The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who discovers that his girlfriend, Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal), has an affair with his boss, Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner a magazine; After that, Nicolas is left without a girlfriend and without work. Nicolas's vengeance on Mallarino is to follow him and obtain photographs of him with his new affair Alexandra (Carolina Gomez) to blackmail Mallarino to obtain money in currency for not showing the photographs to Margarita. <br /> <br /> The story is really smart and well connected, to the point where you will fully understand the meaning of the title, the film presents a thriller with many scenes and comic characters, providing real pleasure to those who like movies centered on a good script. <br /> <br /> I want to emphasize here that this film is different from typical Colombian films that show a dark and violent image of our beautiful country, which is really refreshing. Some critics say that this story does not show the typical Colombian way of life, so it could happen anywhere in the world. I do not share this opinion: (1) the film is shot entirely in Bogotá, so you can see the streets, and pictures of the real Colombian capital (I hope that Americans and film producers will watch this , then they will stop showing the Amazon jungle, or the small Mexican cities in Bogota as on some Hollywood movies), (2) characters, dialogues, accent Rosemary (Veronica Orozco) has a typical Cali accent (3) . You can also see the social and cultural differences compared to the ordinary people of Bogotá. I hope that all this, as well as an English title, will encourage people from other countries to watch this Martinez masterpiece <br /> <br /> Excellent actor of Veronica Orozco, Luis Eduardo Arango (detective Wilson Montes), Felipe Botero, as remarkable as the detective Ricardo Perez and the acting actors Mallarino, Catalina Aristizabal and Federico Lorusso. <br /> <br /> A film that is worth exporting, that people around the world will understand and appreciate!, Do not miss this film 9 / ten!
