I was really looking forward to watching this documentary about what I considered one of the most entertaining films ever made. Growing up in Los Angeles in the 1960s, many of these old black and white movies were shown on local channels. I even remember a Friday night show entitled "Strange Tales of Science Fiction" which featured a different Sci Fi movie every week. This documentary, however, has spent far too much time on the opinion of the four famous filmmakers and what they think of classic films like this and how they inspired them in their film. <br /> <br /> This is not happening. I was hoping in this documentary. It really could have been a complete review of the decade instead of a brief overview of the most famous films of the time. Anyone who has studied or is interested in these films knows well enough personalities such as The War of the Worlds, The Forbidden Planet, The Thing, The day the earth stopped, etc. I would have liked to see extracts of less known films and perhaps some interviews with people involved in the making of these films. I must admit that the documentary was too focused on Spielberg's opinions and was a type of advertisement for his new version of War of the Worlds.
