Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle did not like being called 'Fatty', but I could not resist the joke. <br /> <br /> Here is a short film by Lloyd Hamilton of his heyday, directed by Roscoe. The two work together with a lot of good gags and the usual attention of Roscoe on the details of the shooting in an interesting way. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a fixed camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a few long follow-up plans and some camera tips to tell his story and to show Ham an excellent actor and talented comedian. <br /> <br /> This story plays with interesting themes, such as Lloyd's Classic, MOVE ALONG: this is about perceptions of reality and the confusion that movies create. Or you can choose to ignore such problems and laugh at your head.
