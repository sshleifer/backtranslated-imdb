This episode of Columbo is one of the best and perhaps one of my personal favorites. The cast includes Rosemary's baby boy John Cassavetes, the maestro, his wife played by Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mother), and her mother-in-law, played by Myrna Loy (one of the leading American actresses in the movie of our time). Anyway, I disagree with anyone who criticizes this film. This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast that does a great job. I love watching Columbo with his beloved dog, which he never mentioned in the series. This time, the episode is devoted to classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of L.A.'s attractions. Of course, Columbo is as interested in classical music as it is in everything related to crime.
