This movie is a perfect picture of the action / drama / thriller, every scene you sucked in. I watched this movie and was amazed at the number of talented actors in the movie. story was made for these actors. The characters make the film so realistic. This film just gets a little more from me. Watch this movie without a doubt, it compares to Scarface, but it has a more detailed story. emotions, and in the end you really feel for the main character. Watch this movie !!!!!!
