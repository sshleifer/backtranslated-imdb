I have not written a review here for a long time, but I saw all the TV shows, the live broadcasts and that's what I felt I had to make my point of view on this movie! I think it's the perfect comic film. It misses the lovey dovey stories (I would not really call the rich Gina Carbonara buffs, the love? Or he and Eddie who go naked ... no love) that make the rest of the comedies go smoothly to shit, it misses the usual dilemmas that have to be overcome in most other comic films ... unless you take into account the fact that they poisoned the guests and they have to escape from their green vomiting as a dilemma similar to that of other humorous movies ..... No, This movie presents and succeeds in doing one thing AND ONE thing: making laugh. What do you ask for humor movies? To laugh. This film only laughs after laughter without gorging on laughter like any other humorous film! So, I call it the, so far, the only perfect comic film ever made and I'll never stop watching this gorgeous movie! I apply Rick and ade on such a fantastic genius!
