First of all, I absolutely loved this movie. As a fan of Billy Crystal, I must say that I was expecting more comical situations than I actually had. However, it was nice to see him in a deeper and more emotional role. His portrait of talented agent Sammy has been brilliantly portrayed and unique to him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy travels to Romania to visit his client there, his world is upset. He had never expected to accidentally find the person who could change his life. Sammy and Max's journey is unique and moving, sometimes humorous. Moreover, the place in the Czech Republic where parts of the film were shot was absolutely beautiful. I must say that this drama has made me feel different emotions. I thought it was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.
