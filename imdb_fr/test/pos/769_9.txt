DRIVING LESSONS is a little film that surprises you. What at first seems to be a bit of a comedic and senseless comedy of British style is at the base a very beautiful story about the passage to adulthood and the need for a meaningful friendship of both young and old. Writer Jeremy Brock ('Mrs. Brown', 'Charlotte Gray', 'The Last King of Scotland') directs his own screenplay here. The result is a coherent narrative, gradually involving fascinating and diverse characters, each interpreted by eminent actors. . <br /> <br /> Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, who is a developing actor after the series "Harry Potter") is a poetic and calm young man of seventeen, who lives with his bird watching the father Vicar. (Nicholas Farrell) and her benevolent, obese, rigid, rigid, and evangelical mother (Laura Linney) in a home where "needy people," such as the murderous transvestite Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton), take precedence over family matters : the mother has an affair with the priest Peter (Oliver Milburn), using Ben as a blanket! Sad Ben tries, among other things, to learn to drive a car. His mother is a mediocre teacher and decides that he needs professional lessons AND must find a job to pay for Mr. Fincham's needs. Ben follows an ad and meets Lady Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an aged and austere actress who is as crazy as any character. She hires Ben and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents, including a camping trip, Evie requires them to take lessons from life that they miss: Ben learns self-respect and self-confidence and Evie finds a true friend who will allow him to drop the front of the dear human being she has hidden. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, always offering the finest skills to play in every character she creates, finds a unique role: she is incredibly wild and lovable. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the future opponent, Ben. The chemistry between the two is as tender as that of the classic film "Harold and Maude". Laura Linney is as always a superb actress who plays a role very different from her usual repertoire. And the support distribution is a panorama of fine characterizations. This film is a delicious surprise that will warm your heart and entertain those who love fine writing, staging and acting - and the message! Grady Harp
