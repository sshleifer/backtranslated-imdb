The sad thing about Frontline is that after watching three or four episodes, you really start to understand that it's not far from what's happening in real life. What is really sad is that it also makes it extremely funny. <br /> <br /> The front row team in Series 1 is Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who lives and dies simply based on the notes his show gets. Sometimes his stunts to reach those odds see him running with his executive producer Emma Thompson (Alison Whyte); a woman who has not lost all her journalistic integrity and is ready to defend moral scruples on occasion. The same can not be said of journalist Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) - a journalist to whom all the stuff has been sucked - so much so that when she questions Ben Elton, you have to teach him how to laugh. Her reports usually consist of interviews with celebrities (with whom she has already met or not) or scandalous and unethical reports that usually turn against them. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is the journalist on whom the team relies for his sense of gravity and dignity, as he has the know-how of 21 years of journalism. He does not have so many principles, but rather an idea of ​​what makes a good journalistic story, although he sometimes draws a line. Mike Moore (Rob Sitch) is a selfish and naive journalist who can not realize he's only a pretty face for dirty journalism. He often finds that his morality is compromised simply because Brian appeals to his vanity and allows him to do the stupid rest. <br /> <br /> Frontline is the kind of show that needs more, because it shows that Nowadays, happiness, security and a deep political vision are interesting things. It is much easier to evaluate with scandal, fear and tabloid celebrities.
