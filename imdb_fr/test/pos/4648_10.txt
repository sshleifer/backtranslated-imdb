I hope to do it and how can I get involved? <br /> <br /> This film is a classic rich in laughter, in adventure and casting stars of the 80s! <br /> <br /> gather a group of jocks and sorority, a group of nerds debates, a group of misfits and a couple of couselors? <br /> <br /> A lot of laughs that will ask you more! <br /> <br /> David Naughton plays the role of Adam, the leader of the "yellow team", a friendly and trendy academic advisor who helps students in all fields, be they courses that they wish or beginnings. <br /> <br /> His sworn enemy is Harold, the leader of the "blue team", played hilariously by Stephen Furst, of "Babylon 5", the ugly good son of a rich and old jock college with enough trophies to make any Hall of Fame member jealous. <br /> The two face each other and throw in a "red team", a "white team" and a "green team", an incredible "view" to an observatory, the consequences of golf cheating miniature, a great tour to the Pabst B beer factory Lue Ribbon, and an odious old hostess among other adventures, and you have all the ingredients for an unforgettable evening! <br /> <br /> Look for the appearances of Michael J. Fox, Eddie Deezen and director Andy Tennant in one of the last movies in which he played before becoming a director, you have an all-star, hilarious cast . <br /> <br /> The only drawback of this film was the performance of Debra Clinger as Laura. She is terribly tired, but the rest of the movie is so good that she can simply be ignored. <br /> <br /> I own this movie and never look at it enough! <br /> <br />
