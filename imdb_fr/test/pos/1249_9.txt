Imagine that you have the opportunity to see you as a child. Now imagine what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your young person, or even to change it. Would you try to influence or change your youth's beliefs in the light of your future experience? Or maybe the meeting would change the perception of life and reality by your eldest? <br /> <br /> The Walt Disney Kid tries to engage in this complex thinking by putting "older" Bruce Willis into a conflict with the "young self" Spenser Breslin (from The Santa Claus 2 and The cat with the hat "celebrity"). The result is a meeting sometimes funny, sometimes touching, that makes you think about your own past, present and future ?? and truly believe it's never too late to change course.
