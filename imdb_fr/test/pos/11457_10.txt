I remember watching this film as a child and I was completely impressed, I could not leave the eyes of the television. This movie has everything for horror fans! This movie had no funny moments, expect some liners of Stooge (who was my favorite character in the movie), Kevin Tenney realized this gem and did a great job on a small budget, I thought that the end was great Stop them, it was by surviving the night when they were unstoppable killing machines! the effects made by steve johnson we are excellent I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes low budget horror movies because, as the old saying goes, they do not do it like that anymore. The suites were very good too, but not as good as the original. This is a must in any horror collection, buy it if you can find it, you will not be disappointed
