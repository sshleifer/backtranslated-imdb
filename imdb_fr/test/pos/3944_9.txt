So, the poorly matched couple starts their adventure together. <br /> <br /> REVIEW Okay, so this is another Journey To The West movie, which is not a bad thing for me because I like the story and the characters associated with it . So I was a bit excited to get my hands on the DVD. So I think I'll start my story with the story, which is everywhere, at first it was your classic fantasy film, then it became a ridiculous comedy then suddenly became a real science fiction, if the director Jeff Lau He's experimenting with the mixing of genres, then doing a rather scatological work with this film. I think it's a rather unique approach to centering the story on a character other than the infamous Monkey King, including taking a character as pacifist as Tripitaka and then placing it in what is at the heart of a story of love. So overall, I liked. <br /> <br /> The acting game is mostly solid, with leaders Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi performing very well, although Ah Char spends most of his time on the screen behind makeup rather ugly. The actors are well edited, they understand all the main roles usual in EEG. Boy'Z and Isabella Leong are making their appearance. One actor I would like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays the role of the Monkey King with whom he has done a good job. the limited material that seemed to have been given, he played a version of the Monkey King that was both submissive and arrogant, I had the impression that he would be retreading the territory of Twins Effect II but, fortunately, this is not the case here. I hope he will follow up with himself in the central role, as the film is left open to a sequel. <br /> <br /> Okay, let's get to the realization, which is once again everywhere, Lau gives too much time to Stephen Chow-esquire's absurd comedy, which includes a scene in which Tripitaka is hardened, disguised as Spider-Man, which, I suppose, makes me scratch my head since the film must be shot in ancient China. It creates really nice and tender moments between the two group heads and plunges into winding land, but this critic takes advantage of a little sap from time to time so that it does not bother me at all. <br /> <br /> Right Now, on the CGI, which is mostly quite bearable, there are many moments that probably belong to a PS2 as many other critics have indicated, but there are some cool moments, especially the scene in which Monkey confronts a minion. Much of the CG gags come in the form of a gold stick that turns into a range of different things, from a giant fly swatter to a mech straight out of The Matrix Revolutions. So, yes, it sounds crazy, but I guess you should see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Yes, so ending A Chinese Tall Story is not a film without its flaws but it remains soldered. Long enough to be entertained and generally enjoyable. If all the above does not make you see it, tell me it's better than Twins Effect II.
