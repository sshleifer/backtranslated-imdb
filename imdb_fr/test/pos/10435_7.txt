I already see some great reviews on this movie, I have some points to comment on, reasons why I thought there was something special about this movie ... <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is realistic. it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like to be a teenager, but it's really the kind of superdrama that happens in teenagers all the time. Second, the good guy, the guy who treats women with respect, does not understand girls. it's like that, in real life anyway! he is too kind for his good. people are just selfish. Third, it was nice to see a big guy who trusted him. I mean, this role already takes the trust of the actor, I'm not just talking about the character. All in all, I thought the movie was a positive surprise that secretly hides among the crazy, sexy comedies for teenagers on the rental set. do not get me wrong, it's not all sad, it's also a good laugh.
