My university theater just had a special screening of this film last night. I must say that I think everyone was impressed by the quality of this movie. Although my roommate did not like it, but he does not like horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton could play. By the way, if it worries you, do not be concerned. I'm not really one of her fans, but I have to be honest and say she was very good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actors were very good. I will not go into the details of the plot since I'm sure you know it. Curiously, the characters are very attractive and you really like them, especially the characters of Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray. We meet them as rival brothers and sisters and end up having to work together. Another advantage is that it does not have the sleek look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and looks like a documentary rather than a video clip (do not get me wrong! loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville). <br /> <br /> Now, for the death scenes. In most slasher movies, whenever a character is stabbed or killed, the scene moves immediately to another scene, but not in that scene. When a character is about to die, he dies in a macabre way. But the filmmakers do not stop there and add a little something extra to each victim. I will not talk about death scenes and let you see them for yourself. <br /> <br /> Although it's a great movie slasher, it has the flaws of almost every slasher movie (exploring a terrifying home when you should not be, taking a ride with a suspicious character, splitting up and scream so that the killer can hear you). In addition, there is a kind of stupid plot that was useless and adds nothing to the movie. You can see that this was added at the last moment and that if you removed it, it would have no impact on the film. <br /> <br /> Basically, if you're a horror movie fan, watch this movie. . You will not be disappointed. It has everything you need to make it an excellent slasher movie, maybe the best of the year, even if it's a bit early. The suspense is felt and sometimes it's a funny movie. If you hate horror movies, chances are you'll love this one and if you're divided, I encourage you to try it.
