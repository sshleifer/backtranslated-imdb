Considered another of Hollywood's stunning new dramas, this film excels where others have totally failed (especially considering the most underrated performance of Natalie Portman's dramatic character portrait), this film is almost unanimously animated by the chemistry shared by Susan and Natalie. They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would confuse them with a real family. They live so much mother-daughter conflict in history that it's hard not to improve their acting abilities. I think the talented performances of these two actresses were taken where the story was lacking and almost too familiar (full of clich√©s) and really saved the suffering plot. I would recommend this film mainly to those who love either of the two actresses or such a drama.
