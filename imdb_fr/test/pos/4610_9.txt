British nobleman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene) decides to look for his two best friends who disappeared after visiting Count Karl von Bruno (Stephen MaNally), a powerful and mean man who lives in the Black Castle. Sir Burton travels stowaway with another identity, since he fought against Count von Bruno in Afrika with his two friends missing and the count lost an eye in a battle. When he arrives in the castle, he is invited to hunt with the count in the Black Forest, while seeking evidence that the count killed his friends. Later, he and the Count's wife, Countess Elga von Bruno (Rita Corday), fall in love with each other and with the support of Dr. Meissen (Boris Karloff), Sir Burton and the Countess try to to escape from Count Bruno's claws. "The Black Castle" is an excellent romantic film, action, romance, mystery and even horror. The story is captivating and provides excellent entertainment for all ages. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Castelo do Pavor" ("The castle of fear")
