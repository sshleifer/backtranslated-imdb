I'm not usually in the black / psychological thriller genre. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing job. History, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all very complex and compelling. Rose plays with precision the complexities and movements of a psychologically disturbed woman. My partner was particularly impressed by the sophisticated way in which power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving three-quarters of the time for "tea time" and felt compelled to take a shower. The story was exciting but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy at once. (He dives into the gritty and grubby side of people, but do not leave you there). I have long thought about characters and deeper meanings. I highly recommend this one. Always be ready for an experience you may not expect.
