This show has everything you could want from a prison drama. There are twists and turns until the season finally. The characters are very strong and that gives a lot of power to the show. When you watch the show, you feel not only for the prisoners, but for the prison staff. The actors who play the prisoners on this show did a great job in describing a prisoner. Moreover, if you like law and order and criminal intentions, many actors of this show appear in these programs. The only problem with Oz is that it was not long enough. This show could easily have nine to ten seasons without aging. Even after the season finale, I'll always be watching Oz on DVD. This show is easily one of the best shows on television. Do not be stupid, go watch Oz.
