Disgusted as an Asian horror, "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is actually a complex psychological drama, focused on a character, which plunges the viewer into the problems of an apparently normal family. I was really surprised by the depth of this film. The decision of the director Ji-Woon Kim to focus more on the story telling than on the provision of cheap frights has proved fair. Creation of one of the most ingenious new horror movies. <br /> <br /> "A tale of two sisters" such as the story, as its name suggests, suggest two sisters Su-mi and the youngest Su-yeon, who after spending time in a school psychiatric, return home to their father and apparently violent mother-in-law. From then on, we see how the sisters manage their mother-in-law's aggression and erratic behavior. To say what would happen next would be to ruin the whole experience. I will leave it there. <br /> <br /> The plot is very tightly written. With well-fleshed characters. Ji-Woon Kim focuses on a small distribution and offers a much more detailed view of them and their relationships with each other. In addition, each of the four main actors plays a very different role and type of character. Of the protector Su-mi, the weakest Su-yeon, the father obviously indifferent to the frantic and then deadly behavior of the mother-in-law. There is a great sense of mystery, with much of the intrigue not revealed in the end and even after the film still leaves room for interpretation. Even after watching it once, the viewer will have to see it at least once more so they can understand it better. <br /> <br /> The actors correspond perfectly to their roles. It is particularly difficult to create strong and emotional scenes in psychological films, but it is a great joy to succeed in creating them. This is an excellent example of such a feat. Ji-woon Kim's direction is slow and catchy, creating tension for the horrific scenes of the film. Although few, these moments are strong and frankly terrifying. The cinematography and score are of excellent quality, thus contributing to create an atmosphere at the height of a psychological film. <br /> <br /> "A Tale Of Two Sisters" is a demonstration of how the genre of horror is simple merry-go-round. With a strong emphasis on character and mystery, it's a complex movie that could easily seduce you by looking at it again and again so you can better understand it.
