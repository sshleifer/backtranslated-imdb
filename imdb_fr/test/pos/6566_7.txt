I have recently seen a good number of Far East films ... Some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, The Eye) and others were of lower quality (Versus, The Triple Cross). There are also Uzzaki and Returner, who despite my defects I still liked. <br /> <br /> The fundamental principle concerns the mysterious and horrible effects that a spiraling obsession with spirals has on a community. Sounds silly? Yes, that's what I thought. First, the good things. The management was excellent, certainly a little exaggerated in places, but still interesting and elegant. Secondly, the story was original and, like other writers, commented with a lot of attention ... it was interesting. What it reminded me most was however early Cronenberg; movies like Shivers and Videodrome. <br /> <br /> The acting was not great, but not too bad either. To be honest, I got bored on a few occasions ... I felt that the stimulation, especially at first, was a bit slow. My main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be a real horror, but not enough to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washing machine =)) and I liked the final plan / voiceover. At first, I thought it ended up way too brutal, but about 20 seconds later, I realized the meaning and loved the end. However, because of the lack of seriousness of the story, combined with the most important scenes such as reporting from school to school, I made fun of the characters at the end. The final scene was perhaps supposed to be a little poignant, when in fact I did not really care about the girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * <br /> <br /> So overall, I liked this movie, but it frustrated me and I think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes. Some other points, the main girl is pretty and cute, and the song that is played in the end is good too. I rated it 7/10. <br /> <br />
