When I was in grade 10, my boyfriend and I were standing up late at home and circling the cable to watch this movie. We watched it because it looked funny and because there were breasts. But then the end came and we sat completely speechless. I think after a minute looking at the credits, he just moaned, "Oh, man .....", he goes from the stupid eighties comedy of sex to nihilist realism so quickly that you surprises. I've been trying to rent this film for years and I have not been able to find it - and no one has ever seen it except me and my friend - it seems. But now he is available! I strongly suggest renting it and getting ready.
