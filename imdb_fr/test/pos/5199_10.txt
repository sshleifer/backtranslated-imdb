This film is for the infantry what Das Boot did for the submarines. If you enjoyed Das Boot, that's all you really need to know. <br /> <br /> It's a well done film. On a par with Das Boot. It is basically an elite German "Stormtrooper" infantry company that leaves its garrison station in an idyllic seaside town in Italy and is immediately plunged into the chaos of the rotting Russian front. <br /> <br /> A good film on war illuminates both the insensitivity and the brutality of war and gives us at the same time a glimpse of the experiences and the essential humanity of those who fight. This movie does that. The film is full of drama and action and so is entertaining at this level as well.
