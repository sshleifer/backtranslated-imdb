The skeleton of the story is that the main character must win a public tournament of kung fu with high stakes. The flesh of the story is made up of MANY fights, a love triangle, betrayals, rivalries and revenge. <br /> <br /> This story has a lot to offer. The main character is very friendly as a boy of the campaign with equal temperament, sweet and very hard. A good movie against a bad movie is as good as the bad guys and the bad guys are tough and smart, not to mention ugly, devious and difficult. <br /> <br /> If there is a weakness, it is the scene where the main character imagines it, as well as the protagonist, running in a flowered field and kissing when they meet. I thought I was watching The Sound of Music for a second and I had almost lost hope for the movie. Fortunately, the movie quickly recovered with a fight scene.
