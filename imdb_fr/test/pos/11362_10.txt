All those who enjoyed this series during its first broadcast (I rushed home to watch it) are now a certain age. I can only add my comments to those who ask for a DVD release to allow those of us to relive the memories of the first transmission. before it becomes simply a piece of un-memorized television archive history. If so many old television series from the sixties and seventies can be released, why not? Rights authorizations surely can not be so difficult. Most of the Shakespeare lines I can cite come from this iconic series and I remember exchanging them with my classmates as we try to surpass the memories of the text. Peter Dews rightly deserved the courage to bring it to the screen. It was surely public broadcasting at its best. Robert Hardy and Sean Connery fight to the death - it's fascinating and it goes back to the golden age of BBC Television. Go BBC. Erase it and give it a license, please. March 2009 The DVD has finally arrived and congratulations to those who made it possible. The image quality is remarkably good and the performance just as good as the memory thought. Now, all those who claim it must buy it and relive those magical moments. <br /> <br /> British viewers. Since the series was made in the UK by the BBC with British actors, it is strange that the DVD release is not available on Region 2 DVD (Europe) and can not be imported from the US and played on modified players. It seems unlikely that there are significant rights issues. Maybe the market was considered too small, so why was it not published "free region"? so that everyone can enjoy it?
