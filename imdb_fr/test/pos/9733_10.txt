First of all, I hate Sci Fi Stuff, and although this movie sometimes gets a little Sci Fi, that's fine, because at least it's focused on André Toulon. In the last 3, André seemed to have been mentioned, but the stories never focused on him, which made me crazy. What makes me so crazy is the amount of 0 he has on the vote board. Give him some rest. If you saw this movie and liked it, vote it. Please. What I liked in this movie is that it went back to where it all started. When André learned the secret of life. I would recommend this rental if you have ever seen a puppet master movie and you liked it. But do not rent it if it's your first appearance in the PM Collection, mainly because you might think that all puppet masters are as "dull" as this one.
