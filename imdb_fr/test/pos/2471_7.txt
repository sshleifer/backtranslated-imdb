The highlights of the film were clear for the beginning and the middle of the film. It showed how a very violent and reactive authority could react to resistance. Filmed in the manner of a documentary, the director describes what would have happened if the United States had adopted martial law. Volunteering for "punishment park", a training ground for cops in which you are bullied and harassed, would get you out of this terrible scenario. He alternates between the trials of the accused, those who are in the park that escape the attention of the police, the training of officers who are preparing to handle these prisoners, the judges during their free time, among others. It was a very strong and deeply moving film. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I had to make is the realism of this film. Officers are often seen holding their guns as if they were seven years old with a plastic toy (for example, a 90-degree elbow to point a gun at someone's face or the way a police officer gives it. impression that it is difficult to kick someone down, etc, etc.). It starts with an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs. At the end of the film, the viewer is gradually reminded of the prejudices of the director and the producers. The antagonistic characters of the story begin as true human beings, then progress slowly towards "stereotyped and objectifiable forces of evil" in the end. The mistakes they make are stupid, the strength they demonstrate is unreal and unlike the way the police act, the judges at this hearing are accused of making stupid and unreal mistakes, among many other things. <br /> <br /> The film's reality began to fall apart when it became clear that it was just another blank check attempt to make the government look bad. And that comes from an anarchist. The scenes in the end began to become hokey, unreal and a thousand times dramatic. Nevertheless, for the first part, it promises a very moving scenario.
