I finally received my DVD today, I watched it and I'm pleased to announce that it is the original version of the film in the cinema. As you may have read in previous reviews "Rich and Famous" version of the film mounted television was recorded on VHS in the late 90s, but WB has now corrected the error and published it on DVD with the scene of the plane's toilet, bare ass Matt Lattanzi, and the scene in the hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) called Merry (Candice Bergen) has C ** t! Everything is there and is more beautiful than ever! Crisp, clear digital transfer, a larger display and special features, including an original theatrical trailer and a featurette of the 1981 vintage titled "On Location with Rich and Famous" with interviews of the distribution and the director. If you like this film like me, you will not be disappointed with the purchase of this DVD. Happy to finally have this on DVD ?? It's worth the wait! Thanks Warner Bros!
