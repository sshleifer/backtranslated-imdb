I'm 13 years old and I write this review in my mother's register. She will write her own criticism later. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie of all time. It was shot in England in 1944. I watched it so often when I was little that I carried the videotape. I love this movie and it changed my life! Beautiful landscapes. The powerful thoroughbred horse. The small Irish plain with the girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done, participates in the Grand National Steeplechase in London with her most beloved horse, The Pirate. All this made me want to ride (as I have for 7 years) and learn everything I could about their races to also draw and paint them. It's an innovative film about winning against all odds, controlling your fears, trusting yourself and achieving difficult goals by working hard. In addition, the horse racing scene was one of the best ever and I saw a lot of movies with horse racing. I do not get tired of watching this movie. Everything is perfect. Especially if you are a girl and passionate about horses!
