It's a kind of hidden gem. It has little or no promotion, no fanfare, no classic status, and it deserves all the above! One of the great directors of cinema, Fritz Lang, has created a real jewel in this excellent western. An excellent cast led by Randolph Scott (probably one of his greatest performances), the always solid Dean Jagger, Robert Young as a surprisingly accomplished guy, as well as many actors of veteran characters: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton MacLane and others in an exciting Zane Gray story about laying Western Union cable across the country. There is an intense drama, splashes of humor and great effects. It reminds of DeMille and yet Fritz Lang leaves his mark. At least it's a pretty good western!
