I was born in Beijing, China, and moved to the United States at the age of nine. I have been back to Beijing many times since then and I loved it every time. One of the many things I love about Beijing is the people and the atmosphere they bring to the city. "You hau hao hao shuo" (which more accurately translates as "if you have something to say, say it nicely") captures this feeling of Beijing in a charming and sincere way. I guess you should have lived and understood a little Beijing and its people to make the most of this film, even if you could appreciate it anyway. <br /> <br />> The story is not complicated, intentionally a little weird. and captivating. I'll let it unfold by itself and do not tell you too much, except for a few comments. Every detail, from wall images to decorations, streets and restaurants, gives the impression of being at home. (Zhang Yimou probably filmed everything "on the spot") But more importantly, the characters - our "hero", the girl, the "brave man" but the unfortunate "laptop" and the owner of the nightclub are all two from Beijing separately. Their conversations really capture the essence of each character. The story, mainly motivated by situations and conversations (except the brilliant brewery at the end), is intriguing and always interesting. <br /> <br /> I am 21 years old now. My parents and I love this movie. We are still amazed at Zhang Yimou's ability to turn ordinary people into credible screen characters, and everyday life into extraordinary situations. <br /> <br /> "Keep Cool" - different. hilarious. significant.
