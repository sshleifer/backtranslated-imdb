Citizen Kane .... The Godfather Part II .... The Dolemite D'Urville Martin. It is the largest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed on humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that transcends Oscar stars like Dolemite, the meanest cat in the universe. It is clear that he does not take jive (no turkey, I am unfortunately a turkey) and proves it with his powers of striking, pimping and karate shot. It is blaxploitation at its absolute best, a shining example of the genre with its reduced budget, its errors of continuity and its hatred for the explicit explicite of the rat soup. The true godfather of rap (and not this new nonsense of Ali) Moore is in a way a juxtaposition of acting technique; somehow manages to become the most charismatic actor of the 1970s, and that's saying something. This one is highly recommended to people, if not for single-liners.
