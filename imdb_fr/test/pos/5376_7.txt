This film interested me for a long time, especially after reading some online reviews of the DVD edition; however, I continued to postpone the purchase because of the excessive price and lack of appropriate supplements. When it was exhausted earlier this year, I finally surrendered - but the entire drive (which included a number of other highly desirable titles) was lost during transport! Fortunately, the DVD has been reissued at a great price - and I'm glad I bought it! <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a strange film, and a real sleeper: an initially confusing but startling occult tale that manages to make a mark on both its atmospheres and its atmosphere. small town and the disturbing climate inherent in the sinister alleys -on. A small distribution responds perfectly to a terse, absorbing and intelligent scenario: Strother Martin, in particular, makes the dialogue healthier than it really is with his nuanced performance as a city doctor / head of the coven of the witch; L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore (who also produced the film!) Offer strong support as a pragmatic sheriff and his passionate comic assistant. <br /> <br /> The plot merges the elements of several previous films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural, and not just the obvious titles: the fact that the city is held in a spell that can not be identified at first, for example, immediately recalls the similar affliction of a specific bourgeois house of Luis Bunuel's surrealist sublime THE EXTERNAL ANGEL (1962) !; the angle "children possessed" may have been borrowed from VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960); there have been many films - especially of a recent vintage - where the satanic rites of a witches coven are shown: from THE CITY OF THE DEAD (1960) to THE DEVIL RIDES OUT (1968) but, since debates take place in The Daily, America (albeit in an isolated environment) and revolving around old witches (seeking a "rebirth"), the film they remember most often is ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968). <br /> <br /> The occult scenes (accentuated the foggy exteriors like the subdued lighting of the house with gaudy decorations where the evil events take place) are presented in a totally realistic way to make them disturbing and extremely effective - in particular the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car (!), the unleashing of a devil doll (a concept that has been put to death over the years but here it raises a undeniable thrill), a sequence of surrealistic dreams (put in the ice chamber where the victims are kept, because they can not be buried!), a sequence where the witches attack a dubious member of the coven, a beheading by a knight medieval horse riding (!) and the long final "black mass" (with the witches, accompanied by the respective child they will take charge, all dressed in red - except for a Mar dressed in black presiding the ceremony) that ends with a ritual mass suicide! <br /> <br /> The film also has the courage to deliver a "curtain" downward; It's so refreshing to find a title (although it's a low-budget production) from a big Hollywood studio, Columbia, that manages to go so completely against the tide (like, have I said, the film is quite strange - also extending to editing and score)! It is also strange that such a chic and cinematic horror offer comes from a television director often associated with westerns and other family products! Incidentally, the same theme was treated almost simultaneously in the nth collaboration between Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, NOTHING THAT THE NIGHT (1972, that Lee himself produced!) - a film I stupidly missed it twenty years ago. on local TV, and who has been MIA since !! <br /> <br /> P.S. This article of THE BROTHERHOOD OF Satan will certainly contain errors, but the synopsis and the illustrations on the DVD jacket manage to reveal everything!
