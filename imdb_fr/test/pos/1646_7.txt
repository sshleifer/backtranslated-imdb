This is not a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is the abbreviation of Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Batallion Penal. These battalions were formed because of the growing demand for soldiers as the Soviet Union suffered heavy casualties throughout the war. These battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who had been given the opportunity to clean themselves by proving themselves in combat. They were despised and assimilated and were easily spent in combat without much regret or honor from the military. They were often sent on a suicide mission and suffered extreme losses. Those who refused to fight were executed on sight. Needless to say, their life was nil. <br /> <br /> There were some very good performances from the actors, including Yuri Stepanov (Antip), Aleksandr Bashirov (Stirah) and Roman Madyanov (Major Kharchenko). However, the series does not really create an addiction, in part because it is too long, it could have been much shorter and as effective. <br /> <br /> Although it is war, Shtrafbat has a very mild violence and almost no blood. It only depends on the actors to make it work, and after all, it's a TV show. The producers did not want to frighten viewers and sponsors. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat explores the cruelty of the Soviet regime, and explains why so many men have chosen to fight the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally, I would prefer to be fascist rather than communist given the circumstances presented in the film. One character explains that the Soviets stripped his farm and his family died of hunger. In anger, he burned her, which resulted in her being arrested for destroying property in Kolhoz. He ended up in the criminal battalion as a criminal. Antip recalled how her mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family. The two men explained that they fought for their homeland, rather than for the Soviets. <br /> <br /> The penal battalion had a navy (the naval infantry) who raped a girl, killing her comrade in pursuit, threatening her other friend to keep her mouth shut on both tests, then simulated an injury when it came to fighting. On top of all that, the girl committed suicide for shame. I imagine that if enough marines were watching this film, they were holding up banners and rioting in the streets to demand a boycott or official apology from the producers. <br /> <br /> To say the least, I would recommend it to anyone with any interest in the former Soviet Union or the Second World War. I do not think I have lost more than 500 minutes of my life.
