Looked at this GREAT classic Greta Garbo movie and found that his performance was excellent. However, the German version of the film that had captions in English was its greatest performance. Greta Garbo even told the press that the German film was her favorite and that she had to go from Silent to sound. Greta had a shrill voice and had to take classes to reduce her for future roles in the movies. This story was very sad because Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), "Ninotchka", 39, was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left it years ago as a sailor and then captain of barge. There were many scenes from the Old Town, the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and the Manhattan Sky Line. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Days of Wine & Roses", '62, a veteran actor of the classic played a leading role.
