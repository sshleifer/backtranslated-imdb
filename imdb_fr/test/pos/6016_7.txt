According to the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more loving portrait of their mother than her sister, the actress "Baby", June Havoc, in her autobiography, "Early Havoc" on which "They shoot horses , do not they? "was loosely based. I saw Ethyl Merman in Gypsy's original Broadway production. She was great as "Mama Rose" but certainly more "Merman" than Rose. I was disappointed with the portrait of Rosalind Russell in the 1962 film version. An excellent actress, Russell was a very Merman wood substitute. Bette Midler, on the other hand, was better and more credible than Merman and I would recommend her performance as the ultimate.
