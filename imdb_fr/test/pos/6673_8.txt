If you like movies that will make you think, this is one of the best. I have always loved David Lynch and Cronenberg. They have always made high quality films. <br /> <br /> Iain Softley made the film K-PAX brilliantly. The film delves into the feelings and philosophy of the mind and the world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both have excellent acting skills. It took me, I did not leave the eyes of the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you're hoping for a special effects sci-fi movie, it's not for you. The story is a bit of a drag, which can be a little boring, but also works as a way to build the movie theme. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this movie, I have it ..
