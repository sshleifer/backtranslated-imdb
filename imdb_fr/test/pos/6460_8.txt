The reason why this film is not better known and appreciated by me seems to be because of its subject. Because of its controversial subject, this film has never had a major release and is still quite unknown to this day. However, this is no longer a controversial subject now. <br /> <br /> This is basically a film about a white man bonding with a black man. Friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic, but the way it is described in this film gives the impression that everything is real. We see these different ethnicities mingle with each other, as if it were perfectly normal. Unfortunately, of course, at the time, it was really not considered something normal. Seeing a black man talking to a white girl and having fun with her as a friend must have been a difficult thing to watch, for example, for certain proportions of her audience of 1957. <br /> <br /> You can really understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and is still as respected by the Hollywood society and the black community in general. Of course, this is one of the reasons he also received an Academy Award of Honor in 2002. In his films, he often fights against discrimination and prejudice, with of course "In the heat of the night "as a best example of this. . A true model, which has certainly inspired many African-American actors, to date. But on top of that, he was also a great actor. Yes, he is still alive, but he has practically retired from cinema, it seems, since his last credited role dates back to 2001. <br /> <br /> This movie was Martin's first film Ritt. too much movie to spend on his movie. The studios were probably also a little reluctant, mainly because of his concept and / or because it was Ritt's first film. Or maybe it was simply because MGM was no longer so big and had left his best days behind him. Since the 50s on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, he had the reputation of making movies not too good and not too expensive, while in the beginning, it was really one of the biggest studios with a lot of stars and acclaimed directors who were attached to it, who has produced many award-winning classic films. Fortunately for them, their reputation begins to change and every time the MGM logo appears in a movie, people do not wait for a smaller film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, even with his tight budget and limited resources, managed to make a good movie of it. The film is very simple, with only a few characters and a simplistic plot. However, the film still manages to capture you with its story and subjects, without ever starting to become a preacher or anything about it. It also makes the film effective with his subjects. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
