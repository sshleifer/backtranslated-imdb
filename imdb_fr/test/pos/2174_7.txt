First of all, I must admit that I have not read this particular Balzac novel, so I may be speaking unfairly to my director and his publisher. My experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist and not an obscurantist. It is certainly a film that is worth it, but we are terribly perplexed at the end. Was the Colonel a fraud, used by the lawyer for his own purposes (or beyond who he is)? or was not the colonel a fraudster, but was he used as directed by the lawyer? Or did the lawyer really try to serve the honest colonel? The director and / or the publisher seem to me to have deliberately masked these questions, which do not resemble Balzac, the realist. At the same time, the film captures the characters very well, if not their motivations, and the distribution and production are superb. This opening scene of the battlefield will not fail to haunt his dreams. Yet, we wonder about the all too common inclination of contemporary filmmakers to privilege ambiguity. The problems and motivations of all these characters were they not complicated enough for Yves Angelo?
