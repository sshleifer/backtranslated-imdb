Although some things in Haggard are stupid and useless, the whole thing is good. <br /> <br /> Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) trying to win back Glauren (Jenn Rivell), ex-Ryan. <br /> <br /> The story is followed and developed surprisingly well, it is not surprising and does not become an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam, although it has a parallel story that does not harm to the main story. <br /> <br /> And, for all Bam fans (and girls), there are several sequences of Bam skateboard, perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. Phil makes two surprisingly small appearances, even Don Vito got a bigger (but useless) result. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a comedy and escape the madness of Bam, then stay away from this movie, otherwise, enjoy the time you spend with it, if you can find it. There are really funny scenes in this movie.
