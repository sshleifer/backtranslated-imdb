I think the reason this film did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions about Darwin, pros and cons. I would say that the real man is represented here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the film is only a snapshot of the man, the technique of narration has extended his life well beyond the years mentioned in the film. It is a profound film, a reflection on modern life and our way of thinking, and can provoke a study of the man whose thoughts (and those who have used it) have certainly affected our lives. There are films whose historical context is so great that the actors must first and foremost stay out of the scene. The story took the day and the actors did their work. Good job to them, I say.
