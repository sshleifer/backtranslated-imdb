Although the principle of the film implies a "major coincidence", the actors all do a commendable job and look great to bring the story to life. I found myself looking for the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, to empathize with both of them and to reconcile them. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson also have busy roles: they do decent work with the stereotypical boyfriend relationship. Although the story tends to go through time, sometimes leaving the audience a little hungry for missing details, it still runs and avoids any real confusion. This interesting story has all the elements for a good "girls movie".
