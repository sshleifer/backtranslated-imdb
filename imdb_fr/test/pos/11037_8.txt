If you are very sensitive to extreme racial stereotypes, this caricature is not for you. But if you are interested in a rare animation of the war, enter! <br /> <br /> In this caricature, Popeye patrols the seas and discovers what a Japanese fishing boat looks like. The two Japanese fishermen make Popeye believe that they want a peace treaty to be signed. But appearances can be deceiving; the fishing boat turns out to be a ship of the Japanese Navy! The following is considered today as a stimulating propaganda for morale. <br /> <br /> Be forewarned, the representations of the Japanese in the film are made petty. Keep in mind, however, that there was a war going on at the time. But I strongly recommend this design to those interested in the era of the Second World War.
