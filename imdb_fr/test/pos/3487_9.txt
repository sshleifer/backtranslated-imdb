A very suspensive giallo of the director of "L'Anticristo" (1974), it begins with a brilliantly manipulated sequence featuring a priest, a little girl and a broken doll. marry a traumatized invalid to kill her for her money.The plot, although not original, is really suspensive, the acting is good and there are several killings clever and bloody.The score of Francesco de Massi is quite effective, be heard in Lucio Fulci's "The New York Ripper" (1982). Highly recommended to fans of Italian cinema!
