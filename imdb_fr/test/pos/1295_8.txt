Having seen other Bollywood movies with Salman Khan, I can say it's my favorite among the newer ones. The songs are all very amusing, especially "O Priya O Priya", which seems to contain a good mix of Beatles, Indian music and (I daresay to say) a little Prince. Love stories are a little more credible than, for example, Chal Mere Bhai. The occasional focus on Prem's drinking is sometimes disturbing, as it does not seem logical to me, but Khan plays it well - although his voice becomes squeaky when he describes drunkenness.
