I watched Sleeper Cell with a little apprehension worry about whether the terrorists would be glorified. This fascinating series not only treated the subject responsibly, but created depth and substance for almost every character. Oded Fehr swallows the screen in all the scenes where he is and even if his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has a hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy was doing well, although in some scenes I wondered why he was not shot there because of the scowl on his face. <br /> <br /> The advantages of the series are the two main roles, Fehr and Ealy, the well-written characters - all credible and tragic, and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story. Having married a Muslim myself, the atmosphere created was rather realistic. The downsides, for me personally, were that the T & A woman was exaggerated - most seemed free, as well as some sex scenes. Despite this, it's a series of shots that will make you think. Someone gives Fehr more juicy roles like this one and lets him run with it. He has an incredible presence on the screen and a kind of innate power emanating from him.
