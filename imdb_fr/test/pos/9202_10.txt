Frankly, I like watching James Caan. Wonderful actor. With such simplicity, you know exactly what he's thinking. A real pro. <br /> <br /> I watched the show from the beginning and found it different - it's something that's unique to Hollywood - a new idea - not a 3rd version of a show to success in progress - <br /> <br /> I also find the series fun and exciting - I like the pace - we never get bored - I particularly like the mystery of each episode - the way it unfolds . I am a big fan of mystery and I have read a lot of great mysteries but I find the stories of the series well written and the result is rarely obvious. Also extremely interesting to me, probably because I'm not a player, are the different disadvantages that "players" have invented - I was fascinated by the number of schemes that people have come up with to steal Las Vegas . Music: I like music at the top of the show. Absolutely perfect for the show ... Give the tone and atmosphere. Simply wonderful. And of course, there is James Caan.
