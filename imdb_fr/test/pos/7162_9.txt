As I jumped from movie to movie at the SXSW Film Festival, this opening night movie stayed with me. Curious because it is a black comedy with an absurd spirit. <br /> <br /> A family of fundamentalists overworked in a small community of similar minds is transformed by a car accident. Three of the four have the same imminent death experience in which they are completely open, because everyone receives a reversal of the concept of original sin (I will not spoil this scene with the details). The fourth, a college cheerleader, is not only the only physically injured person, she has also remained unchanged and testifies to what has become her crazy family, apparently in spiritual bankruptcy. Each new moment brings a new scandal as they have become innocently naked and frank in every way, the horrifying, then the community. <br /> <br /> Pardon Franklins offers the most beautiful scene of sexual awakening between a husband and his wife I have already seen, with the song of Sarah Brightman "Deliver Me", a song that can now make me cry . <br /> <br /> The casting is fantastic. Robertson Dean in the role of father, Vince Pavia as the son and Aviva in the girl of the cheerleaders are excellent, Mari Blackwell perfectly interprets Peggy, the neighbor interrogator and the best friend of the mother, a character much more nuanced, more elaborate than the one that could have been (everyone in Central America knows a Peggy). And Theresa Willis radiates positively like Betty, the mother. Actors who play the three modified characters take a lot of risks, and these risks are paying off. <br /> <br /> I hope the film will be released widely - if so, I plan to see it again. <Br /> <br /> Very specific comment on: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm
