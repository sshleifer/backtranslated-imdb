THE SEA INSIDE a film by Alejandro Amenabar. <br /> <br /> For years now, Almodovar has been the Italian flag of Spanish cinema. Amenabar came from nowhere to reinvent genres and breathe new life into Spanish industry, which works differently. Now, in a big gamble, he goes from psychological terror to social drama. The biggest of them would be: is the public ready to embrace the movement and, more importantly, can it hold the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor in his twenties who was paralyzed in a sea accident and fought against the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has the footsteps of an afternoon made for the melodrama of television and the only way it works is through the words and honest performances. Mateo Gil and Amenabar co-write so that the audience is not supposed to be blind, but she is encouraged to make her own opinion and that it is a brilliant shot, it is not a professional film. death but a film in favor of the ultimate illusions of our time LIBERTY. There are still a few laughs, like when the church goes home in a wheelchair to deconstruct the beliefs of Sampedro, but is mostly a valley of tears, punches coming from all fronts, even if you think you are safe , his father at this point, it made no sense to find the most moving line of all the film. It is a heartbreaking experience, especially when Sampedro seems more alive than most people roaming the streets and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life, even of those who help him die ?? but when you strip a man of his dreams ?? The film is almost exclusively built on close-ups, which gives a sense of claustrophobia that makes the audience more sympathetic to Sampedro. For the actors, it is a big challenge that must be built with their eyes and they do not lie. Bardem did not get his second Oscar nomination, probably in favor of Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one able to follow Jammie Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in KILLING A MOCKINGBIRD where the acting game seemed easy, and I think Bardem reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blurred. I never liked his first work, but since LIVE FLESH Almodovar, he is on a roll, LOS LUNES AL SOL, THE DANCER UPSTAIRS and Oscar nominated at the Oscars, BEFORE THE NIGHT FALLS, have made it an international star and although he and Banderas are from the same Almodovar It is fascinating to see how much they have taken different paths and how Bardem has become a real reference for Spanish cinema around the world. A golden globe, 14 Goyas, a jury prize in Venice and probably an Oscar with the authorization of THE CHORUS BOYS, Amenabar directs, co-writes, publishes and puts music in a high-caliber drama that he has succeeded ?? What about science fiction now? Who is it? ****
