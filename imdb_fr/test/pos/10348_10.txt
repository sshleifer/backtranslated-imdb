The brilliant acting of David Tennant and Sarah Parish made me cry, because so many scenes are so familiar to me. My husband suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1977 and had to undergo a large-scale operation to lift his brain and stop the leak. Like Tricia, I was naive enough to expect him to become his old self again. After more than 25 years of loving and caring for him, he abandoned me without notice to go live with a woman he barely knew. He then asked and I am getting divorced. I hope the program has helped people understand what it means to cope with a brain injury.
