If you repeat a lie enough times, will it become the truth? 15 Park Avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The film talks about her search for her house at a fictional address where her imaginary husband and five children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each actor in the film was better than the other. Konkona Sen seems incredibly convincing as a schizophrenic. She succeeds in the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is amazing as usual. She plays the dominant and fiercely independent elder sister of Mithi who cares for her sick sister and aging mother. She refuses to accept that despite all her strength and courage, she always feels alone at times. It should have been a very easy film for Rahul Bose. The role was less demanding and anyone could have done it. <br /> <br /> The end of the film was the most surreal part of the Park Avenue experience. It took me a while to understand that the movie was over. It left me confused and maybe even a little disturbed. But later, it started to sink. My eyes are black. But if everyone says they're blue, will I continue to believe it's black ??!
