Well, it's new ... The famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci is shooting a film about a famous Italian horror director named ... Lucio Fulci. After years and years of witnessing terrible horror scenes, it becomes difficult for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and he is often hallucinating when it comes to committing violent murders. It goes down further and further in a seemingly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. Even the dedicated psychiatrist can not keep Fulci on track ... Now, in terms of pure entertainment and entertainment, Cat in the Brain is certainly one of Fulci's most enjoyable films. The gore is overwhelming and hearty, to say the least. It is impossible to describe the amount of foul slaughter, especially if you manage to get hold of the uncut version (known as the "Nightmare Concert"). Beheadings all around, the intestines of the victims are spread on all sides of the screen and chainsaws are overtime! The film also becomes unintentionally funny soon enough (because it is so exaggerated) and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there is beer in the fridge. Of course, from a more professional point of view, this production can not be called a masterpiece! There is not the slightest tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty. To give more room to the gore, the characters are only 5 seconds and then die a horrible death. Especially compared to Fulci's highlights - like "The Beyond" or "Do not Torture a Duckling" - this movie looks like a warmed snack. The best way to interpret "Cat in the Brain" is like a Fulci personal statement and a direct attack on censorship. Maybe after seeing so many of his movies ?? especially the last ?? cut by censorship committees and criticized by pseudo-artistic critics, he wanted revenge by delivering a bloody mess that just can not be cut! If you remove all the explicit violence and really unhealthy makeup effects, you only have about 10 minutes left! Especially because foolish murders are reproduced later in the film while Fulci hallucinates again about them. You can almost hear our director thinking of things like, "Let's see how you are going to censor this now!" Even the investigation of the murder is taking place in the background. Are the victims missing from one of their friends or relatives? Are there any police looking for clues that would lead them to the killer? You do not know it and Lucio does not bother to inform you because it would lead to sequences that do not require cutting. Oh, and it's damn pretentious too! The name "Mr. Fulci" or even "Lucio" is mentioned every 3 minutes (34 times throughout the film, to be exact) and our director clearly likes to be in the spotlight for a change. Hey, I certainly do not blame him ... After more than 30 years of producing fun movies. he deserved to have a little more fun. You are a God, Mr. Fulci!
