Let's suspend belief for a moment and stop pretending that we could, should, or should know "how it's going" or "should be" in space. Human knowledge in this region is probably primitive. For example, maps of the Middle Ages are compared to current satellite maps. So we have no idea what it is. Since this is a "simple" documentary simulation of BBC TV, the situation is much better than that of many big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, and it's just amazing. 3 All in all, a show to watch as it describes CGI's improved and fictitious story of what we know about the solar system so far. 4 probably fiction and the synthesis of images is the only way to make this acceptable to a wide audience. Have you ever watched excerpts from REAL space missions and REAL space probes? The quality is generally average to mediocre and the comparison is between looking at a chest radiograph (and what it tells about the human body) and comparing it to a cyborg film in CGI ... what would be the most entertaining film? However, the chest X-ray is real, while the cyborg film is a fictional SFX. 5 actors do a good job. None of which I will talk to my grandchildren, but very fair for a simulation of docu of the BBC.
