<br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time shortly after it was put on video in 1995, but I rejected it by surprise, saying that Julie was not a Daniel, did not never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrible. <br /> <br /> But here it is, 5 years later, it's on Disney and I'm watching it again. And I find that it's not as bad as I said. Miyagi is always Miyagi, still kool, the score is still nice. And the character of Swank is not so bad, his game is pretty good considering the scenario. He beats the third installment by a wide margin. So, my initial rating of 4 has been increased to 7.
