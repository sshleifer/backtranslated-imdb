Dario Argento is a filmmaker in which I engage slowly, following the iconoclastic efforts of Deep Red and Suspiria; he is not a filmmaker to always worry directly about nonsense such as "the plot". It may be his minor responsibility (but, for me, apparent): he will not let a thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate murder sequences, because his or her killers can go through any kind of process developed. to be invisible, until revealing the point of view of the point of view, followed from the point of view of the psychopathic killer. But it's exciting to see a filmmaker take such chances anyway, a pure Italian aesthetic slipping into the soul of a chain Hitchcock (in fact, as a note of interest, if we recently saw the short Scorsese in which he took Three pages of an unpitched film by Hitchcock, which was also in an opera, Argento had beaten him for almost twenty years, probably without any knowledge of the text). It is also resolutely 80s (CD players, heavy metal and hair, oh my god!) And with an absurdity that makes it all the more pleasant to swallow. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a Macbeth opera is in the making, with highly stylized pyrotechnics and trained ravens. There is even a talented rising star replaced at the last minute, Betty, played by Marsillach. But a murder takes place during the first, interrupted not by that, but by a falling light. And now, the murderer is after Betty! She can not go to the police (how can she let you know that the opera is really cursed?), But will that affect the murderer who will not give up? We've probably already seen premises such as this one appear in other Argento films - a girl pursued by a murderer - but that's how Argento, like De Palma, builds and executes his sequences and adds a distinctive touch to hers to add a touch of weird humor. (the raven's escape to attack the murderer, and the later version of the indication in the composition), a kind of over-stylization in the manner of Leone (the bullet through the door peephole probably inspired a similar shot in Kill Bill 1) and even a sado-masochistic inspiration with the pins glued to Betty's eyes, more than once! <br /> <br /> Argento puts her actress in the hands of the wrestler, and she is ready to play, even when things seem to be happening in space (what the hell did to me (I raised the hands almost saying) that I give up when she is driving in the secret passage by the little girl, as if suddenly we were in Aliens now). And through such a dark material, Argento keeps the violence thick and fresh, the suspense almost as much as that of an opera coming from a loudspeaker of a stereo and a filmmaker who may have been drinking a few glasses (and rightly so!). ) during certain scenes, the way they are shot and vibrate at a heartbeat. This should be considered a waste, but it is superior to all the limitations of the genre by the director's casual attitude, this despite a stupid end - more stupid than anything that preceded what preceded it (thanks little lizard ) - and an attempt to break the curse of Macbeth, which, unfortunately, did not seem to occur in real life on the set of Opera. 8.5 / 10
