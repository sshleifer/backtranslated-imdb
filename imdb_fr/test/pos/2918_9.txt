Akhenaton being interested for many years, I was surprised to learn this movie via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD in 99p format. I enjoyed the film, the twists in the plot and the fact that the file focused mainly on the main character, Sinuhe, in fact more a "family saga" than an action movie. The costumes and attention to detail were remarkable at the time (1955). The rear projection during the chariot ride now seems awkward. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. In this film, he was portrayed as "Jesus" as in his refusal to make war on the Hittites even as they invaded Egypt and in his closing speech on the uselessness of materiality and political power. Initially, Sinuhe was linked to drifting in the Nile in a basket of reeds, and the Old Testament Moses. But there is no doubt that this relationship will be fully explored in a new film in which a character like Moses will transport the monotheistic religion of Akhenaton around the world, if such a film would one day be politically possible. It is universally accepted that if women are concerned, we are stupid beings, but the relationship or absence of a relationship between Sinuhe and Merit, the character played by Jean Simmons is hard to accept. And that Sinuhe, an educated doctor, would be so seduced by Nefer the "femme fatale" of Babylon to give him the home of his adoptive parents and his grave would not really be credible, any more than his parents would even have a grave. In real life, Nefer (Nefertitti) was Akhnaton's wife. And although Horemheb became Pharaoh, it was after a few others, including Tutankhamen, who was the son of Akhenaton. <br /> <br /> But of course, this is an enigma and the film is nice to watch. Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. After the book and the movie "Da Vinci Code", this film could be redone with the central secret at the base of our current monotheism! I look forward to such a movie, there are already many books on the subject.
