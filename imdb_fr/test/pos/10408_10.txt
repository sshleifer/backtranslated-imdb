I have never posted anything here before, but after watching Noroi, I just felt that I had to write my thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> First of all, do not compare this to Blair Witch, this movie deserves a lot better than this one! In short, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). <br /> <br /> I really liked the fact that the movie does not look like a classic horror movie. , but as a documentary filmed by a journalist (I think?) named Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without spoiling the plot, I can say it starts with Kobayashi doing research on a seemingly unrelated series of events, which turns out to be related to something much darker and more sinister. <br /> <br /> The story may not be so original in itself. What was really close to Noroi was the incredibly disturbing atmosphere. If you're looking for scaring scenes and cheap seat-jump scenes, this movie may not be right for you. This film talks about the atmosphere it presents, with haunting images and a general feeling of disturbing suspense. The style of documentary film makes the farm more credible. <br /> <br /> This is also a lot helped by the acting, which is superb, although not perfect for the general part of the film! Much better than most other movies of this kind. <br /> <br /> Although I feel quite slander, I strongly recommend Noroi to everyone, it is suspenseful, scary, well played and the first film that scared me in the ages.
