See No Evil is the first film of the WWE. Yes, WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, professional wrestling. Of course, being a WWE film, a wrestler has to play it, the wrestler being Glenn Jacobs, aka Kane. Which is not really important, because if you did not know Kane or what the WWE represented, you would never know that it has something to do with the wild word of wrestling, because the movie has nothing to do with the fight. See No Evil is a disgusting horror movie, it has had some moments where some people can jump, but most of the time, it's just saying, look how disgusting we can be! Not that something is wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is somehow a Jason character. His mother tortured him when he was a child with strict Christian beliefs (euphemism) and made him deformed. Now he is a big scary killing machine. 90% of the film takes place in an abandoned hotel where Jacob follows six teenagers (surprised?) And a handful of adults. I could explain why they are in a scary old hotel but eh, who cares! Despite its lack of originality, See No Evil is well done, for what it is supposed to be. Kane plays the role of a great killer and needs only a little makeup to scare. One of the weaknesses of the film is the most annoying possibility that people survive. I'm really looking forward to seeing them being horribly killed, but alas, that does not happen. I hope the film does not carry the stigma of the fight, although, as I said, the film has nothing to do with the fight, people are still closed enough not to want to see it because Since they are a hate fight Again, the film can also make money because Wrestling fans will want to see it. Anyway, See No Evil has some prominent effects and a small CGI, and as I said, it's pretty brutal, so I would say that's fine, if you like that kind of thing.
