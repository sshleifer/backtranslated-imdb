Andreas arrives in a strange city. He does not remember where he came from or how he got there. He is ordered to come to work and he sets up his own apartment in town. All his colleagues are kind and polite to him, they say hello and smile when they pass by him. But then Andreas discovers that the city is not as nice as it seems. Back home after work, he saw people in gray suits, cleaning up the bloody corpse, apparently a suicide victim who had flung himself out the window. The procedure is done with a calm spirit, as if we emptied a trash. The next day, Andreas meets the suicide victim in full life at work. Andreas discovers more and more the unfathomable atmosphere of the city. <br /> <br /> Den brysomme mannen is perhaps the best Norwegian film I have ever seen. Original artistic achievement is generally lacking in Norwegian films, with a few exceptions. The plot is also very original, and could even be called postmodern horror, because the film presents a terrifying thought of having to face a world that is completely without feeling. and the more you try to make sense of your life in this city, the more it loses its meaning. I'm fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of an unblocked universe, a nightmare that you simply can not escape, not even with death. <br /> <br /> Go see it, it's really worth it! I gave him 9 out of 10.
