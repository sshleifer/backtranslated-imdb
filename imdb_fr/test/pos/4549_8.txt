This film is hilarious. The laughs never stop. Each scene is packed to the limit with a hilarious comedy. Chris Farley is a genius of comics and Spade plays his character thoroughly. Farley was one of the best slap stick comics of all time, and in this film (as in all his films) we see how much time and energy he has devoted to portraying his character in his own way. "Tommy Boy" is a great example of comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
