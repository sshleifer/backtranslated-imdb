Being an avowed self-confessed addict means that it's very rare that I have the chance to see many of the bigger budgeted movies with laudable roles. In addition to the success at James Mangold's Identity box office draw; there have been no big name entries since the Scream trilogy once again put Wes Craven's name on the Hollywood map. That's why the last stop of Mark Malone ?? A mysterious thriller with clear accents, instantly intrigued me. With a decent line-up including Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds room for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden, I have to admit that the first signs were very positive for this claustrophobic movie. As far as I know, there have never been more than three other slashers related to the snow, unless of course you consider Demon Possessed as belonging to the category. The first slice on the ice was the blade of dehydrated Satan, then the Lisa Loring cheese feast that was Blizzard of Blood and the nice Shredder followed about fourteen years later. <br /> <br /> During an extreme blizzard, Private Jason (Adam Beach) fights in the snow to reach an isolated flag in the Colorado Mountains. Its task is to inform customers that the road is closed and that they must stay at least one more night until a path can be cleared of dangerous conditions. This news does not go very well with the suspicious group, which includes two disruptive brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver who really does not want to hang out (William S. Taylor), an excited couple. lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and the ex-girlfriend of Jason Nancy (Rose McGowan). Motel owners (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) are not thrilled with the news either, but they offer rooms to stranded guests and try to calm down the situation. Things get complicated when Jason discovers a mutilated body and a bag full of stolen money, lying in the snow behind the cafe. Just like a chapter drawn from a mystery of Agatha Christie, the tenants begin to die at the hands of a masked assailant who seems intent on recovering the money. With so many shady characters to choose from and no way to leave the crime scene, Jason must try to stop the maniac before he kills again ?? <br /> <br /> A good mystery requires at least a handful of dubious suspects who each have a credible motive, a remote place that nobody can escape and a smart protagonist to help reveal clues. Fortunately, The Last Stop provides each of these essential ingredients in a thriller that has its equal moments of brilliance and sheer stupidity. The film starts superbly as dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that manages to maintain tension across the world. Malone maintains high levels of interest when each character unveils their own reasons for suspicion, and to be honest, the essentials are not something you'll guess easily. In fact, I found myself watching the movie one more time to see if I could understand the clues I was missing the first time. Unfortunately, when the maniac proves to be an excessive psychopath who laughs like a comical villain, The Last Stop loses a tremendous amount of credibility. Fortunately, all is not lost when an unexpected plot of land and brilliantly orchestrated saves the final of the film. <br /> <br /> Similarities can be drawn with the excellent identity, the two parcels being almost interchangeable. James Mangold's effort must be the best of both, mainly because of John Cusack's and Ray Liotta's stellar yet reliable cast. That said, Adam Beach is doing a pretty good job in the lead, while Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and the brilliant Callum Keith Rennie are providing credible support. Rose McGowan plays this role with vanity, as she probably does day by day and Winston Rekert has started fantastically before giving up the movie completely. If you're a fan of a slasher watching the scene for bloody killings, you'll be disappointed. The psychopath wearing a balaclava appears only once and the rest of the murders are committed off screen. But as I said earlier, Malone's talent as a director means that the suspense is never too far away and that you can forgive the few flaws, because the positives have it. <br /> <br /> The Last Stop is worth a look at slasher addicts and moviegoers. Yes, there are a handful of negatives, but overall, it's a good example of new Hollywood talent. If you liked the identity, then surely try this?
