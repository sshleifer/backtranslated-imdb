Is Thursday an original film? Damn no, but it's a lot of fun! I just saw this buried on movie channels one night and it was a nice movie. I was expecting a lot, but I had some interesting scenes (I liked the first sight at the convenience store), fun stories told by the characters and a little action in the mix. Some good performances by young actors, Paulina Porizkova was good and I was particularly impressed by Aaron Eckhart (who continued to impress me more in "Your friends and neighbors" and "Erin Brokovich"). So, if you want 90 minutes of relaxation, go ahead, Thursday?
