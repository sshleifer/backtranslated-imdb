I must say that it is a sign that this film will appeal to all ages if someone right must protect themselves from all that is homosexual at a distance absolutely loves this thing. <br /> <br /> I thought every bit of this movie was amazing and the cast was great, but I have to say Anna Chancellor ... where have you been all my life. <br /> <br /> Having already seen Anna in several other things, I am completely blown away by her beauty. <br /> <br /> Diana Letherby may not be the nicest character, but she could definitely take me home if she felt good ...
