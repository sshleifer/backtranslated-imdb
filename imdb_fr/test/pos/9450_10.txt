Well, I'm not a movie critic or anything like that. But I have my opinion for this film. I think the best in this movie was Amanda Bynes, she played her role very well for my look, I 've watched a lot Movies, that's what I liked the most! When you watch this movie, you can just relax, go down and watch it. You do not have to look for subtext or anything like that. You just watch it. The movie is really great. Maybe that's what I liked for an actress, maybe for the whole landscape, but I liked it. The atmosphere that was created.A moment, I had the impression to find me in this university made to win Oscar, it's just a nice movie to watch during your free time.
