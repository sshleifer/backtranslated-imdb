Although I do not like cricket at all and have seen this movie 13 years ago, I still think it's one of the best movies of the new generation. I remember the day I came back from school and sat down at lunch, saw the first titles of this movie and then ... I was so immersed in this film that I felt there, it really touched me personally. I still remember how I felt when I saw him for the first time. I felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine and had the same teenage experience we had at that time. What I really liked in this film is the main theme of a "shy" boy fantasizing about "kissing" his dream girl, no offense, but if it was an American film, you would certainly see at one point, mainly the climax, the "shy" boy "making love" to his daughter, and I really can not understand these conflicting concepts until now ... I have a request simple, if anyone knows how to get this movie on dvd by mail, please let me know because i need a keepsake..thank you
