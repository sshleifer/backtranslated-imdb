Hey; Belmondo! Look Anna Karina! Great New American improvised (or Independent, as you want to call it so), not as good as Godard or Truffaut, and not without flaw, but good kind, realism, style, warmth and humor. I love this New York accent. "you know nothing!"; "forget that". Just like the new French wave, it's about young people; party, fall in love or just hang out. Lelia Goldoni is so cute; she is adorable; wonderful. Ben Carruthers is also good, Belmondo reminds me. A movie you will not forget. <br /> <br /> A regularity of 26.5 out of 31 ;-)
