Bergman's account of how the hell of war can lead a reasonable couple of musicians to barbarism. With many memorable scenes throughout the film, I found particularly noteworthy that near the end, Ullmann and Von Sydow go in a boat completely surrounded by corpses of soldiers floating on the sea. A masterpiece fascinating!
