I thought this movie was smartly written and played very well. It is a film that far surpasses other films in terms of originality and pleasure. Rupert Grint played the role perfectly and has a general talent for acting. The almost obsessive mother added a lot to the plot and was a character that could almost immediately be hated. It reminded me in a way of the divine secrets of the Ya Ya sorority. Not with the actual content of the film, but with the local and the overall tone of the film. "Driving Lessons" is a story of transition to adulthood, which many might find very easy to understand because of the overwhelming mother, lack of freedom and self-discovery.
