I agree with Vince, this film paved the way for Goodfellas. The scene where Pesci was throwing peanuts at the pianist reminded me of his "How am I funny?" routine at Goodfellas. It is a very underrated film that deserves special attention. As in many other mass films, the theme of The Death Collector sounds right: always respect the Don.
