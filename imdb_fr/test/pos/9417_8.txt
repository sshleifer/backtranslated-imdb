Sherlock Holmes' films from the classic Universal period tend to vary in quality. This range is very good above average, with none of their results being catastrophic or incredibly brilliant. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fit in perfectly with the quality and, as always, it's a nice release that fans of the show, like me, will enjoy. This film sees Holmes at the heart of a plot led by the evil Nazi to steal an invention of a Swiss scientist, which could prove to be a key element on the battlefield. Sherlock Holmes's WWII films are generally not as good as those in The Scarlet Claw, where Holmes conducts private investigations, as they are usually linked to excessive propaganda or a more war-related plot than mystery. This one, however, stays pretty much away from both and, with an emphasis on Holmes and his investigation, the film works much better. Universal may have seen what had destroyed the previous version of Voice of Terror and changed the game because of that. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone once again performs an excellent non-conformist performance as a genius detective and if Nigel Bruce does not appear as usual, it's nice to see him when he does. The two do not spend a lot of time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is still one of the best assets of Holmes films; but it gives Holmes more time to show off in various disguises, which is always very amusing. Dennis Hoey's Lestrade is definitely my favorite among the secondary characters, and although he's not as funny as usual; his facial expressions are excellent and his presence helps to emphasize how wonderful Holmes is. His scene with Watson in a car after the fall of paint on the road is my favorite moment of the movie. It's good to see Holmes' enemy, Professor Moriarty, even though he seems to have been thrown in the trash. Lionel Atwill's performance is not as good as that of George Zucco in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, because he never really convinced that he was really brilliant. but seeing him play with the protagonist is fun and it's nice to see him in the movie to offset the themes of World War II, which are never as interesting as Holmes himself. The film begins more as a thriller than a detective film; but once it starts, it's hard to get it down and it's a more than solid entry into Universal's work.
