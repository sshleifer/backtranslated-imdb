When I sat down at the movies to see this, I was expecting to see some sort of elegant and arrogant action movie, which had been suggested by the trailers. However, it soon became clear that this film was trying to be more. <br /> <br /> Normally, I do not approve movies that try to entertain in any way possible. For example, this film tries to mix action with comedy, romance, lightness and seriousness all at once. Most of the time, this type of approach does not work in movies (just watch Batman Forever), but I was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they were successful. <br /> <br /> The end result is a very entertaining film that should appeal to most movie lovers. (However, the weak of the stomach should be really warned of one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller draw a brilliant double act and Ken Stott is an excellent villain. This combination of stunning costumes and some decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch. <br /> <br /> However, the big disadvantage here for me is that having "The Gentleman Highwayman" has given me a good opportunity to chat, but the script was definitely lacking in punch and there was little laughter about it. belly. Okay, the aftershocks were not terrible, but for me, this highlights a problem with recent British movies; Ignoring some notable exceptions, the scripts written today are still relatively weak compared to some Hollywood efforts.
