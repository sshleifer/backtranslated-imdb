At first glance, a film like Northfork, a city about to be flooded in 1955 and a group of six characters sent to evacuate the remaining inhabitants, may well be just a regular movie. As we soon meet a remaining priest who looks after a sick child, an avid landowner, we could be staged for a simple story that we could easily digest. However, when we discover this film for the first time, we notice the incredible open cinematography and a scene in which a parish hall lacks a wall that opens onto the pastures and offers a panoramic view of the mountains where graze the cattle. It soon becomes obvious that after this scene and some of the introductions of the inhabitants of the city, that it is not an ordinary film or an ordinary story, but something very special and 'unique. <br /> <br /> At first sight, things are not It is also clear that the cinematography and the landscape that the viewer witnesses are stunning and that the characters who live in this small area that will soon disappear are simply incredible. That's what can bring you closer to this qwerky movie or get bored, waiting for something to happen. Deep, witty and dreamy films give a slow and methodical approach. I'm sure this will annoy some viewers, but if you're patient with it and see it all, the movie is great to see. <br /> <br /> Rating 8 out of 10
