Josie is a journalist with a mission to return to high school because she will be 17 years old. . <br /> <br /> As she is there, she remembers some really awful things that happened to her the first time she was in high school, as we see in flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> In the flashback, they show that (little spoiler) Josie was a kind of geek in high school and she was chosen a lot and one day, the cool guy tells him that she takes him at the graduation party, only on graduation night leaving the house she receives excited by the asshole and her bitch. what a horrible thing to do (some will find it hard to watch because it is so mean and it will make you feel more hot in Josie). <br /> <br /> I did not find this film as funny as that, but there were really funny stuff in office scenes much more funny than anything that happened in school . <br /> <br /> This film had a happy ending because it made my mother and sister cry with their eyes. The acting in this film was not exceptional, it was good for most of the film, there are some bad actors in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> I will give this film 7 out of 10.
