After watching Ingmar Bergman's Skammen, I felt a lot of feelings, but I felt particularly dissatisfied. I have heard so much about this movie but I have come to find it. Do not get me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but in terms of depth and emotion, I was not so impressed. I found the characters unpleasant and unrealistic, which detracted from the dramatic effect. Moreover, the fact that the war was wrong led me to think that the emotion was not real. Dramatic war films, in my opinion, are much more effective if the events (not necessarily the story itself) actually happened. I find that of all the films that try to show the brutality, this one falls at the center of the efficiency.
