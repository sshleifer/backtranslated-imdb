The film is about a girl who does not go to a bonfire just because she's sitting that night. Nothing weird about it, right? Until ... the phone rings. Until ... the phone rings again. And again ... And again. These are not stupid calls. It's for real. If you want to see how the girl reacts, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Excellent atmosphere filled with scary sounds. Very well interpreted by the young Camilla Belle who had the main role. I see in her a great potential to become a good actress. It's more than a decent thriller, I have no idea why it's underestimated. Anyway, in my opinion, this movie deserves more than 4/10. 24% of voters gave the film a score of 1. Become serious, people. You could not get a better thriller for a title like this.
