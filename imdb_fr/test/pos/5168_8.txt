The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season lies in the fact that it revolves around the family. This is why some people call it "Children's Day". As we age, natural attrition and progress eliminate the people and things that gave us our special memories. John Denver, in one of his sweetest roles, embodies George Billings, successful architect in New York and a new widower who lost his wife about a year ago. His life is centered around his 9-year-old daughter, Alex; both are still in mourning for their loss. George is doing his best to make this Christmas special for his daughter. Enter his boss, Thomas Renfield (Edward Winters), who sends George to Georgetown, Colorado, to explore a possible real estate transaction. Going to tell his daughter that the purpose of his trip is to spend a holiday rather than work, George and Alex fly to the city. They are immediately greeted by a group of loving, generous but somewhat eccentric characters, whose main eccentricity is that they believe in Santa Claus. Georgetown is a community of picture books in which we would all like to live and we would like people as neighbors. George soon meets a loving interest in Susan (Jane Kazmarek.) Without the grinch (Renfield), it would be an ideal time. But the fact is that he is in town to find a property to develop for Renfield, and there is a pretty ranch near the city about to be foreclosed, and the dark edges of the movie revolve around the impending closure and reactions of the breeder and the strangers. I will not spoil the end for those who have never seen the movie. It is a typical Christmas end, but it is managed in a subtle and credible way to show the best of the human spirit without being too syrupy. All in all, it's the most enjoyable way to spend a few hours of television at Christmas. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have a nice chemistry and Gennie James like Alex does a pretty good job. I've always loved the work of Mary Wickes, an identifiable actress, and all the other cast members do a good job with less fleshy roles. It's a regular Christmas fare for my family. I note 4/5.
