In Brooklyn, Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) nightclub dancer lives a simple but happy life in McGuire's, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) hold a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar trying to find a pearl. Rusty's life changes when she participates and wins a contest that becomes the cover page of Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater on Broadway, which the owner offers. She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new lifestyle, missing the love of Danny and his old friends. "Cover Girl" is a delightful romantic and naive comedy with beautiful roles, such as the beautiful and talented Rita Hayworth who dances, sings and plays roles; Gene Kelly, especially in two scenes, dancing with himself and with Rusty and Genius in the street; the songs and choreography of the dances are also spectacular. Danny, the character of Gene Kelly, is almost naughty with his chauvinistic behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her great in 'Gilda', but she is superb in 'Cover Girl'. According to the information on the cover of the VHS, "Cover Girl" was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot, giving continuity to the story, instead of just being "projected" in the film . My sixteen-year-old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age at a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved Cover Girl. I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to previous generations. . My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Models" ("Models")
