I have never seen a movie like this. I did not intend to see it, but it was worth seeing the TV channel. I am mainly a scifi movie watcher, but I would be more than happy to add this one to my collection. It starts with a single-sided movie with a simple love triangle and then becomes something slightly different (I can not say more, but it involves two guys and a girl.) The protrusion is not the one that you are waiting). In addition, this film featured Hugo Weaving in "MATRIX" and "THE LORD OF THE RINGS" in a role I did not expect ... a very funny guy. This film is broadcast on HERE TV, but if you do not have a satellite, it is worth renting. So try it; you will not be disappointed.
