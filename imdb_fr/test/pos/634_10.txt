In today's world of teen advertising, horror and sensationalism, it is very rare to see a film without saying anything about it. Movies like Psycho and Blair Witch, while suspensive (both very well built) are ruined by the fact that we all know the best scenes and at least the plot before seeing them. With Mute Witness, a rare treat, I came across this film and watched it, frightened, in the middle of the night. The threatening atmosphere of Russia, the theme of "snuff" and the claustrophobic spell of the mute scared me, as well as the fact that the characters (fun, which always lead to friendly characters) could end at any time . As it is a low budget and rare film, we watch it without any waiting. Fay Ripley is also responsible for playing a rare film role, watching and preparing to be excited, frightened and amazed in totally unexpected ways.
