I admit that I almost gave up watching television shows. Why? Because most of them involve doctors, forensic doctors or girls / boys, who can predict murder by sitting on the toilet seat. But I must say that I was wrong when I watched the first episode of Oz, one of the brightest shows on television until today. Oz is a show about the maximum security prison and presents the episodes of each cellmate's life and their frustrations. What I like about this show is the fact that she has the courage to show real life in prison without boring characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogues. Even though the characters in the series are not supposed to be heroes, you quickly became attached to them and their lives. Of course, there is a lot of violence in this show and disturbing images of rape and drug addiction, but that's the purpose of this show. to show how life in prison can be brutal and frustrating ... but you can not show your life in prison as a "clean environment" with "nice characters", right? Oz is perfect in every way, the actors do a great job and this whole hour of the show is going very fast. The only thing I did not like in this show was the last season, I think it had become too strange and brutal and the final was not satisfactory. But overall, Oz is still my favorite show on television so far, it exceeds the sopranos and millions of CSI and Dr. House House with just one main title. Brilliant show that has the balls to show what other shows take us away; realism.
