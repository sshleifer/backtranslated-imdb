This film and the rest of its television series have become the iconic replica of what is great in America. <br /> <br /> Fame is famous for her music and performances. Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara * and the superb Gene Anthony Ray are some of the most remarkable personalities. The latter, who plays a dancer without vis-Ã -vis with academic degrees or other than those in the street, is an incredible personality and is worth watching for what is essentially a representation of himself. A wonder to see, as a king could say. <br /> <br /> The plot follows an interesting format - sometimes chronological, sometimes kind, sometimes personalities ... but everything really ends up in a kind of porridge. <br /> <br /> Parker manages to tilt this film into a state of periodic overwork, with the extremely poignant musical score, sometimes beautiful and pure and simple that corresponds to the performers, step by step. <br /> The climax of the film is a climax for all time. And this climatic distribution completes many talented musicians and dancers and the music is happily repeated throughout the credits. It's a set of credits that deserves to be remembered ... a feat for the ages. Christopher Gore's music is a gift to behold.
