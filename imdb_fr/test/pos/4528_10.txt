How many reviews of this film should I write before I succeed? Tom Conway fully inherits the Falcon coat of his brother George Sanders with this entry. Dressed in gorgeous one-button double-breasted, double-breasted suits, and riding in stunning 110% stainless steel cars, with large wing skirts and suicide gates that rise to your armpit, Conway travels from New York in Miami makes for industrial diamonds falling into the wrong hands. Her "client" is charming, the virgin Louisa Briganza who has beautiful hair but will not let you kiss her for the first two months. Along the way, he runs into the type of colorful chart of characters that only a film B can provide. His companion in this outing is perhaps the best among Falcon's acolytes, Edward Brophy, in the role of Goldie Locke, who was given really amusing replies. He meets a sinister plat, Doris Blanding, the type of chick of the 40s that you know well. His cohort is Benny portrayed by Steve Brodie who, twenty years later, was a Presley punching bag in two Paramount King movies. They both work for the cold fish and Kenneth Sutton, wearing a cap, ready to do whatever it takes to get the formula while going by boat to Brazil. Faced by the most stoic cops in pursuit of Falcon, this entry still reigns supreme. Forget about these 120-minute melodramas, give me a one-hour movie about Falcon. I have a wife and two children - who has time for a two-hour movie? Shake dry martinis and forget your worries with this great Falcon movie. But if you do not record it on local television in Toronto like I did 17 years ago, you will not have a chance.
