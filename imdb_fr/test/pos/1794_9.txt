In Fassbinder's previous films, his ideas sometimes surpassed his ability to execute them. He has always been a great writer, but it took him a while to understand his style of working with a camera and telling stories. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Four Seasons is one of Fassbinder's first films to make good use of color, bright green pears in the bright red roses merchant cart of the funeral (a burial in a Fassbinder movie that would have thought of it). <br /> <br /> His photographic work was happening there too, but it was still pretty minimalist. The occasional zooms sometimes seem a little uncomfortable and unnatural, but again, Fassbinder was still emerging from its purely forward-looking phase. It may be because Michael Ballhaus is not behind the camera, but rather the slightly lower Dietrich Lohmann. <br /> <br /> Yet here is Fassbinder, and you get your solution here. Broken dreams are so vividly and unshakably shown that they alienate the public and push them into depressed stupor. Just what the doctor prescribed. One of the first classics that shows remarkable progress compared to his first films released just 2 years ago.
