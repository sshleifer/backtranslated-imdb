My Mother Frank begins as a warm, friendly comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, played by Sinead Cusack), who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling at her son's university. Most of his friends and family are horrified, including his son (Matthew Newton), who has fallen in love with his best friend's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank has aroused the ire of his disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill). <br /> <br /> Matthew Newton is completely disarmed as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character is stuck. It generates valuable goodwill, guiding the audience through some of the film's most difficult and broad comedy moments. Shortly after the mid-point, Mark Lamprell, first director-screenwriter, skillfully directs his film on a darker emotional territory and gives Cusack a real chance to shine. <br /> <br /> the welcome faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all the directors (including a more animated Sam Neill than usual) are excellent. My mother Frank delivers more than what is promised and pleases a little more to the Australian crowd.
