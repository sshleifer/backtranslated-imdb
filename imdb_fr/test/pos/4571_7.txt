If this film is closely examined, it's a bit sad. It is detailed enough to suggest very real problems with children growing up in poor and dysfunctional environments. Still, it retains its comic value, with enthusiastic performances by Diahan Carroll and James Earl Jones. The sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunctions of the mother (Carroll), who can not really help her children, not because she does not want, or tries, but because it is obvious that she does not know how. Do not forget it's a comedy, but if you've never seen it, or if you've seen it before, watch this movie and see humanity in the characters. Good movie.
