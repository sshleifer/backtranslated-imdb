Those who wish to see the remakes of the black film, do not see it as a remake, you will always be disappointed. Instead, enjoy a stunning performance by Dennis Quaid and visual imagery to commend. The color flows out of the movie (literally, not metaphorically!) As the plot gets faster and the dialogue is clean and realistic. The opening dialogue is astute and the viewer is driven by a sharp scenario and a real and original film noir sensation.
