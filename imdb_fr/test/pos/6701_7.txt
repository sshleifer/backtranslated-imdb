Ok, let's first consider this: As a movie piece, Lifeforce is a waste. For fans of SF, it is a kind of fun and meritorious animation. If you like watching these old SF B black and white movies - giant mutated spiders / alien or extraterrestrial monsters wandering the desert - you'll really have a kick for Lifeforce. is not logical and the acting is quite mediocre. Good things: the special effects are halfway decent; it has a history centered on Great Britain (it takes place in London) and gives a different feel to most SF films; and she has the well-endowed Mathilda May (fun called "Space Girl") wandering completely naked. <br /> <br /> In short: it's fun. <br /> <br /> I've seen it a half dozen times now, and every time it goes on TV, I take the time to watch it - this is partly due to the nude Ms. May - but also do with the profit of a bit of unpretentious and stupid SF.
