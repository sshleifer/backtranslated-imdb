Bwana Devil is reputed to be the first major studio feature shot entirely in 3D. Producer Oboler is supposed to have gone to Africa to shoot a different film, but after hearing the story of two men-eating lions terrorizing railroad builders, she chose this one. It's a good story too, almost like Hemmingway; fear, redemption, the great white hunter and all. It's the tale of the story that seems to be hanging out, almost as if filming in the new process was too much for the team. The action scenes are steep, almost too staged. But these technical problems seem minimal in light of the dramatic conclusion of the film.
