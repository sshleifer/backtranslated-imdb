17/12/01 All I can do with this film is to improvise on my impressions. I was not given the "changes", I do not know the "score" and I am not in school. Anyway, I always had trouble following chord changes (trumpet player, you know), so I was pretty limited to doing the basics "keep the chord" and ad lib around that. This incredibly gloomy piece of black-and-white blues held me by the knot it gave me in my head and heart when I was trying to determine whether I wanted to accompany the ensemble or choose a path along the melody (story. ) went with the melody as usual; I was constantly losing myself in the changes - too deep, too wide, probably over my head. Still, it was a gas to try to keep up. I admired the acting game on the theme and the story. I did not see certain things or things that others seemed to have: I did not feel that the light skin was "trying to pass" as much as she was unaware of the color problem or was trying to ignore it - at first : later, she came back to fight. The bright-skinned and brooding young man (his noodling trumpet was ridiculous) was ambiguous, ambivalent and - perhaps his best feature - distant. After closing the shadow curtain on this provocative piece, I said to myself: what is the foundation of such a thing? Is it a way to find the "reality" by setting up a scene, populating it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and a theme? Is this truer or more truthful than a well-crafted script - without the benefit of editing and editing? Is improvisation heroic, more "artistic"? Where is the truth greater or clearer: in art / craft retrospective or in manufacturing and reform? Well, I'm always lost in this question. I loved the movie; I lost myself in a blue and misty evening where I just had to go home and take out my horn. Guess what? I burst into a blues riff of twelve bars, tried and true - I could not get out of the melody. The reality is too scary. Jaime says to give them a 7 and up. I'm having a break.
