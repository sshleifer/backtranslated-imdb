It Came from Outer Space II is a very good movie that has a good cast and that includes Brian Kerwin, Elizabeth Carra, Elizabeth Spana, Adrian Sparks, Bill McKinney, Norris Dean, Dawn Zeek, Lauren Tewes, Mickey Jones, Iilana B'tiste , Jerry Giles and Howard Morris! The game of all these actors is very good. Kerwin and Norris are really excellent in this movie. I thought they performed well. The chills are really good and some are surprising.
