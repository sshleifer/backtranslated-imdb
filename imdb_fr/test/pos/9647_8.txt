I do not have a really strong thesis here, so I'm just going to make a couple of comments. <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie is absolutely beautiful. The shooting is very contrasted in black and white and some scenes are so well composed that they are almost embarrassing. <br /> <br /> At first there was a sequence of intense demonstrations, and some of the shots were incredible - three types fired tear gas at protesters, and so on. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think one of the biggest signs of the claim that this film is recent the idealism of the revolution has transformed itself into something different . The point of view of this change is really interesting - I think that the political phase of things as well as the artistic phase and the more self-indulgent phase have strengths and weaknesses. The film does not necessarily take for granted that things have deteriorated. <br /> <br /> Third, I think romance works very well. <br /> <br /> Finally, I really, really, really hated the end. . It was too melodramatic. One could even say that the end is unworthy of the film that preceded it.
