Leno speaks through his striking lines. This spoils the joke for those of you who do not understand it. His show takes place in a small studio for one or two reasons: little laughter will be amplified and few people will want to see it. Letterman's decor is the opposite - Ed Sullivan would be proud and the balcony is always full. <br /> <br /> NBC, NBC sticky, will never get it. The megalomaniacal company of founder David Sarnoff continues to be focused on money. CBS has at least an air of family. <br /> <br /> Leno collects cars, or stamps, while Letterman races. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I chatted, I asked other chatters to send me an e-mail if Leno _ever_ said something funny. I never received a single email. Letterman has superb timing. He can also re-use the least funny joke so that it becomes one of the funniest things in this evening's show. <br /> <br /> Letterman has built other careers. Paul is now well known and respected in his musical right. Even the other members of Paul's group are recognized and stimulate their careers. Biff Henderson has become a household name in America. Even businesses located in the same block as the Ed Sullivan Theater have a boost. What has Leno already done for someone else? Personally, I'm happy that Dave moved out and that Leno got the job at Carson. I had never watched NBC shows before and had no reason to do so afterwards. <br /> <br /> The top ten list is an American icon. Just like Letterman. Leno is a caricaturist's dream, nothing more.
