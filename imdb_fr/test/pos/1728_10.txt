Honestly, I do not really understand why this show has generated so much controversy. He embraces the elements of the original while developing them. The narration has been updated and, although some episodes seem to be a bit "fast", it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role. As easily as Tom Baker. <br /> <br /> Rose is one of the best companions, tied with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the concept that the timelords were destroyed. - More politicization with the doctor acting as president emeritus. And he adds something to the character to be the only one left. <br /> <br /> SFX is exceptional - especially compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Take it to me (And I was a huge geek of Dr. Who - Actually, I took notes while watching the series, from Dr. 1 to Dr. 8. I threw Canon's horrible movie, personally) is the best science fiction show on television right now, maybe already. Watch it and buy the DVD.
