Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is an example of French transition cinema. A film between the realism of post-war cinema and the new magic and symbolism. With a few passages from American classic films (without imitating them), the director tells us a story about love, crime and the importance of points of view. We can also find excellent actors (Suzy Delair is impeccable). <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see how we can find the aspects of this film today. The heritage of Quai des Orf√®vres is palpable in the Woody Allen tradition. Immerse yourself in a crime situation in a picturesque environment. The naive ending is also typical in Steven Spielberg's quality films. Finally, I would like to emphasize the feeling of already voo during the photography session between Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair) and Dora Monier (Simone Renant), in which the first confession that she thinks that her husband is unfaithful and exactly with the woman who is photographing it. This scene is exactly that between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer (Mike Nichols, 2004).
