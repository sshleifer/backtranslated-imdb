I enjoyed Erkan & Stefan ?? a cool and fast story that has not got bogged down in the details. These two guys are great to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time. The high quality of the images and cuts supports the film a lot. <br /> <br /> Erkan & Stefan show that the German film industry is able to transfer successful Hollywood concepts with local "satire" in our theaters.
