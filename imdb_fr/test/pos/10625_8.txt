Overall, I found this film good: exceptional acting with disturbing scenes (some essential, others useless) and a mediocre second half. CONTAINS SPOILERS The film is divided into 2 parts. I thought the first half of the pianist was great. We meet Erika Kohut (the wonderful Isabelle Huppert), piano teacher, and discover her world. She is single and struggles to find her place against a tyrannical mother, too protective and limited. We understand that she has lost or rarely experienced love as a physical + emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being strong and offensive to people, frees her sexual tensions in sex shops, as a voyeur or when sadistic self-mutilation. This first half is very clinical and creates an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> Then comes Walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (superbly interpreted by Benoit Magimel). Although he begins to feel the coldness of Erika at first, he seduces her and slowly destroys Erika's fortress. He loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfill his sadistic desires. Then, when she's about to crack for him, he's disgusted with her world and we finally discover that Erika is unable to love or feel at all (especially since Walter is portrayed as an impossible person not to like). This is the second part of the film, very moving when we see the inability / lack of experience of Erika in love that leads to self-destruction. Haneke seems to have less mastered this second part, and sometimes less credible scenes (that is to say, too shocking) paradoxically mitigating the drama. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a rude film, at least in the French version. : you see sex-shop sex scenes, audacious mutilations and sex scenes. The blowjob scene between Magimel and Huppert, who was so talkative, was pretty good, it seems to me, and it is essential to understand Erika's sick relationship to love. As for the actors, Huppert is wonderful throughout the movie, Magimel is getting better, and Girardot (the mother) is excellent. <br /> <br />
