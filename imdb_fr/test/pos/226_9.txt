The creative team that brought us with the police squad - and the derivative firearm - said in an interview that the contact from their network had told them that the series would be canceled after the broadcast of the first episode. Basically, the show has never been given any chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the series was that for the series to be funny, the viewer had to actually watch it. most shows are shown on television, knowing that the viewer needs to get up and miss a few minutes to eat, go to the bathroom, and so on. <br /> <br /> The humor of the show is extremely dry (it does not use any laughter), and the universe in which the characters evolve is a universe in which anything can happen, whatever logic, provided that it is totally incredible; For example, in an episode, a surgeon must bribe an informant on the street for advice on cardiac surgery. <br /> <br /> Those familiar with Naked Gun movies should be aware of a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the movies. In the films, Nielsen has developed a special approach to "take" - that is, wide-eyed in the face of the unexpected. This does not happen in the series, where Nielsen's Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected for him. In addition, there is no romance in the series and no parody of MTV. Finally, the show takes some risks that movies avoid; in the first episode, Drebin, for "restoring crime," has a team of homicide detectives shooting at each other from several different angles - ballistics to the hard. It's actually a bit of risky humor, because we have to admit that it is perfectly normal for police officers to kill each other while investigating a crime, for no other reason than experimentation. This kind of thing rarely happens in movies. <br /> <br /> Taken individually, each of the episodes is actually funnier than any of the Naked Gun movies, as they are more compact (the more it happens in a shorter time). -frame), and yet more rhythmic (nothing presses a typing line as happens sometimes in movies). Some inconsistencies in movies (mainly "2" and "3") never occur in the shorter period of the series. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great theatrical comedies. And if you watch episodes of TV shows after episodes of a hit, the dry quality of humor may wear out your tolerance. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it would be useful to have a DVD, and Watch an episode a day for a few weeks - If laughter has, as some claim, a medicinal value, watch this show is good for the health.
