I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and every time I watch it, the movie is just as fun as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of 1960-1970 anti-war "hippies" living in New York. This small group falls on a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage), who was enlisted in the US Army to serve in Vietnam. Despite all his efforts to dissuade him, Claude finally shows up to follow a basic training in the army. Always saddened by the fact that he left, the hippie group stole a car and crossed the United States to visit Claude "... for a few hours", according to George Berger's remarks. temporarily stationed in Nevada). The result is really touching, so I will not spoil it for those who have not seen this fantastic movie yet. The musical score is just as fantastic! Don Dacus (Chicago rock band), who plays the role of "Woof" - one of the hippies, is not a key character, but the film would not have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, a girl from the suburbs who befriends the hippie band) is stunning in her role! A must-see movie !!
