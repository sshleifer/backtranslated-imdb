Eisenstien's "Potempkin" (Bronenosets Potyomkin) is one of the best films ever made and perhaps the best of the silent era. Eisenstien was a pioneer of film form and his use of editing has influenced films to date. The video of the Odessa Steps massacre is as powerful today as it was over 70 years ago. Do not miss the chance to see this movie!
