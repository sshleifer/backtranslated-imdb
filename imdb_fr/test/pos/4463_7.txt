I did not know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew there was a cult, but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works that, though deliciously gory, were also quite inconsistent. DO NOT TORTURE A DUCK with a linear scenario and a mystery that let me guess almost to the end. And after all, it was a truly confusing and scary experience. A major caveat: I would have rather preferred to hear the soundtrack and read the English subtitles rather than the unequal dubbing found here.
