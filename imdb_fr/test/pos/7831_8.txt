Ladies and gentlemen, we are really winners here. In fact, this is not the case, but this film is an often hilarious and entertaining film. Poor Alma (who is going to fetch Julia Ruiz) suffers from an ancient Mayan curse that causes dead and poisonous snakes to grow in her body. Alma and her disturbed shaman husband, Brujo (Alby Castro, feverishly striving with a delightful, eye-catching intensity) on a train bound for Los Angeles. Naturally, a group of deadly vipers are lost to terrorize the motley assortment of passengers. The Mallachi brothers, using an absurd scenario by Eric Fosberg, treat the ridiculous principle, creating a deliciously rustic piece of cheese. The crisp CGI effects, the Gardner snakes of the common pathetically scary variety (sounds of scary rattlesnakes add to the soundtrack to imbue them with a slight sense of threat otherwise non-existent), the frantic pace, the lack total of any tension or momentum, the train train obvious and delicate, and especially the simply amazing "you must be screwed to me!" the absurd superabundant endings are downright awesome in their breathtaking horror. Better still, we also have a game (so bad) that plays in an unnamed cast, a nice hint of good free nudity, a funky humn'shiver score and a lot of extremely rude and grotesque makeup. . Bonus points for the irritating token of a cute little girl being eaten by a large reptile and the stoner engineer who is caught smoking smoking in a hollow bulb (!?). Absolute Gut-Buster of a kitsch howler.
