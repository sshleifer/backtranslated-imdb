Beyond words, this heartbreaking divorce story results in a tragic battle over the custody of a seven-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> One of the great strengths of "Kramer v. Kramer" is his screenwriter-director, Robert Benton, who has wonderfully adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. It keeps things pretty simple and very realistic, while delivering all the drama directly from the heart. His talent for telling such emotional stories was to prove his worth with "Places in the Heart", where he showed, as in "Kramer v. Kramer", that he had a natural ability to work with children. <br /> <The other highlight of the photo is the splendid performance that rightly earned four of the film's nine Oscar nominations, two of which won first prize. One of them was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is superb as a frustrated businessman, Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. As his wife Joanne said, Meryl Streep claimed Oscar-winning actress Oscar for her strong and sensitive portrayal of a woman lost after eight years of marriage. Jane Alexander was also nominated for her fantastic tour as Kramer's good friend Margaret. The last word of the actors must be reviewed by the young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving performance will surprise you again and again, and a well-deserved Oscar nomination has reached him. <br /> <br /> Brilliant is also Nestor Almendros. Jerry Greenberg's cinematography and timely editing, while Henry Purcell's classic piece is used musically. <br /> <br /> In truth, it's a touching story of how a father and son become dependent on each other when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, get to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. Ted is faced with new responsibilities and a new vision of life, and gradually understands why Joanne had to leave. <br /> <br /> Certainly, nothing more, "Kramer v. Kramer" shows that no one wins the battle. to a battle for the custody of a young child, especially not the child himself. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 10, 1995 - Television <br /> <br /> Dramatic drama taken from Avery Corman's novel about the heartbreak battle for custody between separated parents who both feel to have at heart the best interest of the child. Apart from a superb script and a surprisingly mastered staging, both of Robert Benton, it is the superb actors who make this picture such a winner. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is brilliant like Ted Kramer, the man torn between his stunning career and the son he desperately wants to keep. Streep is also excellent as a woman lost in eight years of marriage and had to go out before disappearing as a person. Jane Alexander, common friend, Margaret, a remarkable man, Justin Henry, captured in the middle, and a group of prominent extras are the strongest. <br /> <br /> This very moving and heart-wrenching drama More than deserved, it's the Oscars of 1979 for best film, best actor (Hoffman) and best actress in a supporting role (Streep). <br /> <br /> Wednesday, 28 February 1996 - TV
