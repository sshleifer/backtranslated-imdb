This movement is absolutely, certainly one of the greatest movies of its kind, or any other. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be placed in a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey different from anything I've ever seen on screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors who can attract you and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even in the absence of prolonged dialogue or intrigue. Only by the visuals, 2001 is able to present an image of the sublime and horrible future. 10 out of 10, no doubt. For my money, it's not much better than 2001: A Space Oddysey ... now, the rest, 2010 ... it's another story.
