Jean Dujardin understands well the ways of Connery: the adjustment of the cufflinks when entering a club whereas all the women turn to admire it, the nonchalant stiffening and the smoothing of the tie, the relentless step and steel. It's strange, and you realize how Bond was a Connery creation in the '60s and not really the character of Ian Fleming. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a nod to these early films, the film takes off mainly from Russia With Love and Thunderball. The main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is, not only in terms of sexism, but also of nationalism and colonialism, and how he makes fun of his nose when he is sent to Egypt. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect - at about 20 minutes, it looks like it's a joke movie, some reminiscent of the periodontics of the day, which have been abundant. Morcecambe and Wise's Intelligence Men had suspicious-looking men in Fez who followed their heroes too, and that goes back a bit. Unlike the Sellers Clouseau or Baron Cohen's Borat, Dujardin does not give his character that layer of reality or real pathos: he is too busy perfecting his Connery manners. It does not do enough with the credits or a big song, and there is no funny or serious villain, like the Dr. Evil of Mike Myers or the sworn enemy of Ricardo Montalban, that the hero will face. <br /> <br /> But the scene where OSS117 wakes up one morning in Cairo made me burst out laughing at the empty three quarters cinema, and the whole thing is beautiful, besides you will never have the chance to see Brother Kid operation on the screen, and women are ace crumpet, really hot. It's a travesty of Bond without falling into the crazy scientist / Ken Adam series or the fun gadget routine. Absolutely recommended.
