Is this a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, what did you expect from a movie called "BEACH BABES FROM BEYOND"? <br /> <br /> This is a movie "BABES in BIKINI" and has no claim to be otherwise. Since this is not "a room with a view" or "Schindler's list". If you wanted a movie like "A room with a view", you would not be watching Beach Babes from Beyond. But if you are looking for a good movie Babes in Bikini with almost no plot, this one is for you. This film keeps its promises and more. It's a pure pleasure 100% teenager. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of BABES in and out of the bikinis. The movie was funny and enjoyable to watch. They were some of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in a home video. <br /> <br /> Every high school student should watch at least one bad movie like this one. It's actually one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen. So without shame, I repeat ... If you only watch one movie "Babes in Bikini", this is it.
