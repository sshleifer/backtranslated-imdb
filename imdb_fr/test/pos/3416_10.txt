We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard about the Truth and Reconciliation process, but as others have written, I did not know much about the details of the process. This film showed the process and growth that can occur when people are able to face their past, understand the events from the perspective of those involved and be together in mourning. Archbishop Tutu and others involved in developing the R & R process deserve to be recognized for their understanding of human emotions. Seeing this film gave me hope for the human race. If we can do T & R, we might not destroy ourselves. People will consider T and R as the first step of human adolescence towards maturity. <br /> <br /> As a film, there were of course flaws. I did not notice any major problems in the acting, the director or the writing - but for the first time in years, I was totally lost in a movie, so maybe I did not not noticed. <br /> <br /> See this movie. The Toronto public would not give up the stage for the next movie, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and the director. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor went to the sidewalk to continue the conversation. People just came to shake their hands and thank them for the movie. It moved us all.
