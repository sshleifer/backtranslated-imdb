When the masterful version of John Carpenter's "The Thing" was released in the summer of 1982, it was swept away by critics and bombarded at the box office. The audience could not handle another "bad" extraterrestrial, they wanted AND. Their long-term loss. <br /> <br /> I would like to kill to be able to see this big movie on the big screen. It's a movie that was way ahead of its time; now, he has influenced a new generation of filmmakers, showing his track on things like "Se7en", "Alien 3", and even "The X Files", which tore him up unceremoniously, page by page. And the structure, which avoids the development of the character in favor of the incredible SFX, is common in today's blockbuster movies. <br /> <br /> atmosphere. The performances are satisfactory and the end is fantastic - still unique today. <br /> <br /> A paranoid masterpiece.
