It's an amazing movie and he's very good at using the few actors and sets. It is also very shocking - physical and psychological torture (explicit and implicit) is mingled with quiet and even humorous moments. So the horror is always unexpected and brutal. I'm not sweet, but it should be the most shocking movie I've ever seen. The message of this film is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer. This is the film for which I will always remember the two actors.
