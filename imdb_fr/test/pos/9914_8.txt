I sympathized with the fate of the first man, Schmitter, whom we see killed in this episode. It reminded me of the concern of being a security guard at night somewhere - the type of work I did briefly about 20 years ago. Of course, I never risked being burned, as the leader of the colony (Lynch) says. The monster in the dark here, murdering members of a deep mining colony, creates a scary impression in the first act. We do not really see it in the first scenes and, as many of us realize, the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination. "Big and Shaggy" is a description, but it actually looks like a big lumpy pepperoni pizza, slipping on the floor like a silicon centipede - a budget limitation of the show, unfortunately. This also shows in the latest matte painting, famous for fans of Trek, the only way to convey a long view of mining operations. <br /> <br /> But the whole theme of this episode is about what's inside, rather than outward appearances, anyway. Of course, this Horta, a newly discovered form of silicon-based life, looks at first sight to a stupid monster. Thanks to Spock's telepathic ability (probably the best use of a Vulcan mental mix for conspiracy purposes), we learn that this is an extremely intelligent, even sophisticated creature. In addition to the instrumental use of his talent by Spock, McCoy replaces his usual medical routine: heal a creature resembling stone or asbestos. He also manages to pronounce one of his most famous sentences: "I am a doctor, not a mason!" I found it very realistic in his scene where he was exulting in his success, although he was unable to share his enthusiasm with Kirk - Kirk's busy organizational results. The episode casts unexpected turns in the character and motivation of the audience as the story progresses; Spock defends the need to possibly preserve this life discovered while Kirk adopts his usual position to prevent the death of red shirts (no half measure, as in "The Man Trap"). But later, it is Kirk who, for whatever reason, holds his breath, as if the heat of the hunt had dissipated and he had time to think about Spock (I think that During the filming of this episode, Shatner learned that his father had passed away, and that it is not typical for most of the first season, things are coming to an end.The conflict stems from the needs of fundamental capitalism, such as compliance with standard quotas. , as opposed to protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants - a version of the space age that protects the owls from the tractors of modern advancement.In one way or another, despite many murders and the feeling that everything could go at any time with a single phaser, Kirk and Spock manage to negotiate an agreement that satisfies everyone.I guess people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century.
