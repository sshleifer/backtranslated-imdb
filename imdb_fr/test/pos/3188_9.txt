It's a very sweet movie, very funny, and Russell Crowe is amazing! Those who only know him by Gladiator will be surprised to see the extent of his acting abilities. Arthur Baskin (his character) is one of the best nerdy virgins on the screen I have ever seen. Watch this movie - how can we re-edit it in NTSC format? <br /> <br />
