We wonder about the state of a society that produces a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald, whom we meet for the first time on a plane, while he is heading to the place where he abandoned himself. a long time, and where he left a woman and a child who is now accused of murdering a mentally handicapped boy. When we see him for the first time, he read in the newspaper that the woman in front of him was reading. Roughly enough, he asks if he could have the newspaper and the lady offers other sections. Well, that's not what he asked for, but what he wants the woman to do is give her the first part she's reading. <br /> <br /> Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed this disturbing film that reflects, in many ways, our society as it is today. In fact, Mr. Hoge says exactly what's wrong. <br /> <br /> The film presents Leland, a teenager who can not even tell the difference between fantasy and reality. It is obvious that killing a human being, even the sweet and innocent boy who did nothing to deserve it, will have fatal consequences, not only for himself, but for his own family and the murdered boy's family. In fact, Leland seems to have no idea what motivated him to commit the crime because he shows no repentance about it. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that Leland was traumatized by her parents' divorce. His own father is a distant man who does not care about him. It is Pearl, the teacher of the juvenile detention center who sees the concern inside the young man and wants to help, but unfortunately, he has no chance. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the movie is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. The overall cast does a good job under the direction of Mr. Hoge. Kevin Spacey has a good opportunity to play the selfish father of the accused murderer and hates to consider him an arrogant idiot. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a little long, the film leaves us more questions than what it answered.
