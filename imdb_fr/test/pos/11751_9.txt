Directed by a former Hollywood director, Henry King, who began his career again in 1915, Love is a Many Splendor Thing is one of his last great movies.

Produced in the 1950s, the film, with works by directors such as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli, is a kind of revival of melodrama, its blossoming and its apogee. <br /> <br /> The story begins when a beautiful American reporter Mark Elliott, played by William Holden, finds himself once again in one of his irresistible playboy roles in Hong Kong and meets a young and pretty Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones), of half Chinese and English origin, works as a doctor in a hospital and her husband was recently killed by the Chinese communists.

But very quickly, she gives in to the persistent temptation to attempt hell Mark and both start a passionate relationship seemingly impossible to stop by anything, even by the fact that Mark is badly married and his wife does not want to give him the divorce the differences and prejudices caused by Han's Chinese origin. But it's still fate that has the last say in determining the eternity fairness of this happy relationship, no matter how persistent the murder is, thinking that ruthless time awaits in a form of death rather alarming, prepared at any moment to prove his impermanence. <br /> <br /> Undeniably one of the most romantic films of all time, Love is a Many Splendored Thing features great performances by William Holden and Jennifer Jones, a magnificent musical score awarded by Oscar Alfred Newman and extremely romantic story, touching, comforting but ultimately heartbreaking.
