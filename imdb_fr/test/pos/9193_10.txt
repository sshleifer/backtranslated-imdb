Someone considered this film a "waste of time" because he / she was waiting for the "beautiful landscapes of Brazil and Portugal" but then everything seemed "erased" or gloomy, or something of the sort. I think that person missed the whole movie. It's reality. The purpose of this film is to show that life is really not ideal and to show what people live in their lives for family, love and survival. A young man leaves his slum in Sao Paolo, Brazil, to go to Portugal in his mother's home country after his death. He discovers that everything is not free and that Brazilians are despised by the natives of Portugal. He ends up finding a life, a love, but the story does not end as expected and it is not a story of "fairy tale". The part that touched me the most is the final song "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)" by Gal Costa. It goes so well with the film; especially the end.
