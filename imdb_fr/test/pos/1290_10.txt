The first feature film by Christopher Nolan seduced the critics who saw it on its release. Shot with a micro-budget of US $ 6,000, this is a student film with a real class. The film is shot in black and white and features people who you think are friends of Nolan appearing in the film. This does not mean that they are bad actors because they are very good. You can see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects, but unfortunately they have not done it since its inception 6 years ago. <br /> <br /> Nolan's thriller, like Memento, does not play in chronological order, it changes the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It's a great thriller, but because the movie's timeline is out of sync, it's even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes, especially when everything was starting to come off, was excellent. <br /> <br /> For a film with such a small budget and no recognizable name, it's really good. It is superior to most Hollywood studios and Nolan offers, after three films (this one, the Memento Superior and Insomnia not quite so good but still excellent) has established itself as the most exciting new talent of the recent period. I can not wait to see Batman. <br /> <br /> This film is short and nice and is an excellent watch. It's very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. I also thought that David Julyan's score was excellent, very atmospheric and of an icy quality. He then composed the other Nolan films. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would recommend it. I plan to get all the Nolan movies. It's a little gem on a budget. ***** <br /> <br />
