This film brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a D & D band. While I was watching, I could not help but notice how much the characters reminded me and my fellow players, to the point where they literally acted in the same way as us. Including quarrels, fighting, internal jokes, making the DM crazy. ALL. <br /> <br /> He has everything. Jokes that made me cry, action scenes that, even filmed low budget, are strangely amazing. The story is quite simple and not surprising, but it does not really matter, because the best part of the movie is to see the characters react and interact with each other and with the NPCs. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you play D & D or a similar RPG, I can not emphasize it too much. WATCH THIS FILM, he has wonderfully captivated the spirit of D & D.
