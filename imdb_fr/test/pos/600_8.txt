I would be about 11 years old when this movie is out. All those years later, at 37, I had no qualms about renting it on DVD. Excellent entertainment for all ages. And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See: <br /> <br /> Why are there so many songs on Rainbows And what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide. So we have been told and some choose to believe it I know they are wrong, wait and see. One day we will find him, the rainbow link, the lovers, the dreamers and me. <br /> <br /> Who said that every wish would be heard and that it would be granted When desired on the morning star? Someone thought of that, and someone believed it, and look at what he has done so far. What is so incredible that prevents us from star gazing and what do we think we can see? One day we will find her, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers and me. <br /> <br /> We are all under his spell, we know it's probably magical ... <br /> <br /> ... Have you been half asleep? And did you hear voices? I heard them call my name. ... Is it the sweet sound that calls young sailors? The voice may be the same one I have heard too many times to ignore. It's something I'm supposed to be ... One day we'll find it, the rainbow tie, The lovers, the dreamers, and me. <br /> <br /> Laa, da da da da da daa, La la la laa dee da da doo ...
