Hi! Speaking Cantonese, I found it very amusing and I was able to make all the jokes that we could not have because of the language barrier. The fight scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie. However, I have my criticisms. First of all, I find it's not as good as the first A -GO Project and SEE IT NOW! :-) The reason is, SPOILERS AHEAD - DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE !!!!!) because in Project A, Jackie ends up fighting his enemy; the man he is sent to kill, Sanpao. This is what he strives to do throughout the film and the confrontation is spectacular. But in AII, although he fought Chan, the scene of the confrontation between Jackie and his sworn enemy is not long enough and the bulk of the action is directed against the Empress's men. They are not nearly as bad and played only a minor role in the film compared to Jackie. Although their fight sequence is spectacular, they are not the ones Jackie pursues throughout the movie. viewer slightly dissatisfied. However, this is just my humble opinion so do not take it word for word - go see it yourself! It's a big movie in its own right! Take care of yourself and hope that your admiration for Jackie will grow! Sincerely, Ian PS. Do you know the chief of police in A II? It's the same guy in First Strike, it's nice to know he's always going strong!
