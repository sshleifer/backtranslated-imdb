I saw this movie at the Mod & Rockers party in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry had an amazing life and one of the best and most distinct voices ever recorded. For those of you who do not know Harry Nilsson, do a little research and you'll see that Harry probably found his place in your life one way or another - maybe that was his special " 70 Talking of "Midnight Cowboy. For me, it started with "people let me tell you about my best friend" - the theme song of "The Court of Eddie's Father". Watching this movie, you can really feel the love and admiration of Harry's true friends and peers. Do not shed a tear for Harry - he had fun ... <br /> <br /> Brett
