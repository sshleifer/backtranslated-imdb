This is classic Disney at its best live action cartoon! Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell), a student at Bumbling University, develops a mysterious formula of invisibility of liquids that makes objects disappear and helps him save his cash-strapped university. More advanced experiments reveal that it works so incredibly well on humans! Riley's surprising discovery takes some hilarious twists when a gang of crooks led by the infamous A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) stole the formula and tried to use it for its legitimate activities. Dazzling special effects and a fast story make this animated film a school comedy school case! I love that movie! This film has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy. A nice little comedy that the whole family can enjoy. Not a lot of violence or sex and absolutely no swearing, makes this film a movie that parents can watch with their children. A film from a series of Kurt Russell films taking place at Medvale College. A nice little series placed in a healthy America before terrorists, when people value integrity more than money! I highly recommend this movie!
