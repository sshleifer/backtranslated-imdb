This is one of those films that are very underrated. Once again, I vote for an underrated film. This film has a good story, maybe a little far-fetched, but it could happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actors) still shows us a good performance. The guy does a great job as an actor, but his roles are never recognized. He has done well since the goonies. Not only him but Louis Gosset JR. does a swell job. I thought maybe this movie would have made more money in theaters, but who cares about money anyway. All around, it's a good movie that will sometimes put you on the edge of your seat and the plot will keep the movie moving. I enjoyed this film and I hope the rest of you will do it too.
