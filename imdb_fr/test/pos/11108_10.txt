I really fell in love with the characters. They were very down-to-earth but each of them had a dark side. A kind of mystery. David Graysmark, himself, was an enigma. The secret fears and secrets in general he had. There was a whole side of him on which the other characters knew nothing and it left the public indifferent or supposed. There was always a part of this man that he would keep hidden, but he would also share a little of himself. He was the main male strong character and I admire this type of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who could play just about any role! He is an incredible talent and a good man. His fans love him, respect him and support him constantly. <br /> <br /> Since this show, he has participated in many other projects and has expanded his acting skills more and more and quite well. Congratulations to him and all the other actors of this show for having done such an excellent job! I wish them all happiness. I wish the series would have continued! It's a shame not!
