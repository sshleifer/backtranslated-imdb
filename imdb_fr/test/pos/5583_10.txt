I also remember seeing this film when I was young in a small local theater that showed foreign films every week. This is the daring adventure of all this that has remained in my memory ever since. <br /> <br /> The scene with Noel Purcell was particularly impressive. It was the old sailor, Paddy, who drank too much, saw or heard apparitions, and died of fear in a cave. I have always kept an eye on the Christmas career even decades later, because I had already seen it. There is also a young Cyril Cusack in the role of chartered smuggler, James, with motifs on the charming Jean Simmons, shown as Emmeline, adult. <br /> <br /> Would really like to have a video of this mesmerizing film and refresh my memory of it. Where should I send my request?
