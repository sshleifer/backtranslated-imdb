I just watched this movie during the weekend and I must say that I really enjoyed it. The two Italo American actors are excellent as usual (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). It is obvious that the director was influenced by two great films of the past made by Italians. He was mainly influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. This is the story of two young men who meet by chance and become friends. One is extrovert and the other introverted. They enjoy the day together and at the end of the day, the shy discovers that there is more to life than its usual monotony. The same thing happens to Albert De Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASSO has a very similar ending and this apparently influenced the director of ON THE RUN because he uses the same technique, but with a twist. I was expecting something, but I was surprised to find that it was the opposite. If you watch both movies, you will understand. The other film that influenced the director is AFTER HOURS, directed by the great Italian American Scorsese. I highly recommend the 3 movies !!
