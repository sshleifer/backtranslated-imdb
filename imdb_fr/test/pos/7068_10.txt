Some people can only use 3 neurons, one to eat, one to breathe and another to emancipate ... This is not a film for them ... <br /> <br /> But for those who like to use the brain ... the whole film is a metaphor, everything is there for a purpose, every detail, the coffee cup, the red sofa, everything ... is an underestimated masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> It's hilarious, raw and totally realistic, that's how we interact ... it's a royal comedy ... a total causality ... <br /> <br /> Wait, Don Do not let the first scene shock you ..... hold on ... and enjoy the show ....
