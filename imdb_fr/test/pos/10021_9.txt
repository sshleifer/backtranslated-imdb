A gem of a silent era cartoon - it has been rediscovered by CARTOON NETWORK and has been aired probably for the first time in decades. various cameos ... Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitoes; Will Hays visits Static Studios as "boss"; as well as appearances by Chaplin, Keaton and William S. Hart. The image of chewing gum decimating the populace's shoes (a profitable idea for Felix's almost failed shoe - the seller's boss) can not be described - it must be seen. A wonderful cultural jewel.
