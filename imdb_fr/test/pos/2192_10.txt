Having not seen the 1936 version of this story, I can not offer any comparison. I can say, however, that the musical treatment of this story by Stephen Sondheim is absolutely brilliant. Only Sondheim could offer music and lyrics both stellar, but perfectly adapted to a very strange subject. If someone needs explanations about what a black comedy is, he should see this (and "Dr. Strangelove" too). When Mrs. Lovett goes from the "worst pies in London" to a burgeoning business, which is highly praised, we are not talking about "Soylent Green" - but the ingredients are similar. The song where Mrs. Lovett presents her idea to Mr. Todd is particularly brilliant. Even in the introductory number, the line "... they went to their manufacturer perfectly shaved ..." gives a good indication of the premise, drama AND comedy to come. Exceptional!
