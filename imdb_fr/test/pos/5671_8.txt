I found this film rather brilliant. Initially, I wanted an "animal attack" that looks like a "straight fish" or even a "thug", but has been delivered to a really horrible and not devoid of humanity. After visiting the affected areas, this was done (including the croc farm at the beginning of the movie and even the same guide!), That added to the fear factor. These fangs are really everywhere up there, although I do not think they had the attitude of this beast. Yes, there were melodramatic moments but they helped distract from the atmosphere. I really cared about the characters and shivered, contemplating "what would I do?" in their boat. Not knowing where your enemy was hiding or the sound of the fang slipping through the night was really scary. I would say that this film is one of the best horrors I've seen in years (getting closer to the descent). I give him four alligator purses.
