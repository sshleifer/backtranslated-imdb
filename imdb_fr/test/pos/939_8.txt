Brilliant Australian film ... A bit slow at first, but once it starts, you can not stop laughing. When I first saw the film, I vaguely knew the plot, because I do not know if many people know that this film is based on a true story, and more particularly, the director and his mother (obviously , the names have been changed). I only knew this fact because the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the film, my mother-in-law kept the secret: we had to meet Matthew Newton after the screening ... Such a gentleman (except a particularly nasty incident with his ex)! Brillian plays as well with Sam Neill and the others! A good reason to continue supporting the Australian film industry
