I came across this movie on TV. I had never heard of it and almost changed channels, but it quickly took me. <br /> <br /> The history of the struggle of the Burmese people against a military dictatorship provoked. The level of brutality that some are willing to use to maintain power is hard to believe. It makes me grateful to live in a country where the government is not going to shoot people on the street. <br /> <br /> The story of Laura Bowman was a good thread to summarize the political struggle.
