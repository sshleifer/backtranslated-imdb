Contains Spoiler The film is a good action / comedy but I do not know if the director has cut too many roles, but it seems that the villain dies too fast. The end of the film arrives, the villain dies and that's all. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good and I do not regret having paid to see him at the theater.
