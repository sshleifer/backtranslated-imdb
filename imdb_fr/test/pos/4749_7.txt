How did they get this cinematographic picture of the car colliding with the back of the semi? And then Roy sits - great! It looks like the DVD is scheduled for May 2006 - it's almost time !! Watch this on a big screen or relive a movie in a movie theater, if possible, to fully appreciate the format of the image. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian Job with Michael Caine; Bullit with Steve McQueen; Live and die in Los Angeles with the guy from CSI when he was young; French Connection with Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Deniro; Vanishing Point with Barry Newman; State Enemy with Hackman Again - What are your favorites?
