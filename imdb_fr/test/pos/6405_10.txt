What a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen has so much talent for screenwriters and actors, such a beautiful landscape that is the ultimate escape for those living in a state without sun and land. Many actors went into bigger things ... another indicator that there was something wonderful, sadly lost. I lived in Columbus, Ohio at the time, with the very big family of my husband (now ex) in a chorus of 'NO!' each time he would be taken back by a baseball game. <br /> <br /> Someone who wrote here said it was against "Rosanne" ... all my ex and I noticed that it was always always pre-empted by BASEBALL !!!! Yes, FOX has really wasted something wonderful and nothing will ever equal it! Thank you for the memories.
