Just before Dawn came out during the fine days of the movie slasher. The Backwoods slasher debuted with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning and Madman. Just Before Dawn is one step ahead of the typical Backwoods slasher movie. The cinematography is beautiful. The acting game is top. The heroine of the movie is not your typical "final girl". <br /> <br /> Constance is a "Woods" girl, but when it comes to the survival instinct, she is a step backwards. It is only to save the life of her and her boyfriend that the primordial notion of survival occurs. There is a subtle transition that is gradually focusing on girls' hidden sexuality, which coincides with their desire to survive. <br /> <Just before dawn, it's not for everyone, but for the slasher fan, it's as perfect as possible. The killer or killers are very menacing - it's almost like a game of mutilating and murdering anyone who crosses their territory. The final scene is a bit off. For the viewer for the first time, it may sound a little shocking. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Backwoods Slasher. Even non-slasher fans will find something to like about it. The frame is strange and makes it uncomfortable. The death sequences are not particularly bloody, but I'm not sure the movie needs gore. To see him!
