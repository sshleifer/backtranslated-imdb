Having already seen this short film on VHS tape with the Summer Stock function, I just watch every Sunday on the site of TCM. This marked the debut of 15-year-old Deanna Durbin and 14-year-old Judy Garland, apart from her two older sisters. These two teenagers showcase their musical talents with a Deanna solo of "Il Bacio", then one of Judy's "Waltz with a Swing" before the climax of "Americana". The slight plot of this eleven-minute film concerns the possible unemployment of Edna's grandfather (the real name of Durbin, as it has been said here), because of its low attendance. With the help of both girls, you can probably guess what's going on from there! The contrasts are marked not only by the musical choice of Garland and Durbin, but also by their height, balance and movement. Despite all this, they behave pretty well in the end and it is almost surprising that MGM chose Garland, while Durbin was already under contract with Universal. This short film, however, has been allowed to return briefly since the release of his first feature film (Three Smart Girls). prepare the steps. Judy herself would make her first feature film (Pigskin Parade) at 20th Century-Fox, while MGM would decide the film in which she would play. It would be Broadway Melody from 1938, where she would perform the show's stop number, "Dear Mr. Gable (You made me love you)". But back to this short film, Every Sunday offers a warm and wonderful glimpse of two star singers at the beginning of their legendary career, unaware of what the future holds for them ...
