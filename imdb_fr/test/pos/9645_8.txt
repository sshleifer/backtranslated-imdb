You can say that this is the first offer of the director (who also wrote it), but you can also see the potential of this guy. This is obviously a low-budget film in the spirit of Boondock Saints. Of course, Boondock Saints came out a few years after that, so you can see this as a diamond needing some polishing. The acting was good - if you're looking for DeNiro or Michael Madsen in a crime drama, remember that these are young guys who play the role of young people trying to be criminals. They are not going to be "supercool" (tm) like some of the veterans. I would have liked to see Justin Pagel (Joe - the main character) continue to make more movies - he has been great in this area. Good movie - 3 out of 5 stars.
