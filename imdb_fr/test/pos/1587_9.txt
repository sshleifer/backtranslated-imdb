Death in Venice by Visconti is considered one of the most beautiful films ever made. While watching, we recognize that we are in the hands of a visionary genius. The infinitely opulent death in Venice surely is; but in other important respects it is an unsatisfactory film. Thomas Mann writes scornfully and at a distance from von Aschenbach's career and literary output; from his compelling ways, his layered to layered programmed and conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and the obsession is born, it is obvious that Aschenbach has no idea who he is under his golden age and his well-led life. In fact, seeing Tadzio, the "loner", as Mann sometimes calls him, splits in two. Aschenbach No. 1 absorbs the sight of a handsome 14-year-old boy, then attempts to intellectually treat the vertiginous shock of blood pressure as if it were a work of art - a "divine" work of art ". But Aschenbach No. 2, appears as a stalker who takes control and replaces the rational Aschenbach No. 1. Like the original Aschenbach, his sex-doppelganger is mortified to establish human contact with the object of his obsession - and so Tadzio remains a distant ideal. Thomas Mann has no pity for this game. Every shred of self-knowledge comes too hard and too late; the excitement of sexual redness is too great to resist. That Venice is invaded by the disease means nothing to Aschenbach - except that his game now has more important issues. When finally he murmurs in a low voice: "I love you", he knows that everything is lost and that the abyss is waiting for him. Is this movie filmable Maybe, and Visconti creates a visual feast impossible to watch. But there are errors: he and Dirk Bogarde create Aschenbach with sympathy; Mann, again, does not have. POV Aschenbach dominates the film and we expect to identify it. But nowhere on the screen, a man is torn from the inside. Bogarde switches between sublimely controlled and ridiculously capricious, but what is underneath? Bogard's reactive performance has no mooring. Mann writes a character who, in his imagination, is doing the Dance of the Seven Sails, aware of the consequences of this freedom, but unable to resist. In addition, Visconti's script creates a character that does not appear in the original - Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach - to dramatize Mann's discussion of Art and Artists. These scenes are poorly written disasters and the actor who represents Alfred is hard to watch. In addition, Aschenbach of Visconti is a Teutonic composer of the golden age, who I think works for the film; and Mahler's symphonies replace Aschenbach's novels. The great music of Mahler is unfortunately poorly recorded and very badly played. Thus, death in Venice, as Visconti confides to us, is not a complete success but would have been a purely visual power. All film students, especially cinematography, will want to take a look at it.
