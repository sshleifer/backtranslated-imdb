A beautiful sensitive film that highlights the uselessness and cruelty of wars, whatever the reasons. The performances of Cage and Cruz were quite impressive, but it is the oldest Greek characters who deserve praise. Irene Papas is as beautiful as ever! Although some scenes sometimes seem a little long, this film will be a serious candidate for the Oscars.
