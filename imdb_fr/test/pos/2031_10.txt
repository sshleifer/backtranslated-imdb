If you like 80's rock, you should really watch this movie! I only saw it recently and I fell in love with it! <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very entertaining and offers you a lot of rock and not a second of the movie. find boring! It was a great idea that some real-life musicians do what they do best. I was happy to see Zakk, as well as Blas Elias, all performing. I tend to agree with a lot of people who say that the first half of the movie was a lot better than the second, especially in terms of the script. It could have been a little better worked, but not a big major problem. One thing that bothered me a bit was Jennifer Aniston's performance. I thought she was not the right person for this role, I just could not see her as a rock star girlfriend. But as the film progresses, you realize that she has done a good job with that. There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity, it gives us things that do not make you cold. <br /> <br /> To summarize, a good movie that is fun, that does not go deep into the characters, but gives you a good entertainment, a nostalgia and of course the powerful voice of Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic!
