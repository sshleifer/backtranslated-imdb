Now, I know Sandra Bullock has produced this film, but she needs to know that sometimes you have to make some sacrifices to advance the story ... like not trying to make the entire movie about her character! <br /> <The story tells the story of two high school students (one rich and popular, the other intelligent and anti-social) who develop a plan to commit murder and follow it according to the number ... just to see if they can get away with it. Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve the case. The boys planted evidence, created alibis and cleaned up after themselves so that the cops fall under the charm of the act. But Sandra feels that everything is not what it seems. <br /> <br /> This film could have been a great little Hitchcock thriller, but he spends too much time getting to know Sandra's character. than to focus on the crime itself. You see, something in her past haunts her throughout the movie. And we learn everything about it ... EVERYTHING. It gets a little tedious after a while, especially when you're in the middle of an intriguing murder investigation, and then you have to stop this investigation to hear what has happened to you in the past. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the real winners of this film. They play their characters convincingly and with the right amount of malice. If the script had spent more time focusing on these characters and leaving the detectives there just to do their work, it could have been an immensely entertaining thriller. With what he is, most emotions are lost. They should have cut everything in Sandra's character and made it a separate TV movie for Lifetime. But I am moving away from the subject. It's still an entertaining film. I recommend this movie ... but wait for the video / DVD.
