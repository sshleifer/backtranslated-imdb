Like a very expensive episode of Buffy peppered with a lot of humor. A lot of kung fu thread and stunt. The Twins Effect is on HK's list of must-see classic films. Vampires have a jumping ghost-type mix and European style. If you have the opportunity to see this one at the theater, it's worth taking a 30 minute drive. If not, buy the import DVD before someone spoils it by giving it a bad dub.
