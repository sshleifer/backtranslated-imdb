I was surprised how emotionally I got involved in this film. Peter Boyle is a stunt as a conservative socialist bigot of the working class, Joe. In fact, I sympathized with some of his complaints. Of course, he does not mention the historical socio-economic reasons underlying many of his prejudices. The film also provides an interesting insight into the rapid change that American society was undergoing at that time. Recreational drugs, casual sex, and the questioning of parental authority have become fashionable and have replaced the more respected traditions of respect for God, the homeland and seniority. The fans of Susan Sarandon will be delighted. Joe is his first film. It also gives viewers a visual treatment from the beginning of the film. Recommended, 8/10.
