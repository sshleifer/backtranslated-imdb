Disney and Bill Paxton have both done a great job in conveying a story based on real facts. You do not need to love the game of golf to appreciate the story of a man's struggle to overcome obstacles. It could have been based on any sport or just about any other situation involving competition, even though it is simply golf related. The only problem I have with the story is that I would have liked to see a little deeper each of the main characters, in particular. Mr. Ouimet. Mr. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his time, the America of the beginning of the century, where the "lines of class" are well defined and woe to anyone who deigns to try to rise above his "class". I did some historical research and I answered my biggest question, to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are a little different from those described in the film, I left with a sense of satisfaction. I really enjoyed this movie, I think you too.
