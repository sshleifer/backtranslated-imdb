Bloody Birthday plays on the presumed innocence of children and shows them bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne, aka Billy Jacoby) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) are all born on the same day during an eclipse. In addition to sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they are not difficult about who they kill). The young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy play pretty well the roles of these monsters without emotion, but they also know when to put their charm. But they can not continue to fool everyone. This is a good horror movie overall, it's not too unrealistic, there are some good moments of suspense and the children have well described roles (adults are still pretty cute). I would say that it is worth seeing (I own a copy myself).
