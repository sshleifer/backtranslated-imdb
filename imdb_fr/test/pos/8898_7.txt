I do not pretend to be a big fan of Asterix, having seen only one film adaptation and only read two comics, but it was a great movie, all the same. I only saw the English version and found that the voices fit perfectly with the characters - Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin in the role of Justforkix in particular. The story itself was both interesting and really amusing (especially the ending of contradictory names - all viking names end with "af", while all Gallic names, of course, end with "ix "), with a little romance thrown in I however)) improved the story, even if it weighed down the overall production with unnecessary clichés. <br /> <br /> The plot is this: the Viking leader, Timandahaf, is tired of going to the raiding village and finding them empty. He therefore consults his "wise man," Cryptograf, whose entire repertoire consists of ancient proverbs, and Cryptograf tells him that "fear gives wings to villagers." Timandahaf thinks that fear allows people to fly and embarks on an expedition to recover the "Champion of Fear", an expedition that leads him to the Gallic village where Asterix and Obelix live. <br /> <br /> The pair is currently very frustrated - the cowardly and pacifist nephew of the leader Vitalstatistix, Justforkix, has been entrusted to them so that they can train him to become a man, and the boy hardly progresses. When Justforkix unknowingly confesses to being "scared of everything" in the presence of brave Olaf viking, he is supposed to be the "champion of fear" and is kidnapped. Vitalstatistix sent Asterix and Obelix to help Justforkix before his father returned to the village to bring his son home. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a fantastic movie with some flaws in addition to clichés and sometimes, faulty dialogues. I really enjoyed it, even if it was not faithful to the comic strip.
