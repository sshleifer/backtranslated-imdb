When commenting on this film, it must be realized that it is based on a true story and that it must be reviewed for the quality and precision of its representation of events as well as for its entertainment value. It may be unlikely that Jack Shepherd went to Jack Wild twice because he had captured Edgeworth Bess. Nevertheless, it happened. It should also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, which is why he relied on proven techniques. There have been occasions when Clavell did not have the confidence to follow the script as it was written. The movie would be better if he had it. And yes, I had a copy of the script (a copy of Stanley Baker - one in five), which I recently returned to my father, the writer Rafe Newhouse.
