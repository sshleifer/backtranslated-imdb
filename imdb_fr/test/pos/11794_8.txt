People watch movies for different reasons. This film did not have the big budget, there are no special effects, no car chases and no explosions. In reality, reality does not have much either. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> It's a very real movie about very real people, none of them are perfect, but together they are put in a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and which, in turn, puts order in order. out of chaos. I am not willing to limit the possibilities of parapsychology, since I am neither an expert nor to use the full extent of my brain. <br /> <br /> So, watch this movie for the characters. It is filled with a whole group of extraordinary and fantastic people. <br /> <br /> In the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland beautifully describes the life of Detective Michael Hayden and continues to develop the character throughout the film. Excellent acting, very credible. <br /> <br /> Henry Czerny could not have been better interpreted and the relationship between his "Harvey" and Kiefer's "Mickey" reinforces the opposition of their characters. <br /> <br /> I really appreciated the grumpy owner "Mrs. Ramsay", I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends !!! <br /> <br /> There are many other people among these wonderful characters but space is limited here, so watch the movie and enjoy it.
