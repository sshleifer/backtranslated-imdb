"Black Water" is a film that, in a way, surprised me and definitely exceeded my initial expectations. "Black Water" is really a very well structured, unpredictable, exciting, well directed and scary movie. The plot is actually somewhat original, and you will certainly be intrigued by it. What I love in this film is the direction, because it has mostly exceeded my initial expectations. Initially, I was expecting "Black Water" to be a movie made, played, directed, rhythmic and boring. It really was not. Well, the acting is not commendable, because I sometimes felt that I did not show enough emotions, and some lines feel so much written. However, I love the direction, because all its shots seem predictable, but they are not. Like when we look, we tell the camera to take a slow lens of water, and all is well, we are as if the crocodile was about to attack. However fang attacks are very unpredictable (which was bad for me who does not handle movies like this too), and that makes you jump. Plus, I love the fact that it's one of those horror movies that do not rely on the sudden explosion of sound to blow you up, but rather on the movie itself. I also like the way the story talks about people trapped in these trees, it gives the impression of becoming very real and allows you to keep your eyes on the screen. I must say that I did not think that the first 20 minutes were well prepared and that the boat was a little heavier than in reality. Also, I did not like the way they did their best to make the character situation totally hopeless when it really was not. Again, I do not think that some of the characters' actions were realistic. For example, I would never have been near the water knowing there was a crocodile in it, let alone a killer. However, these problems are really not that important and I still enjoyed the movie. Overall, when it comes to movies, I've seen better, but when it comes to horror movies about animal attacks (a genre that lets me easily fooled), this is one of the best the best you will see. And of course, it's not perfect, but that does not mean it's not worth it.
