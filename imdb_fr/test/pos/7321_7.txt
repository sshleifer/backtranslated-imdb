Directed by the younger brother of the great director Leo McCarey, this is a very good short film by Three Stooges, nominated for an Academy Award. Here the mates are doctors named Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, and Dr. Howard. They are not the most brilliant doctors, but they have the benefit of the doubt in that they manage their duty and their humanity. <br /> <br /> I liked this short film. This is not one of the best, but some moments are hilarious. A joke repeated several times works every time. The part where they have to run the boss of the hospital is great. To say more would spoil some of the jokes, so you have to see it yourself. Just another beautiful Three Stooges court.
