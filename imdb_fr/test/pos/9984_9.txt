I was blown away by this movie. I'm one of those who takes risks with movies that I do not particularly like sometimes, and I have to say that it has paid off. I mean, wow! Even my boys enjoyed the movie (5 and 6 years old at the time), although I'm sure it was not suited to their age group. <br /> <br /> This movie was clean too, which is great more. It's really nice to be able to watch a movie you really like without blasphemy, violence (except a very brief scene) or anything that you may find morally wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie has led you journey, you are so ready to believe because of the great actor. You feel the wide range of emotions portrayed with the characters. <br /> <br /> I never thought a movie on the golf course would have me at the edge of my seat, but I could not help but be deeply interested in how this one to reveal oneself. I have nothing to compare with this since I have never watched golf in reality or film before, but everyone has done a great job keeping the pace and emotions exciting here. The score has also worked wonders; excellent, excellent score. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not think it would be your kind of movie, look at it. You can be pleasantly surprised. I was certainly.
