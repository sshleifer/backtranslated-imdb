Not as well known as English, American, German and French cinemas, though Swedish cinema of the 1920s was also pretty good, interesting and revolutionary. <br /> <br /> This film is made great story. The story is told in the genre "A Christmas Carol", in which death confronts the deceased with his past, his present and what could have been. This is of course a story that focuses on morality and does it very well. The message seems very powerful and effective. This is of course also due to the effective staging of the father of Swedish cinema; Victor Sjöström. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the Swedish novel Selma Lagerlöf. The story is adapted by Victor Sjöström himself, who might have had to extract some more elements for the story and the film to unfold better. It may take a little too long before the film starts to take shape and the story becomes clear, but when the film takes shape and speeds up, it becomes truly wonderful. <br /> beautiful story, she is also beautiful. The film uses early and effective effects, as well as different color filters to create the right atmosphere and indicate the past, the present and the "future". <br /> <br /> Sjöström not only wrote and directed this film, he also plays the main character. Of course, the game in the movie is sometimes exaggerated, but not as bad as in early German movies, for example. And after all, this film deals more with its history and morality than its acting. It is therefore of little importance, nor distracting. <br /> <br /> A great classic of the underrated and effective silent film from Sweden. <br /> <br /> 9/10
