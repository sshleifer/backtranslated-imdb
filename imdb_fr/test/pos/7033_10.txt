There were discussions on the E! Special Hollywood for Making of Dirty Dancing which is still considered by many women, including one of my darling friends in her fifties, as one of her favorite movies of all time. Perhaps the music, dance or melodrama around the Baby Frances plot becomes a dance sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this movie has established Jennifer Gray whose most important role so far has been Ferris Beuller's bitter sister of Day Off. Patrick Swayze perfectly embodies the heart that beats the heart of the man who literally takes baby. Dirty Dancing has everything to become a hit Broadway or West End. There is the love story, the music and especially a lot of dance. Jennifer and Patrick could easily revive their roles. it's nice to see Jerry Orbach playing a doctor in the place of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as a mother. Everything happened in the Catskills in the sixties, where many Jewish families spent their summer holidays in the region. At the end of the film, it's sad to see the owner of the hotel, Kellerman, be confused by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and trips to Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. These old big hotels are becoming Indian casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive. After all, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, it should be obvious! I know this movie is one of the favorites that we do not get tired of after watching 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie, 1,000 times now. In a way, watching the filming and the story of Dirty Dancing made me dream for my thirteen-year-old childhood. Dirty Dancing may not be the biggest film in history, but its universal appeal always draws crowds and repeat observers, like the 800 club members have seen so many times. I look at him affectionately now with all the awkwardness of Baby's early days and his first real love with Patrick Swayze, Johnny Castle. Nobody could have imagined this little film as a great success with the music of the sixties, two soundtracks and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. This would make the audience part of a movie. No wonder it still attracts children and even adults, especially women of all ages, to watch it again and again. Australia and London have both produced Dirty Dancing. It seems that Broadway will be traveling in 2007 just in time to celebrate its 20th anniversary.
