King of Queens is a comic genius. Kevin James, who plays the IPS delivery guy Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly sexy (# 19 on the list of the 102 hottest women in Stuff magazine) and very funny. The real magic of the show Whatever the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest of the show. Jerry, a comic book genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, who lives in the still cold basement of Doug and Carrie. I must admit that I have never watched this show before this year 2006. Whenever I flipped through it, it never seemed funny, but with the cancellation of Friends, Still Standing and Yes Dear, I had need a new comedy. In fact, by giving the King of Queens a chance, I discovered that it was absolutely fantastic. So funny in fact that I downloaded the first 7 seasons and watched each season in blocks of 8 hours. I urge those who have not seen this treasure to verify it. You will not be disappointed.
