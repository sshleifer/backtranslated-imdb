Although I understand that this show is too weird to please everyone, I do not understand where all these bad reviews come from, and I am particularly surprised by the bad reviews, that it was received from the fans of movies. I loved it and became hooked since the first episode I watched. It's a bit messy though that Kuzco was sent to school. And that seems to be high school rather than college. But I guess he's only eighteen, is not it, so it's not like he's too old to learn? And have the royals not always had the best education available to them? So, the "Kuzco must graduate, otherwise he will not become emperor", it does not seem too weird. And I guess his education has been neglected before, so he needs to be educated now.
