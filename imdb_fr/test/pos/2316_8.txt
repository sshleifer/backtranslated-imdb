Do you know that sometimes you just have to have it? That's how this movie is with me. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it's so clumsy in some parts, but I find myself looking for it when I'm down and I just need a good laugh ... and believe me, I'm just not a "clumsy movie" a little dude. <br /> <br /> You can read the synopsis so that I do not have to be bored with that, do not worry, if you like Kelsey Grammer, this movie will probably please you. <br /> <br /> One more thing, be sure to watch the end credits. You do not need to read them, just watch them and watch the performance of "In the Navy" Village People ... and his friends.
