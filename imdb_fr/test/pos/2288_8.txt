It has always been one of my favorite movies. I have a VHS copy and a few months ago I found a DVD that is also part of my video collection. I'm also a big fan of baseball and, as part of my readings in the low season, I took a copy of Robert Whiting's excellent book, "You Gotta Have WA," which describes the ins and outs of Japanese baseball and the challenges ahead. that foreign players have encountered while playing in Japan. As I began to read yesterday, it made me think of this film, as it seems that the script was based almost textually on this book. The parallels are strange. The character of Jack Elliot is very much like Bob Horner, an aging MLB slugger whose best days were behind him. Teammate Leon Lee, Leon Lee, is also featured in the character of Max "Hammer" Dubois, a veteran of the Japanese league who has overcome the frustrations of the Japanese game and helps his teammate to remain sane. The character of Elliot crosses the same sequence of meetings as Horner, since the signing of fanfares, the early success that feeds an already voracious sports media, and the ensuing slump that generates frustration, the alienation of his teammates, of his fans and media, and disenchantment a desire to return home to the US. The only difference is that the film adds such Hollywood touches as a love interest and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Talking about love interests, I'm sure many people have come to this site (as I did) to search for the actress who played "Hiroko" (the beautiful Aya Takanashi ) and what other work she did. He only lists this movie. According to an article I read, it turns out that the brief love scene she has with Tom Selleck (a stranger) in this film (soft by our standards - basically, they kiss each other during that he is in the bath and that she is wearing a towel) has caused Indignation of the Japanese public (men in particular) to never be offered another role, whether in movies or on television - essentially by the black-block of the Japanese film industry. It's a shame because she is a talented actress in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like this film as much as I do for baseball elements and cultural differences, go find a copy of Robert Whiting's "You Gotta Have WA". A good read and a good companion book for this movie.
