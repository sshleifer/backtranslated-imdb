A grumpy old baronet, happily unmarried, decides to bring his three illegitimate adult children and offer them a home in his mansion. To his surprise, he is bonding with his American daughter without taboo. Can he find satisfaction in his new role of FATHER BACHELOR? <br /> <br /> This 1931 film, in which he gives a solid performance, marked the arrival at the MGM of Sir C. Aubrey Smith, an old man one of the most valuable character actors of Hollywood. With his big hooked nose and brows, Sir Aubrey watched every inch of the role of the duke or general or the statesman he would play so often. Recognized leader of the British community in Hollywood, Sir Aubrey would also champion the cricket game in Southern California. He would be in great demand in studios throughout the city until his death in 1948. <br /> <br /> The most successful star of the film is Marion Davies. We remember today the mistress of media mogul William Randolph Hearst and the chatelaine of Hearst Castle, the most fabulous residence of the west coast, it is a very talented and pretty actress. For a few years, Hearst tried to make her queen of MGM (with her own production company and a huge dressing-bungalow) but the studio already had several other queens - Dressler, Garbo, Shearer, Crawford - and he eventually moved her. at Warner Bros. Here, Miss Davies has an opportunity to joke and clown and her scenes with Sir Aubrey are fun. <br /> <br /> His love interest is played by Ralph Forbes, a beautiful British actor who was just beginning to find good movies (THE TRAIL OF 98) at the end of the days of silence. He had all the qualities to become a major player, but unfortunately, this was not the case. The celebrity would come to Ray Milland, making here one of his first appearances on the screen. Halliwell Hobbes & Doris Lloyd also seem to have an advantage.
