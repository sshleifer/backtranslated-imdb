This film is my favorite comedy of all time and I have seen a lot of comedies. First of all, I should not have this scenario without a script. I just have a storyboard. The cast is one of the best comic sets you'll ever see. The story is that of the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia and some of its competitors. Parker Posey shines and is absolutely great! This is one of those movies that have the most laughter comes from the absolute pathos of the characters. ***** / *****
