I can not say that I liked this film as much as "The Big Lebowski" or "Raising Arizona", but I felt a little offended, but "O Brother" is a nice film worthy of a good laugh and a foretaste of the liveliness of the Coens. , twisted sense of creativity. The DVD edition contains the featurette and I was interested in the fact that the Coens are quite simple in their staging techniques. It suprised me! Of course, this movie is not the best example (and I only say that in comparison) and it did not deserve Oscars (many have the impression of being stolen), but it may depend of the call. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the previous work of Coens, I've never been a fan of old westerns or "The Dukes of Hazzard", nor any of those things they present daily on TNN. I guess that's why I was not so enthusiastic about watching this film, as it revolves around Southern folklore. For all those in the South who read this, I do not want to offend anyone of your people! I'm sure you feel the same when watching movies in urban areas like "A Bronx Tale". When you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get used to movies of this nature. All the excuses aside, I found the characters fun and offbeat. I think John Turturro understood the accent perfectly, and I find it amazing to see how he speaks in real life. Tim Blake Nelson was also good. Of course, George Clooney - who I suppose is not the best at simulating accents, judging by his decision to reject the idea of ​​working with a dialogue coach and developing a neo-English accent for " The Perfect Storm "- looks naturally a bit miscast and continually struggles with the accent. His performance was good, though. You can also see Coen regulars like Holly Hunter (in a short but friendly role) and John Goodman (also on screen for a short while, but steals every minute). <br /> <br /> Although I do not normally know how to dig country music, I liked the title song "A man of constant sorrow". The DVD also contains the video clip of this song. <br /> <br /> All in all, I found the film entertaining and original, but it does not have the same quality as yourself that the Coens have shown us in the past. It's a lighter effort, but good. I always suggest that you check. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
