Chen Kaige lost his sense of tempo. I envy Europeans and Americans who can watch the film without following the dialogue with their ears, because it is painful to do: slow, unusually heavy and too deliberate. But Westerners, on the other hand, suffer from the poor quality of the translation of subtitles, which loses all subtlety and double meaning that makes the study of the film so amusing.
