Coleman Buckmaster, a bold, ambitious, ambitious and uncompromising young producer, brilliantly interprets Harvey Keitel, one of the director's first major roles. It's a real talented hot shot with a shrewd "gold ear" and the son of a famous jazz pianist. to start. Coleman is eager to break into the R & B band (nothing less than Earth, Wind & Fire in their awesome funky awesomeness), but his strictly commercial Greedhead label, A-Chord Records, is run by -the-road-square Jerry (a good Ed Nelson) wants him to record a single for the pop trio too much like Carpenters, The Pages, an apparently pretentious group that includes pedophile father-in-law Franklin (a vile Bert Parks), bitchy and neurotic girl Velor (a beautiful flying lap of Cynthia Bostwick, a beautiful and beneficent brunette), and her hedonistic son addicted to Gary smack (former Jimmy Boyd, major actor of the 1950s sitcom). Coleman, extremely naive and idealistic, must learn without delay how the music industry really works and play as best he can, otherwise he will lose both the group and its credibility. <br /> <br /> Adopting a harsh attitude, The incisive, corrosively hard and biased scenario of Robert Lipsyte, journalist and rock journalist under contract with director Sig Shore (best known for his production of "Superfly") shows a picture resolutely cynical and unflattering of various bribes, rewards, unkept promises, return of daubs, duplicates and double transactions that are an unpleasant, but intrinsic, part of the largely corrupt rock music sector, with themes particularly thoughtful about Art versus Commerce, struggling to maintain its artistic integrity, and the recent attempt to homogenize rock in dominant respectability bland, useless, creatively stagnant. Plus, this sneaky and daring gem offers a rare insight into the intriguing, painstakingly detailed and credible backdrop of the recording process, while the recording console cowboy Coleman wrestles with his own words for make chicken salad from chicken. The disc jockey and the legendary "Fifth Beatle" of Murray the K, the lustful DJ Big John Little (Velor bites his hand after Big John bit his thigh in a live interview!), Soul soul new and Frankie Crocker, host of NBC's "Friday Night Videos", juggling herself, singer-songwriter R & B Doris Troy (she wrote the charming "Just One Look" ) as a church pianist and tubby, bald-70 favorite blaxploitation Charles MacGregor as a priest at a wedding. The rather mediocre sound and mediocrity of Allan Metzger's cinematography inadvertently add to the overall authenticity of the film, torn and rough. Although technically lacking, this film remains one of the jewels of exploitation of the unexplored rocks and pessimistic backstage of the 70's.
