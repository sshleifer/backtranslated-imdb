Driving Lessons From writer of critically acclaimed films, Ms. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock presents a touching drama starring Oscar nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and the Harry Potter series Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint), a seventeen-year-old boy who is held prisoner in the heart of his mother Laura, neurotic on a religious level. At the end of his school year, he decides to work for a smart, free-spirited and "sensational" retired actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters). The couple embark on wonderful adventures, from camping to simple walks, to simple conversations about life. Challenging the domineering mother and each other along the way, they develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes their lives at a time. <br /> <br /> The comic elements are flawless and accurate, especially thanks to British veteran Julie Walters. . Brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and affectionate nature that novice filmmakers could only dream of. The staging is naturally Brock who builds a breathtaking imagery that breaks the surfaces and plunges the viewer into a superabundance of worship and creation. Even the subtle score of unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn accentuates the tone and the way Brock has no trouble generating. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney always makes her mark in the movies as she does as "Laura". The authoritarian and domineering mother is sometimes unbearable and, with Linney at his head, we are engulfed in this personality. The complexity of his character could not have been better described by anyone. Rupert Grint separates from "Ron Weasley" and tries new people. His performance is more reactive than loquacious, but Grint offers us a new performance for a child and the viewer can enjoy it. But the star comes from actress Oscar-nominated actress Julie Walters, who gives her own life to "Evie". Although her role is clearly a leading role, Walters ranks best in the secondary category, where she can simply win the award. "Evie" is a mix of "Clementine Kruczynski" and "Mrs. Laura Henderson" with her free spirit and her lovely character. Hopefully his role will not go unnoticed this season of awards. <br /> <br /> Driving Lessons is not an "amazing" experience, but a pleasant and enjoyable experience that any viewer could take into account and learn a little something. on life, love and friendship in the form of the most beautiful colors and sizes. <br /> <br /> Category: *** / ****
