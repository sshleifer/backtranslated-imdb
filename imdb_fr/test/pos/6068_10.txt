THE ENGLISH PATIENT has not only everything (condemned romance, tragic war, great characters), but in a way that no other film has. It's a haunting story told through flashbacks featuring amazing performances from everyone involved, lavish visuals, characters that interest us, and the most beautiful love story ever told. A cinematographic landmark, the best film of 1996 and one of the best of the 1990s.
