When I saw the trailer for the first time, I have to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection. But after hearing about it, I decided to buy it. When I bought the complete collection in a box, it was absolutely what I wanted to see. It was very funny and the characters were pretty cool. The favorite characters in the series are: Marion, Carrot, Haze Knights, Big Momma and Dotta. I also liked the opening and ending theme songs. The show also has some great voice talents from Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas and others. But however, this show is one of the biggest. So, if you want to see something cool. So this show is this one.
