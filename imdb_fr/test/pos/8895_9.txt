For those who have loved Asterix books and movies, you'll love this movie! Yes, I'll admit that it mixes some books and some movies, but the characters are great and it's not just people who show their CGI left and right. I have seen it many times and I laughed. <br /> <br /> Of course, it contains the main heroes Asterix (Asterix), Obelix (Obelix) and Dogmatix (Idefix), but this time have someone new to ... deal with. <br /> <br /> With a sense of humor like this, the Gauls will continue again and again. Bless them.
