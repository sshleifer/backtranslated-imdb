It's one of the best movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> It's so rich in detail and every time you see it, you'll find new things ... Like then the father is in the shower but always hears only one voice, and when the girls play the flute, they can not do it at the same time because there would be two girls and there are none. <br /> <br /> I have a problem knowing that, in the middle of the movie, their "uncle" visits them, but why is his wife panicking?!? Otherwise a fantastic movie. !!! The best Asian movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hope people will appreciate it. There have been so many movies, where the main character is skit-so (the machinist, Secret Window, etc.), but this movie is much better than them!
