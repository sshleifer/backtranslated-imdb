A fascinating documentary about the life of a husband and wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their son. We all like to think that our parents have lived happy lives, that their marriages have been filled with fulfillment, love and good memories. Unfortunately, many of us know that this is not the case with their own families and those of their parents. This wonderful little documentary is told through the lens of the camera and the emotional perspective of the son of a family who has just experienced the death of their mother. The son being a documentary filmmaker, he filmed his eldest family for many years, claiming he was "posterity". Three months after the death of her mother, her father remarries with his longtime secretary. The suddenness of this event stuns the family and causes the son to delve into the past lives of his father and mother. What he reveals is a fascinating look at the lives of two rather ordinary people who, like so many members of their generation, got married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they had to fend for themselves. A woman who was sometimes bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who bury himself in his work. She and intellectual at heart, he is a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet solitude of work. They are obviously wrong for each other, it is clear. Yet, they hold on, for what? This is part of the mystery, they clearly show affection for each other from time to time, if not a lot of love. You will not find really shocking revelations here, aside from the infidelity on both sides, which is largely what makes it such a jewel. You really think that these people could be your own parents if the circumstances were different and actually bring into question the life of your own parents.
