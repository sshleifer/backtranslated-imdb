I recently saw the short film "The Reader" and found that the film was well planned and executed. I really felt for the two characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz describe in this film. Elizabeth was able to show a great variety with her blind character and let me feel emotionally connected. Morgan was able to sell me his total commitment to protect "Sissy" or Franz from the pain of losing his sister who lived in Copenhagen. The great thing about the movie was its short running time and budget of only ten thousand dollars. Duncan Rodgers was able to make a very well done film that keeps the viewer's interest. Rodgers has a clear idea of ​​the actor's ability and the large transition camera angles to demonstrate his talent. I still think that if a director can make a good movie with a small budget, what can he do with a much bigger movie? Excellent job Duncan !!
