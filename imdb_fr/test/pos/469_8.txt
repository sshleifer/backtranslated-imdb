This film is as if happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense end (or maybe a Crying Game surprise) and the best soundtrack I've ever heard ... if it all made sense. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds indicate pretty much that you're going to have a twisted turn. (I'm surprised no one left immediately at the premiere in Brooklyn.) But from there, the film settles into a conversation between two really hurt people, Daphne and Buddy. <br /> <br /> They are alone, they do silly things and they talk about sex. Daphne tells his stories of the most interesting escorts. Some are quite funny (Mr. Chang), some are disturbing (Harlan's scenes with music telling us that what we're seeing might be what's happening or what Daphne really feels), and because I a friend who was escorting before, I might add, most seem very real. <br /> <br /> You are alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant. Okay, maybe a few minutes less, and I do not know if we would have missed anything. <br /> <br /> Once again, I need to see him again to know the end. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director asked people in Brooklyn the public to write a review on IMDb because many people read it (request accepted).
