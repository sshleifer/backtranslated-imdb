While reading the comments, I was surprised to meet the one who said that this film was "not very deep". I must disagree - it must be one of the most profound and stimulating films I have ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent. they have been rented repeatedly in magazines. However, I also congratulate the heart of the film. It resonates with a deep sense and feeling - it's a story of redemption. It is about two very different characters and very imperfect, slaughtered by the life but too strong to lie down and to die. This is a man who sees more value in a girl than in herself. This reminded me strongly of Francine Rivers' book Redeeming Love, which tells a similar story of redemption. Yes, the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking, but if you look closely enough, you may see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the most true things in life are not pretty, but they are real.
