Taylor Hackford wanted to do this movie for 15 years and finally found Jamie Foxx to star. Foxx is amazing in his rendition of Ray Charles. From an interview I saw with Foxx, he met Charles several times. They also played the piano together (Foxx took piano lessons from a very young age and actually played the piano in all his scenes). I did not see Charles live until his last years, so it was great to have a perspective on the evolution of his career. I hope Foxx will be nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor because he deserves it. The music is amazing too - it really showcases the breadth of Charles' music, from country to blues, and everything in between. The film also gives a spotless account of the life of Ray Charles, the many women with whom he has had sex with his addiction to drugs and its consequences.
