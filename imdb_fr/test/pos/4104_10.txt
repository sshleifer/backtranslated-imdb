It may be a remake of Capra's 1937 film, but it's wrong to think of it that way! He was supposed to expose Hilton's novel in a completely different way. As a musical, it's excellent. The scenery is fantastic, the characters are good and anyone like "Leonard Maltin" who thinks Bacharach's music is awful must be completely deaf! I highly recommend it.
