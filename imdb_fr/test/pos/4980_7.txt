Stanwyck at his best villain, Robinson his equal - as pitiless landowners in this pretty ordinary western. <br /> <br /> Good action scenes, strong use of places, colors and Cinemascope. But why the obvious use of archive footage in the scene of the rout? <br /> <br /> Ford is reliable, as always, and Foster is strong as Robinson's daughter, but it's the villains' movie. And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith is a surprisingly dashing villain who is Stanwyck's lover, and Richard Jaeckel is unforgettable as a murderer with an icy heart. <br /> <br /> See it for the camp.
