Read a biography of the late George C. Scott and you will discover why he was so talented. An investigator asked him what his secret was so that every character he interpreted was his own. Scott answered, he had a fire in him that pushed him. In one of his last interviewers, he unfortunately revealed that he had lost the reader. This was not the case when he played in the movie "The Hospital". In this offer, he plays the talent of Dr. Bock, medical director of one of the best hospitals in the country. However, life has caused him disabling problems, such as the loss of his wife following a divorce, his remoteness from both his promising children and, even worse, his belief that he is physically helpless. At this point, he becomes complacent, moody, and often fantasizes of different ways of committing suicide. To add to his growing list of personal obstacles, his main reason, his hospital was besieged by local students and protesters, incompetent doctors like Dr. Welbeck (Richard Dysart) and a mysterious doctor. who kills patients and doctors, because he believes he is "the wrath of the lamb". (Barnard Hughes) Few choices are left to Bock. One is the promising doctor Brubaker (Robert Walden) to whom he confides in saying: "If there was an oven here, I would put my head in it." The second is a luscious young woman, named Barbara, attracted by Bock because he behaves like a wounded bear. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the play and Arthur Hiller did a very good job in realizing this dark and dramatically interesting story, but a vehicle nevertheless lit up by the fire of George C. Scott. ****
