I am looking for this mini-series for a very long time. I saw this film when I lived in Russia many years ago. I am curious if anyone who has the recorded copy of this movie can send me the copy. I am willing to cover all expenses and pay extra tapes or DVDs. This is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of Israel and the history of the world after the Second World War. I'm also trying to find a book (I've heard it's even better than the movie), but the new one costs about $ 50 on Amazon and I never bought a used copy. my e-mail address is yurets777@hotmail.com Thank you very much for your help.
