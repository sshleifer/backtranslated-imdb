I have already seen this movie count times and I still can not be fed up. It's like a drug. I know a lot of people do not like it, but there is something about it that attracts me. Each performance is spectacular, but it's Aaliyah who steals the show. She not only played the role of Akasha, she became what she was. His body movement and beauty were captured exceptionally well. It is also nice to see that a black girl has been chosen for the role of an Egyptian queen (no, I am not a prejudice against whites, I am one). Certainly, we do not know what color were the ancient Egyptians, but it was an interesting change. Stuart Townsend made me completely forget the portrait of Lestat by Tom Cruise and Marguerite was once again striking. Overall, it was a good time in the cinema. For those who have not seen it, be sure to look at it with an open mind and not take it too seriously. I mean, it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star. Take it like that.
