The Thing is an important step in the making of a movie and remains one of my favorite movies of all time. Despite its roots in science fiction, the film is ultimately a horror film that balances brilliantly with splatter and psychological trauma. Today, more than twenty-five years after its release, the special effects are an example of great brilliance and effects. Rob Bottin suffered a total physical breakdown for his art. It would be impossible to make the same film today, because the Studio would certainly insist on the choice of a female character or a type of Paul Walker. <br /> <br /> An all-male American science team in Antarctica is plunged into turmoil when an extraterrestrial life capable of absorbing and perfectly imitating other life forms infiltrates their camp. Their trust in each other gradually fades as they become less and less sure of who is real and who is an imitation, and this scenario of "body thieves" sees their numbers dwindle gradually. as one by one, they are victims of The Thing. When he is cornered, he presents himself as a nightmarish creature, the metamorphosis always horrible and convincing. <br /> <br /> The impotence, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no way out. helping to reach them is cleverly supported. The long hours of darkness and the rising snowfalls provide a dark background to the terror that is unfolding. Director John Carpenter has carefully selected a team of brilliant actors and each member of the team fits perfectly into the role they play, be it the young street chef, the old doctor wise or helicopter cynical and bitter. pilot. The fact is that no one here can be considered an American superhero with blonde highlights and a six pack. The true strength of the film lies largely in this realism. The people who suffer on the screen are recognizable in our daily lives. <br /> <br /> The thing is always nice and touching even after repeated viewing. I have now seen the film on more than twenty different occasions and my amazement at the quality of the staging, acting and special effects is unshakeable. My girlfriend prefers the fallout of the film in high school - The Faculty - which is a good and solid entertainment, but much lighter and hissing. She still loves and recognizes the genius of The Thing though, and thank god for that ... Because I could not stay in the company of someone who did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> A classic, then some.
