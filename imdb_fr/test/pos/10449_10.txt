What looks like a Porky scam proves to be a touching film about youth and love. The story is about three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, who spend their school hours looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in town, Gary falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> The film goes from a suspicious sexual film to a review of the insecurities of teenage girls. It's funny and sad at the same time. It never completely addresses this formula of love story that seems predominant in all the films made. You know, the guy meets a girl, the guy loses the girl, the guy gets the girl in the final frame formula. This formula is thrown apart after the guy meets a girl. Maybe that's why I liked the film so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is particularly good and the end is a real tear. It may also be one of the most realistic conclusions I've ever seen in a love story. <br /> <br />
