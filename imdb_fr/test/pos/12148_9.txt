Claude Sautet's All Hazards film was not a film. To be honest, I had really heard about it until the New York Film Forum announced a two-week screening of the film, with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was in line with classic French crime movies like Jean Pierre Melville, I jumped at the chance to check it (in the best case, it would classify his great works, and at worst I would have good results: popcorn in a big theater). It was worth being admitted, because All Hazards Class is one of those French films that are just waiting to be rediscovered (or discovered for the first time). With tremendous diligence, Sautet keeps the suspense very tight during the first forty minutes of the film, retaining much of the middle (if not great) and then ends with what we always expect with these films, but with fascinating motivations through the characters. With a movie like that, you know how it's going to end, but it's the cool and thoughtful journey that counts. <br /> <br /> The film presents a performance with real truth and honesty, in the middle of Lino Ventura's "Old Age Criminal Code" in the role of Aldo who, at the beginning of the film (l one of the best beginnings of a film of this kind and this country) steals a large sum of money with its partner in crime.) When, suddenly, one night, on a beach, destiny changes abruptly and ugly, Aldo is again on the run with two young children, with the help of Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, a role in Le Doulos with a little more humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and pushes him to Paris.However, some of Aldo's former business partners have problems, and an old score may be the right ticket.Sometimes the plot may seem quiet, but it's not As Melville, Sautet leaves no trace of his story, and it is a very structured film, with a few b There are doses of humor here and there (I sometimes smiled at the audacity of the criminals at the beginning of the chase sequence, and also with a particular woman who had problems with her cat and a fish). <br /> <br /> With a beautiful score of the great George Delerue, an exceptional cinematography and an atmosphere rarely encountered even less Adays, All Hazard Class recalls this bridge between the real old school noir film and the police films of the last day. The gangsters in this new genre of "rogue life" movies have a thousandth of a class and the honor of the thieves in this movie, and are a second banana to the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment I assure you ). That it is realistic and moral, it helps too.
