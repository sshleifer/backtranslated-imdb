A well-done melodrama that tells the story of Sally, the circus boy's dancer, evoked by the McGargle show (played by WC Fields). carnival games like Three Card Monte and Old Shell Game. McGargle has raised Sally, who venerates him as his "real father" since his mother (expelled from her home by her father, a judge, when she married a "circus man") died and left Sally orphaned. Sally is courageous and loyal to McGargle, no matter what concerns him - but McGargle seems to feel a bit guilty for keeping him in the circus instead of staying with his own family all these years. When they end up performing in a carnival in the city where his wealthy grandparents live, McGargle takes this opportunity to "investigate" Sally's real family, with the idea that he might return it to him. But the grandfather judge immediately takes his dislike to Sally because he does not like a "show girl" - what a stern and stubborn man, a real job, this guy! And meanwhile, Sally is busy being chased by a handsome and rich young man, son of the man who helped his grandfather to get his wealth. <br /> <br /> It's a very good film with some laughs here and there and some kind of strange editing style (I do not know how to describe it otherwise than it shows long shots, then sort of come back into back a few seconds or change angle suddenly as a close-up is shown). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is charming here - pretty cute and comical in her performance. BATHROOM. Fields, even without his famous voice, is very funny - just the way he moves and his amusing and comical reactions (like a little dog seen in a fun scene), we even see him juggling briefly. I love the few circus and carnival images presented here. The print of this photo on the DVD is very pretty, tinged with a slight sepia tint, and the score for the piano is really excellent, played by Philip Carli from the original score sheets.
