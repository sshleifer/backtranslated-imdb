This movie was great! I like the way he mixes dark humor with drama. There are times when you think that it is impossible to laugh at the situation presented and that you are having an amazing laugh. He is wonderfully played, with great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels and Emile Hirsch. It is well written with an elegant and surprising end. I'm not one to say that everyone will love him as much as I do, but give him a chance and praise him. The DVD features excellent special features, including full commentaries by director Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch, and a commentary by Sigourney Weaver, which provides you with interesting information about the film. I hope my comment is useful and that you enjoy the movie!
