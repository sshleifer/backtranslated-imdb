There are 3 films of this genre, all designed in the same way and extremely entertaining. Red plays on the radio Wally Benton, aka The Fox, who struggles to solve real crimes with his fianc√© played by your typical neighbor of the war, Ann Rutherford. Many one-liners and gags are idiots and probably in the 1940s, as I had expected. But, like many of them, I laughed out loud, which was unexpected to say the least. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence, which is surprising because I grew up with a much older version of the charming man who did not really play well in my great years. I have to give these films the go-ahead if you're in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare. I almost had a light heart, but in truth, people are upset, beaten and dare to say it, the suspense is sometimes well above average. As with most movies of this era, it receives a PI rating (politically incorrect) for reasons you can imagine. In wartime, I guess it's funny, and those movies too. Look at one, look at them all.
