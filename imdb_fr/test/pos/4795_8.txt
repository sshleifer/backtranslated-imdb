The career of Spanish director Luis Buñuel lasted almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. His best films are probably those he made during his exile in Mexico - from the late 40s to the early 60s. , he had to cope with very cheap budgets and work in an industry mainly interested in shooting commercial movies to an unsuspecting public, but he still managed to produce interesting, stimulating films that withstand the test time. This film is based on a novel by the Spanish writer Benito Perez Galdos - and the adaptation is very faithful, although the decor is now the beginning of the twentieth century in Mexico instead of the beginning of the 20th century in Spain. The protagonist, Nazarin, is a priest who tries to lead a life as faithful as possible to that prescribed by Christ. The question many would ask is whether such an undertaking would be possible, without incurring hostility, misunderstanding and mockery on the part of your fellow men. In fact, he suffers from many indignities, but he remains stubborn (until the last controversial blow) with regard to this objective. I think Buñuel wanted to show Nazarin a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps inadvertently, his stubbornness (at least for this viewer) is admirable. In any case, a good movie.
