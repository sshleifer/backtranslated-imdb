I have to admit that I liked this movie a lot more than I expected. Will Smith has that neat charm that you can not help but love. The plot was a slight modification of the base of the romantic comedy, reminiscent of Jane Austen's "Emma". This guy, Kevin James, has a real talent for timing and physical comedy. I have never seen his TV show, but it was very well presented in this film. Amber Valletta was pretty good. I do not remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film, but if she was supposed to be an actress or a model, the casting might have left something to be desired. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery and would have liked to have a bigger role. But, keeping the best for last, Eva Mendes more or less stole the show. Her beauty and charm, and just what was needed from a distance, stuck to me every time she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This film is definitely worth the detour.
