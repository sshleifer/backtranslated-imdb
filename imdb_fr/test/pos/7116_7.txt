House of Dracula works from the same basic principle as House of Frankenstein from the previous year; namely the three most famous monsters of the universal; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man appear in the film together. Naturally, the film is quite complicated, but the fact that the three monsters are there is usually enough that the sixty-seven minutes of the film do not become boring. It is obvious that the idea of ​​making another monster crushes has come to the mind of the writer before the plot, because the thread given to us is not quite without holes. The plot sees Count Dracula arrive at Dr. Edelman's home for a cure for his vampirism. Then, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees Lawrence Talbot, among others, to see The Wolf Man come forward to seek healing for his affliction! It turns out that Dracula is on the lookout for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot is really serious. When it turns out you can not stop him from turning into a wolf, The Wolf Man jumps into the sea ... where he finally finds Frankenstein's monster. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not as good as Frankenstein's house earlier. The 1944 film built its plot better than this entry in the series, the plot here not giving the same time to every Universal monster. Dracula's plot is the biggest at first, but it eventually fades to resurface at the end. The werewolf is the star of the series, but his story never really develops. This is essentially another version of the plot in which he is still located. The Frankenstein Monster is the coldest hand, because it appears in the film simply after the fact. , and an obvious excuse to make sure the three monsters appear in the movie. The story of the doctor who binds the three together is the most interesting, but it's a bit disappointing because that's not the reason people will see this movie. The acting is enough, John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr ensuring again that his character is plunged into a tragedy. Glenn Strange has nothing to do and Onslow Stevens is the real asset as Dr. Edelman. Overall, this movie will not do much for those who are not a fan of universal horror. but as the movies of idiot monsters go, House of Dracula is worth the detour.
