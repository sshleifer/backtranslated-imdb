I loved this show. Such talent; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled after only having started. I was looking forward to seeing this show all week. And so sorry for the people who were hoping to be the one. I would have liked to see who would have won. It's just started, and I think it should not have been canceled. I hope these young artists have been seen by talent scouts and have the opportunity to achieve their goals. I voted and sat down waiting for him to come; never knowing that it was canceled. And I could not believe it was. I am surprised that he had weak odds; because in my opinion it was one of the best reality shows.
