Henry Thomas and Robin Tunny are some of the most underrated artists in the industry. I do not understand why they did not receive more recognition than they received. This film is a perfect example of how limitless their abilities are. <br /> <br /> Playing the life of people who might be considered a little strange seems to be their specialty, and if these characters are not strange I can not find anyone who is. <br /> <br /> The story is funny, romantic, dramatic, complex and tragic. I hated the end, but if I had not done it, I would not have liked the story as a whole. So this is it.
