In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sinhala government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has reportedly killed 68,000 people since 1983. Human rights defenders said that because of the war, more than a million people have been displaced, are homeless or live in camps. The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is deeply dramatized by the famous Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek, winner of several awards at the National Film Awards in India. While the Civil War is only the backdrop to the narrative of a young girl's journey, the human cost of war is clearly explained and Ratnam gives fighting a universal context, pointing fingers at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed in southern India by director of photography Ravi K Chandran in a setting reflecting the relief of Sri Lanka, the film tells the moving story of an adopted girl from 9 years old looking to find his real mother in the middle of fighting in Sri Lanka. Played with deep feeling and expressiveness by PS Keerthana in a memorable performance, Amudha is raised by a loving middle-class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents, Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a red. Cross camp. In a loving flashback, we see Amudha's adoptive parents, famed Tamil writer Thiru (Madhavan), and TV personality, Indra (Simran), get married to facilitate their adoption of the little girl with darker skin. <br /> <br /> The young Amudha has no idea of ​​her adoption until she is suddenly decided on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. As she plays, Thiru almost tells her that "you are not our daughter" and that her answer is predictable. Afflicted, she wonders who his father was, what his mother's name was, why she abandoned him, etc., but few answers are waiting for us. Amudha fled several times until her parents agreed to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her real mother, now a Tamil separatist fighter. The immersion of the family in the reality of the civil war leads to traumatic moments and difficult decisions, skilfully managed by Ratnam, although a sequence in which the family was caught between two fires was felt amateurish. <br /> <br /> A Peck on the Cheek is of course a Bollywood style movie and that means tons of music and melodrama. Melodrama did not bother because of the strong performances of the main actors; However, I found the musical dramatization of A. R. Rahman's songs against the atmosphere of the film with their smooth and sophisticated production techniques and a quick montage of musical video style. Yet the convincing nature of the story and the honesty with which it is told transcend the boundaries of the film. Tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even in the country, for being too clichéd and commercial, yet A Peck on the Cheek is both an entertainment film and a film that tackles serious problems. The fact that he successfully straddles the dividing line between art and commerce is not a rejection, but a tribute.
