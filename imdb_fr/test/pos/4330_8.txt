This is probably the second best of Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 reminds me of "West Side Story" with a new twist. Even the recent movie "Gangs of New York" can not compare to a New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3, which is not rife with two rival gangs - but a big gang. A gang that is ready to commit sharp acts, like cutting to death if it encroaches on the set. <br /> <br /> Deborah Raffin, who plays the role of a public defender, plays softly in this film is filled with a lot of violent shoot-em-up. Thus, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with its sweet and romantic moments as well as its violent moments. Only scenes of James Bond's love interest would do much better. <br /> <br /> And in addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new pistol called the Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of Dirty Harry's movies when Callahan used his Magnum .44 in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. The Wildey pistol has a big punch and when Kersey kills, he does not care if the pistol kicks. <br /> <br /> And this anti-tank missile that killed the main gang leader? Well, it's something. Kersey would not use an anti-tank missile as a weapon of regular vigilance ... it's way too military for him.
