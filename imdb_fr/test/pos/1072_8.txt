Our critic from Toronto explained what you need to know about this movie (except that you have to edit it, the manual technique becomes very old, very fast). I saw this film last night in MÃ©nerbes, France. We are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course winemakers. They were all there in the Polyvalente room to watch crowded shows. Polite, patient, great. Although my French is challenging, I understood the essence of the film, but I noticed that the public liked the "old" producers of terror interrogated - in particular. that of a communist village of Languedoc. He laughed a lot. It's unusual in France - laugh out loud. There is no doubt that on which side of the terrorist-globalization war they are! SM
