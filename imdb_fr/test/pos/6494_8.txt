Thank God, the Dutch are not all ruthless. I think Jason is judged by most people just because he has a famous father. Maybe he's not as good as some of these actors, but he's certainly not as bad as suggested. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie a few years ago and I really liked it. I knew Jason from other movies and of course Robin from Sherwood. But I must say that I really liked his role in this movie. It was really good! <br /> <br /> During the movie, I forgot he was the son of. Sean .. who? <br /> <br /> And if you are a lover of Shakespeare, I can recommend this movie. I am sure you will enjoy it!
