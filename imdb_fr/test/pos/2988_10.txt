I love this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was working in a video store. when I went to buy it, they told me that it was exhausted and that I could not order it, so I told myself that today I would watch. and then I found it they released it in Spain on DVD under the name "Algo Mas Que Amigos" and you can buy it here in English and Spanish on the DVD ... hope it helps ... .. I know how hard it is to find movies we like that have not been released in the US market yet. good luck..oh For more information, here is a place to check .... HTTP://www.zonadvd.com I think that goes for $ 10 USD on eBay too.
