Istanbul is a big overcrowded city between Europe and Asia. Too many people have lived together for centuries. In this documentary film, you can see how music can describe the race culture of its owner. <br /> <br /> You could hear too many types of music, including rock, hip-hop, arabesque, alternative music, and so on. Some musicians are famous in Turkey, others also in Europe. The others are only street musicians. Their music tells the audience the different faces of a city. <br /> <br /> Awesome!
