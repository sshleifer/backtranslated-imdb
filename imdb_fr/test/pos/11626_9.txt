Sigrid Thornton (SeaChange) was apparently born to play the role of Philadelphia Gordon of Cato, in this story that is often compared to Gone With the Wind, a classic of Margaret Mitchell's Civil War. Waters (Heaven Tonight) is probably his best role, as well as his love for the larachin. The two leading men lead a wonderful Australian cast in this series, arguably the best known and most beloved Australian miniseries. <br /> <br /> This is an exceptional production, but do not try to look at it all at once, and it deserves to be remembered as a magnificent portrait of life in Australia before the federation. Rating: 8/10
