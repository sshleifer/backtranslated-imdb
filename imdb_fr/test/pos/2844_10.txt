I saw "nurse betty" twice in September 2000 at the International Film Festival "Films by the Sea" in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I continued to smile all day long after watching it for the first time and almost all evening when I took the film as the final taste of the festival. In short, what I knew about "the nurse betty" is that Renée Zellweger would embody a girl in love with a star on the soap opera. But what I saw was much more than that! Beautiful roles for morgan freeman, chris rock and renée zellweger. A strange mix of romance, violence and roadmovie. And for all, a story that takes another direction every moment you think you are on the track. Many soap opera fans will love 'nurse betty' - the movie as well as the character !!! - but they can take all their non-soap friends, because they will appreciate even more the story for the hard and humorous lines - free man and rock - for cruel scenes, thriller aspects and for beautiful pictures. And I'm sure in the end, everyone will love 'nurse betty' for its captivating and innocent charm !!!
