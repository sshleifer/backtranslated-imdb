I think this film has to be one of the most moving and heart-wrenching films of recent years. <br /> <br /> The film begins essentially with a suicide in the toilets of a school. You do not see who it is, and from there, it goes until the beginning of the day, and we get to know 6 characters, and they live things quite heavy, anyway, one of them will eventually commit suicide. <Br/> <br /> For 8 years, I have been teaching physical education at school and I have never seen in a movie such a faithful representation of what is really going on in the life of the school . <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully shot and sounds incredible. <br /> <br /> The end is so shocking, and that's what you would not expect, it's something that will haunt me for days. <br /> <br /> It's really worth watching. <br /> <br /> I think that the fact that the director / scriptwriter was at school only a few years ago is an important factor that contributed to the honesty expressed in the film. <br /> <br /> The film is shot in two different "modes" if you want. First, there is the seamless observation style in which we get to know the characters in their school environment throughout their drama, but the amazing part of the film is in the interview sections, where we get to know the characters, their stories and their stories. deepest and darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> You continue to wonder who will be (who commits suicide) and, as the drama unfolds, you continue to change your mind, until bam, he You hit in the face last five minutes. I am everywhere in my writings, but I just saw him during a projection in the media in Australia and I am still a little shocked. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Australian films I have seen in recent years.
