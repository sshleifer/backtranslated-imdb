Philippe Garrel makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the New Wave, almost lost among the vestiges of its former splendor but ready to be reborn from the ashes if it is remembered from the past. On the other hand, those who know a little about the director's subjects know very well how much he is obsessed by the feeling of loss that persists regarding the versatility of reality. "The regular lovers" shows us the parallel stories of a "crazy love" and a revolution attempted in ruins under the direction of young French students. <br /> <br /> The first part of the story is about the dramatic events of May 68 in France, evoked in a series of amazing sequences of shots, a kind of cinema-truth style, which place the revolt student in a day as enviable as black on a black background. <br /> <We can say a lot about the peculiarities of black and white photography used to describe the battle between students and police, where high contrasts give an unrealistic atmosphere to the sequences and where the darkness closes on the excited bodies that envelop them in mystery. The images, completely devoid of words, show the real consistency of the myth, made of a coarse violence, more and more emphasized by the exasperated reality of filming. The individual does not count anything here: he has a tendency to disappear in the mass. What really matters in these fight scenes is the significance of the mass suggestion, the blind fury of the juvenile assault, the ominous praises of the power of the crowd, even if they are conceived as separate entities, away from all emotion, with cold and cold. distant look at an entomologist intending to catalog his collection of insects. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story is described in a more calm and intimate way. Trace on the horizon the desolate portrait of an egocentric generation in search of its lost time, completely disenchanted with the individual values ​​of men, inclined to turn on itself between the opium vapors and to make a funeral oration at the glory of his recent defeat. <br /> <br /> "Regular lovers" seem to evoke from time to time the shadow of the great Robert Bresson, revised and corrected by the special sensitivity of Garrel without departing from the main argument, seeking to expand perspectives on the subject of human disappointments that while painful can bring us to the truth. In my opinion, by trying to penetrate deeply into the substratum of history, if a man lets himself go and plays things in his ear, he will probably realize that he can bring out the dark side of his ego with consequences. terrible and irremediable.
