It's a movie I watched when I was little and never forgot. It's certainly not the best film ever, but there is something very special about it that I can not quite put my finger on. I like that. I'm the kind of person who likes everything that explains me, it's for this reason alone that this movie drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> Exactly what / Who is this mysterious witch-woman and what is her relationship with Tom? WHY and HOW did he become a baby of water ... why was he raised on the earth? These are questions like those that eat me! I thought that if I read the book, I would get answers, but I just read an article that says that the book from which this story is "based" is very different. So, I guess I'll never know what the author thought! <br /> <br /> However, I still love this movie and I recently saw it with my two year old niece. She loves it as well as she insists to call it "baby's water" for reasons unknown to me. She likes the part where it jumps in the water then declares "I am all clean". (You must understand that my niece is the world's cleanest two-year-old!) We watched this scene again and again. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy that we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more movies like this one. (But what's going on with the gay hippocampus ?? !!)
