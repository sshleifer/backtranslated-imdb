And a hard point elsewhere. I have not seen this movie since I was young enough, maybe 12 or 13, who knows. But what I know is the film that taught me to masturbate. I am not joking. I do not know at all if it's really good by today's standards, but for me, at the time, that was it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I feel comfortable writing this is that I will never be able to read it. Really, who's going to watch this movie these days? <br /> <br /> I just discovered that I have not used the minimum of ten lines yet for the amount of time I take most in a review. I did not know there was a minimum length, but I go there as a student trying to fill a page in a newspaper, my ten lines. Thank you so much.
