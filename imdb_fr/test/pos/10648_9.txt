This film is a reference in the history of unconventional cinema. The use of editing represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of Strike (Eisenstein's first film). Take the stage on the steps and notice the repeated gunshot of the soldiers coming down to remind of the importance of the horrors that really happened! A monumental film very intelligent, to see absolutely for all students in cinema!
