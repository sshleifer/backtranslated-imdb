I really like the wind and the lion. It was a good movie. I thought that since I was young and that it was done so long ago, I would not like it so well, but after seeing it, I was surprised at the quality of what it was . My family loved it, my friends loved it, everyone I showed loved it. I liked this because it showed how Arabs and Moroccans were treated in the early 1900s by the Germans, the French and even the Americans. If I were a history teacher in high school, I would certainly show it from my student's point of view. I give this film a good 10 out of 10. My grandparents liked it so much that they bought it for themselves. My little 3 year old cousins ​​even sat down and watched it. Systemoffell <br /> <br />
