I guess some high-end directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, their grappa, their aramangac or their jungle juice one night in the 80s during the Cannes Film Festival or another film festival and one of them they said, "Hey, guys, let's make a movie where everyone creates a segment of world class air." Welllll ... it worked. It is clear that someone was smart enough to select some of the best records of the selected Arias, for example Nessun Dorma from Bjoreling. If you were blind and lying on the ground just listening to the DVD, you'd get more for your money. Not all filmmakers have been successful, but more than ever, and the film seems to be getting better every time we watch. My favorite is the oddly beautiful love duo of Die Todt Statd; All right, a naked girl, Elizabeth Hurley, is a feast for the eyes, but her husband singing her, her ghost, is incredibly beautiful, because the love music comes right after Otello's "Gia nella Notte Densa" and Desdemona in all the opera repertoire. The film could have been better, of course, which could not be, but it's worth seeing, especially if you're in a hyper-romantic mood.
