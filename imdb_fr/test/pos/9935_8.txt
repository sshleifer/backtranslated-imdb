Even if it's not tagged as a Slasher movie, it contains all the elements. The fact that slashers are well known for their modest budget, their lame plot, their nerdy effects and all you can add, that does not mean that there can not be good slasher movies. "Opera" completes the description. Even if it's part of Italian giallo; which is far from being a slasher subgenre. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento proves that he deserves the label of one of the best directors of Horror. "Opera" is one of the most elegant horror films of the last 30 years. Although the film takes place in a beautiful and bright place; the situations and gore make it one of the scariest places ever used in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I think of "Opera" as an elegant slasher, even if there is an in-depth development of the plot and characters. The cheese factor often used in most Slasher movies is not present here, but in exchange, we have a gory tale, stunning and visually stunning. The plot of the movie is simple (as in all Slasher). There is a psychopath in the opera who is somewhat obsessed with the lead actress / singer and who forces her to witness horrible deaths. The scenes of death are extremely horrible and are the best thing about the movie. The famous scene of death "peephole" is in my opinion the highlight of the film. It's a fantastic death scene that no one other than Argento could release. The knife in the neck (and the mouth) is another scene macabre but less violent than that of the scissors. The gore of "Opera" will delight the bad guys and lovers of violence. <br /> <br /> What I did not like in the film is the lack of coherence or logic. I mean, after watching the first death, the main woman, calm as if nothing had happened, came home and did not care much about what she saw. In addition, she stayed home alone and did not take any security measures. Yet, the suspense in the movie makes you forget the lack of logic. Argento knows how to create tension and scare the subconscious. For example, when Betty's friend told him that someone was watching from outside, she panicked and put the suspense in case something happened. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film is excellent. For an Italian giallo it's excellent. The creative plans in POV Argento are impressive. The crows also added a feel of goose bumps to the movie. Argento adds his unique spice. <br /> <br /> "The Opera" is one of the most underrated but most popular groups within the Horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: opera setting - the knife in the neck and mouth - the heavy metal score combined with opera music (this music has never panicked me before) - the ferocity of the killer <br /> <br /> The only thing I do not do not like at "Opera" is the heavy metal songs used in the death scenes. It's nice to disturb the audience, but I think the music of the opera might have added a more frightening feeling. Nevertheless, the "shocking" use of heavy metal is a singularly disturbing aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Look at "Opera" even if you do not like gore. There is a lot of suspense and tension that could scare the most skeptical. This is not a "Suspiria", but it deserves to be among the best of Argento.
