I thought Nick Gomez's look at New Jersey's steep streets, where car shots were at record levels, was both challenging and entertaining. It's as good as movies like Boyz n the Hood or Menace II Society or Above the Rim. I thought the actors and scenarios were appropriate, that it had a realistic feel and that it was very atmospheric, whether by design or coincidence. I really liked this film, an underrated gem that I found on TV and glad I caught it. Go watch this movie if you have a shot. If they do not have a DVD, they should get one out. Well done Nick Gomez. IMDb rating: 5.9. My rating: 9/10
