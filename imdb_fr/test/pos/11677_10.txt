I saw this film at the age of 14 and it changed my life. I immediately cut my hair and started buying all the records of the film groups. These were some of the pioneering bands of punk rock L.A. filmed at the peak of their power. Groups like Black Flag (Pre-Rollins), Circle Jerks, Fear, X and Germs have few equals in the history of punk music. I can not believe that this film was never put on video or on DVD. Excellent movie for punk rock fans.
