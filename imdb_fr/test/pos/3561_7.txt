A train holding union soldiers carries $ 300,000 worth of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who is there to see him reach his destination, but he is suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However, Bahunda wins with the gold and the cache, but when Monetero tries to remove it, he is killed by soldiers. The only clue is a medallion, but Monetero is captured and will soon be executed. A stranger disguised as a priest (who after Monetero's bonus) introduces himself and offers to save his life for half of the gold. In exchange, Monetero gives him half of the locket, but Clayton notices it and discovers that something is wrong. Soon all three cross for gold, but the bank's insurance company and Monetero's gang are waiting, waiting for their chance to jump. <br /> <br /> Looking at the opening sequence, you'll know you know what to do. Enter into a spaghetti western with an ironic style and addiction dotted with many references (some beautifully made) of other movies (mostly the trilogy of the dollar) of its sub-genre. The energetic direction of director Enzo Castellari is sprawling and mostly light, but many of his large, rhythmically staged plays are promising. Basically, there are a lot of fights, fights in hand (and many acrobatic stunts), compared to excessive vicious shots. However, most of these waterfalls are very well done and very enjoyable. When the guns are blazing, you can burn energy. The traditional story remains faithful to the conventional details, but as there is a lot of connivance and confusion, the spontaneous nature ensures that you will never really be sure how it is going to be between the three. This leads to many effective suspense moments, intelligent twists and a lot of wink, wink. The humor in the starch script is pretty sneaky. The dynamic and tense framing of Giovanni Bergamini and the impulsive score of Francesco De Masi fit favorably into the light and energetic style. The performances are extremely well adapted and form a striking report. George Hilton's twisted and frayed turn is as solid as the ambiguous unknown. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives a strong performance as Clayton, who resists well. Kareen O'Hara does not have much to do, but is a worthy observer. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli provide effective support. <br /> <br /> A funny and dignified Spaghetti parody / tribute that throws a curved ball after another and many successful antics.
