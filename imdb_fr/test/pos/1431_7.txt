But pretty dated today. Otto Preminger made this film without the necessary certificate of approval. It was extremely courageous and risky because he could have lost his investment and his future. <br /> <br /> The film is not faithful to the wonderful book and is unfortunately Hollywoodized. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra (and I've never been a fan of Frankie Machine, his performance is amazing, we forget that it's Frank, the realism he brings to the role of a drug addict in the making must be seen, we must believe it. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak, eternally beautiful and talented, does not disappoint the role of the devoted foreigner, always present for Frankie. <br /> <br /> secondary roles, especially a young, handsome and talented Darrin Mc Gavin, are flawless. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker, playing the role of Frankie's wife, is hopelessly inept.It goes from irritating to melodramatic and is far too much, a forgotten performance. <br /> <br /> The sets are both flat and inexpensive, as if a firm gust of wind projected all the sticky painted cardboard on the horizon. Almost laughable sometimes by their low price. <br /> <br /> The music was irritating, sometimes very loud. nuance of the script (example: when Louie was releasing his game from Frankie) had to be underlined at a high decibel level. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. Sinatra really deserved her Oscar nomination. Worth to be seen.
