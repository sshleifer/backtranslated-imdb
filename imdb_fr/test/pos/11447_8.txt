Night of the Demons (1988) is part of a long series of teen horror movies on video and pay-tv. during this film mecca making the eighties. But unlike most shit that was peddled, this one was actually a decent watch. A group of bored "teens" decide to party with a pair of weird sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley) in the infamous Hull House. Your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers is invited to the party. But an average teenager turns into a night of terror as they try to survive the night of Halloween when undead residents of Hull House decide to crush the party. Who will survive this night of bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A beautiful horror movie that can be better seen in its unrated version. If you look at the R-Rated Cup, you will miss all the splatter and nudity effects. Stay tuned for this fun epilogue! A bloody movie followed by an equally entertaining sequel. Reserved for horror lovers! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
