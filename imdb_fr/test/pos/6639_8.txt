What Bergman understood here is "What if all these bad things were happening here in Sweden, to such nice people like us?" And what it gives us, in Swedish, with Swedish actors, on Swedish sites (and using what seems to be real Swedish military vehicles), is familiar with the war movies taking place in almost every other country in the world. Europe - all disconcerting invasions and counter-invasions, political lies, internment camps, false confessions, summary executions, tortures, revolvers, "collaborators", etc. As in a new modern, this is done in an abstract way, without real names, cities or countries. But the strongest faction is the "Nazis": they bicker and some wear bright boots. We even whip things with a whip (ok, it's actually a cane). The victim couple is called Rosenberg. Aside from the shame they feel of finding dirtier ways to survive - and who would not do what they did - all of the above suggests that the title is clearly meant to refer to de facto complicity from Stockholm with the Nazis. Indeed, we are shown what Sweden might have looked like if Germany had asked for a little more than mining concessions. <br /> <br /> The first half unfolds like a black comedy. We see the "fog of war" from the point of view of a fairly comical couple who ignore troops, long convoys, bombed buildings, reports, and so on. They do not even bother to find a radio that works. They are the ultimate in "Not in my backyard". They talk about wine and blueberries; Meanwhile, friends are mysteriously called and more and more soldiers are landing in the city. They show no curiosity about the war that has surrounded them for many years. <br /> <br /> The man (Von Sydow) is cultivated, pouting and vitalizing navel; the woman (Ullman) is a little more impulsive, passionate and outward looking. There is a beautiful scene in which the man speaks of his violin: the manufacturer, he said casually, fought in the Napoleonic wars, but his personal interest stops with the cultural artefact in his hand - or, more specifically, that his warm feelings about owning him, and the security that this property assumes. Not in my garden! But when the war finally enters their bucolic idyll, man's timidity, an irritation in good times, turns into a liability, which he ends up overcompensating - as is often the case - as Bergman shows. with subtlety and beauty. Well worth a visit.
