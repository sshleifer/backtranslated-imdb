It's not part of my favorite Hitchcock movies, although I have to admit it's still pretty good. The presence of Jimmy Stewart (he always improves even the most mediocre material) and the incredibly scary assassin (which looks like a skeleton with just a thin layer of skin covered with skin) particularly pleased me. Although it cost the studio a lot of money, I did not particularly like Doris Day in the movie. She seemed to cry a lot and shout "What will be like a back?" Yes, I know she was supposed to sing that way, but it always made me hate that song. Sorry. <br /> <br /> The other, even minor, complaint I had about the movie was that he was a little "too polite" and "Hollywood". The original version (also made by Hitchcock) just seemed a lot more serious and lighter - and it added to the scary atmosphere.
