I was lucky to attend the screening of this film tonight at midnight. I must say that I was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely wrong. This movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything I loved I just loved. Bruce Campbell was as incredible as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He was playing the crazy doctor's henchman as much as he could. Between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he was only shining. But I really can not ignore the magic of Bruce Campbell. Although I thought Ted Raimi had stolen the show, Bruce did what he does best on the big screen. Somewhere between the ugly American businessman and the tragic victim, he has displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly appealing to the public. The film itself was often interrupted by applause from viewers. The crowd was really enthusiastic with each little tour of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be an Oscar movie, but my faith was great. I highly recommend it to all fans of Bruce Campbell. Also, anyone who likes sci-fi movies campy, treat yourself and watch this. I can not wait for it to be recorded on DVD. <br /> <br /> Take it as you wish .... <br /> <br /> - the fed
