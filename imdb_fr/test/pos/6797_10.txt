Two of Hollywood's hottest stars (Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney) work together to create one of the classics of the family of all time. The story of a determined 12-year-old girl, whose adoration for horses will not allow her to turn away from her goal of winning the British National. Mickey Rooney is the newly orphaned vagabond who seeks to attach himself until he can fulfill his own dreams. <br /> <br /> A beautiful plot reveals that the girl's mother had her own girlish ambitions. Repeatedly canceling the father's decisions in favor of their bouncy daughter, it is the mother who seems to know best. The scene where exhausted Taylor rushes to school is priceless: the father protests, "Why did you let her go to school, she will be exhausted by noon!" - Do not worry, she would be back in half an hour; it was Saturday! The brilliant Technicolor, the sumptuous score, and these beautiful faces all tell a bitter-sweet story. Here is a good reason for the old adage: they are no longer like this!
