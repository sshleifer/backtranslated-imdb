I just watched this movie at the International Film Festival of Santo Domingo. Watching the movie, I felt I had already seen a film with a similar story ... a movie with Ray Liotta, but I do not remember much. Of course, this one is much more dramatic, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> This is the story: Emilio's life becomes a lie that he can no longer support. After 20 years of lying all his life to his wife, son and all the people he knows, the truth continues and there is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> Watching Emilio inventing lies is exciting and fun After a while, you're tired of the same thing ... the affair with a girl was supposed to give something, but it's not is not the case. Despite this, the film remains funny, captivating and exciting. It makes you want to help Emilio with his lies or help others catch him. I liked the analogies, the photography and the good performances. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10.
