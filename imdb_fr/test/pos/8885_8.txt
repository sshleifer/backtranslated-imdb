When I watched this movie as a child, I did not understand the principle of Hitchcock movies and black comedy. Now that I'm in my mid-twenties, it makes more sense. <br /> <br /> I think the reason I prefer this movie is that the comedy duo Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito offer an interesting comedy. , both slapstick (the scenes of the pan and the car) and verbal (the arguments / conversations about murder and writing). <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Larry Donner (Crystal), a struggling writer who gets his masterpiece stolen from him by his wife Margaret (played by an astonishing radiant Kate Mulgrew, aka Capt. Janeway of Star Trek: Voyager). <br /> <br /> As he moves from writing to writing to the teaching of creative writing, he meets a student Owen Lifts (DeVito), a budding writer and boy overgrown by his mother, unfortunately still behaves like a child. It has train rails, should I say more? Think about the failure of the launch, only Matt McConaughey is small, fat and bald. <br /> <br /> Owen is stuck in his own life, with a demanding demonic mother (Anne Ramsey) whom he can not bear. He's asking Larry for advice, and when he says to go see a movie about Hitchcock, Owen has the misconception that if he kills Larry's wife, he'll return the favor and kill his mother for him. The hilarity ensues as both try to solve each other's problem. Owen goes to extremes to kill Margaret while Larry, who refuses to accept his "share of the plan," is driven crazy by Owen's mother. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Larry and Owen form slowly but surely. a bond of friendship that is rare in black comedy nowadays. Part of the film I really liked is when Owen shows Larry his collection of coins and simply says it's a sentimental collection. <br /> <br /> Apart from the two main stars, the late Anne Ramsey is hilarious. Mom and mortal with his cane. She is much more humorous verbally and physically in this area, unlike her role as Mama Fratelli of The Goonies. She curses like a sailor and belittles his son at every turn, but that's what makes his character so alive. She makes her character the kind of person you love to hate. <br /> <br /> The music of the great jazzman Brandford Marsalis, who plays the role of neighbor and friend Larry, Lester, is another treat in this film. There's a big moment in the film where he's playing jazz for Larry, depressed and in need of good tunes to relieve the pain. Jazz can do that. <br /> <br /> In closing, I wish Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito to do another good movie together, but I'm sad to say they're getting too old for the game. That's one of those rare films where the two stars shine in a subtle way. DeVito's children's comedy and Crystal's sharp spirit made this movie for me. Comedy 5 stars.
