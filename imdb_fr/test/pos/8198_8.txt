This is an epic film about the unification of ancient Chinese kingdoms in the third century BCE. What makes it interesting is the tragic fall of the king and all the palace intrigues unfolding around him. It reminded me a bit of "King Lear" and some of Shakespeare's other plays. <br /> <br /> The king sets out with noble ambitions: to unify the kingdoms under one sovereign and put an end to any quarrel. people can prosper and lead a better life. He and his childhood love, played wonderfully by Li Gong, concoct a scheme in which she pretends to be exiled in a rival kingdom in order to recruit an assassin to kill the king, thus giving him an excuse to make war. But during his absence, the king becomes sadistic in his thirst for power and starts a killing. <br /> <br /> There are many secondary plots that keep the action going. There is the Marquis, who claims to be stupid and phantasmagoric but who is really very intelligent and wants to become king himself. He has two children with the king's mother and manages to keep him secret for years. Then there is the prime minister, the king's political rival, who turns out to be his father. <br /> <br /> The assassin himself is a complex character. Adept swordsman and assassin, it undergoes a reform when the lover of the king comes to recruit it. He does not want to have anything to kill anymore, but is finally convinced by Li Gong (who would not be?) When he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become. <br /> <br /> Spectacular images, especially battle scenes that unfold on a large scale - as they said, literally thousands of people. The acting game is OK, nothing special. This is the story that is interesting, but after two and a half hours, she pushes the limits. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth watching.
