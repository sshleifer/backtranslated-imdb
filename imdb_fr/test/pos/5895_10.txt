Thirty years before THE DEER HUNTER, this film is an excellent meditation on the effects of war on the American family, as evidenced by the heroes of the war and their wives. A really ironic title, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE is nothing, but since those times have disappeared in still images and there remains only an uncertain future for the people involved. <br /> <br /> Really an overall cast despite the top -Fair of Myrna Loy, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE focuses more on the stories of men. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons grow up, although he finds the support of his wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Upon his return, Fred Derry can not find a decent job while he is a veteran and is trapped in a marriage he does not want to Mary, a cheerful girl who wants more of life and who hates him more and more. . Homer Parrish, meanwhile, has more problems because of the loss of his hands at war and believes that the whole world - including the girl he loves and his family - think he is a monster of nature . <br /> <br /> At almost three hours long, the film never seems long and stretched. There are so many emotions that happen even in small moments that the intrigue escapes; nothing seems wasted or placed on the screen for lack of editing. This is not a performance that sounds wrong, although the main characters are Dana Andrews (Fred Derry), Harold Russell (Homer Parrish) and Virginia Mayo (Marie Derry). Even then, each character had his or her shooting moment, and it was time to talk about all the pain and suffering that had never been seen in American movies (including those around the First World War). who has these topics). Although there is never any declared violence, everything is there, in the haunted expressions of the three faces of men, in the lot where the planes reside, ready to be transformed into junk (and therefore, forgotten ), in the cynicism of shop owners who did not want to bother using these shocked men who had been at the battle or worse, to make them wonder what it was worth. This is the film in which FAMOUS and BORN THE FOUR JULY have a debt to. At a time when the United States had fled war films, it was necessary to find this solution when the end of the Second World War was still fresh was a necessity to be able to make a film more honest.
