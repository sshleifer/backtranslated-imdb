One of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers (there were a number in the 1970s). This is an accident in a nuclear reactor and attempts to conceal it. Jack Lemmon is the employee who realizes how dangerous the factory is and Jane Fonda is the television reporter who leads the crusade and takes the story into account and both players are at their best. <br /> <br /> The events described in the film are:, of course, terrifying and not at all extravagant (much of what happens here happens in real life at Three Mile Island), and well that it now looks like something of an era, it nevertheless stresses how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves. Expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming (and not waste like "The Day After Tomorrow" either).
