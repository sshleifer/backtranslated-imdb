The Centurion is one of the best cartoons of all time and it must be presented on TV and DVD so that younger generations can enjoy a show as excellent as they have produced in the last 14 years years. I have an online petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html that was originally trying to get this show five days a week, but is now trying to do it on DVD from the television channel she was focused on has bad public relations. We must all convince the owners of this show to put it on DVD so that future generations can see it. In addition, since Hasbro Toys owns the toy line of this series, we might want to try to convince them to make a live action movie, as they did with Transformers and sometime this year , GI Joe. We need good designs like this so that younger generations can enjoy it. Please, sign this petition so that we can someday have the DVDs of the famous guys for their "Power Extreme!" Cry.
