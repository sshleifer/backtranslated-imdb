It is by far one of the best films that India has made. Here are the highlights of the film ... <br /> <br /> Wonderful achievement, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the schedule of changes is excellent. <br /> <br /> Even though the film shows the lives of the Mumbai police and their difficulties, it is never boring or friendly. <br /> <br /> A breathtaking role in the actor Nana Patekar. We can surely hope that he will be nominated for the Best Actor Award for the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Controlled violence. The violence is controlled and the film does not degenerate into a bloody mess. <br /> <br /> No stupid songs like in the usual Indian movies. <br /> <br />
