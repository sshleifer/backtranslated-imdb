Especially if I can count on one hand, romantic comedy films that I have never appreciated. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is excellent as a heart transplant patient with a mysterious connection to the recently deceased woman from Duchovny. (I can think of several terrible movies that have used this story - I think there was an LMN movie with Jane Seymour) This movie, however, is a guardian. <br /> <br /> Duchovny is friendly, and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad - the dog misses his deceased wife. All his friends want him to find a replacement, and there is a fun scene in which he is blind and where Driver is the waitress. His appointment is horrible and he is intrigued by Minnie Driver. <br /> <br /> Caroll O'Connor also plays well in one of his last roles, as a grandfather with incredible femininity. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (this is the only movie I liked) complete the comic aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie because history works, it's not too romantic, and not insulting the public's intelligence. Highly recommended 9/10.
