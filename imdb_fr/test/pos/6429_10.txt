When, oh, when Anchor Bay or Blue Underground will they publish this DVD on the big screen ??? The Elm, which I know only because of my rare / vintage video collector's habit, is a film from my collection that I would not only like to watch but like to watch. The fact that Klaus Kinski is upscale, but only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (Although several comments expressed disappointment at his rather limited viewing time.) I can not say it's a good horror movie, a good mystery, an epic of science -fiction or something like that. It is simply unclassifiable in the sense of "genres". It's more like a confusing, scary (but not particularly violent or bloody) dream full of great visuals and mystery. It is based on images and emotions, a bit like "Lisa and the devil" of Bava. Both films are beautiful in almost every way, but almost impossible to describe in a logical way; they both occur in a dreamy atmosphere. Do not be discouraged by the Force Video synopsis on the back cover. It's infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. Although the version of Force Video dating from 1986 (the only one in the United States, to my knowledge) is cropped to full screen on a tape, even in this format, it is still excellent. The remastered and / or Letterboxed release would make it beautiful (index, index ... DVD companies).
