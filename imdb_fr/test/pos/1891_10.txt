I went to see this film during a book signing in Lexington, Kentucky, last night. After a wonderful night consisting of a few brief words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell), friends during the signing of the books and a QnA session with our favorite. Mortality killer the lights went out. <br /> <br /> To avoid spoiling, I will not go into details ... but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a remarkable job preserving the classic feel of the type B movie. The characters were classic "B" characters, the place was refreshing (which movies do you know that are based in Bulgaria?) And the Decor was both almost original and fun! In addition to that, the humor that reigns throughout the film has made the audience laugh for much of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have as general appeal for people as some, but is a symbol of fun and laughter in a season of (as Mr. Bruce Campbell said) "B-movies" listed as "fiction movies" (Bewitched, Dukes of Hazard, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? Come on guys!)
