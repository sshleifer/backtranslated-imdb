Even if Voskhozhdeniye was your favorite movie, it would only be possible to watch it every ten years. THE ASCENT is the story of partisans operating in the Belorussian forest in the heart of winter in the Soviet Union under German occupation. <br /> <br /> As he assaulted the public with the very physics of war experience, especially cold and snow deprivation, of the current struggle for survival against nature and fascists there is always a subtle and barely inferred subtext of moral judgment and the question of whether a man can be moral or immoral in one context but in another. <br /> <br /> A group of partisans hiding in the woods is attacked by a German patrol and loses its food supply. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish teacher, have the task of going to a small village to feed themselves. They find the village entirely burnt, with nothing edible, and nothing but charred wood and foundations in which a children's mirror hides a mirror for children. The dominant feeling is that whoever brings the brutality of war to a country and a people becomes really cursed. I was thinking of the American-British war in Iraq and the fact that publicizing the horrors of war to a people is the act of a degenerate nation. <br /> <br /> They then head to a larger village nearby. obtain, under duress, a lamb from the collaborating chef. The German arrives and the two partisans escape under fire. Sotnikov is shot down and stands up to the German as Rybak moves away with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that, ready not to be caught alive, he removes his boot to put a bullet in his head. Just then, Rybak returns and drags Sotnikov off the firing line. <br /> <br /> Rybak trailed Sotnikov through the forest, one meter per bloody meter in one take. Every meter is an agony, and yet he always pulls it in thick snow, in ridges, in depressions, on black bush stumps that crack when broken under the weight of men. There are several similarities with Tarkowsky's cinematographic vocabulary: the long documentation of a process, the effect of repetition and the resulting emotional stress, the longer the shoot. In the background, unnoticed by the action, a question is asked: Did Rybak commit an immoral act when he returned to Sotnikov? Whether it was under the moral standards of Marxist-Leninism or simply for the common imperative of group survival, was not his duty to bring food back to his hungry group and let Sotnikov cover his escape? Sacrifice a man so that the group can survive? Which leads to the following question: Can a man who is immoral under a philosophical system be moral under a different moral system? Supporters present themselves as another curse of war in a farmhouse containing a woman with three small children. She is embittered by the scourge of war and barely clings to her three children. They are hardly rested when more Germans present themselves. They go to the attic and hide. <br /> <br /> Sotnikov's cough betrays them. When a German points his head to look and no one responds, he threatens to shoot through the loft. Rybak's nerves break and they are captured. Now who has the moral responsibility here? Sotnikov to cough or Rybek to crack? The two partisans and the mother are tied up and taken to a nearby town which is disturbing under a wrought-iron arch at the entrance. They find the chief and a little girl already in custody. They are interrogated by a Belarussian coat rack played by Tarkowsky's favorite, Anatoly Solonitsyn. Sotnikov keeps his head during interrogations and tortures and asks only what was the pre-war occupation of the interrogator. He does not answer but, comfortably installed behind a desk, probably answers "teacher". <br /> <br /> Rybak, for his part, prays for his life and even proposes to join the police. The lack of character, hitherto unknown, which took a "bad" moral decision, the ambiguity (sentimentality) that has masked the judgment, becomes obvious, disturbing and very ugly. <br /> <br /> The five people are sitting in a dark cell. They are all scheduled to die the next day. From there, the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. Rembrandt's true lights and compositions are used, as are the other poses of the old master's Christ. He decides that he can save everyone if he feels guilty towards everyone. He must stay alive until morning to save everyone. He apologizes to the mother and the chief, knowing that what is happening now, does not feel the desperation to die unnecessarily as before. <br /> <br /> The morning comes. The Germans do not care whether Sotnikov or not all the sins of his companions. They will all be hanged. They climb a very steep street that is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bench is brought to the execution site which is the gateway to the city. Five strings are suspended there. The bench has only three seats, so Sotnikov stands on a tree stump that Rybak throws to the ground beneath him. They are all hanged. <br /> <br /> While Rybak goes down the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him a Judas, a useless allusion, the only misstep of Shepitko. Rybak imagines several times being shot in the back while trying to escape, dying of an honorable death and tries, unsuccessfully, to hang himself at the shithouse, but leaves with the Germans as the beaten dog he is. However, if Rybak was morally right to go back and save Sotnikov's life, is he wrong to try to save his own life?
