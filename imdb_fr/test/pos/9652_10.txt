It's the best French film of the year! I saw it twice and found it great both times. I did not think it was boring even though it was very long (3 hours). I'm seventeen, so I obviously did not experience the events of May 1968 that marked an extremely important turning point in French history, but it does not really matter because I always have a lot liked the movie. It's actually pretty universal: people of my parent's age can identify with the characters, as do people of my age. Garrel seems to understand young people perfectly, their way of thinking and the complications of love, as well as the loss of illusions about the possibility of changing the world. Perhaps it is due to the fact that the character of Louis Garrel (his son) is supposed to represent Philippe Garrel himself. Anyway, good movie, no action (you have to be honest on this point), but feelings so strong that it's impossible to remain indifferent. If you are looking for a relaxing movie on Sunday night, do not waste your time on it, you will be disappointed. But if you like cinema, you'll like Les Amants RÃ©guliers, a captivating film close to those made in the '50s and' 60s by New Wave artists.
