Seriously, any film with John Malkovich is usually very good. And that includes Clint Eastwood, Rene Russo, John Mahoney (Frasier), Dylan McDermott (The Practice) and many other great actors. <br /> <br /> Clint is aging now, but thanks to him too on his own). <br /> <br /> We are used to Wolfgang's "water films" like Das Boot, Poseidon and Perfect Storm - it was really different but just as sublimely realized. The premise of the murderer is as serious as it comes, the film is well paced, some of the violence is a bit ... But quite recommended (but not for children).
