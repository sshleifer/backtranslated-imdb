The book and the movie are excellent. They differ slightly but it improves and does not hurt what constitutes an excellent scenario and excellent acting. The historic atmosphere, the girl in search of love, the astonishing music hall background and the journey into London's lesbian world in the early 20th century make it an exceptional film. Andrew Davies as a screenwriter excels by writing this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both excellent actresses and give the best of these pieces. The rest of the cast is very good. If there were more than 10 out of 10, I would give it!
