The film is an introduction to what really happened in Phenix City. I am a grandson of people who have really lived history. The truth has never been revealed to my knowledge. I tried to find the whole story, but the people who lived it are always afraid to tell it. Phenix City is always run by crooked people. Albert Patterson was not quite the saint that history wants you to believe. The story was filmed in Phenix City. It still contains some of the famous sites that you see in the movie. The Colonal funeral home always looks the same. But if you want to know the real story of Sin City, you must visit us and find people ready to talk to you about My beachies and their kindness. She did not get the name of mom for nothing.
