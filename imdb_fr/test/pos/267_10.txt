After seeing The Lost Child several times since it was released in 1995, and reading the reader's comments (mainly on Jane Tennison's background and Helen Mirren's superb role), it seems to me more than ever before that no commentary is Robert Glenister plays the brilliant role of Chris Hughes. Even after 10 years, it remains one of the most credible means of portraying the complex personality of an abusive child, bearing the weight of his own past. Watching the episode for a full hour and a half makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hatred for this guy, in which hatred prevails because of the severity of his actions. I have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor, but this one never fails to make the biggest impression possible. Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors by her side. Praise Robert Glenister!
