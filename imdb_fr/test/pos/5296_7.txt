Inspired by Disney's Little Mermaid, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is the master of Japanese animation, Hayao Miyazaki's next great work after the well received Spirited Away in 2001 and Howl's Moving Castle in 2004. In Ponyo , his style Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), the main role of the film, discovers a "goldfish" trapped in a glass jar while playing at the edge of the sea at the foot of the cliff. He stays with his mother, Lisa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) above him. Sosuke shakes the jar forcefully to try to get the "goldfish", but the little "goldfish" is stuck. He then tries to take it out but he just can not come off. Sosuke then places the pot on the ground before breaking a small rock on it, instantly breaking it into pieces while inflicting a small cut on his finger. He then checks with curiosity if the "goldfish" is still alive. As he watches, the "goldfish" react by suddenly licking the blood off his finger. Excited, Sosuke rushes home and puts the "goldfish" in a small bucket of water in the hope that he can survive. That's what he did and he named it "Ponyo" (Yuria Nara). <br /> <br /> The scene above would indicate what will happen for the rest of the movie. These are the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo. And Hayao Miyazaki meticulously illustrated. He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of children's behavior before describing this chemistry of communication between the two main characters. The children's behavior would also be reflected in the rest of the film during new encounters. <br /> <br /> The affection between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progressed from the time Sosuke brought Ponyo to school in Lisa's car. The best time came when the two men were reunited after a brief separation when Ponyo's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), a magical sea dweller, reconquered the wandering ponyo before wrapping it in a magic bubble with a benevolent intention. <br /> <br /> Fujimoto, who was once a human being, grew up to refer to men with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing his life. But all that Ponyo wants is to be human and to be with Sosuke. She escapes for the second time, accidentally emptying her father's precious magical elixir stock into the sea, creating a tidal wave storm and engulfing the small town at the same time. <Br/> <br /> The following are the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded city. <br /> <br /> Is there a happy future in this one? Would true love win? You will know it. <br /> <br /> Looking at the art of Ponyo on the cliff at the seaside, there seems to be a deviation from Miyazaki's past works in terms of rendering. This seems unfamiliar, as the environment, with the exception of the characters in play in each scene, is not colored in the usual way, as in Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). The aesthetic appeal is deduced from what appears to be colored pencil drawings. Objects and characters are not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> This is particular if you take it in the face, but from the way the story is written and told, the possible explanation is that Miyazaki allows the audience to watch the movie with the hue of a child, while allowing adults to remember Japan when they were younger. This gesture could have prevented potential viewers, new to Miyazaki's work, from seeing him. The trailer did not help promote Ponyo either. Admitting the case in Japan, however, would be another story, because Miyazaki's skills far surpass all marketing techniques. <br /> <br /> In short, everything is not equal to its parts. Aside from Miyazaki's ability to mount animated and lively characters, the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder compared to previous works, resulting in a lack of presence on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke have failed. Brighten up the film dramatically, but moments of warmth, kindness and love can still be found by recognizing that the film is not for kids, but for the kids that everyone is or has been.
