I loved this film! <br /> <br /> Films and plays fulfill their function when they expose social, political or other problems that affect the majority. This film served this purpose. <br /> <br /> I identify with the plot and I know people to whom it happened. At the time this film was shot, the concepts presented in this film were advanced to the public, but had already passed to friends of mine through people in important positions. And I know what it's like when people do what they did to Angela Bennett, because they did that to me. <br /> <br /> I really liked the portrait of Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx of Sandra Bullock. She is a beautiful, intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid fooling around, to fight for her mental integrity and to recover her life, and to try to protect those she love. Losing one's self-concept and succumbing to this age-old attempt to build a weakened self-esteem by engaging in sex with a stranger added a poignant touch of reality. <br /> <br /> The culmination of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind of problem.
