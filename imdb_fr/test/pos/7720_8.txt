This film tells the story of a young Indian who comes home one day and finds himself betrothed to a woman. The problem is he's gay. In order to stop the marriage without telling his parents that he is gay, one lie leads to another until he becomes uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> This film is hilarious and made me laugh a lot. Sally Bankes' game is superb and she embodies this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is also exceptional. I find the plot very realistic and I can perfectly identify with the feeling of being terrified, worried and upset by Jimi. On the other hand, Jimi's boyfriend, Jack, gets a lot less attention in the movie. I would have liked him to receive more lines in the movie and to develop more characters. However, as I suppose the director wants to make this film a more traditional film, the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the film. <br /> <br /> It's great to watch an affirmative gay movie. Moreover, this film preaches us to accept the difference of the others, that it is the sexuality, the culture or the way of life. This film makes the viewers reflect. <br /> <br /> We need such films to give us a boost. Thank you for making this movie!
