Long before Terri Schiavo spoke about life as a "vegetable", "One Day in the Death of Joe Egg" addressed it. Alan Bates plays Bri, a teacher whose daughter is almost completely red. He and his wife Sheila (Janet Suzman) are trying all kinds of dark humor to try to continue their lives, but they can not escape the facts. At one point, they even consider euthanasia. The question that surrounds them and their friends is: what will ever become of this situation? <br /> <br /> With this film, Alan Bates continues his series of very good movies, preceded by "Zorba the Greek", "The king of hearts" and "The repairer". We can safely say that we will miss him very much.
