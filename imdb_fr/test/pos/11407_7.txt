If you have already babysat in a house that you did not know, or if you have seen the original and have enjoyed it, it will be a good choice. Ignoring the reviews and what was posted here, I went ahead and rented this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teenager. This movie has (of course) changed some of the original story to connect with today's teens, as the babysitter is struggling to use her cell phone for a few minutes and needs to do some work babysitter to pay her bill. However, it sticks pretty well to the original story. If you can relate to the babysitter, do not know the house and that's usual, it's pretty surprising. When the murderer is shown, he is very scary and you end up screaming at the girl to "get out of the house". If you have never been babysitting or if you have been in a situation like this, you probably will not understand and love it. It's about understanding his fear.
