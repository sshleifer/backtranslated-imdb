In 'Hoot', Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the newcomer to school who has just left Montana. But Florida is very different from Montana. Despite his difficulties to melt, Roy discovers a more serious problem. A new franchise restaurant is coming into town and the burrowing owl families are having problems. The new kid, a tomboy (Brie Larson) and a fugitive (Cody Linley) can they prevent big companies from destroying the homes of these owls? <br /> <br /> This film was pretty good. The children (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the real stars of this movie. Luke Wilson (Delinko officer) is fine, but really does not have a big part. Robert Wagner (Mayor) and Jimmy Buffett (Mr. Ryan) either. <br /> <br /> It was nevertheless a fun movie that will please the whole family. For a new producer, I thought Jimmy Buffett had crafted quality work. Plus, the owls were really cute.
