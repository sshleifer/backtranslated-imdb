Critics say this film is one of the worst ever. Observers also claim the same thing. But there is a setback to this piece. They are wrong, very wrong. It's the smartest movie I've seen in ages ... <br /> <br /> From start to finish, you see an unrealistic story. A story that reflects the real world. This film is like a mirror. You see yourself in another way that people see you. To understand the point of view of the director, you have to see it another time ... <br /> <br /> When you see this movie ... Try to understand the story (and look at the background) .. Listen to the lyrics of the music ... And feel the industrial complexes ... <br /> <br /> This film is unique in its kind. You will hate it (most people will) or you will like it (and you will understand it perfectly) <br /> <br /> Ernest Hemmingway once said: "The world is a beautiful place and it is worthwhile to fight for him ". I agree with the second part.
