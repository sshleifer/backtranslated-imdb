I always thought that Ms. Merkerson never had a role that matched her skills. Familiar with millions of people under the name of Lieutenant of Law and Order, she has been seen in numerous theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. HBO's Lackawanna Blues changes the game and allows this talented actress to shine as a Nanny, a successful entrepreneur in a changing world, from segregation to integration. But the story is actually about the wide array of colorful characters she and her adopted son meet at a boarding house in Lackawanna, NY, in the suburbs of Buffalo. <br /> <br /> The story could take place in any big African country. - American community of the 50s and 60s, from Sweet Auburn in Atlanta to Harlem in New York. But the angle of segregation-integration is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful life of the people at Nanny's pension. The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all kinds of people, performed by some of the best actors in the industry (I have purposely omitted to say black actors - this set is an awesome set of black talents, with the exception of Jimmy Smits, of course) I recommend this film as a fun and colorful look on a bygone era.
