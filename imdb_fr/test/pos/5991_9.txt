This film is a hard jewel to find! This is the story of Juliet, a very ordinary maid who works in the big office of a yoghurt company, and Romuald, her president. He does not pay attention, he does not pay attention to anyone before several plots to tear his company, all struck at the same time. He is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliet. As a housekeeper, no one pays attention to her, so she says and does incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to grab and use to help her defenseless and defenseless boss. The complications are wild, she is not as ordinary as she seems with five children of five different ex-husbands who are always madly in love with her, and he is not as smart as he thinks. This film does not follow a predictable path and it allows you to watch. The acting is superb and there are also very moving moments. The working class displays more wisdom than its superiors, almost in the same way that "Gosford Park" has shown that the upper part of the crust is not quite slotted to be mentally sound. I highly recommend this movie. To see him! 9/10
