It's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the role of the main role, it has a solid playing quality of both the male lead roles and the female lead role, and although the story is a bit long and a little clich√©, you can not help but love it. <br /> I think the story was a little hasty at the end, but that would have prolonged the story. Superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with Mr. arrogant and possibly tied with my friend tutor. <br /> <br /> This would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as great as my impertinent, but nevertheless good girl.
