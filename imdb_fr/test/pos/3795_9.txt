Telling the story would not be the goal at all, is it? Barnens ö, spelled almost as "booné aww" is the title of this brilliant novel of the late 70s that shocked many people, including myself. <br /> <br /> Children's Island is the title and what island. In the book, Raine, the main character is The Guinness World Record Book. And he likes to create new records himself. In particular, the youngest person immersed for three minutes. <br /> <br /> The story is, like most Swedish films and books of the time, profound, deliberately provocative and inspiring. Bergman was starting his latest film and Cries and Whispers was just out. the expectations for any Swedish film were quite high. They taught us that the great theater, the great actors, the superb authors and the talented directors formed a real team of perfection in the cinema. <br /> <br /> That said, Barnens Ö is a story of discovery. It is also a story of alienation: the cities are alienated and one of them makes us strangers to most of its inhabitants. It's a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. It is a film of overwhelming hope and despair. Feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and isolation of a world that does not care about it ... <br /> <br /> This approach, in itself, is a rather difficult way to weave a compelling story. Here, Kay Pollak's masterly advice on Ola Olsson's PC Jersilds novel script transforms it not only into a possibility, but into one of those masterpieces of cinema. <br /> <br /> I can disagree a little with someone who said that work was almost forgotten. It's not. Even as I write this in 2009, discussions about the history of P C Jersild are being conducted around the world, and the film is being shown in many film schools and small theaters. <br /> <br /> Why? To wax philosophically about all this would be difficult and many have already done so in a scientific way by writing and giving lectures. Barnens Ö was a special story, it is the feeling of well-being that you feel from the beginning when you discover that everything is said through the eyes of a small child. And that's where it ends too. Maybe it's a clinical view, as someone pointed out. But deeply disturbing, moving and satisfying. The concept is profound: as long as we do not have pubic hair, we can still live an extra day like an angel. After that, we will become what Raine reflects as a colophon of his experiences: "Men are pigs". He finds his fears when he is afraid of nothing. He finds love when the world collapses around him. He discovers a reason not to behave like the big ones because he abstains from committing crimes. He has abandoned his inner purity and unreserved trust in others just to learn how bad a man's soul can be. <br /> <br /> Where love is expected, he finds hatred. Where compassion is needed, he finds suspicion and cold hearts. It's a film of metaphors. A film to reflect and ask questions difficult to ask but more difficult to answer. <br /> <br /> In the end, the satisfaction of seeing such a superb job (which has really raised the bar for any other Swedish film afterwards) is a walk of joy and hope. Know that it's a movie full of the dark side of our nature. But, alas!, A film of hope and deep joy. Queen will always remain an island in Stockholm, but we have the great hope to live fully today, even when we have discovered our first signs of sexual maturity.
