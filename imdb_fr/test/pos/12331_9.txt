You GOT to see this movie ... I saw it from my first date at the cinema, at the age of 13 ... More than 20 years in advance and I am now gay (thank you very much One Dark Night !! LOL!). This film slipped me into my childhood (the mausoleums are still!), But as an adult, the thrill of this film is not in the story, but rather in the hysterical laughter he holds. The names of the teenagers are called, from "nerdlebrain" (my favorite) to "turkey". Also keep your eyes on the scene where Carol (the blonde head-sister) is trying to hang up her phone on a soda can (I can not believe they have not filmed it yet!) ... Other highlights include Adam West's dramatic bursts and gooey corpses. If you are a fan of real horror, I would suggest this film simply because, for me, it's almost a parody of horror. There is def. a scary factor and the plot is a good one, but do not look at it if you want to be afraid of your mind (unless you are like 10 years old or something).
