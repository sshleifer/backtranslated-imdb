"Nuovomondo (2006)" (in the United States under the name "The Golden Door") was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This film is different - and, I think, better - than most of the films about the poor who leave Europe to come to the United States. <br /> <br /> The film begins with scenes in a poor rural area of ​​Sicily We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island, but you will not really understand the implications of this sentence until you see the first half hour of "The Golden Gate". <br /> <br /> The central part of the film is dedicated to the long trip to the United States. Most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the Third Class section falling sick, then show us the Statue of Liberty. Not this movie - we have a sense of life under bridges, and it's not charming. (We never see the Statue of Liberty either.) <br /> <br /> Finally, the typical film will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island, then the immigrants will walk in the Lower East Side of New York. Not here - the Ellis Island experience takes about one-third of the footage. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Amato is remarkable as Salvatore Mancuso, who takes his two sons and his mother to the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is as good as Lucy Reed, a mysterious Englishman who also speaks fluent Italian. <br /> <br /> There are some strange little touches in the movie, especially the soundtrack with songs by Nina Simone. There must be some symbolism there, but I can not understand it. <br /> <br /> Another critic has already pointed out that this film would be better to be seen in a theater than on DVD. Always, big screen or small screen, it is worth looking for.
