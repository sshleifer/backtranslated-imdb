I would recommend it to anyone who is an admirer of the late John Cassavetes. And for those who have never known Cassavetes. It's an excellent movie. I really do not have time to explain in detail why this is my opinion, but if you are looking for something brave, with lots of scenes to ponder, this one is for you. Cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as is history. This "criticism" does not do justice to the film. It's an experience you have to see for yourself. A LOT OF CHARACTER. Very authentic.
