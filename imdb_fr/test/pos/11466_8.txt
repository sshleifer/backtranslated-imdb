The 80s have been invaded by all these slasher-style horror movies, so it's a relief. <br /> <br /> Ten incredibly annoying teenagers (would you like to spend time with these fools ?!))) decides to start a Halloween party in a former funeral home called "Hull House". During a "past life session", a demon is inadvertently released and each person becomes possessed and kills others. <br /> <br /> It all sounds very EVIL DEAD / DEMONS-ish, but Tenney lends a management style to debates, there are good one-liners, the music is excellent, the prosthetic makeup effects of Steve Johnson is scary and Linnea Quigley is quite amusing as a crazy boys bimbo coming out of the eyes with fingers and doing a new thing with a tube of lipstick! <br /> <br /> Have fun! After checking the distribution of the vote and other notices posted, I do not understand how it received only 4 out of 10 (?!) <br /> <br /> I give it, 8 out of 10.
