If you are one of those who think that Lucio Fulci is about blood, guts and zombies, you have to look at this (and "The Psychic", too). Even if the film includes rather brutal scenes of violence and a disturbing subject, it is not essential here. It's a truly awesome murder mystery, based on a story and a character, which could well be the director's masterpiece. Here, he proves that he is a true craftsman by creating a memorable, disturbing but strikingly beautiful masterpiece filled with frightening Catholic images and interesting social commentary. He also has a large cast, including the superb Barbara Bouchet, as well as Tomas Millan (Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. However, it is the Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also played in the strange "Lizard in the skin of a woman" Fulci) who steals the scene in the role of Majara, giving an excellent interpretation of a woman driven crazy by her superstitions and her vicious murder The scene is particularly heartbreaking. The second star of the film is Sergio D'Ofizi's cinematography, which, along with Morricone-Esquire's melancholy score by Riz Ortolani, helps bring to life the "isolated Italian village with a dark secret". I must admit that I thought that the bogeyman's head hit the rocks a little bit, but nevertheless, it's a real classic of Italian horror - a moving, sad and ultimately thought-provoking work of genius . 10/10 for me. If you liked this one, I recommend you to look at Alfred Sole's "Alice, Sweet Alice" because they are a bit similar and are both underrated gems.
