Because I like movies like "Central do Brasil" (1998), I really like "Chop Shop". There is no powdered sugar, there is no attempt to turn the lives of these people into something more pleasant or prettier. What you see is what you get, which is often difficult and sometimes heartbreaking. But that's exactly what makes a film such as "Chop Shop" so wonderful, aside from the fact that the screenplay takes place in such an elegant and subtle way. For a younger brother and a younger sister, who are about as close to homelessness as one would ever want to get, working (and living) in a car body repair shop in Queens, New York is just as fantastic. Is it a good thing or a bad thing? This is the question that this film essentially poses to the viewer. This film is really a fantastic piece of life that sometimes looks like a documentary rather than a drama, and it's a good thing because it looks and feels real. In the midst of so many current movies based on mostly surrealistic and often implausible intrigues, falling on "Chop Shop" is like finding a little gem.
