Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw this film in theaters at the relatively young age of 10 years old. The trailers on television portrayed the film as a comedy and upset my parents until they took me. After seeing the movie, I was blown away. I did not know what to think. Totally different from anything I had seen before, leaving many questions to such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I watched these films for two or three years, and I still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are at the top of their game, as a mysterious man who may or may not come from the planet and the psychiatrist who connects with him while trying to decipher his mystery. Supportive actors are also almost perfect, each resident of the psychiatric facility is incredibly convincing in his own way. The open end has been very well managed, providing ample evidence to support what you believe to have happened in the end. How this film did not receive at least one Oscar nomination this year, it's beyond me. If you have not seen this movie, go to Wal-Mart now. The DVD is usually in the recycle bin, pick it up! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
