I reviewed this title on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew, who was 17, to look at the same thing with me. I am 35 years old and he is 17 years old. He loved and me too. It's always funny, a bit childish but always very clean. Satish Shah is hilarious in many roles. This sitcom would still have better results than many recent soap operas on television. But it is obvious that some people obviously prefer the daily rates published today. It would have been nice if Shafi Inamdar had continued in all seasons. He is no longer alive today. I wish someone could list here all the episodes. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the lines "Yeh Kya Ho Raha HAi" "What a relief" "Kaat Daalu Boss" "Vyavhaar hai Vyavhaar" "30 years Ka Experience hai" <br /> <br /> and the title track, Yeh Jo hai Zindagi, teaches us to live life as it is and to fully enjoy it. The life of ordinary people. <br /> <br /> I still like this sitcom. It may not sound as funny sometimes but some episodes are always hilarious.
