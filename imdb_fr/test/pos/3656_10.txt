Between extraordinary and extraordinary scenes in a plethora of Indian places and a plot inspired by Bollywood and yet rooted in reality, this very moving film is a must for those who love romantic adventures. And by that, I mean "good", not an easy or artificial happy ending in Hollywood or Bollywood. The East meets the West in a different vision of the movie boyfriend. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematic epic and the amusing, engaging and poignant plot without the slightest trace of schmaltz or tug-of-war. HARI OM is a soft film that does not rot your teeth. To see him!
