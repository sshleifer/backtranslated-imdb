Located in the home town of Westchester PA, Bam Margera, 'Haggard' is a true story of the life of Ryan Dunn and his friends Falcone and Vallo. <br /> <br /> Dunn has been abandoned by his girlfriend for 2 years, Glauren, who is seeing a long, sticky-headed metal head named "Hellboy" and makes Dunn mad with envy. <br /> <br /> In a desperate attempt to discover the truth about what is happening between Glauren and Hellboy, Dunn asks his friends Vallo and Falcone to break into her home and produce evidence of the case, with somewhat disastrous results for all concerned! I found this film very funny, maybe partly because I am a total fan of Jackass and CKY, and it must be said that a lot of humor will probably be lost for those who do not have a prior knowledge of the comic mark of Margera insane '. <br /> <br /> The film contains many things that will be of interest to skaters, including the cameo appearance of skateboard legend Tony Hawk as a police officer. There are also cameos from Bucky Lasek, Brandon Novak, Jason Ellis and April and Phil, his long-suffering parents. <br /> <br /> The DVD includes a video of CKY (with Bam's brother on drums), and Bam's favorite band, HIM (the character of Bam in the film takes its name from the leader of HIM, City Vallo). There is also a documentary and a skit "Too hot for the moron". <br /> <br /> In summary, as I said before, this film will mainly interest skaters and fans of Jackass / CKY, but I feel that Margera and its partners have made great efforts with Haggard and I really enjoyed it.
