I remember when I saw this movie for the first time. I was babysitting for a friend of my mother and one of the kids suggested we watch it. Thinking it was the prince of the frankly laughable thieves that they slipped into the video recorder, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom. What I had was a shock, a pleasant, I admit, but still a shock. <br /> <br /> Now, you all know the Robin Hood legend, do not you? I will explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, who stole money here and there and gave it to the people who needed it, while seducing the beautiful maid Marion and scandalizing the sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John. It's essential! Now, with criticism. <br /> <br /> This film was released in 1993. It is a beginning of the legend of Robin Hood and an incursion in particular of Prince of Thieves. <BR/> <br /> According to legend, Robin de Loxley is first met in an Arab prison during the Crusades of the third century, and with a "Moor" as it was called at that time, he performs a sneaky escape with a cellmate, Asneeze. <br /> <br /> After escaping, Asneeze pleads with Robin to find his son Atchoo, a language study student in England, and monitor him. This Robin makes a wish! Robin returns to England. <br /> <br /> He returns home to Loxley Castle, where he is surprised that the bailiff has taken him to the back of the cart, and he sadly recounts that his father, his dog and his cat, and even the goldfish are all dead. Desperate to find a familiar face, he finds the faithful blind servant of the family, Blinkin, sitting on the toilet with a Braille Jazz magazine. The hilarity continues throughout the film. <br /> <br /> As with all Robin Hood stories, Robin must thwart the evil plans of Prince John and Rottingham's sheriff, who wreak havoc and levy exorbitant taxes on King Richards' kingdom. . <br /> <br /> Those who already know the films that Mel Brooks has already made will have some idea of ​​what to expect. After all, it's the man responsible for Dracula's death and loving it as well as the young Frankenstein. All the jokes, ranging from visual gags to wonderful spiritual commentaries, are exactly in the right places in the film, with never more than a minute of laughter. <br /> <br /> Cary Elwes (the only English man to have played) Robin Hood in a movie), which many of you know about Princess Bride, brings her cheeky presence to the sparkling smile with sparkling eyes in the movie and does a wonderful job. From a strange heroic posture to an incredibly sexy look, he's incredibly funny. And the man looks better by sticking than me! <br /> <br /> Richard Lewis is hilarious like Prince John, arrogant and plaintive, with an ever-changing mole. He has sissy-boy behavior thoroughly, and his American vocalisations are great. Throughout the film, a mole on his face constantly changes position: it begins on the left cheek, then on the right cheek, then on the chin, then on the forehead, before returning to its original location. This is a subtle mole-based joke about Alan Rickman when he played the sheriff in Prince Of Thieves <br /> <br /> <br /> Roger Rees in the role of Rottingham sheriff is wonderfully gooey and naughty, movie. <br /> <br /> Here you will find some faces of other Brooks films. For example, Robert Ridgely, playing hangman in this film also played Hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He also likes to add subtle references to his previous films. with many in this movie that Brooks fans will be able to easily spot. Those who watched the first part of History of the World will recognize the music of the song "Men in Tights". In addition, when Patrick Stewart arrives and annoys Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) utters the phrase "it's good to be a king", one of his lines in the History of world. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is wonderfully comical, even those with only a few lines bring them a great depth of warmth and humor <br /> <br /> What makes this film so wonderfully warm and funny in my opinion, these are all improvised scenes. Although there was a screenplay, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, like the scene where Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prays for Rottingham in his bed, and he falls by the ceiling and lands where she wanted him. was totally designed and thought by both actors. <br /> <br /> There are few special effects and the ones that there are are small fun but amusing moments of computer camera trickery. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs, and some cheese love songs. You will sing "Men in tights" or at least hum for you for weeks. <br /> <br /> The note is Pg, what I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no vulgar language in the film, except for the double meaning, and only one statement of sh! T, and the violence is minimal. In fact, I would go so far as to say nonexistent, except for some scenes of humorous fights. <br /> <br /> A very funny movie that will appeal to both adults and children!
