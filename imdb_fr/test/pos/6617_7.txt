First of all, let's say that I spent a total of about two minutes of my life on a skateboard before realizing that I was absolutely uncoordinated. I always thought it was cool to watch cats who know how to be extreme, but I have never been a skateboarder and I have never really followed this sport. That being said, I thought it was a very informative and interesting documentary. Some commentators have said that these guys somehow waved their own flag, but what's that mess? It seems to me that these guys probably deserve as much credit as anyone for helping the world of skateboarding and they have provided good pictures of their innovations to support them. It's great to see that viewers are allowed to see these guys from yesterday to today and that the images they shot as teenagers growing up in California, offer an interesting nostalgia which goes a little beyond skating. I never knew where the extreme skating came from, but this film links all the pieces together and provides us with an informative documentary. I'm sure it's at least a bit biased, but are not they all documentaries? Watch for anyone interested in sports or, as in my case, those who grew up in the 1970s.
