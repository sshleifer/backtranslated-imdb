This film is an almost forgotten jewel of 1979 which, although essentially a comedy, was based on one of the biggest hold-ups of the British banks. In fact, one of the titles by which this movie is known includes "capers", which in itself indicates the type of movie. A group of adorable reds, who are not violent or psychotic types, who, with a pensive ruse, do the hard work of their lives. To be honest, I do not really know the real crime and I can not say whether it accurately portrays the events that took place or the characters involved. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan is doing very well playing PINKY Green and is very credible as an easy-going neo-American crook who seems very comfortable with himself. I must add that sometimes American actors have trouble getting along with English actors in a British-made film, that chemistry is not always present, but that it is not a problem for Jordon, which fits perfectly to his role. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that Jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the '70s and' 80s and he never got the recognition he deserved . He seemed to be stuck in supportive roles and B-movies, not a fair representation of his ability to act. He played a corrupt policeman in THE FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE, a sadistic assassin in THE MEAN SEASON. In THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS, he played a kind of comic character of Gordon Gehco and on the TV show EQUALIZER of the 1980s, he played a good guy. All this testifies to the versatility of his acting skills, while mingling with David Niven, Kurt Russell, Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham. <br /> <br /> In this film, he effortlessly plays his role as a little crook with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and root for him from the beginning. You can not help but love Green, ?? ?? You see, he really wanted to go straight in front of him, but once the blackmail was done, everything seemed like an opportunity and at the end, he loved the thought of all that money. <br /> <br /> David Niven is the boss and The police inspector was brilliantly portrayed by Richard Johnson, who usually represented a glitzy London detective, who clearly loves his work. The other actors do not say much, but looking at them, they were all well-known British actors who often found themselves playing either bad guys or brass (is not it ironic). Elkie Sommers, Oliver Tobias do what they have to do and it's good to see Gloria Graham in a cameo role. <br /> <br /> For some viewers, especially Americans, it would seem ridiculous that someone with Greens Record could land a job in the interview. to all things a bank and come and go whenever he wants. In addition, the stunt he committed against the Crown Court after the conviction was not as absent as it may appear, in the 1960s and 1970s, security was not as tight as it was. is now. <br /> <br /> the film itself, there are some interesting observations. With a little time, the flight was too difficult. There have been other films where this is happening too, that is THE BRINKS MAT. This is not just the provision or concealment of loot, but with so many people involved, someone will be careless, chatting or just breaking once on which he relies. In addition, the authorities attach great importance to the inhabitants of the region when such robberies are committed. In addition, they say there is no honor among the thieves, but Ivan was adamant that PINKY had his shot. You had only too much to look at his eyes in the dock, if the looks could kill, a look of total betrayal! How could he have them all detox after taking care of him? You have to ask yourself a question: why can crooks be so stupid? Did Green really think he could get rid of suspicion again? Inspector Watford was not fooled at all by his innocent look, as well as by a well-constructed alibi, the whole capper felt the inner work. Plus, you have to wonder why they leave so many clues? A notebook with noted safe numbers, travel brochures for trips abroad, always leaving his telescope and unusual behavior on the day of the flight that was not a character. <br /> <br /> Sense Police Work Inspector Watford quickly measured Green, took it, and soon made it sing like a canary. It just shows that despite careful planning, things can happen very quickly, there is never a clean escape for all bodies, some will always get caught. Although it is worth emphasizing that much of the money has never been recovered. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an entertaining film, interesting shots of London and England in the late 70s, well paced, with a beautiful ending. I highly recommend it, especially if you like capers. (Note: I recently bought a DVD of this, but the transfer was taken from a VHS tape and is of poor quality, so do not pay too much!)
