I can not say how many times a line made me laugh or how many times I have described this scene to people who are not familiar with this movie. I saw her the year of her release, I was 19 years old. I do not think there were a dozen people in the East Village theater that night. For years, I thought we were the only ones to see it. It's good to see here that others have found it as hysterical as me, and that it lasts a long time despite the time. Rent it, buy it or steal it ... to see absolutely.
