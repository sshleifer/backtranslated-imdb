15 PARK AVENUE is the address "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona) is looking for starting movies. "Prof.Anu" (Shabhana Azmi) is the extremely caring and loving half-sister of the previous marriage of Mithi's mother. The film revolves around these characters and is interested in the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, chatting constantly with Anu and the others. <br /> <br /> Konkona deserves not one, but thousands of awards (which I'm sure she will get) for this interpretation of Mithi in this film. You can see the look of a patient written on his face, by the falling lips and the sleepy eyes, from the first scene. Rahul Bose did a good job, but was reduced to half of the film, despite its importance in their lives. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the intense relationships that occur between the characters in the film, Mithi & Anu, the mother of Anu & Anu and between Anu and Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). Shabhana Azmi, as usual, made a captivating performance that will be remembered as a sister, who sacrificed her life for Mithi. <br /> <br /> schizophrenic patients from a totally different angle. <br /> <br /> As usual, Aparna Sen brings the film to a different end rather than clich√©s, we might think. Hat to her for this awesome movie !!!
