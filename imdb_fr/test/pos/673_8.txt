I particularly appreciated Delly's review of this movie and I agree that Howard is not the only "damaged" character. Howard is ruthlessly "prepared" by the scenario, but there is no evidence that his previous employer was really dead or, if it is, that he murdered her. Howard does not know and neither do we. In terror and confusion as she sees the woman lying, he takes off. However, he never hurts Helen Gordon, regardless of his anger. Indeed, he reacts with horror at Helen's fainting and the fact that he is wearing a pair of scissors ... then he resumes his storage work and greets Helen with the almost pathetic "I am very tired now. I think I'm going home. " Frankly, I do not think he's a psychopath. A sick puppy, certainly, but not a psychopath. <br /> <br /> The problem with Howard is that he does not have a real masculine identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental state deprived him of a place in the army. He is singularly rootless and isolated: no woman, no girl, no home (again, at least to our knowledge). And he does a woman's job - "The soil is my specialty". Helen's niece ruthlessly removes that pride with meticulousness and fiercely exclaims that she would like a man with a real job. Moreover, although he is strongly attracted to Helen, he can not or will not do more than scare him with a strong sexual pass. He is remarkably helpless - he can not fight, he can not work, he can not make love. <br /> <br /> Helen is, however, rightly terrified. She tries to communicate with him but, finding that he does not respond normally (ie, well outside the comfort zone provided by her husband's pink memories Ned), unintentionally presses all Howard buttons lying to him in his attempt to escape. <br /> <br /> The two characters, trapped in the house, trapped in fear, neuroses, anger and memory, deserve sympathy. I know that the sudden end disappointed some critics, but I felt that everything was fine because it offered a kind of release to the characters. Helen is liberated, I think, from the past. When Howard tries the coat of her husband's army, Helen's disgusted reaction is highlighted. She no doubt feels that the "sanctity" of Ned's property has been violated, but hopefully her need to keep everything "intact" has been lost in the reality of her own struggle against danger. Maybe she can continue. <br /> <br /> Howard is also released from his endless cycle of anger, pain and violence. Whether in treatment or in prison is questionable, but I hope it is the first case. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances of Ryan and Lupino. I prefer "On a dangerous ground", but it's very good too.
