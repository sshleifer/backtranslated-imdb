Before this one, there had been burglary movies and Rififi did have an obvious influence there - but the Red Circle is more than another overcrowded film and with this film director Jean-Pierre Melville managed to create something that both amaze on the surface and give his audience something to think about. In the modern detective film, cool is just as important as firearms and gangsters, and Melville does as much with this film en masse; The tone of the film is also very relaxed and Melville allows most of the film to bubble under a cold exterior. The story has several angles, but the main character is Corey, a thief who is released from prison. His release coincides with the escape of the notorious murderer Vogel, who slips under the nose of Police Commissioner Mattei during a train ride. The first thing Corey did when he was released was to steal money from his former boss, Rico, and the second thing he did was recruit Vogel and a sniper to help him get a job done. decisive flight. But Rico and the police are looking for thieves ... <br /> <br /> The film is united by four excellent central performances. Alain Delon is calm and calculating as an anti-hero of the film, while Gian Maria Volontè is formidable in his role as an escaped assassin. François Périer is also good as a dubious club owner, while the remarkable performance comes from André Bourvil in his role of police commissioner. The film lasts almost two and a half hours and is not really a thrilling adventure. However, the director keeps things interesting by focusing the action on the important elements. The film features crime scenes such as filming, but they are kept to a minimum. The first two thirds of the film are just beginning to unfold at the end of the heist scene. Rififi was especially famous for his sequence of heist - a complex scene designed in which no one speaks a word. The holdup in this film is similar in that it is also silent, and I must say that I preferred the scene to Rififi; but Melville's talent in directing and the calm and calm manner he plays make it good. The film comes down to an exciting climax that completes the whole thing perfectly. Overall, this may not appeal to all fans of crime movies because the action is more than a little slow; but the red circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.
