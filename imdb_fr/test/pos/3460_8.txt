It is definitely a film that will make you think of the difficulties that a person can live in everyday life. The excellent interpretation of the two main roles is another illustration, and you will not regret seeing this film. <br /> <br /> It's a heartwarming story of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from a wheelchair seat. Their friendship is put to the test as well as their spirit when they are in their own apartment outside the retirement home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who likes photos with friends or who just wants to see a beautiful and comforting film that avoids all clich√©s and traps and does not get damaged once.
