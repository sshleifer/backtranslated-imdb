The reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be. A poignant story, told simply by well written dialogues, beautifully painted images, a score that sneaks seamlessly into the story and characters portrayed with thoughtfulness and grace. <br /> <br /> I saw this film at a festival of other films and interesting ideas were screened. But none of the other short films had all the elements of a great film production in a film, like The Reader. The reader caught the attention of all festival-goers in the room and immersed us for 10 minutes in the emotional life of the characters. <br /> <br /> Duncan Rogers has created a beautiful film and I hope to see more. director either shorter or maybe a feature film.
