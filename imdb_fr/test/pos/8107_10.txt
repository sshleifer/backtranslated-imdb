We have here the inimitable Charlie Chaplin who abandons his blind past to tackle the serious subject of anti-Semitism and intolerance in general. He portrays two characters - the gentle and innocent Jewish barber - a veteran, and the furious and ruthless dictator, Adenoid Hynkel. The Jewish ghetto of this country has not been safe for a long time, because of the whims of Hynkel and his armed thugs, who wave his residents or leave them alone, depending on his mood that day or this week. The barber is one of them, but his former commander, Schultz (Reginald Gardner), befriends him. It seems that the situation remains calm for a moment, until Hynkel condemns him to a concentration camp. He seeks refuge in the ghetto with the Jews, especially the hairdresser and the brave young woman, Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The premise is: who will be the one among those Jews who will put their lives in danger to get rid of Hynkel and his friends? We do not need to guess too much to know the answer; the barber is a ringer for the dictator, and he is equipped in his image, accompanied by Schultz, also in military uniform. Hannah escapes with several of her ghetto friends in Osterlich, where Mr. Jaeckel's cousin (Maurice Moscovich) has a farm and they can live in peace for a while. At this point, Hynkel himself was arrested by his armed forces, thinking he was the famous barber. The latter, meanwhile, was escorted with Schultz to a podium to make a speech announcing the conquest of Osterlich. The next ten minutes are purely Chaplin himself, speaking of his heart of tolerance, love and freedom, and denigrating greed and hatred. Although Chaplin started production of the film in 1937, we can forgive some naivety. He was apparently unaware of the seriousness of this persecution and hatred and said that if he had known the full extent of what he would have done, he would never have shot the film because he probably thought it would trivialize the situation. Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniell for Garbitsch, his aide-de-camp, the always-wonderful Billy Gilbert for Herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie for dictator Napaloni, his rival for conquest, old European actors David Gorcey (Leo's father), Maurice Moscovich, among others. The scene he choreographed with globe, with just a musical accompaniment, is pure, bright and luminous inspiration, Paulette Goddard at the end of the film, smiling through her tears. I have already seen this film, but there is always something new for me. Last night, when he finished, I sat there in tears. I challenge anyone not to be moved.
