What is there to say about this film? This film is simply beautiful. A real treat for the eyes. In the same way that the game set the standard for 3D role-playing games 7 years ago, this film sets the standard for future CG movies. Many of you have seen the trailers and the incredible details of each image. Let me tell you that this movie will not disappoint you. You can actually see the fibers in the vest of the Cloud Sweater. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. The film contains several rearranged pieces of the video game that fans will certainly recognize and appreciate. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is its story. This is not really a bad story, but this story is only for people who have played video games. Beginning spectators may sometimes feel lost or not notice the importance of certain events. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone, even if you have never played the game because what we have here is a special movie. Watch it and enjoy the beautiful show.
