Operation Scorpion (AKAThe Scorpion King) does not go into high gear for about 25 minutes, but when the action reaches its maximum speed, it offers truly amazing martial arts scenes that demand the attention of the viewer. This does not mean that the first hour is worthless ?? it seems a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Yuk-Su, a talented cartoonist who dreams of being a hero, just like the ones he describes in his films. his drawings. When Yuk-Su rescues a girl, Siu-Yu, who is sold for prostitution, he incurs the anger of his bad boss, Wa. Led by Sonny, master of the scorpion-style kung fu, Wa's henchmen sued Yuk-Su and the maid. Yuk-Su's father intervenes but is hurt. After being rescued by friendly bodybuilders, the three men eventually hide in a noodle restaurant owned by their friend, Master Yat. <br /> <br /> Yuk-Su learns how to cook noodles, but also sneaks up regularly to secretly reinforce her strengths and learn kung fu under the tutelage of Jean, the instructor of the muscular hulks who saved them. When Master Yat has to go on a business trip, Yuk-Su remains in charge of the kitchen. However, he moves on to exercise his skills with Jean, leaving Siu-Yu to serve clients. Sonny and his men visit the restaurant and, disgusted by the noodles served to them, jostle the restaurant. <br /> <br /> When Master Yat learns that Yuk-Su is sneaking, he tells her that he should have learned kung-fu from him; it turns out that Master Yat was one of the best assassins in the Triad, until he decided to try to change his habits. Under the direction of Master Yat, Yuk-Su improves his skills and even learns the art of the invisible kick! Yuk-Su finally has the chance to become a true hero when his friend Fatty announces that his cleaning lady has also been sold for prostitution purposes. With Jean, they visit Wa, who introduces herself as a French brothel guard looking for new women. When Fatty's housekeeper is introduced to them, she accidentally throws them the trick and the action finally triggers a great style. Despite his best efforts, Jean is severely beaten by Sonny and he and Yuk-Su are forced to flee. Back at the restaurant, Yuk-Su finds him on fire; and worst of all, the bad guys found Siu-Yu! Yuk Su, accompanied by Master Yat, returns to Wa's house to try to save Siu-Yu ... <br /> <br /> Despite some rather amusing training scenes, the slow progression to the last action at Wa is rather too stretched and devoid of serious fight scenes. It's a pity that the boredom was not dissipated by a decent fall halfway, rather than keeping all the juicy stuff to the end. <br /> <br /> The last fight, however, is worth the wait in the end; Won Jin gives a stunning performance like Sonny, who strikes high, sculpts, turns and pivots with incredible skill and dexterity, and Chin Kar-Lok gives a strong performance as Yuk-Su, the artist turned fighter. The lucky star Lau Kar-Leung (aka Liu Chia Liang), a former kung fu star, also plays Master Yat, proving that this old man still has what it takes to kick his ass! Although not a perfect film, Operation Scorpio has enough remarkable effects in its finale to deserve a viewing. <br /> <br /> NB. I may have misinterpreted some names. My DVD calls characters under names other than those listed on IMDb.
