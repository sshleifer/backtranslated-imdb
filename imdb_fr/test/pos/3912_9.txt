It's the ultimate horror movie this year. "House of Wax" is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. This version is really ashamed of the Vincent Price version of the movie. I only know a few of the young actors in the film. Paris Hilton always boring; the pain in you know what seems to be more seductive than ever. At least she did not try to copy his infamy. Well, if she likes to make horror, she's better than Vanna White's "Wheel of Fortune". She beats Vanna HANDS DOWN! And the scene of where "House of Wax" was made was not a joke. The house was waxed and the victims were able to get out of there before waxing like their friends. These twins Bo and Vincent (the twisted twins) were maniacs from the start. The parents raised them well, with the exception of Vincent. And I think they have become equally distorted. How come that one in the other pickup is scary, but not as bad as the other two. This is another story in the book. I guess he had to follow his heart and not the other twins who turned Ambrose into a tourist "trap" for unsuspecting victims. This film is like "The Phantom of the Opera" meets "The Rocky Horror Show". And this movie is one of the scariest of 2005! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
