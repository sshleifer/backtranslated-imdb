Cinematography is the most brilliant feature of the film. Park really knows his job when it comes to filming memorable scenes behind a camera. Each shot is filled with vibrant colors that come out of the screen. Each image of the film seems to tell a story alone. I hope this movie will be released in Blu-ray, because it will look fantastic. It is rather intriguing to see what elements of Park's vampire mythology used for his vision. Sang-hyeon needs to drink blood to survive and stay flawless, has incredible strength and is vulnerable to the sun. However, he does not have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Although I have never seen the movie, I could not help but think it was the version of Chan-wook Park. of twilight. The whole central part of the film is devoted to the reciprocal love of Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. It really looked like the adult version of Twilight. Much blood, nudity, sex and even some obscenities have been thrown out for good measure. It may be the Chan-Wook Park fanboy in me, but honestly, I feel like I can guarantee it's the best movie of the two. The psychological aspect that I like about Park's previous movies is also in Thirst. This is a major factor for me, because any movie that makes me think or that is unusual ends up becoming a fan favorite. The soundtracks of Park's movies always seem like a glove to their respective movies. Thirst is no exception. Although the soundtrack is a little more subtle this time, it is rather effortlessly suited to the general atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> The central part of the movie seemed to last longer than all the rest of the movie. It's weird, because scenes from this era are essential to the film's script and it's hard to imagine that Soif is the same movie if one of these scenes were cut. Nevertheless, it's my only piece of the movie. <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park delves into vampire mythology with Thirst and adds a dark psychological twist. Park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: excellent writing, beautiful cinematography, solid distribution, a kind of psychological diversion that will spoil your head and a memorable end. Thirst keeps her promises on all fronts and hopefully gets more attention than she deserved during her theatrical release on DVD (and possibly on Blu-ray).
