This film is one of my favorite movies and is closely related to the Christmas holidays for two reasons: (1) having grown up in the 1960s, everything was related to space, from advertising to TV shows, and even the Santa Claus found himself in spaceships during this period. era; and (2) I saw this film during a Christmas shopping tour at the age of ten and it reminded me of fond memories of my favorite TV shows when I was younger ( "Supercar", Fireball XL5 "and" Stingray ",) Therefore, I am a bit biased when it comes to this film for personal reasons. <br /> <br /> That said, as a student long-time, it's mostly a film for fans of Gerry Anderson (and Barry Gray, oh, this beautiful score!) while the casual viewer will be discouraged by the vision of the past (digging cars wild, commercial airplanes, clothing, etc.) and the so-called "bouncing plot" that will make him moan.However, if you can look beyond the "post-2001: an odyssey of the space "" desire to make a sci-fi movie with a story "out out", and if you like imaginative special effects, then you will enjoy this joya u from a time when man was walking on the moon and people were still staring at the stars with wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down at the common traps of today's 21st century.
