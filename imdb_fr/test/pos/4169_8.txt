Sensational. this film is the voice of a climbing generation. Director Sam Keith takes us into the depths of the soul of man where we find love, life and the summit. Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), exhausted by the world, follows her heart and her anchors in a cerebral journey to find reason in a post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly meets the confrontation in Don (Jason Bortz), incarnation of machismo and spirit of humanity. The epic film arrives at a turning point in a breathtaking competition that will make even the most dedicated spectators dizzy. <br /> <br /> This film has it all: Top out, Top in the gym, shorts and sleeveless flannel shirts, awesome images for climbing (some are so good you see it 2 or 3 times!), Bear and snake attacks. <br /> I gave the film 8 out of 10 because I wanted to see the romance grow a bit more. It looked like the movie was leading to a thorny sex scene between Telly and her new lover, but, alas, it would not fit into the already busy ride of an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Fans of Cliffhanger and Mission Impossible II will find that this film is a rough diamond. All in all, if you are ready to question your view of the world on humanity and climbing, this movie is for you !!! 1
