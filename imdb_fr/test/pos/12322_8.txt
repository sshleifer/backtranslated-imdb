An exquisite film. They do not do it anymore! We listened to a middle-class family in Dublin in the early 20th century. They organize a dinner after Christmas for their friends and relatives. Their conversation at the table is nothing but chatter, but it is so well written that we are captivated. Outside the table, some quality pianos can create an intimate atmosphere, as if we were there as a customer. Maybe a little too perfect for an amateur player, an error here or there would have added to the magic of this film. No real story, but real entertainment and a lesson of objects for future directors.
