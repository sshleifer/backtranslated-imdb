Murder by Numbers is a very good movie. Even if the plot is moving at a snail's pace, Sandra Bullock's character mingling with her partner and the film recalling a traumatic situation in which she was, she manages to keep the viewer involved in the film. <br /> <br /> That being said, I think he does a good job of creating this strange atmosphere of the "who did it" type. This allows you to guess when one of the boys was really behind the murder, if not both. I think Ryan Gosling and this other child (lol) are doing a good job selling this tyrannical relationship against dork. Not sure that Gosling plays badly, but for a guy who would later play in a film like The Notebook, he did a really good job. Once the movie started, however, I really got involved in the story, asking myself somehow, "Oh my God, what would I do if I were in this situation?" As I said, it's a good CSI movie, maybe not for the EXTREME crime drunk, but a good film all around. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
