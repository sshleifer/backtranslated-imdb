Viewers often say that good movies must have 3 memorable scenes to be considered really great. Broadcast information does not have three, it has two. This movie is extremely well written by <br /> <br /> James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been <br /> <br /> better. I like this movie for several reasons. It's great because it makes you laugh and makes you cry. Albert Brooks has <br /> <br /> several great lines and many unforgettable scenes: # 1 (laugh) "I can <br /> <br /> sing and read, I sing while I read" with Midnight Train <br /> <br /> Georgia playing in the background. # 2 (laugh) Tell William Hurt <br /> <br /> character that "You really blew Nookie's lid", <br /> <br /> after watching Hurt's report on rape to date. # 3 (cried) When Aaron <br /> <br /> (A. Brooks) finally tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and that she <br /> <br /> can not find herself with the character of Hurt because Jayne finds that everything is present in the journalism <br /> <br />. Finally, # 4 (laugh) who can forget the scene where Aaron <br /> <br /> anchored the weekend news .... hilarious. This film should have won an Oscar! He has everything I love in movies, an excellent rendition, an intelligent storyline and even a Jack Nicholson cameo <br /> <br />!
