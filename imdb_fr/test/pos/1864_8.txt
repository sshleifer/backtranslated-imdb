Wow! Fantastic film in my opinion, I did not expect it to be so good! I was captivated from beginning to end. It's a very well done and educational film that gives us a fascinating insight into the trials that Darwin had to go through to get his ideas across the world, telling his life as he wrote "Origin of the Species" ; fight both the personal demons and the ignorant society of the time to do it. He is struggling hard with his mind, body and mind as personal problems come to their breaking point and even his family seems to be running away ... while the rest of the world stands against him when he knows that his discoveries literally shake the very foundations of their lives. life, culture and sense of existence. It's a subtle film (it's a British film produced by the BBC, not exaggerated in the same way as in Hollywood, but with a very strong meaning thanks to the incredible, well-directed scenes and the superb interpretation of Bettany Connelly plays a rather supportive role, but I liked her a lot and she lived up to what you'd expect, her chemistry alongside her husband was really strong and endearing, you could feel the bond and their real husbands The woman / woman bond shines through their performances, but the star of the show is without a doubt Bettany and he does a brilliant job, a very touching performance, I understood and sympathized with him then that he was fighting against his own degrading health and impending "madness" to try to understand what he had discovered and discovered, to come to terms with all he thought and what he actually thought was to contradict his and found himself in the process of losing everything, including his wife, who was of course a fervent believer in religion and a strict Christian, while in the realm of science, Two worlds that did not see each other not, so their relationship was also at stake. <br /> <br /> Anyway, an emotional drama really very good, well played and I dare to say that I shed a tear at the tragic climax which was truly heartbreaking and beautifully poignant and moving. The film is also symbolic and very artistic. In fact, I can not wait to see him again because there was a lot to catch for the first time, which I missed. One of the best movies I've seen this year.
