Shameless Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I think) DVD label, specializing in crapulous and excessively violent cult movies ?? mainly Italian - glorious times when everything was possible, from the late 60s to the mid 80s. The selection of the brand looks like a cross between the works of "Mondo Macabro" and "No Shame" ( they have probably borrowed the name of the latter) and they have already released very rare Italian puppies like "Ratman", "My Dear Killer", "Killer Nun", "Ghost of Death" and "Chest". "The frightened woman" was completely unknown to me, but since other critics, whose opinions I attach great importance to, she describes it as one of the greatest and most fascinating psychedelic films euro-sexploitation of her time, I did not hesitate to pick up. This is a very strange movie and probably not suitable for about 99% of the average audience who loves cinema. However, if you are part of the remaining 1%, you expect a truly unique treatment. The style, atmosphere and content are similar to those of Jess Franco's "Succubus" and Massimo Dallamano's "Venus in Furs". They are widely regarded as classics, while "The Frightened Woman" is virtually unknown. It's all about profile and good marketing, I suppose. The story tells the story of a rich and disgusting doctor (he lives in a gigantic isolated mansion, owns several vintage cars and has a very impressive collection of artistic relics, including a life-sized model doll replica, with a weird and slightly shifted attitude towards women.He considers them a threat to the survival of the male race and spends his days to kidnapping, the hateful and sexually abusive he picks up in the street.Sayer Sayer then kidnaps the journalist ambitious Maria in order to completely break her feminine spirit, but it slowly falls for her.Just that he begins to believe in love, she takes revenge.This is really not for everyone, but if you can enjoy sexy and sinistically sexy atmospheres, weird landscape toys and psychedelic touches that seem quite improbable and surreal, you can z consider it as a recommendation of choice. It's slow, elegant and totally crazy ?? Entertainment shameless, okay!
