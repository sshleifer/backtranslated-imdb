From the same partnership between Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner who produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk (deceased) - the latter was renamed My Partner The Ghost for the US Market - Department S remains a classic example of the action-adventure series produced by the UK in bulk at the end of the 1960s. Like these two series, its internal dynamic consisting of two guys and a girl may seem to indicate a progressive attitude to equality (Dept S also has a black superior) , but it's mostly a facade: the launch of "Six Days" is just halfway Before Rosemary Nichols is invited to scroll in bra, panties and stockings (yes, a stockings) to get out a shady situation. It's still an interesting time capsule, even if the awful sense of fashion of Peter Wyngarde's character (who, surprisingly, has degenerated into the Jason King spin-off series) should have been buried.
