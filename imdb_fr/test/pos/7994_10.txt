I always thought that Batman's return was a nice sequel to Batman. The story was interesting and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave excellent performances. In addition, Tim Burton was a genius and made the cartoon character fairer than Joel Screwmacher had ever done. his parents as a child for being deformed. He uses this as an excuse to hide a grim plot to kidnap Gotham's first children with the help of his henchmen (Red Triangle Gang) and a very suspicious mogul, Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later made Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed by a window by Max Shreck and is rekindled by cats. Later, she develops cat qualities and seeks to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. His reasons for wanting to destroy the black knight are not explained. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. The atmosphere is darker. Tim Burton has always been chic to make sinister backgrounds attractive. Micheal Keaton is still as alive as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have been a better violator for the movie Spawn than John Leguizamo. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry could ever have. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason I love Batman Returns is its pleasure. It's not only creative but it's also fun. Many big budget movies are sorely lacking nowadays. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton has decided not to do any more. You do not believe me, look at Batman Forever, Batman and Robin. Thank goodness, Christopher Nolan brought the series back to life with Batman Begins.
