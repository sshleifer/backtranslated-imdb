The revelation here is Lana Turner's dance ability. Although she was known privately for being an excellent disco and ball dancer, Miss Turner rarely had the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film. <br /> <br /> So, viewers take note! Here, the MGM was clearly trying to determine in which direction she was going to develop the young starlet and therefore recorded everything from Andy Hardy to Dr. Kildaire. <br /> <br /> In "Two Girls on Broadway" "However, she has a great opportunity to show her natal rhythm and her ability to change tempo in the lavish production number," My Wonderful One, Let's Dance This issue is conceived and filmed as a kind of hybrid between Busby Berkely extravagance and the kind of routines that Hermes Pan had designed for Astaire and Rogers at the RKO. <br /> <br /> The number s George Murphy and Miss Turner represented the clients of the bar (with a complete chorus) in front of a curtain of lame black in which Mr. Murphy was handing the number to Miss Turner, then the camera (on an arrow) retreated into a remarkable shot to reveal a huge stage and a rotating set with steps, columns, fences and sliding walls. <br /> From this point, Murphy and Turner perform a wide variety of moods and attitudes, including lifts, spins, soup shoes and ends with an electrifying series of twirls that end when Murphy raises and rotates Turner at an exhilarating speed for a racing band. > <br /> All this in a vertiginous feat that proves that Miss Turner was quite capable of doing better than fending for herself as a dancer, although most of her admirers are reluctant to abandon her from her throne. as queen of melodrama.
