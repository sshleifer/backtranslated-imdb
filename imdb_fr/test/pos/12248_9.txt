I did not really like "As Good as it Gets", but I'm a big fan of the work of William Hurt and Holly Hunter, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most surprising thing for me was the great work of Albert Brooks. Here in Spain, he is little known and is only a 2nd division version of Woody Allen on the west coast. He played a big role, but Hunter and Hurt were good too, especially Hurt, in a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played the role that reminds me a bit of his role in "Once Around" (Lasse Hallstrom, 1991). <br /> <br /> Finally, the rest of the distribution is excellent too. Robert Prosky, one of those familiar faces of American cinema, the former girl of links, Lois Chiles, is well enough placed to play this role, I think, the always perfect Joan Cusack in her youth; and especially the brief overview of Jack Nicholson. It may not have a good scene, but it's Jack Nicholson, anyway ... James L. Brooks' best film, beautiful story (well resolved) and superb casting for one of the best movies of 80 years
