Really a wonderful movie. Bruce Willis gives his always-exceptional comic-romantic actor power to this movie-message and the film gives hope to the losers that many of us know we are. A gift for all middle-aged people whose past time seems both full and empty: there's more at the next turning point and it can be awesome, rewarding and romantic. Leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past, then embark on a favorite flight to your best future. If we could relive our youthful experiences, if we could really remember the events that shaped us, would not we find a special kind of freedom? See the movie, open the gift.
