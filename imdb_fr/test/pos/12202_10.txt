I thought it was a very good TV series and I would like to see it continue. It was really interesting in the end and I really want to see where it's going. Sometimes we have to kill a series without giving it a chance. I think this one needs a chance to continue, and I will certainly expect it. The ocean is one of the places that man knows so little and I think it's a mystery in itself. What awaits us under the waters of the world. It is even said that man may have crawled or disappeared thousands of years ago. Is this a new evolution coming? Are we going to move in the food chain or fight for our position?
