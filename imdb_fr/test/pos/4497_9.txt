I did not read the novel on which the film is based. I can not comment on what is missing or if changes have been made. <br /> <br /> As I said above, I had a great experience watching THE KITE RUNNER .. I find that when I see movies about other cultures than here in the US United, I am learning how other peoples live and exist. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film come from Afghanistan and other countries in the region. There are 3 young children in this almost epic movie in their leading roles. They were wonderful. <br /> <br /> The scenes that were supposed to be in Kabul were shot in different parts of China, I guess the area looks like the actual places in the book. <br /> <br /> Mark Foster directed & he FIND NEVRRLAND, he created the same magic here. <br /> <br /> All aspects of production are first rate. <br /> <br /> I think this film is better than those nominated and wins Oscars. <br /> <br /> The film is subtitled, it is very clear to read. It has an appropriate PG-13 rating. SPOILER ALERT --- The child rape scene is very well managed. <br /> <br /> I can not, however, give him 4 stars as a general scenario and scenario we've seen over and over again, Non-the- less this is a very interesting movie to watch .. <br /> > <br /> Notes: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
