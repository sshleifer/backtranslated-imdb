I caught this film in my eyes as I passed a poster room in the nearby cinema. The slogan was a bit confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought it might be similar to National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. This film pleased me. In addition to having a huge collection of such genres, I decided to transfer it to the cinemas just after my exams to get a release of tension. <br /> <br /> Deliciously, I smiled from cheek to cheek and also had a great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie. Amanda Bynes certainly launched better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being both actor and actress is certainly not easy, especially to face the similarities of life and the reactions to which the actress must react. This film requires a lot of confusion to baffle themselves and us, spectators. This film is the only way to succeed. <br /> <br /> The head director is obviously hilarious and sickly, the girls are just as sexy and beautiful as the actors. I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a relaxing weekend and do not worry, you'll laugh all the way through the movie. This is a definitive guarantee.
