Watching this film for the first time, this film seems to be a kind of fairy tale about a magnificent and considerably white horse, which we have never seen and never forgotten. However, seen strictly in the context of history, the implication is that to survive in post-civil war America, you had to have a horse and not an old man, but a very good horse. And the wing of the eagle is such a horse. But for a man, being worthy of such a horse is another matter. Who should own it? The Native American or the soldier AWOL? Throughout history, primitivism is opposed to civilization. As has been said by other commentators, it is ironic that it took an English director to perceive this fact, then to develop this simple theme into a western that is unlike any other you would never see again. . The film focuses on this beast and the harshness of the environment and the people who live on it. The photography and the soundtrack are exquisite. The performance of Martin Sheen is a revelation. This film, released the same year as Sheen's other great film, such as Willard in "Apocalypse Now", alludes to his abilities that, one way or another, have never been left so free . More is pity. A comparison of the two stories reveals surprising similarities, notably that the two films trace the journey of a man in his soul in order to find redemption. While Willard is redeemed, I leave the choice to the viewer to decide if Pike will eventually be. The end is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving; be warned. In short, it's an extraordinary film.
