While it's not as funny as "Chicken Run," Wallace and Gromit's new comedy "Curse of the Were-Bunny" (*** on ***) produces more laughs than most action comedies real. British director Nick Park, who created characters Wallace and Gromit, and co-director Steve Box rely on the old-fashioned, stop-motion animation method - better known as claymation - for create several visually adorable characters Dreadful scenes on a monstrously mutant hare want to devour all the vegetables in sight. As amusing as its whimsical story is, the heart of hilarity lies in the imaginative way in which Park and society have meticulously constructed characters and gags from a brand of plasticine called Plasticine. Basically, every shot you see in "The Curse of the Were-Bunny" required a patient soul that slightly modified the clay characters for a series of individual plans that merged into a true montage of joy. Hollywood pioneered as a form of animation in silent films of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. The animators at Aardman Studio were able to produce about three seconds of usable footage per day. For the record, it took five years to make "The Curse of the Were Hare". The lumpy characters, with thumbprints in their respective shades of clay, are incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and mouths too biting. It is interesting to note that Gromit appears as the most funny character, an adorable pooch with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face that says more than most characters who speak. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are respectively master and cabot. As the human half of the duo, Wallace is an idiot homily who manages to build machines that do pretty incredible things. One of the most amusing scenes shows the master and the doggie awakened by a system of chutes, traps and spring gear that dress them and feed them. Meanwhile, Gromit is the animal half. The joke is that Gromit shows more common sense than his master genius. As good as his ideas and inventions are, Wallace could not succeed without the loyal Gromit who gives him a hand. Our heroes run a pest control company called "Anti-Pesto". For the most part, they have to protect every vegetable garden for miles with a device called Bun-Van 6000, which literally sucks rabbits into a huge glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit do not kill the critters. Instead, they keep them as pets and Wallace experiments with an invention: Mind-O-Matic - designed to convert hares into enemies of the carrot. This approach "Frankenstein" and "The Fly" plunged poor Wallace into big trouble when he exchanges fragments of his brain with that of a rabbit. Shortly after, a mysterious terror dominates the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the 517th Annual Vegetable Contest approaches. <br /> <br /> A Grand Day Out film school project (1989). Since then, Aardman has released ten other animated shorts, including "Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave" (1993) and Wallace and Gromit: Oscar Winning Counterpants "(1995). The first two-thirds of "Were-Rabbit" contain better gags than the last third, but Park and the company never miss an opportunity to slip into a joke to adults that children will not understand, but that attentive adults will appreciate. "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Bunny" is a fun game.
