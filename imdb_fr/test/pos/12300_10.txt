I saw this film for the first time in Austria during its first release and it spellbinding me. It is an exciting and deeply moving work that should be experienced by all cinematic art connoisseurs. What a shame it has never been published in DVD format. Perhaps one of these days will be rectified, because it would be a shame if one of the best films ever made is forgotten and left forever in a movie box. <br /> <br /> Why 'B' movies like 'American Wedding' and 'Eurotrip' have big-screen and full-screen releases, and often a special edition with lots of commentary and extras, while some of the world's best art like 'The Dead' are simply forgotten?
