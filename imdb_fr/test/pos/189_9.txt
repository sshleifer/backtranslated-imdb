It's a fantastic movie. The acting game is one of the best I've seen. Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful and she automatically takes you to the film with her credible acting. Cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. Looking at it, I could see the parallels of cinematography used today. It's really a revolutionary film. Due to the cinematography and acting of the actors, the audience can feel the change of tone from beginning to end, as the tone of the film environment changes. It's a very touching and powerful piece. My friend told me that it was to see and I totally agree with her. It's one of those movies you watch and never forget. Everyone should see this extremely moving film. This should be put on the list "Movies to see before ________" (everyone).
