For anyone who has ever searched for happiness, "Half Empty" is a must. This original multicultural musical has hilarious numbers, giving "The Producers" a boring look. Writer Bob Patterson is committed to sharing his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, and even writing inspiring comments on cards while his girlfriend gives him his heart and ends their relationship. When his book on happiness, "North Star" does not meet any success in the United States, his publishers send him to Germany for a book signing tour. While explaining their decision to Bob, the meeting room sings a catchy song that would make Monty Python proud. Since his arrival in Hamburg, Bob's total ignorance of German has put him at a distinct disadvantage. However, he continues to play, insensitive to the sincere feelings of his hosts, until the arrival of a devoted fan in his own way that changes everyone's reaction to him. in the precision of the lateral division. The actors, led by Robert Peters, have an extremely dry sense of humor and live as if they were not playing. See for: A case study on irrelevance of good intentions; How are the Americans perceived without mercy abroad? How many reasons it takes to start singing and, above all, for a silly, fun and unconventional laugh.
