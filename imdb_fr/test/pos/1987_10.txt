The producers of this image are Hungarians. It is not by an artist's fool that X and Z are capitalized in the titles, knowing that the word "isten" means "god" in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word that means God in Hungarian ... - Hum ... Is that right? <br /> <br /> Consider this film as a sci-fi brother "A story of violence". Both films have the strength to explode the respective genres; thriller and drama in that of 2005 and science fiction 'without FX-ed as hell' in the one we are currently examining. Everything he did has a meaning and is surrounded by details: a nod to Phil K. Dick (who wrote "In Perky Pat's Days") by creating a fast-food restaurant "Perky Pat". A nod to Stanley Kubrick using the 2001 naming model; IBM became HAL (a letter in the alphabet) in the 1968 film, in the eXistenZ WD-40 "classic lubricant spray", turns into XE-60 (a letter) when Allegra cleans Pikul's port. Make a wink to David Cronenberg using the clever Videodrome formula ('Death to ...' & 'Long Live' ..) and taking another medium as the central theme of an image (television in Videodrome, video games and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983, you entered a television, then in 1999, a game. Welcome to Canada! <br /> <br /> A nod to good taste by getting the Peter Suschitzky's cinematography, Howard Shore and Ronald's music The Sanders montage (a winning team). For all those born in the early 80's with a super family, a genesis or an arcade stick in their hands, this movie rings the bell. Enough with the nods. The parcel ? "Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the role of a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual reality game that appeals to the players' minds," as can be seen on the main page of the film. This is the story in the story. For me, this image concerns a young couple of "reality protesters" infiltrating the presentation session of the "new virtual game" to destroy his programmer. I guess what we see in the last five minutes is a reality, if there is such a reality. Jennifer Jason Leigh still plays a game designer in the game in which they are and the end of the film is reality, with video game freaks freaks, big hairy dogs, "Realistic Cronenbergy" plastic textures (helmets and others) and 9mm handguns. What you see is true. They play transcendence for about an hour (in this game there is a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays the genius programmer of eXistenZ and Jude -Pikul - Law, marketing trainee associated with the Allegra game) , they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very worried about the health of her pod (which gets you nervous system to play), she has to connect herself and Pikul then wins the game (Transcendenz) and comes back to reality where they kill Yevgeny Nourish, programmer of TranscendenZ. <br /> <br /> Playing with eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is about facing your essence, facing your subconscious, while creating a virtual reality that you will have to overcome unexpectedly to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing "Demonstrator of Reality" turns into Allegra, a "goddess of virtuality"). <br /> <br /> What game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract term from within? To be really engaged in the world? <br /> <br /> And what about Nietschze (yes Friedrich, God is dead and you know what, Willem Dafoe represents him - God, mechanics -) ??? <br /> <br /> Yes, we build a story for ourselves and, losing the thread we follow overnight, disintegrate people as personalities; eXistenZ discusses that reality is all self-perception by anyone who truly engages it. And we could sometimes get some cool stuff; a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.
