Golden Boy is in my opinion one of the sleeping / lost anime. A sexy comedy, about a young man who is looking for his life and who starts all kinds of odd jobs that has somehow this sexy girl who ends up falling in love with him, but he does not go really count! It's really something that you can easily miss if you're in the name, but once you've seen it ... you'll fall in love with the comedy / foolishness that lurks inside. Really a crime that only produced 6 OVA episodes and pilot movie were made. However, be unique in the state. I'm surprised he survived to produce as much. If you want to laugh, with a high quality anime (100% free with CGI), take a look at this anime. Boy who one day can save the world ... or maybe not.
