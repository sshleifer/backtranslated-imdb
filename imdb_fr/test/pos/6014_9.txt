I am not a big fan of musicals. "Annie" was a show I loved but the movie was a flop. The "Phantom of the Opera" films (and I think there were three) did not match Weber's staging. But I loved that. The DVD will occupy a place of honor among my "guardians". Although it is a film adaptation, it captures the flavor and atmosphere of live theater. Bette Midler, always a treat, is exceptional in this role. There is good music, lots of laughs and even a tear or two. I saw most of the great musicals of the eighties and nineties. Somehow, I missed this one, so there is no comparison possible. But if it comes back, I'll be first in line for the tickets! But this film is so good that I may wonder if theatrical production will be worthy of the film.
