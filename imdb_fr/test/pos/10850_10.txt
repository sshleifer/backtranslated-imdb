I love that movie. I watched it again and again when I rented it to Netflix. It had a lot of substance and meaning for me. I think a lot of people will enjoy it.I have read and seen a lot of lesbian stories over the years and I am happy to say that they are improving better and better. It's nice to see two women come together and be as happy as others in this society. I think it's obvious that more and more movies with this theme will beautify our theaters and television screens. realizing that lesbians lead a full and healthy life and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals and families without hesitation.
