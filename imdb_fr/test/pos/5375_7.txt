This totally strange feature is a typical and exemplary example of the shocking horror of Satan. The events are completely confusing and it takes a long time before you understand what's going on, but the dark atmosphere sucks you in immediately. From the intrescribably bizarre intro, showing two strange kids turning toys into real war machines, know that this becomes a shock without compromise and no frills. "Fraternity of Satan" soon appears as a new slice of the so-called unofficial "little terrifying village hiding a dark secret". A young widower, traveling with his delightful new girlfriend and 8-year-old daughter, stops in a small isolated town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway. Villagers behave very hostile and insist that visitors leave immediately. The city is clearly in an atmosphere of fear and panic, as children disappear inexplicably and supernatural forces keep everyone within the city. Hillsboro is beset by a satanic cult apparently run by the older members of the community. I really liked "Brotherhood of Satan". The story reminded me of a novel by John Saul, but I can not remember the title. It also dealt with elder worship abusing young villagers for their own merits. The film is mainly based on scary sets (like dolls and relics of witchcraft), but a slightly more consistent and coherent scenario would have been good. The subject often raises many issues and questions, and Director Bernard McEveety can not always provide answers. The highlight is great, very seventy (which means shocking) and unforgettable. Beautifully shot movie, too.
