The Red Circle of Jean-Pierre Melville traces the life of two criminals: Vogel (Gian Maria Volontè), a murderer who gives the slip to the police as he is transferred from one city to another by train; and Corey (Allain Delon), a thief who has just been released from prison. Fate decides to join these two men to achieve a spectacular holdup. In the background is Matei (André Bourvil), the detective Vogel who escapes, implacable in his pursuit and sometimes ruthless in his methods. Along the film, the viewer meets other minor but fascinating characters, the best of whom is Jansen (Yves Montand), a disgraced ex-cop and an excellent shooter. <br /> <br /> Melville has a style so unique that you do not have to watch a lot of her movies to understand. The Samurai, A Cop and The Red Circle are clearly made of the same fabric: the symmetrical angles; long shots; silences; coats and hats and cigars; quotes at the beginning; astonishing burglaries, fatalism; criminal life without glamor and without glory. All that is great in Melville is here in its current form. <br /> <br /> And his faults did not bother me so much this time: the illogical and confusing behavior of his characters and the confusing narration, which harmed my joy of living. his other films are almost invisible here. Since The Red Circle preceded A Cop, that does not mean he has improved over time; maybe I would get used to it and I could reach a state of mind where it does not bother me at all. <br /> <br /> Melville has made unique crime films. As old as they are, they are more ingenious, more realistic and more graceful than the modern techno-thrillers in which cool thieves use computer systems and James Bond gadgets to succeed in impossible crimes. The criminals of Melville are not cool: they feel lonely, socially clumsy and probably aware that they are not good at planning the robbery. They are not wanted by society and live in the night. They always have a head start on the police in a match they know they will lose. Nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, for a film of this type, the police are not idiots either. Matei is smart, clever, patient and even compassionate. It's not a bad guy or a cliché, it's just an old man doing his job and doing it right. He knows when to use force and when to use the brain. Many movies could learn from him. <br /> <br /> It's this down-to-earth, non-romantic style that makes Melville's films so enjoyable to watch and puts him on a special pedestal as the grand master of movie crime.
