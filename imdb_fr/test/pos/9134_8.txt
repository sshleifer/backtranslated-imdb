Although it is not the masterpiece that was "The Samurai" (I now recognize that Jean-Pierre Melville has never managed to beat this classic), I find that "The Red Circle" is much better than "Bob the gambler". I thought "Bob the Flambeur" was an above-average and influential B movie, but still a B movie. "The Red Circle" proves that as a filmmaker, Melville has improved as he works. progress. John Woo is a big fan of Melville, even though their movie style is different. While Woo uses the fast motion for shootings and a sense of lyrical violence, Melville has a minimalist style that suits him very well. He was not interested in creating fast-paced action movies, but rather in meditative police thrillers. In this department he was one of the best. <br /> <br /> "The Samurai" remains his best work, mainly because he has more character development than this one, but technically they are probably equal. In addition, while "The Samurai" had an excellent performance in the lead, he has four. Alain Delon becomes an ultra-cool gangster on the lookout. The silence of this man is fascinating. Bourvil is superb as a police inspector on the burglary case and escaped con. He steals every scene in which he finds himself and proves he was a talented dramatic actor (in France, he is best known for being a brilliant comedian like Buster Keaton). Yves Montand is also excellent as a fragile and paranoid firearms expert. Gian Maria Volont√® (a regular in spaghetti westerns) is eclipsed by his three co-stars but still doing an adequate job. <br /> <br /> Once again, the direction of Melville is superb. Taking equal influence from American thrillers and the new French wave, man always seems to know the best shots and angles of view. It's slower than most caper movies, but it's really profitable in the end. "The Red Circle" is a bit short of an absolute classic, but remains one of the best filming films ever made. Tarantino must have seen this before doing "Reservoir Dogs". (8/10)
