Honestly, I do not know why so many people hate this movie, I always thought it was one of my absolute favorites. the fight with the tiger and his men rocked, the fight with the pirates with the axes rocked, all the skit with everyone trying to avoid themselves in the house is a pure genius ... ok so he did not not had the final confrontation required the manchus were very good. I give him an 8/10.
