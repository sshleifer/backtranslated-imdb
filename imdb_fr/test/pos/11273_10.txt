I loved it, it was really horrible and disgusting. I thought that the tearing of human flesh was completely provacative. the way he described the human crucifix about Jesus Christ was really interesting. Tears in the limbs and jaws were terribly terrible. Do not look at it if you have a weak heart, you will not be able to bear it.
