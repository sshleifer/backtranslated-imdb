The hypnotic film "Northfork" Michael Polish is a film that will remain in the memory for a long time. Michael and Mark Polish wrote this film of exquisite workmanship. This is visually one of the best things that came out of the world of independent films last year. The film is beautifully photographed by Mr. David Mullen, with a haunting score by Stuart Matthewman. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you may need to stop reading here. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​placing the film in Montana was a big blow for the Polish brothers. Never have the majestic views of the country and the mountains been so well understood as in "Northfork". We do not need any color! The beauty is in the dark tones of the film that highlights the tale of desolation in this remote outpost. <br /> <br /> At the center of the story is Irwin, the sick child entrusted to the mysterious Harlan father. . This boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is administering the medicine for his body. But is he really here? We see him interacting with the strange group that we meet for the first time around the cemetery. There are two freshly opened tombs. Will one of them be for Irwin? <br /> <br /> At the same time, another line of lines plays parallel to this first theme. We see the six black men who have come to the area to keep as many people away as possible. This will be the artificial lake bed that will be created. Their reward is an acre and a half of property by the lake if they move a number of people. <br /> <br /> The third story centers on the mystical group composed by Flower Hercules, Cup of Tea, Cod and Happy. . They are considering the possibility of a relationship with an angel who has been injured in this area. When Irwin meets them at the cemetery, he offers to help him, provided he takes her to at least a thousand miles from here. We watch the quartet examine the feathers that the boy has placed among the pages of his Bible. Could Irwin be this angel? <br /> <br /> The closing sequence shows us all the parts leaving Northfork in different directions. The men in black driving their cars, perhaps returning home to take advantage of newly acquired properties, which were given to them as a reward. The mystic group is seen getting on a plane and taking off for a higher place. We also realize that Father Harlan's child died, despite the medications and the care he received from him. <br /> <br /> Michael Polish got one of the best sets of all directors. Nick Nolte, as father Harlan performs a discreet performance in his portrayal of this kind man. James Woods, as Walter, one of the men working for the developer, is doing a great job. The biggest surprise is Duel Farmer, who makes an excellent impression as Irwin. This child actor, well supervised, is very promising. <br /> <br /> The Mystic band is brilliantly performed by Daryl Hannah, Robin Sachs, Ben Foster and Anthony Edwards, the man with fun glasses. Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, Ben Foster and the rest of the cast are flawless under the direction of Mr. Polish. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in its simplicity. Mr. Polish's vision will haunt his memory. Montana's imagery, perhaps an unreal landscape, is one of the best things in American movies for a long time.
