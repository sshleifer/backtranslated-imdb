This is an excellent collection of interviews and excerpts from films from the late sixties and early seventies, which was a counter-movement to the great Studio Films of the late sixties. Directed by Ted Demme, it is obviously a work of love of the films of the time, but it does not care about the masterpieces of the time. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers of this era were influenced by Truffaut. , Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman and of course John Cassavetes. Unfortunately, the documentary that connects to 138 minutes is too short! The film is rich in interviews and opinions of filmmakers. Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdonovich, Ellen Burstyn and Roger Corman, Bruce Dern, Sydney Pollack, Dennis Hopper and Jon Voight are among the interviewees. <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern has a moment of truth when he says he and Jack Nicholson may not be as pretty as the other stars who preceded them, but they were "interesting". This summarizes the other areas of this film period in American history. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers were struggling with a lack of funding from the studios because they expressed unconventional attitudes about politics, sex, drugs, gender and racial issues, and the involvement of the Americas in overseas conflicts such as the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> The interview with Francis Coppola was excellent, saying he had the chance to participate in "The Conversation" because the producers knew he was trained by Roger Corman to make a film without anything so they financed his film. <br /> <br /> Another interview is with Jon Voight which was directed by Hal Ashby in "Coming Home", a clear anti-war movie about an insane soldier plunking back into society after facing the battle. Voight explains how her work methods helped her reach an emotional point when Ashby said they were making a "rehearsal" and that it was ultimately the catch used in the movie - it was better because was so unrepeated and not too cool by being too repetitive. <br /> <br /> There are also many interesting excerpts from Al Panino's groundbreaking movie "The Panic in Needle Park" and interviews with Dennis Hopper on the set of "Easy Rider" and interviews with Sydney Pollack on film making. <br /> <br /> The documentary is a good starting point for any movie lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in the movies looked like in the seventies. Most Sundance Folks, where this film caused a sensation, do not know how much the independent filmmaker owes today to the films of John Cassavetes, Milos Foreman, William Friedkin and Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> Rent it at your favorite store.
