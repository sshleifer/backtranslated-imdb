Little Gus is a ten year old offender. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road trip. Reaching the petal is a bit difficult for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a lottery type card game called Motorama. He must find the eight letters to be able to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. A dark laugh follows when it turns into a road trip from hell. He meets a disturbed Lynch, like characters. The most memorable is the pump attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in the hope that God will see it. Later, Gus will get a tattoo and cover the injured eye. He becomes one of the most rebellious 10-year-old rebels you'll ever see on the screen. This is not a child movie! Look for cameos from Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Berrymore. Be warned though Drew is on the cover, she only appears in the movie in a dream sequence for a few seconds. In addition, the film becomes confused towards the end, reaching the territory of David Lynch, you may want to watch it several times. "Motorama" was written by Joseph Minion, best known for his scripts for "After Hours" and "Vampire's Kiss". So enjoy this overcrowded and fun road trip!
