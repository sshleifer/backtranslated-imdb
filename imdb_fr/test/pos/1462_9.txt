A humorous talk show hosted by the creators of "Garth Marenghi's Darkplace" The new series, Man to Man with Dean Learner, is devoted to the manager, publisher and advertising agent of Garth, played by Richard Ayoade. <br /> <br /> Nightclub owner, restaurateur, publisher, international playboy - Dean Learner is an individual brand. <br /> <br /> After his co-funded television program, Channel 4, hit Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, he now invites you into his penthouse for a brand new entertaining and extremely stylish TV talk show. <br /> <br /> Man to Man with Dean Learner will feature all of Dean's remaining friends, as well as live music and fine fish-based cooking in a class-stingy show, but no fish ! <br /> I attended this evening two live recordings and it put me on the back burner. There are very different comparisons to Alan Partridge's "Know Yourself" text, but the unique writing style of Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness takes it to another level. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Darkplace, you can not miss Catch it when it airs late this summer
