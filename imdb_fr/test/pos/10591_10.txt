This movie is just great. It's so hilarious. Although skating and other montages are played, the comedy is great. Raab himself and Brandon Dicamillo are hilarious. There will be times when you can not breathe, you laugh so hard. Plus, there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times while laughing. It's one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.
