Bergman regulars Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann starred Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story began with an ordinary couple fighting and putting on make-up. Jan was a sensitive person, but an escapee who isolated himself from the world. Eva is a practical woman who is fed up with her husband's lack of ambition. Because Jan procrastinating in repairing their radio, they are unaware of the impending war. Of course, the war happened and the film was a fascinating study of their mutual and mutual transformation during the invasion when they were mistreated by the enemy and their own government. <br /> <br /> There was no musical score in the film, but the soundtrack was the sound of the war. In one scene, the background shot, the explosion and the sound of the planes flying were incredible. From time to time, Bergman zoomed in on face expression as different events unfolded. When something violent happened, it zoomed out to allow the audience to feel the violence rather than look closely. Film very well done.
