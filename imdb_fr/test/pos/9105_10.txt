I had the chance to win free passes for the preview of the POD. Let me tell you that among the glimpses, I was excited to see it! The film absolutely rocked! What I really liked was the fact that JB was in his element. With other films like "School of Rock", he names namby pamby music for children and families, but this music is obviously his. <br /> <br /> I took my brother and sister with me laughed basically all the time. There are a few places where I wonder what the heck they were thinking, because some things are a little disjointed, but for the most part it was great. Most of the time, it did not seem like a low-budget movie, so it's an advantage. <br /> <br /> What surprised me most was Dave Grohl in the role of Satan. It's hilarious! Honestly, you would not know when you see the movie that it's him. <br /> <br /> I say that if you are a rock fan and like JB, KG and / or Tenacious D, check out the movie. Get ready for MANY references to drugs, LOTS of four-letter words and a rock that tears your skull!
