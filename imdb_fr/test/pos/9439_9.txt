What is the most violent film of all time? Rambo III? Commando? Robocop? Add these three violent ones together, and you're still not going to match the carnage of The Stabilizer, the craziest, craziest, and craziest action movie I've ever seen. For a hundred minutes, things are exploding and people are dying in dozens of strange ways. This will make you laugh and cheer, and when all is over you will be more than a little exhausted. This film is a hidden gem, a cult classic that is sorely lacking in cult. <br /> <br /> The Stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter Goldson (Peter O'Brian), a fat man with a curly mullet. He arrives in Indonesia in the footsteps of villain and villain Greg Rainmaker. We know he's perverse, because his full name ("I hate SCUM like Greg RAINmaker!") Is mentioned and uses a method of death so horrible that I can not even say it here. Wait, yes I can. He walks on people in cleated shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. <br /> <br /> When Greg Rainmaker does not pour alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure, he kidnaps important teachers and heads a huge underground empire. It's up to Goldson (a Jewish action hero? Gevalt!) And his rag-tag team of teammates to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing up many things. Maybe "stabilize" has a different meaning in Indonesia. <br /> <br /> And violence, oh violence. It's an unwilling, if not impossible, film to let five minutes of time in front of the screen without some sort of explosion, stabbing, car accident or blocking interrupting the dialogue. The violence is extreme. not graphic and bloody, just really weird. For example, The Stabilizer & company invades one of Rainmaker's warehouses (crossing a massive concrete wall on a motorcycle, of course). When he is perched on the balcony, fire from below, the stabilizer does what he can do. He leaves the balcony to go into the guy's head, his tire before bouncing it like a basketball. Amazing. <br /> <br /> Love scenes too free (the two major female characters jump in the bag with the hero of their choice not two minutes after having spoken to them for the first time) to the evil doubled dialogue ("Victor , talented bastard! ") The stabilizer has it all. It's a movie for ages, with Citizen Kane and Gymkata. It is not widely available in version. If you find it anywhere for any price, buy it and enjoy the madness. <br /> <br />
