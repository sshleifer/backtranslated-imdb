Dakota Incident is a curiosity for several reasons. It will be obvious from the beginning that it was done long before anyone thought of political correctness. Although the character of Ward Bond soften the edge with "maybe we can communicate with them, after all these are humans too" type of dialogue. His role is held side by side with the preacher trying to communicate with the Martians in the War of the Worlds. In fact, it's strange. The title is curious too. The use of the word "incident" gives the film an importance and sophistication that probably did not detract from the box office. Linda Darnell's artificial character set, costume and hat are wonderful, dated touches that make Dakota Incident a very cool western artifact from the mid-fifties.
