In 1242, Russia was invaded by two camps: from the east by the Mongols and from the side of Europe, by the German Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. The city of Novgorod is the last free city of Russia. The population, to organize the defense of Novgorod and lands of Russia, calls Prince Aleksandr Nevsky, who had defeated the Swedes in a previous battle. His successful strategy defeats the Germans after a great battle on a frozen lake. This film was made in 1938 because of the threat of German to Russia, in a period before the Second World War. The idea was to make pro-Russian propaganda. However, it is a powerful masterpiece overwhelming, wonderful and stunning. It's amazing the fight scene on the frozen lake. The current generation is very used to special effects, as in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and may not understand how fantastic this black and white fight is. If the viewer can forget the ideology and look at it as an art, he will certainly be amazed at the end of such a masterpiece. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
