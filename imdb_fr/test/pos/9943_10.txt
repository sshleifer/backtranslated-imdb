Although many people have mixed feelings about Argento's giallo thriller, this film is still another lavish testimony to Argento's brilliant cinema. <br /> <br /> A young lyrical singer has her first concert and suddenly finds herself the subject of obsession for a crazy maniac. <br /> <br /> In a way, Opera is like a modern giallo who confronts the Phantom of the Opera, mixed with all the style and all the colors that one would expect from Dario Argento to deliver. Argento makes great use of inventive camera techniques, recurring symbols (like those of crows!), A gothic atmosphere and really horrific murder sequences. One scene in particular (which includes a peephole and a gun) will hit the spectators from their seat! The film also manages to retain a strong suspense and create a pleasant atmosphere thanks to the superb score of Claudio Simonetti. <br /> <br /> The distribution presents satisfactory performances. Cristina Marsillach is good as our main wife. The late Ian Charleson plays his role as director, as do Urbano Barberini as an investigator, Daria Nicolodi as an agent of Marsillach and William McNamara as unhappy lover of Marsillach. <br /> <br /> The Opera is great in recent days, Argento and perhaps the last of his great works. It is sure to please his fans and even to create new ones. <br /> <br /> **** on ****
