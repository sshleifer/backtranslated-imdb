I came across this film by accident. I mean, how could I know otherwise? The studios did not get excited about it and I did not even hear about the release of my normally connected friends. After throwing my money into so many bad movies this year, I wish I could have seen it in movie theaters rather than on DVD. Mike Judge is the master of delightfully smart humor disguise in a low package. Just look at "King of the Hill" for a while ... it's an ostensibly redneck humor, but it's a very subtle hit from rednecks while being very nice at times. I read the slogan of this movie and I immediately ordered it on the Internet. I really do not understand where these negative reviews come from, except perhaps from Carl's Jr. This movie is not only hilarious, it's balanced as well. Moments of lightness intermingle between hilarious visual gags and blows in the current culture of our superstar / company. Of course, there is a little bit of humor, but it's just there to laugh in a derisory way. The premise is only semi-plausible, but since when did it matter? I do not see people making fun of "Futurama" because the principle is very similar. Just watch this movie. If you do not laugh, then something is really wrong with you. Maybe your father is working for Gatorade or something and he's really offended by the movie. Maybe you are an idiot. Probably the last one.
