I saw this film for the first time last night. I thought about it all night and this morning. I can not say it was my favorite movie, at least not yet. I need to see him again. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is beautiful. Each shot has a lyricism that might be expected in a film with the name of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> It is always tempting to see Chirico among the images of rows of orders disappearing in the dim light, but in this case, the analogy is appropriate. In many ways, the silhouette of Malkovich walking in the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the off-canvas statue that haunts Milan in the major works of the Italian-Greek painter. It is slightly threatening, a presence that looks and, as a filmmaker, influences the whole story. <br /> <br /> Dedicated followers of Wenders can not help but think a little about Damiel and Cassiel wandering the streets of Berlin, observing all the contacts but not interacting directly with the inhabitants. And, following the metaphor of Himmel Uber Berlin, the angel (or in this case the director Malkovich) interacts with one of the stories. <br /> <br /> At this point, I have to withdraw from this too much criticism. I need to see the movie again. I'm pretty sure it's the thread that will bring Malkovich's monologue together. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his reveries and pontifications are pretentious, an empty dialogue that sounds good but can not possibly be analyzed as true communication. Maybe that's the purpose of all this. No one can make this judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until he has done his homework. <br /> <br /> We must be careful when we use the word "pretentious". It is easy to write everything about the intellect as a pretense, but it leads to a terrifying mental state, in which the only conversation considered authentic, earthly or authentic is the most ordinary. When we avoid all discussions about philosophy, God, existence, meaning and all that brain candy, we prepare our culture to die of a slow, stupid and ugly death. This may be the warning that Wenders and Antonioni give us. This is certainly not the only theme of the film, but I think it can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> The other leitmotiv (and the most obvious) is that of satisfaction. There are many things on this, and a thorough examination of all the subtleties and consequences of the development of this leitmotif far exceed the limit of 1000 words for this review. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see the movie. But I want to caution: it's not a stand-alone film (at least I do not think so yet). Some films interact so much with the intellectual and artistic thought of their time that the viewer must have a Zeitgeist experience before approaching the film. Beyond the clouds is one of those films.
