Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great end to a decade of gold in American cinema. In the 1970s, the studios enjoyed an atmosphere of tolerance, open-mindedness and progress that allowed some of the best directors ever made by great directors to make great films. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (some are the violent deaths of prominent American political and cultural figures, the racial struggles, the emergence of the 1960s counterculture, the the increase in violence and death in the streets ...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers ready to dare, to be different and to create fun and intelligent films. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and filmmaking, respecting the parameters of war and adventure films, while reversing them with its fluid reflections on the value of life, the reason for death or the ethics of society. war. It is also an exciting work, made against all odds, reported in the 1991 documentary "Hearts of Darkness: The Apocalypse of a Director"; a film that has surpassed all previous reflections on the Vietnam War to reach the screen. Coppola challenged the classic melodrama formula found in two Vietnamese films made simultaneously, "The Deer Hunter" and "Coming Home", or in these as "Platoon" and "War Victims", before Vietnam became the point starting to make products of all kinds, such as the horror in "Jacob's Ladder", or comedies like "Good Morning, Vietnam", among the most respectable. Coppola had the courage to take this economic and political conflict as a basis for seeking answers to the questions that every man faces every day of his life, without betraying the dramatic consequences of this war.
