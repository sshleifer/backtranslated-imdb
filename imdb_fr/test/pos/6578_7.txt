Paha maa is a different Finnish film. But the things that differentiate it are copied abroad. Some narration techniques are by Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. The scenes are shot from different angles. Paha maa is a good movie, but it's not so good that the hype says: "A realistic movie, no happy ending, no commercial entry." Some actors did a good job. Sulevi Peltola was so good as a peddler of vacuum cleaners. Also Jasper Pääkkönen shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so lame. He is so much overrated that he is handsome and kind, but he is not the best actor in Finland. But if you like Finnish movies, Paha Maa is worth seeing.
