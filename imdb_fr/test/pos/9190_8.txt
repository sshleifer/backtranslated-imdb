Fado is an almost bluesy sad style of Portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly in the film. As one of the main characters explained (Igor), it also means destiny. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it is destiny that brings together the two main characters, Paco and Alex, and triggers the problems that arise from it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really enjoyed it. It begins as a drama / road movie "on the down and outs" that turns into thriller / road movie suspense. <br /> <br /> Two things I found unrealistic kept me from abandoning. note (I gave him an 8). The first is the main point of why Alex gave things. She was so desperate for money that she sold her passport for a pittance, and then she donated items worth several thousand to a stranger? His explanation was not convincing. Also, how did they get through the door, where were the cops?
