I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere). <br /> <br /> An intimate and obsessing portrait of loneliness, as well as the consequences of letting it grow and turn into something darker. <br /> <br /> The game of the two protagonists (Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage) is excellent, and I hope you would have met these characters before they were so damaged. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I'm calling). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces the moments of the film without drawing attention to itself. <Br /> <br /> Highly recommend the movie and the soundtrack.
