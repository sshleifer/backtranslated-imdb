I loved this film. It was an excellent representation of a family that had ups and downs, but in the end, they knew that special love they had for each other. I saw a lot of films with Jaclyn Smith, but my god, it was one of the best, although it was released 12 years ago. This film contained a cast of stars and what I liked the most was that it had opened my eyes to see actors that I had never seen before. This movie was quite long, but I enjoyed every minute. It's a movie you can watch with your family and watch, although you have to cover the children's eyes several times because of the discretionary love scenes. Overall, this movie is rated 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. Lifetime is not broadcast enough, so if anyone knows which store is selling it, let me know because it's about a must-have.
