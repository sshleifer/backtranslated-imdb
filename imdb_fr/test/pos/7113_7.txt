This is an entertaining B movie from the Universal Horror series starring Dracula, the Wolfman and the Frankenstein monster. The plot revolves around Dracula (John Carradine) and Larry Talbot, the werewolf (Lon Chaney Jr.), visiting separately a revolutionary doctor. They both ask him if they can be cured and the doctor tries to find a solution for everyone. Under the doctor's castle, they find the Frankenstein Monster buried in the mud (apparently this is a reference to the previous film in the Frankenstein series). <br /> <br /> Of course, if things had gone as planned, the movie would have been incredibly boring. Instead, Dracula can not suppress his appetite and the doctor is finally infected with a blood transfusion with vampirism. As a semi-vampire, the doctor goes crazy and wakes Frankenstein's monster. As with the Universal Horror series, the end is completely unsatisfactory. A beautiful woman with a hunchback, one of the two assistants of the doctor, has a particularly horrible end. Plus, you just have to feel sorry for Frankenstein's monster in this movie: he's awake for about two minutes, kills a policeman, then another building (what is it, the fifth now?) Collapses on him and is consumed by flames. It is also unfortunate that the great character created in The Wolf Man (1941), Larry Talbot, is really reduced here. People underestimate this film and Chaney's performance. Here he would be rightly criticized as being made of wood. All in all, it's a pretty fun movie, with only 68 minutes. A nice waste of time. 7/10.
