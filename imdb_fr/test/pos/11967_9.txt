"East Side Story" is a documentary about Stalinist Russia's musical and then Eastern European satellite comedies, with many excerpts from the films and survivors' commentary. Although some Stalinist films look ridiculously bad (The Bright Road (?) Being a notable exception), the movies of the sixties are actually quite beautiful. "My wife wants to sing", "The white mouse" and "Midnight Revue" are particularly fun. Producers have to face the censors, who have the power to decide what is politically correct, which creates some confusion, humorous in retrospect, since the people the censors try to appease are the very people who supported the film making. start with! Since musicals were quite rare behind the Iron Curtain - there were only forty copies in forty years - they had a disproportionate effect on their audience, which recorded major successes of some films. <br /> <br /> I notice that the sound of the movies of the sixties was much better. Filmmakers often had to deal with obsolete equipment and strict power rules - they had to shoot in seven minutes or less - and dangerous officers. <br /> <br /> I also notice that "West Side Story" seems to have had a strong influence on "Hot Summer". The latest movies may not match "Sing in the Rain", but they certainly seem to beat the hell of "Bye Bye Birdy"
