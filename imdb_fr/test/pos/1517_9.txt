This film, with only two characters, brings you closer to these two people, the interrogator and the prisoner, that most of the movies do not take you to any character, even well designed. <br /> <br /> The confusion, the terror and the pain of Madeleine Stowe's character is deeply disturbing, as is Alan Rickman's sadistic but charming interrogator. <br /> <br /> This film is quite possible and presents a shocking climax, the effect of the film as a whole leaving you sitting silently at the end. It will haunt you for a long time.
