I have never forgotten this movie. All these years and that stayed in my life. I looked for this movie on so many sites and stores. If someone reads it and has a copy, I'll pay you a copy or let me know where I can find one. This is a movie that should be a known classic novel as well as my other favorite, Somewhere in Time. It was really great. If the good actors re-made this film and gave it the patience it needed to be the good actor, it could be a puzzle. A love story as powerful as this one should be visible to all lovers. I remember how sad I was at the end and it was really a shock. I believe with all my heart that Johnny really loved the woman and she, him. It was a fantastic movie and it's a pity that it is not available for purchase. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com. I want to thank a wonderful lady who responded to my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the film and was kind enough to send it to me. She is a big fan of this movie like me. With his help, three happy ladies received these DVDs. She is waiting for the book he is resting on. I check with my local library, called "Mrs Maitlands Affair", by Margarett Lynn. I'm sure it's great too. Thanks a lot to Julie for her kindness and friendship. I'm your friend forever, / Sharon
