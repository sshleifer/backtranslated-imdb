Ken Loach showed the world the hidden face of Swinging London with "Poor Cow", about the London-based woman Joy (Carol White) who connects with a thief and has a son with him. the slammer. While his friend (Terence Stamp) manages to help him, he turns out to be a little better as a loser. Joy quickly realizes that she will have to make a serious decision about her future. <br /> <br /> One thing I determined - I do not know if this is true or not - was a use of irony in the film. Her name is Joy, but she has no joy in her life. Even if it was not planned, it's still a movie that I recommend to everyone. Featuring Donovan's songs (including "Colors") appeared in another Terence Stamp movie: "The Limey" (which, by the way, came out in 1999 when I was as old as my parents when "Poor Cow" is out)).
