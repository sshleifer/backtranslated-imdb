Rich businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after a fight. Panicked, he retired to a bar and met Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): a strong man, angry, bigot who is bitter to the idea that his beloved country has become. Unintentionally, Bill allows Joe to discover that he has just killed a hippie. And that's just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic film of an unlikely friendship. A bond between two men, one of a background of white-collar workers, the other of a background of blue-collar workers. Bill & Joe have one thing in common: they are dishonored by the madness of the world. Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle both gave very realistic portrayals of their characters. Director John G. Avidsen, with this "pre-Rocky" effort, directs this low-budget gem with the same smoothness as a $ 100 million film. The script is loaded with excellent character development and a realistic and very lively dialogue. Despite its strengths, this film has its weaknesses. The scenario falls asleep at about three quarters of the way, but he wakes up just in time for the climax. Susan Sarandon, 24, plays very early and without interest in the film. Melissa, Bill's daughter, and her hippie boyfriend, Frank, are very well done by Patrick Mc Dermott. We can only congratulate him that he was killed at the beginning of the film. Despite some flaws, it is one of those forgotten movies of the 70s that should not be. Even though "Joe" is very dated by today's standards, the chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is quite relevant today, and it's the glue that keeps the film as a whole.
