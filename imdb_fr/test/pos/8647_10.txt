On the lost highway, a sign reads: <br /> <br /> * THE GREAT SPOILERS OF THE FRONT * <br /> <br /> (but you already knew it, did not you?) <br /> <br /> Since there are many people who apparently have not understood the purpose of this film, I would like to give my interpretation of why the plot has a perfect meaning. As others have pointed out, only one view of this movie is not enough. If you have the MD DVD, you can "cheat" by reading David Lynch's "Top 10 Tips to Unlock MD" (but only at the second or third reading, please.);) < All, Mulholland Drive is downright brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuses to leave you head. The comments on the DVDs are not often very accurate, but "It goes in the head and stays there" Vogue has really hit the mark. <br /> <br /> David Lynch deserves praise for creating a film that has a beautiful, elegant look - from a cinematography point of view, has an excellent acting (especially Naomi Watts), a Bewitching soundtrack of Badalamenti and a very dreamlike quality - but in addition to all of this also manages to engage the viewer such a thing that few movies have before. (After all, what was the last time you saw a film that would not leave you in the mood and everyone felt obligated to speak and write, whether they like it or not?) /> <br /> All right, enough of all this, it's time to justify these statements. <br /> <br /> Most people who have tried to reconstruct the plot have come to the conclusion that the first half of the image is an illusion / a dream sequence. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a pity for all those who try to make sense of the film by expecting "traditional" methods in which the story is presented in a timely, logical and linear way for the viewer. But for those who expect it, I urge you to check the name of the director and come back. ;) <br /> <br /> MD tells the story of the sad disappearance of Diane Selwyn, a phantasmagorical actress and in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career and believes that she has not been able to meet the expectations of her parents and that of her parents. When she realizes that Camilla will never be hers (C. will get engaged with Adam Kesher, the director), she will hire a hitman to get rid of her and will eventually face the guilt she provokes. . <br /> <br /> The film begins with what may seem like a strange opening for this kind of thriller; This is a jitterbugs contest from the 50s, in which we can see the main character Betty give an excellent performance. We also see a senior couple (whom we will see twice more in the movie) with her and applauding her. <br /> <br /> No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they see it. There is actually another very important fact that is presented before the credits: the camera goes into an object (although blurred) and the scene disappears quickly. If you look good, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream. <br /> <br /> The main characters seen in the first half of the film: <br /> <br /> Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary ego, used in the first half of the film, is the "dream sequence" "- a positive representation of a young actor who is successful and in the making (the opposite of Diane). "Betty" was chosen as the name because it's the real name of Winkies' waitress. Note that in the dream version, the name of the waitress is "Diane". <br /> <br /> Rita: The fantastic version of Camilla Rhodes who, thanks to Diane's dream and the help of an imaginary car accident, is transformed into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then well placed in the luxurious home of Betty / Diane's aunt in which Betty is allowed to stay. <br /> <br /> Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream part, the woman in charge of the apartment complex in which Betty resides. She is primarily a strong figure of authority, as evidenced by both parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Adam: The director. We know from the second period that he gets engaged with Camilla. Her only goal of being in the first half of the movie is to serve as a Betty / Diane punch, as she develops such hatred for him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Ruth: Diane's true aunt, but rather to be out of town, she's dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used it to pay for Camilla's murder. <br /> <br /> Mr. Roach: A typical Lynch character. Not true; appears only in Diane's dream sequence. She is a mysterious and influential person who controls the chain of events in the dream from her wheelchair. It performs much the same functions as the dwarf who speaks upside down (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> Hitman: The person who murdered Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the film, although made slightly more clumsy in the sequence of dreams (more details below). <br /> <br /> Now, having established the different versions of the characters in the movie, we can begin to dive into the plot. Of course, I will not go into the details (I will not present it in chronological order either), but I will try to explain some of the most important scenes, in relation to the "dashboard" of Lynch . <br /> <br /> As I said above, Camilla was reconstituted into amnesia because of her unlikely survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the film, which left her completely vulnerable. What I found very intriguing at MD is that Lynch constantly gives clues as to what's real and what's not. I already mentioned that the camera was moving in the pillow, but notice that there are two cars in each lane approaching the limousine. <br /> <br /> Only one of the cars hit the limousine; what about the other? Even if they stayed away from the accident, would not they try to help others or at least call for help? My theory is that since this is a dream, the presence of the other car is simply put aside and forgotten. Since, as Rogert Ebert so eloquently puts it, "Like real dreams, he does not explain, does not finish his sequences, dwells on what he finds fascinating, rejects unimportant intrigues." <br /> Shortly after, Rita crawls Betty arrives from the crash site to Mulholland Dr., gets off the hill and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment. We see this terrifying old couple moving away, staring at each other in horror and grinning at each other and in front of the camera. This is the first indication that we are witnessing a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Although the older couple do not seem to know Betty, I think they are actually her parents (as they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). Maybe she did not know them all well and she did not really have a relationship as good as she wanted. The couple is therefore shown to be very nice and helpful to her in the dream. They also represent her feelings of guilt for the murder and Diane's sense of unfulfilledness about her unfulfilled goals in her life. <br /> <br /> A rather long and hilarious scene is that of the murderer. Diane apparently sees it as the major force behind the campaign, trying to put pressure on the director to accept Camilla's role in the film (Adam's evening in the second half of the film), and he therefore occupies an important part of his dream. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse for Camilla's murder, part of her wants to miss him, so she turns him into a dumb criminal. <br /> <br /> This scene, I think, is also an attempt by Lynch to totally blow up his audience, because they are given a false pretext to watch the film. <br /> <br /> I must like this sentence "Something has just bit me bad". :) <br /> <br /> The next interesting scene is the one with Twinkies's two people discussing how one of them continues to experience this recurring nightmare involving a man he sees through a wall outside the restaurant where they sit. After a little discussion, they go outward and continue walking towards the corner of a fence, accompanied of course with excellent music matching the mood of the stage. <br /> <br /> Arriving at the corner, a disgusted face-like character appears behind the corner, frightening the life of the man with the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; she saw this guy in the restaurant when she paid for the murder. In short, his obsessions translate into nightmares of this poor guy. The tramp also represents the evil side of Diane, as we will see later in the film. <br /> <br /> The cowboy is (with the dwarf) one of the strange characters still present in the lynchian landscape - Diane He saw it only a short time at the party of Adam, but just as our own dreams can reward insignificant people that we hardly know a major role in our dreams, we can attribute to him an important role of his dream. We are also given other clues during his scenes that what we see is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.) <br /> <br /> The cowboy is also used as a tool to make fun of the director when he meets with him at an unusual place (the lights here clearly indicate that it is part of a dream). Also note how he says he will appear once again if he (Adam) does good, or twice if he does evil. Throughout the film, he appears twice more, indicating to Diane that she has acted badly. It was also him who woke her up (this scene is probably an illusion made for her to appear twice) and shortly afterwards she commits suicide. <br /> <br /> The espresso scene with the Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, Luigi) are probably the result of Diane having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam do their announcement at Adam's evening in the second half. It could also be a statement from Lynch. <br /> <br /> During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying in the bed is Camilla, but notice that she has assumed Diane's sleeping position; Diane sees herself in her own dream, but her face is not hers, although he has the same facial injuries that Diane could have had after shooting herself in the head. This scene is also full of lynchian goosebumps. Since Diana did not know where (and when) the murderer would arrive at Camilla and finish it, she simply put it at her house. <br /> <br /> In real life, Diane's audition for the movie part was bad. . In her dream, she achieves a perfect hearing - leaving the entire crew delighted by her performance. <br /> <br /> It is also worth noting that the money that was used in real life to pay for the murder of Camilla now appears in Rita / Camilla's handbag. This is part of Diane's loss from her terrible act by returning the money to her, as the murder did not happen now. <br /> <br /> When her neighbor arrives to retrieve her ashtray in the shape of a piano, another clue is given; she takes the ashtray off her table and leaves, but later, when Camilla and Betty meet on the couch, we'll see the ashtray reappear when the camera lands on the table, suggesting that Betty's meeting with the neighbor was a fantasy. <br /> <br /> The slogan of the movie Adam audition actresses for whom is "She is the girl"; What exactly are the same words that Diane uses to give Camilla the author's photo summary. <br /> <br /> The blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the film. This is where the true identity of the characters is. revealed. There is a lot of symbolism going on here; the box may represent Diane's future (she's empty), or maybe some sort of Pandora's box (the laughing man laughs when she asks him what the key will open). Anyway, it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder). The box is also visible at the end of the film in the hands of the disfigured tramp. <br /> <br /> The Silencio Club is a nice little addition to remind the viewer that what he / she is watching is not real. It also means that Diane is about to become aware of her reality (her reality being a nightmare she can not escape even in her dreams). <br /> <br /> During the frightening scene at the end where A terrifying old couple reappears, Diane is so tormented that she sees in suicide the only way out to escape the screams and avoid being haunted by her fears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's my $ 0.02. I hope it could help people not to let go of this movie and call it "the worst film ever" or something like that without realizing the plot. <br /> <br /> As usual, Lynch's goal is to create irrational fears, and he certainly achieves this with that image too. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
