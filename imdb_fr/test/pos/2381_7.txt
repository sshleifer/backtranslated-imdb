"Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster", one of Scooby Doo's cartoon films, is both entertaining, exciting, interesting, entertaining and gives a surprisingly good performance of the Highlands of Scotland. An annoying aspect of the film lies in the voices of many characters. Americans who try to play Scottish in this film unfortunately do not succeed very well (although some have a better Scottish accent than others). <br /> <br /> Daphne came to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and Highland games at Blake Castle. Gravely Shannon tells the gang that she thinks she saw the Loch Ness monster. When even darker chaos occurs, the Mystery Inc group has another mystery in their hands ... <br /> <br /> Good for Scooby Doo fans and for those who want to know more about Scotland ! Enjoy "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"! :-)
