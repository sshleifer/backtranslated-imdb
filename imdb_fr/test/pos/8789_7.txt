NO SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> After the success of Hitchcock's first American film, Rebecca inspired by Daphne DuMarier's romance and Gothic intrigue novel, he returns to some of the most familiar themes of his British era - mistaken identity and espionage. As the United States embarked on World War II and participated in a large-scale "war effort" to build the planes, weapons and other militias needed, the burgeoning film entertainment sector was beginning to emerge. to produce paranoid and often fanciful thrillers. These thrillers often involved deceptive and competent networks of operators working in the shadows among good law-abiding citizens. Knowing that the director was comfortable with this kind of spying, producer Jack Skirball asked Hitchcock to run a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war sabotage and a helpless hero immersed in a vortex of coincidences and false identity. The darkest elements of the story and the quick wit of Dorothy Parker (her brief period in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in New York), who co-wrote the screenplay, perfectly matched the sensitivity of Hitchcock. <br /> This often overlooked movie tells the story of the ill-fated Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), 25, who, while working in a Los Angeles aircraft factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and commits shortly thereafter to commit. sabotage. Fleeing authorities who do not believe his story, he meets several characters as he travels to Soda City, Utah, and then to New York. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car filled with "monsters" and a popular advertising model, Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), who falls head over heels in love with the worst crisis of his life and national security! Of course, in the country of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, cracks for his kidnapper, adding a romantic tension to the mix. <br /> <br /> Fit for this outing, Hitchcock prepares a national network of sober old ladies, middle-aged women and respectable businessmen who play the role of terrorists secret agents who house criminals, issue weapons and detonate bombs for things to move. It's a formidable plot that takes its time to advance and once ignited, it culminates in one of Hitchcock's most memorable finals. Incredibly looking for life as New York's tourist attractions (all of which have been recreated by Hollywood art directors because of the "ban on shooting" public attractions during the war). Although Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's best-known films, it's a popular, solid and engaging B movie with many intelligent twists and, as usual, some terrible villains from Hitchcock. Do not forget to watch the appearance of Hitchcock in front of a pharmacy in the second half of the film. Hitchcock's original cameo idea (fighting him in sign language with his 'deaf' wife) had been rejected by the Bureau of Standards and Practice who feared offending the deaf!
