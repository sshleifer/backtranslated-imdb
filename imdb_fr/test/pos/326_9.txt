I saw this movie when it came out and it is undoubtedly very touching. I liked the point of view of a child who learned that what she thought of her was actually wrong. It's a shine for this little child. And her search for who she is. And before and after she knows her relationship with her adoptive mother. It is a beautiful sight. A Rahman adds his stress by a good re-recording and songs. In this movie, mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advice (as in Vuyire), but simply tells the characters as they are. And because of that, the movie hits the audience exactly. The swimming pool scene of chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas did not convey perfectly what that meant. Mani Ratnam has improved incredibly.
