Anyone who appreciates the action game and sound dialogs will love this movie. From Ronald "Taking Sides" Harwood, this is a fun and ultimately exciting <br /> <br /> analysis of a relationship between two <br /> <br /> very "actors" types. Albert Finney is sublime as the despotic Shakespearean actor who barely notices the raging world war <br /> <br />. <br /> company and his own psychological and emotional depression. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtenay is unparalleled as Norman, the "Dresser" of the title, <br /> <br /> whose apparent dedication turns out to be anything but disinterested. <br /> <br /> Really a must.
