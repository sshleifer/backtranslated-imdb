The sub-genre slasher is practically exhausted. In fact, even in 1979, only a year after the release of the so-called "first slasher", Halloween (released seven years after Bay of Blood). the sub-genre was not far from exhausted; but Tourist Trap represents one of the most original outings. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers - that is, the madman kills a lot of children, but derives its originality from the fact that the madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to a invisible assailant or to a masked man) have a glimpse of his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinesis capabilities, including being able to control the wax manikins that fill his home, adds to the originality. We start with a superb opening sequence, which sees a young man fall under a flat tire after being in a terrorized gas station. The scene is incredibly frightening, as the wax models flirt with it and the objects fly through the shelves - and this gives the audience a glimpse of what will happen; namely, a very scary horror movie! <br /> <br /> Interim credibility is as non-existent as one would expect from a slasher of the 1970s, but to be honest; it's not so bad. Girls look sexy, boys do not matter. and Chuck Connors is more than a sufficient fear in the role of the psychopath. He is not exactly Anthony Perkins. but still good enough. It is not the acting game that is the star of the series, however, and as one might expect, the gloomy atmosphere holds this price. The models of wax, as evidenced by the likes of House of Wax (Vincent Price version ...), are very scary; and the film makes the most of this fact. There are very few things in the cinema that can be scary just by being there - but wax statues are definitely one of those things. The killer's special ability could easily have hindered the atmosphere, but the film makes the most of it, even by flying various things on the shelves and it goes well with the rest of the film. Overall, it's a very good movie. While Tourist Trap might not be an absolutely essential visualization it's worth the trip and I can recommend it.
