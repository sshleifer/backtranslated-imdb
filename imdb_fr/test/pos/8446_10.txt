>>>> Author: msgreen-1, originally from Canada >>>> The big problem was the assertion of "China syndrome" - that if a reactor error occurred and radioactive waste escaped, they could make their way to China. Many people laughed at this and if the filmmakers seriously thought about it, then yes, you have to laugh about it. The spill would not make it anywhere near the center of the earth or even molten rock. Even if it were going to the center of the Earth, how would that happen in China? It should be against the grain at all! In addition, China is not the opposite side of the world, but the Indian Ocean. <<<<< ......... ......... ........... ............. ... ............. ..................... ................ .. .............. ............ ...... .......... <br /> <br This point was raised by the characters of the film, saying that this could not happen, because the core would have touched the water table and trigger an active radio - cloud, it rains on the population. <br /> <br /> Before trying to find a weak point in the movie, you should watch it first !!!! Do not judge a book by its title ...
