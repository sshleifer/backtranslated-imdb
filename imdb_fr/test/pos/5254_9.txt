This movie was funny from the beginning to the end. Everyone in the cinema was laughing all along the movie !! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the daughter of Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best replicas, the best attitudes, and so on. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she played well and was very convincing. The only drawback of this film is the fact that the other two main characters are not as fun, even if the film is centered on them ........ This is a great movie to see and see. your girls (yes guys, this is a girl movie thoroughly!). Enjoy!!!
