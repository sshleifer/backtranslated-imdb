This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Of course, it's fluffy, it's not "relevant", but when are the movies just entertaining and entertaining a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely "a good thing" as Martha Stewart would say (rightly)! Barbara Stanwyck is so attractive in this film and Dennis Morgan compliments her to perfection. Both have charm and heat to spare. They are assisted by a team of incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40s and 50s - Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor, among them. Where are the characters like that today? Not one role could have been better interpreted. Bette Davis happily refused this role because she was right to refuse it. She would have tried to steam everyone and everything around her and would have completely destroyed the film. Stanwyck was a strong actress, but had the wisdom to play lightly. She has rarely been more attractive and her pitch is perfect. Morgan is the essence of the nice boy. Because his part is the least glowing, he tends to neglect his skills. The mere fact that he can get by surrounded with such distinctive characters is an accomplishment in itself, but he too is absolutely perfect as Jefferson Jones. Put back the poorly recommended (and useless) remake of 1992 and watch this sparkling and sparkling holiday gift!
