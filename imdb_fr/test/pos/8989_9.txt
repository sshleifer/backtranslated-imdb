Now I realize that most of the people here are denouncing YOUNG WARRIORS or hailing it as "so bad it's funny" entertainment, but let me be clear: it's actually an action of quality, low rent, if cinema without critical eye. In fact, it's a lot more entertaining and stimulating than the majority of 80s action movies. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is in the subject of the movie. I am always a fool for movies that tackle the subject of vigilance, especially when they are ambitiously exploring the psyche of the characters involved. YOUNG WARRIORS may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first DEATH WISH movie (and yes, I think the first one had both of these), but it's trying to be different from Cannon's regular movies of the period is truly unique. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple (do not worry, there will be no disruptive): a group of student jokers alters when a member of their family is attacked by a tough street gang. Students take to the streets to fight street crime in general because they do not know who the gang leader is. They end up acquiring heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and roam the night fully armed. However, they are not Schwarzenegger types; These are vulnerable and inexperienced novices who make considerable blunders almost every time they undertake to clean up the city (usually with their dog mascot frat in tow). They finally find out who the gang is and pick on them, but you do not expect a classic climax in which good people go unharmed. <br /> <br /> One thing about the film that struck me Strange but effective is that the fat of the first act does not indicate that we will see later action or violence because it is treated as a zany comedy that you would see in the American All Night night (where I think it was actually shown at one point). The configuration of the comedy lulled me to forget that the VHS cover showed a guy driving a motorcycle with a machine gun attached to his back. Then, when the violence finally arrives, it's not fun or cute at all ... it's shocking. From that moment on, the film becomes an uncompromising, blood-filled action movie that contains dizzying shooting fights. <br /> <br /> The action, although nothing special, is much more passionate than I thought. James Van Patten, who plays the protagonist, gives everything and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of film. The rest of the cast is also invested, including the always reliable Ernest Borgnine as father of the hero's cop. Cinematography is also excellent and the action scenes are treated with a level of seriousness that I did not expect personally. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people thought that this movie was worthless because it is extremely dated, but these facets seemed to me nothing less cool in itself. The character of Van Patten studies animation and his work of the early 80s, presented in several scenes, is the psychedelic dream of the retro movie lover. I'm sure most contemporary viewers would cite these moments as weak points in the film, but I do not agree. In addition, Joe Walsh's soundtrack - which seems to be only recorded in 1983 - seemed particularly suitable and enjoyable, whatever his age. "<br /> <br /> YOUNG WARRIORS is one of my favorite action movies of the '80s and I strongly encourage anyone interested in the genre to watch, but unfortunately it is not only released on VHS at the time of writing this article, and it's not being shown on TV these days.A nice DVD presentation would make me walk into the living room with such intensity that I'm sure my ankles were swelling up In the meantime, I urge you all to go on Ebay or Amazon and pay $ 10 or whatever else for the old big-box cassette.It's really a remarkable staple of ambitious trash cinema.
