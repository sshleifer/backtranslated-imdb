Review of the movie Daisy By James Mudge of beyondhollywood.com <br /> <br /> On paper, "Daisy" sounds like the dream of a fan of Asian cinema come true, directed by the co-director of "Infernal Affairs "Andrew Lau and starring everyone's favorite blame girl, popular Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun. Unfortunately, despite the talent involved and the fact that the team has traveled half of the world to shoot in Amsterdam, the film is a little disappointing, because it is a romantic drama that wallows in sadness and the importance of oneself. <br /> <br /> The plot follows Hye Young (Jeon Ji Hyun), a rather naive Korean living in Amsterdam, working in her grandfather's antique shop and making portraits of tourists. One day, she begins to receive flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer, whom she believes to be a mysterious man of her past who has already built a pretty little bridge. One day, she meets Jeong Woo (Lee Seong Jae, also in "Holiday" and "Public Enemy"), who, unbeknownst to him, is actually an Interpol agent who tracks Asian criminals in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> With Hye Young assuming that Jeong Woo is responsible for the flowers, both fall very slowly into a chaste relationship. However, it turns out that the man who sends the flowers is actually Park Yi (Jung Woo Sung, from "Sad Movie" and "Musa"), an assassin working for a Chinese crime syndicate. Inevitably, the love triangle becomes tragic and the two men end up facing each other while poor Hye Young tries to determine which of them is the love of her life. <br /> <br /> Although "Daisy" is apparently a love story, it has the feeling of a burial, with a slow and dark rhythm and a plot that stacks misery. Half of the shooting time of the film is occupied by scenes of characters staring enviously at the window in the rain, the silence breaking only by episodes of self-pitying narration. Director Lau seems to have the impression that the film is a Shakespeare tragedy, rather than another tragic love story. As such, the procedure looks rather pretentious, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely on a blatant clich√© borrowed from likes such as "Fulltime Killer" and John's classic "The Killer" Woo. <br /> Almost every aspect of the film is sowed with anxiety, the three main characters suffer as if the weight of the world weighed on their shoulders and firmly refused to do anything to pursue their romantic leanings. Park Yi, in particular, the kind of overly emotional and socially loved murderer, worshiped of modern cinema, is slightly ridiculous, from his blatant incompetence at work to his hilarious attempts to discuss Impressionist painting with Hye Young or his penchant for growth. flowers. This languid passivity hardly complicates the central romance of the film, and Lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that fate unites the characters is more like a shabby coincidence. <br /> <br /> Jeon Ji Hyun fans It should be noted that his character is much closer to his role in the dark supernatural drama "The Uninvited" than "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstruck", and then she tries her best to shoot some wacky faces here and there, her performance is certainly more discreet. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from brilliant production values, and Lau takes full advantage of the Amsterdam landscape, contrasting the gray, almost Gothic beauty of the city with the innocent blue sky and blossoming fields of countryside. Unfortunately, he tends to abuse the slow motion for certain emotional scenes, which, when combined with certain visual elements of postcard, gives the film sometimes the appearance of an advertisement for a perfume. There are some surprisingly violent scenes of action, although they are rare and spaced out, and although well staged, seem to have been added after the fact and only give a brief boost. <br /> <br /> Despite its faults, "Daisy" is a captivating film, and the story is almost engulfed, mainly by morbid fascination not to see with which man will finish Hye Young, but to see who will die His arms. The self-indulgent melodrama works well enough to check all the appropriate boxes for the genre, and the movie works perfectly like a pleasant and brilliant romance. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the DVD presents the director's cut of the film, which indicates for once that it is substantially different from the theatrical version, which adds not only 25 minutes, but reorganizes some scenes, making the story less linear. Although this new version may be too long, it is certainly superior, because without these changes, the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from a development of the character even darker. <br /> <br /> Wai Keung Lau (director) / Jae-young Kwak (screenplay) CAST: Woo-sung Jung ??.
