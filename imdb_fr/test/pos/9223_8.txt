I saw this film for the first time when I was very small. I was born in 1985, so it was about the age when cartoons of the 80s were big. My mother recorded it one day, thinking it might please me. I had never heard of the Rainbow Bright TV show before I got introduced to the movie. When I saw it (on one of those old BETA tapes ...), I loved it. I became addicted to her. There are people who say it's badly written and all that, but it's a children's film, and things like that do not really matter to kids. I loved the story and especially the songs and all the female characters. Of course, I pretended to be them, and in the scene where Rainbow met Krys for the first time and they were pushed back, they had to work with the opposite sex, I could tell everything. History was the essence of the good against the harm that children value, and there were enough moments of happiness to balance those who were scary. The world is a fantastic place that would stimulate the imagination of any young child. I am very happy to have had the opportunity to watch this movie when I was little. That had a big impact and watching it now brings back good childhood memories. I would recommend any parent with young children to rent this movie. This will trigger their imagination and provide a lot of entertainment. You are only a child once, so do not let them pass by this one!
