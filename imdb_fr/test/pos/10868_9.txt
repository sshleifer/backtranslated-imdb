I found it charming! No one but Kiarostami can do so little and yet get as much. You might think I'm weird, but I was so charmed that I could not speak during the movie. While during other movies I comment a lot. The short film he made for Lumiere et Companie, the one with eggs, that one is unbeatable in my heart, but it's also wonderful. I liked it better than ten. Kiarostami is perhaps the best director in my opinion, because he can see things! He does not need to use a lot of things "brought from home" to illustrate his images, he simply grabs a camera. Few people can do it. Maybe I do not know much about cinema, but I do not care about complicating things, all that someone has to do is to touch my soul. Kiarostami does.
