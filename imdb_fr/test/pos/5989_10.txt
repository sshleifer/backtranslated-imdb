I like foreign movies and it's among the best. I tend not to see this as a comedy as it is listed and find a comment on how we see others around us.

There is an underlying story and almost many stories in the story of this film. I just hope that if someone decides to make an American / English version of this film, it's not the vein of Three men and a baby that would definitely hurt this film, to see absolutely .....
