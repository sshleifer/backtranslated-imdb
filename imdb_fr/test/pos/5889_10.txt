The best years of our lives are often compared to It's a wonderful life. They should never be. Their only common point is the desire to make a serious comment on a war that has cost millions of lives. It is difficult to know what value individual life can have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people have lost their lives in a violent way in the last century?) What a statistic we have to live with.) Moreover, our feelings about the war have changed in 60 years. We gradually stopped thinking that the war was right if the enemy was right, to believe that no war was totally fair, especially those that occurred recently. <br /> <br /> I have been a longtime pacifist. . I oppose any war. Not long ago, I had this position tested. This happened while I was on USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship needed a crew 3 or 4 times larger than the community I live in. It's a powerful experience, moving on its decks. She had seen a lot of action. Someone granted me the right to be pacifist and it was not bought cheaply. <br /> <br /> I can not look at the best years of our lives without thinking of things like the Lexington. <br /> <br /> Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they also paid mine. <br /> <br /> None of them succeeded more easily than another. The Navy, the Air Force and the Army paid equal, though in different ways. Everyone had problems directly related to the war. And everyone had to work hard to overcome these difficulties. It took them more courage to face their civilian environment than to face the war, because everyone had to do it alone. Everyone could understand the problem of others and sympathize with them: no one could help him at the end. <br /> <br /> The moving part of the movie (this could be the beginning of the spoiler) is the following The male leaders found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is where Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Do not hesitate, do it tomorrow. Harold has a hard time believing that anyone could love him as a football hero and a sports star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens. <br /> <br /> The other is where Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Repair your relationship with your wife ?? standard fair for films from the 30s / 40s. Derry did not discuss the question: he felt he was not worthy of Al's daughter. So he accepted. The truth of the film appears when we consider that the girl feels the same about Derry. Real emotions of real people. I think that our time has profound problems of feelings, feelings and honor. I sometimes think that we believe that these values ​​do not exist. This is perhaps why people watching this movie have problems. <br /> <br /> Al is not free of advice that he does not want totally. Whenever his boss speaks to him, Al is tied to knots. And rightly so. Occupancy standards do not make it possible to judge certain things: they must be judged on the basis of huge general intangible assets and only a person tested according to the severity of life will understand what this intangible asset is. <br /> <br /> To a close-to-the-end scene where all the planes that fought so hard are stripped, piled, stored, discarded and soon recycled: their function, value and pride are as translucent as Derry. He can overcome this translucency that he does and shape it, in his mind, for the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I gave 10 years to the best years of our lives and few movies seem to me this way. sure. This is not a movie for popcorn. This deserves our attention. We are very privileged to drop something as private as the lives of these wonderful people. We must be careful not to abuse this privilege.
