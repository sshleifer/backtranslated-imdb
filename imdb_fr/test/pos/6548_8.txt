Having discovered the Ring trilogy, I greedily devour all other Japanese and Korean films that follow or follow the movement. <br /> <br /> I do not have a simple definition of horror, but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons, although I can not pretend that the movie makes a lot of sense. I'm scathing, so there were several moments in the movie where I just did not want to watch what was happening on the screen. The film pissed me off and I was afraid to see things that I thought I could see. <br /> <br /> It's an imaginative film that offers a lot of visual things. It also provides some food for thought. And a lot of material to discuss when the movie is finished. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined for the least. Could they make movies like this in the West? <br /> <br /> That makes no sense in the end, but when you have an appetite for occultism, the supernatural, the bizarre, another world, the film will give a last explanatory benefit.
