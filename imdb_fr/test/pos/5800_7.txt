Captain and Tennille have released a very good package of 3 DVDs with a minimal edition. Unlike most varieties, these shows have not been hacked. The music and dance numbers are included in the sketches as they were during the first broadcast. I suspect that some music numbers on the DVD may have been modified in shows in which they were not originally listed but were unable to verify their suspicions. I noticed some inconsistencies between what is on the DVD and the program information I found on the net. I can not check if the network information is inaccurate or if the music performance has changed in the DVD shows. Whatever the truth, I really appreciate the efforts of the production company. I hope that each release of varieties released shows the same respect for the format. I guess almost half of the broadcasts are included. I think they encountered rights issues in the series that were not included. Hopefully these problems can be solved and a volume 2 can be published later. Among the extras, there are some individual music videos as well as a dance rehearsal. I recommend this DVD to all fans of C & T.
