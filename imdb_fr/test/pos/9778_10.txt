It must be one of the best Australian productions. I completely disagree with the comments of "RamiNour101". <br /> <br /> This series shows the depth of Australian camaraderie and their efforts to help each other. The Episode Five 'Eddies Birthday' is an excellent example and perfectly illustrates the Australian spirit. <br /> <br /> The music used throughout the series only highlighted the situation men faced, their aspiration to the home and their loved ones. The many amusing interpretations of The Road to Gundagai capture the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forget the house and that they were small elements such as singing a song that brought them home. for a short time. <br /> <br /> When it comes to racism against the Japanese, the only thing to say is that you can not change anything that has happened. The Japanese treated the Australians very badly with Changi and to represent it otherwise would be very misleading. The comment on the accuracy of the scenario is also wrong. These six stories that are told in the series are composed of actual experiences of P.O.W. <br /> <br /> The actors were superb; the best being in my opinion, Matthew Newton. His performance as David in the first episode was heartbreaking. From a city dweller to another nameless face for his captors. We see it change drastically in the first episode because of its violent jungle attack, and in other episodes we can see how this event has changed it, it is more aware of what is really going on and is still one of the first to help other members of The Secret Nine. <br /> <br /> Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance in 'Eddie's Birthday' is amazing. It ranges from group larrikin to illness, weakness and inability to take care of itself. The camaraderie demonstrations in this episode affect you emotionally and make you proud to be Australian. <br /> <br /> I study the Second World War at university and I found this series, if not physically truthful, spiritually truthful, as it captures the true spirit of what an Australian soldier was. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to John Doyle for capturing the spirit of Changi.
