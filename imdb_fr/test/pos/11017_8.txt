Niagra Niagra was certainly not the best movie I saw. However, I can not describe what the film made me feel while I saw it, what I felt at the end of the film and how I feel now. Very few movies have such an effect on me. I like them or I do not like them. I consider Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something and it can remind us of something or it can instil fear or fun, etc. This film did not put me in a good mood. In fact, it left me feeling empty. I guess because the lives of these two people were so empty in many ways. They had no direction. Their only direction was to have no direction. They had many problems to settle and, I suppose, had to get away from what could not be a happy life. But on the way things really got worse. A steady decline from where he started. It was sad to play so well and I guess we probably all saw someone in a situation that might look like the situation these people were in. They might have had a good life if they had any idea how. But it is clear that they did not know what to do. So they sort of went to a place they had heard about. No real objective. They did not know how to set a goal. They did not know how to overcome the life that was reserved for them. I felt bad but I could not stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much in a movie that I would not want if anyone played the roles. These two did an excellent job to the point that you did not come to see the role of actor. I am very impressed and I want to buy the movie when it will be available on DVD. You know. I felt a bit like leaving Los Vegas. But again, he's in a class of his own. Not a good movie but well worth an hour or two on a good day. If you are a person with problems, I would not advise you to watch them. It could depress you. It depressed me and I do not have the conditions that these people had. JimmyJoeJetter
