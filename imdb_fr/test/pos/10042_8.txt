The saving grace of this film is its humor. Exploiting the assets of their star, Warner Brothers presents their version of General Custer as a reckless jester, dashing and irreverent, imbued with romanticism and unexpected idealism. It was Robin Hood again and Flynn blossomed into the role. All his best action shots appealed to his talent for evil and comic timing, and this one was no exception. <br /> <br /> It also benefits from the return of former co-star Olivia de Havilland, despite a previous agreement. break the partnership; Libby Custer's share of wit is better than the adorable love-interest genre she was tired of playing for the studio in Flynn's latest movies. to do justice to the party. In this latest collaboration, she accumulates all her acting skills in what is basically an overflowing adventure movie. The chemistry of the screen is revived. For once, she and Flynn have the opportunity to develop their characters beyond the first novel. in an old married couple, with an equally winning effect. <br /> <br /> The Flynn / de Havilland couple and the comedy series are what made the film last, when most of the other Flynn westerns - in such an affection by the contemporary American public, that it is not apparently by their star, have been forgotten for a long time. The scenes of action are rather sketchy (despite, ironically, the death of an extra falling on one of the accusations filmed) and the villains of the room are revealed, in the manner of schoolchildren, be the same people who were horrible for Our Hero. his very first day at West Point, and thus continues to frustrate him throughout his career. It's a little too practical morally. <br /> <br /> However, these are small critics that are largely irrelevant for a film that should never be more than a catchy entertainment. Perfectly aided and abetted by a group of exceptional players (including including Anthony Quinn in an almost silent role as a Sioux leader), Errol Flynn makes his way through the plot with his usual arsenal: a charming sheepish look, a unexpected sweetness, mischievous sparkles, instant indignation, joyous companionship and pure charisma. He is a reckless boaster, but you can not help but appreciate it. And it's hard to leave without the melody of "Garryowen" that trots in your ears for many days. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's great successes; it also contains a surprising amount of good acting and a movie worth remembering.
