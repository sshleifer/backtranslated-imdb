Bride of Chucky starts late into the night as officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the evidence room of his police station and among all the horror movies with joke accessories he steals the remains of the Chucky doll that serial killer Charles Lee Ray had back in the child's original game (1988). He drives the remains to an isolated area where Ray's ex-girlfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), slits his throat and brings the remains back to his caravan. There, Tiffany sews and staples Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) gathers again and uses a book "Voodoo for Dummies" brings him back to murderous life. The thing is not right as Tiffany had hoped and Chucky turns out not to be the man of his dreams, so she locks him in a pen where Chucky is not happy. While Tiffany is taking a bath, Chucky escapes, electrocutes her and uses this book to bring her back to life in the form of a female doll dressed as a bride. They also do not want to get stuck in plastic bodies and have to work together to go to a New Jersey graveyard where Ray's natural body was buried with the amulet needed to convert their minds back into human bodies. The bodies of Tiffany's neighbor, Jesse (Nick Stabile), and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), who are both on the run from the corrupt Jade uncle, Warren Kincaid (John Ritter), chief of police, will do well ... <br /> <Directed by Ronny Yu I love Bride of Chucky. Don Mancini's screenplay is very entertaining, very fast, very entertaining and refers to many horror movies with a lot of affection. From the opening sequence where we see Jason Voorhees hockey mask on Friday 13th, Freddy Krueger's razor-sharp glove from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series and Michael Myers mask from the Halloween franchise. The clips used in Bride of Frankenstein (1935), which reproduces virtually the same scene. Bride of Chucky never takes himself seriously, which is just as good, there are a lot of doublings, self-referential gags that Scream (1996) put in fashion a few years ago and he does not seem to be afraid to make fun of himself and the kind of horror in general. I love the scene where Jesse and Jade chat with a romantic casting conversation that Chucky hears and where he makes funny comments and derogatory gestures. That does not mean that there is not a good movie either because there certainly is one. Director Yu manages to create a good atmosphere and create a real sense of fun. The human and plastic characters are friendly and brilliant, as each couple suffers from their own domestic problems that the trail of corpses they leave would obviously be caused. Technically, Bride of Chucky is great for the most part and has a big sewing budget on it and about $ 25,000,000, I hope so. The only thing I will say is that some of Kevin Yagher's puppet effects are a little stiff and unconvincing. I do not remember scenes in computer graphics in Bride of Chucky. Fortunately, the film does not neglect the blood and blood with a slit throat, nails in the face of someone, probably a tribute to Hellraiser (1987), people impaled on shards of glass, a person lost by a huge truck, a victim torn off. lip piercing and various stab wounds and shots. The acting is pretty good and Dourif like Chucky is very funny because he launches the liners. I also like scenes with Tiffany at the beginning and I find her very sexy when she wears all this fetish clothing, I can not be the only one? Personally, I think Bride of Chucky is a fantastic movie, a total entertainment from start to finish, a sense of humor and horror equal, and in just 85 minutes it never gets boring or boring. One of my personal favorites, watch it as soon as you can!
