Film about two Australian - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and what happens when they become the friends of two guys surfers. in 1981. Technically, I was still a teenager (I was 19), so I was interested to see how Australian teenagers were acting. Script wise, there is nothing new here. It shows the usual teenage adventures regarding dating, sex, suicide, etc. I always knew what was going to happen before, but I was never bored. What I found interesting is that, despite the accent and some changes to the clothes and hair, these teenagers are not very different from American teenagers. They had many of the same difficulties and blockages. It was also based on a real surfer's book and her real adventures and (I heard) it was a faithful adaptation of it. The acting was just ok but the actors were attractive and it was well done and quite interesting. So it's not a misunderstood masterpiece, but a pretty accurate description of what it's like to be a teenager and try to be with popular kids. I give him a 7.
