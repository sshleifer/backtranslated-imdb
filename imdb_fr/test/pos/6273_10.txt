The second part of the ATOR !! Led promptly by JOE D'AMATO, a specialist in all kinds of farming sub-genres, and reinterpreted by MILES O'KEEFFE. the film budget must be ridiculous or minimal. Despite not being a better film than his predecessor not mas entertained, ATOR 2 either, he has something, something that makes him thrilling. Its introduction, according to you, explains the origin of ATOR with images of the first part. The scenario is amazing, it's like any cartoon from the brilliant ROY THOMAS. contains such fantastic elements in the world of SWORD and FANTASY such as invisible men, black gentlemen, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain interpreted brilliantly. The final this fight very well. lack of violence and blood, but this one well. It never gets boring. It has all that was missing at ATOR 1. Let yourself be charmed by me !! 4/5
