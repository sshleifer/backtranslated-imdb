A mix of Alien and Ghost Busters? <br /> <br /> Starts very promising, then slows down to become almost boring. <br /> <br /> LifeForce contains awesome special effects that they were able to produce in the mid-80s. The story is intriguing, but ends up lacking enough luster. He was ranked R because of nudity, sex and gore. The ethereal and wild beauty (nude) of Mathilda May is very apparent throughout the film. A weird and expensive film at the time of its realization. <br /> <br /> It could have been a classic with a better scenario, but unfortunately it was not a big hit. I think the result was a very bad result. <br /> <br /> So there was a problem with this one, but it's still a lot of fun.
