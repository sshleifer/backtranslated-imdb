Based on the manga (comic) of the well-known artist Masamune Shirow, this animated feature film was a slight disappointment to me. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the animation is just "OK" as long as it could / should have been breathtaking. The film conforms to the IMO standard, but seems flat and uninspired, if you know what I mean. A missed opportunity, if we consider that another Shirow's work, "Ghost In The Shell", is considered in many ways as a classic. He set new standards for Japanese animation and gave birth, among other things, to a brilliant series entitled "GiTS: Stand Alone Complex". <br /> <br /> I think it's worth being praised, unless you're a fan of Shirow. and I want everything. Check out the original manga, which is highly recommended.
