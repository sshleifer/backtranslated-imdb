Basically, it's a very good movie. However, it is very different from other Seagal movies, which may unfortunately disable some of its fans. Unlike some other movies, this does not look like a "Seagal vehicle". You'll see a lot of other characters as well and all of Seagal's actions are not the same as we've seen before. The fact that he is an "intellectual" in something other than bombs and other weapons is an interesting change. Although the film has unrealistic parts (some more obvious than others), you can usually let them slide because the movie is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It boils down to this: for a classic Seagal action movie, sorry, but you're going to be disappointed. Look at it anyway for pleasure. If you're ready to see Seagal without the action, it's worth a look. Personally, I think it's one of the best jobs he's done in a while. <br /> <br />
