"The flesh" is difficult to describe with a solid summary because, well, there is no conspiracy. The film shows roughly the day of life of a scammer named Joe (Joe Dallesandro, who is in Louis Malle's underrated picture, "Black Moon") while he's doing his round, asleep and dummy to make money for the abortion of his wife. <br /> <br /> Not much, and as the film lasts eighty-nine minutes, one would think that "Flesh" would be an hour and a half slow and boring. You think badly. The film is made of improvisation, there is no script and the angles of the film are quite pretty, but there is a kind of truth under each image that gives the film its enthusiastically entertaining dynamism. Everything is logical and useful in what happens to Joe that day. He meets a regular client who visibly lies and says he wants to see Joe again, a photographer who talks so much that it bothers him to cry, two drag-queens who read in tabloid magazines while Joe gets the head of a addict to the mouse's voice. who mumbles later about how she wants to be lifted her chest, an old friend of Joe who reads stories of rape to her, then a final scene with his wife and lover echoing the scene at the beginning of the film ( one of the best openings of a movie I've seen for some time) ?? and tells completely the philosophical meaning of the film. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how the messages and styles of the film seem almost timeless, even if it takes place in the 1960s in New York, in real time, in a real place, and is filmed as an obvious independent film of that era. It certainly is not a film that could be made today, which adds to its delicious mystique. <br /> <br /> Powered by unplanned cuts; and missing a score to advance his images ?? "Flesh" is about as raw and realistic as a film about male prostitution in the 1960s.
