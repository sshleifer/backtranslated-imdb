"The Journey" is a romantic version of the Cold War. This is an English woman (Deborah Kerr) who tries to pass her old love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.) out of Hungary during the revolt in Hungary in 1956. She is in a bus with thirteen other international people trying to get out of Hungary by the Austrian border. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bus is stopped by the Russians for a security check. The Russian officer in charge (Yul Brynner) is attracted to the Englishwoman (Deborah Kerr) and delays the trip. Of course, the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist pretending to be a British citizen, but he decides not to stop him because he is waiting for the English woman to come and see him. Of course, it all seems absurd, but it's a fun movie to watch. Despite the romantic dialogue between Mr. Brynner and Ms. Kerr, which seems inappropriate in the situation in which they find themselves, the film becomes suspensive and interesting. The good acting game takes some stupid dialogs. Perhaps some people involved in the Hungarian revolt would not like this film; they would consider this as a piece of down. <br /> <br /> It's my favorite role of Yul Brynner. He speaks with his own male voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is the second time Deborah Kerr has been collaborating with Yul Brynner since the creation of "The King and I" in 1956. They are a very attractive couple. Too bad they never worked again. It was the second sexy role Ms. Kerr had since "From Here to Eternity". Despite the fact that Mrs. Kerr wore heavy winter clothes throughout the film, she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /> <br /> Jason Robards, Jr., in his first film role. Some of the international actors were recognizable, such as Robert Morley from England. However, the rest of the actors, whom I had never seen before, were just awesome in the movie. In the background, it was fun to see Senta Berger, one of the maids, talking a few lines of Hungarian. A few years later, in 1966, she was in a movie, "Cast a Giant Shadow", with Yul Brynner as the main woman. She still works today.
