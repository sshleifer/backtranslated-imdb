I watched it the other night on a local channel because I did not want to watch tripe like "American Idol". Peter Strauss gives an excellent performance as a convict named "Rain" Murphy who stays alone. He admits his crime and does not hide his reason for not being ashamed of it. His cell is devoid of all the comforts that other inmates possess, such as books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is in the race. He does it often and can run a mile in less than four minutes. When a university coach hears about this, he wants to get him to try his luck at the Olympics. At first, "Rain" does not want any of that, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, simply. Strauss is very good (what did you expect, nothing less?) And Michael Mann shows allusions to greatness that would flourish years later. This film had this realism (probably because it was filmed among convicts). It's almost like it's a true story. The extra cast is good. There are many notable names like Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley and Richard Moll as well. <br /> <br /> My heart collapsed when a pompous board did not let him run away because he did not leave him. to feel bad for his crime. His last act made me stand up and applaud. When they took away his dreams, he brought them back hard. It was at the time when TV movies were really good. 'The Jericho Mile' is a movie gem. ESPN Classic, PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM !!!
