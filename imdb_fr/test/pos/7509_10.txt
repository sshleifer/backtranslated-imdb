This film is George C. Scott at his best, Bernard Hughes at his best and Diana Rigg at his greatest magic, and of course Paddy Chaevsky writing at "masterpiece" warp! There are also very short excerpts of future big names like Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, etc., who have a line of scene that you will not necessarily notice before your fifth or sixth time. Nancy Marchand as a young and mid-sized nurse supervisor is also superb, as are almost all the "faces" of Hollywood in 1970. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies that has improves the more we often see it. Watch the scene "surprise" ala "Wait for Dark"! It's one of the few movies I've ever bought on DVD. It is this superb.
