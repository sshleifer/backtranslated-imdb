Lieutenant Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners of his sinking ship land on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). After some random deaths of prisoners, Rackham welcomes Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Fortunately for all, Barbara Bach is also on the island! Unfortunately, there are crazy fishermen who like to kill people. <br /> <br /> This Italian exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with a hint of voodoo WHITE ZOMBE and Atlantis. Despite some hairy fisherman's costumes, the film has a beautiful photograph of place and a pretty turn mid-course. All the actors are good and Joseph Cotton even appears as an old biologist. The director Sergio Martino is doing pretty well because there is action about 10 minutes. The same can not be said for its late follow-up, THE FISHMEN AND THEIR REIN (1995), one of the most zany and most confusing suites since HIGHLANDER II.
