I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and since as long as I know his name, I have also looked for this film. I have been trying to find this movie throughout California for over four years. Last summer, I went on a trip to Europe. One of my missions on this trip was at least to see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and I finally feel satisfied to have seen the first work of Luc Besson. Absolutely amazing character development, very challenging, excellent acting and the ultimate concept movie. If you're a fan of concept concept, it's one of the most original and classic. I think it's rare to see a movie like this, it's risky, unorthodox and ultimately just unique. if you are a fan of Luc Besson, it's really a must, but whether you're a fan of Besson or not, it's definitely an important work, all in all a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema.
