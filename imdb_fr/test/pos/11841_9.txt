This film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the thriller / mystery / murder movies that abound. They are real people who make the best of their lives. They are just Indian and the main characters are part of the police. The realistic game and the beautiful landscapes largely compensate the unlikely plot. The soundtrack is from BC Smith, who also made the soundtrack of Coyote Waits, and she is excellent. Adam Beach plays a tribal policeman who is somewhat prone to accidents and Wes Studi is the stoic professional detective. There are many other roles of Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, both secondary and supportive etc. We also saw Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, which we enjoyed very much.
