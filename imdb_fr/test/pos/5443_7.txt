This movie was advertised as a comedy, but was much more serious than trailers claim. Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but I was expecting more laughs. Excellent performances by Robin Williams and Laura Linney. It's worth the detour, but do not expect to roll over. The film left me wondering what it would be like if Robin Williams was a real person running for president. Would we elect a comedian? I doubt it, unfortunately. This kind of absolute honesty is sorely lacking today. This is a movie that I will add to my DVD library as soon as it comes out on DVD. The film has heart.
