I'm surprised people, after such lousy movies are in the top 250 or just in the 7.0, I thought more people would like "Throw Momma from the Train". It was a great comedy of two comic actors, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together, they formed a great duo of madness and obsession. Billy is a man who has just lost his million dollar story for the benefit of his ex-wife and who wants it on a number of occasions. Danny has a crazy, senile old mother who just mistreats him. When Billy gives Danny "misunderstood" advice, Danny makes a proposal to Billy, if he kills his ex-wife, Billy has to kill his mother. It's a crazy and funny story that can always make you laugh. Please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! It is good! <br /> <br /> 7/10
