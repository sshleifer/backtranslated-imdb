I do not know if the filmmakers intended to make sure that the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this movie. This may be the romantic image that many Americans have at the time of filming this film, as in the middle of the war, Macy came back from the war (her neighbor asks, "Hey, is this true that you have a Fritz there? ") and tries to live his life but one day he recovers a new pair of glasses (hence his name) and sees things clearly while the surrounding situation turns out to be a rabid anti-Semitism, and Macy and Dern could be wrapped up in it. It's funny how neither of them are Jewish in this film but the accusation is made. In addition, it is historically accurate, because the union democrats of that time were wrapped in the flags of America and God. Macy is continually harassed to come to the "meeting". His presence brings unexpected results. <br /> <br /> The application of this period to today is a study in contrast. In 2005, the average citizen who took patriotism and religion to support the Republican Party and who views organized labor as part of left "non-patriotic" America has undergone a complete reversal. <br /> picture to watch, if you want to see the kind, shy and sweet Macy (admirably played by him) get caught up in the carnage of race and hate in the mid-40s in New York. <br /> <br /> A hard, emotionally charged movie.
