Ten respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as a source of inspiration (and music). I will do each one separately: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg (dir) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 in Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad - very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - Verdi. No story, but mesmerizing black-and-white images blend in perfectly with the music. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrible. Useless, boring, no conspiracy, no nothing. Filled with free feminine nudity. The worst! <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris play the leading role in this funny and obvious story of a deceitful couple. Really good. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, lush and romantic. Very well. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Dull. A yawler. <br /> <br /> Fran Roddam - Richard Wagner. This has Bridget Fonda in his film debut. Beautiful love story with a sex scene explicit enough. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. Really strange but OK. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapentier. Lyric gaze on youth and old age. Very sweet. <br /> <br /> The last is from Bill Bryden doing "I Pagliacci". He has John Hurt (!) Dressed as a clown synchronized with Caruso (!!!). <br /> <br /> When this came out, he almost got an X (for abundant nudity and sex scene). He was given an R with a strict warning attached saying that the R rating would be heavily enforced. After the bombing of the film, this warning disappeared. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad and 6 out of 10 segments were worth it. To see even if you do not like opera. Just avoid the Godard segment. I give him an 8.
