Not being a fan of the Coen brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I had at the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time, it was these zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing "their thing" at one of the great works of literary history. Who would ever have thought that Homer had this in mind? I do not know where this film will fit in Hollywood history books, but it will be in mine and in many other DVD or VHS libraries. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with some Gumpesque celebrities, outstanding performances of Clooney, Turturro, Nelson and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter. Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the South, I wish more people would make fun of this genre. They even cite an adaptation of the rural south soundtrack. You do not do anything better this weekend, see this movie! <br /> <br />
