This wonderful film contains many elements that make a family comedy fun, fun, sweet and memorable, it's hard to decide where to start. <br /> <br /> According to the opening number, "Rainbow Connection", the excellent Paul Williams score sung with enthusiasm by Kermit D. Frog, who gives us a prologue of the adventure throughout history is a funny movie <br /> <br /> It's essentially a travel film, where Kermit travels across the country with the dream of pursuing a "rich and famous contract" to entertain. Along the way, our green hero meets a series of actors, comedians, singers and budding musicians who, coincidentally, are muppets like Kermit himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? "Basically, how it went," says Kermit. <br /> <br /> It's not since "It's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" that the cameo formula has been used in such a prolific and fruitful way. Stars in the making meet many recognizable faces during their odyssey; some are flashing on the screen, but others have memorable cameos. Steve Martin is fun as a rude server. Edgar Bergen, puppeteer Jim Henson, is particularly touching. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has ever watched the show Muppets will be able to see all their favorite characters, they are all here. The puppet work is beautiful; especially looking for Kermit to ride a bike (how does it work?) Jokes and references to old movies are ubiquitous, but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit itself. An example: when the scammers terrorize Kermit and Piggy, she affectionately says to her small and beautiful green: "I would not give up tonight together for anything, would I?" "Uh, make me an offer ...." I also love the shooting of the OK Corral scene: brilliant and absurd stupidity. <br /> <br /> I have to get into the job now, but to summarize: A good film that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of the age or taste of the genre of film. Highly recommended.
