Two Hands has restored my faith in Australian films. It took an old place and made it fresh. I enjoyed this endless movie. I recommend it to those who like Guy Ritchie's movies. Bryan Brown was fantastic and almost perfect in a role tailor-made for him. Ledger was perfectly stupid and his performance anchored a very satisfying movie for me.
