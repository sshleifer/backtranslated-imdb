I own all the family seasons so far and I must say that Vol. 6 was the biggest disappointment of all. There is still a lot of laughter to find here but I think that Vol. 6 as the latest volumes slowly provides less and less laughter. At least for me. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I had with Vol. 6 is it seems to be very heavy in left politics. I firmly believe that if you can laugh at others, you should be able to laugh at yourself, but this volume REALLY seems to upset their political views and I think that takes a lot out of the show. Insinuated, all conservative states are horrible places, insinuating that we need more gun control, insinuated schools are underfunded, insinuated religious are crazy, Bush is devil's friend .. I could go on and this only applies to the first three episodes Of course, some of these things were funny, but it becomes a time when you do not do a comedy and you just push your political opinions to other people.
