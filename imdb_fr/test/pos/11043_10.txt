The magnificent Greta Garbo is in top form for the first time. She gets good support from the rest of the cast, including Charles Bickford, the sturdy sailor who captures his heart. Ms. Garbo gives an excellent performance, as she usually does as a daughter of a naval captain, who returns after fifteen years. The great actress Marie Dressler is also part of the cast. A good film!
