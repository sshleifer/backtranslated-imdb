I went to see that thinking that it would be a great comedy and a return for Robin Williams, but when I saw it, I realized that the advertisers had lied to me, because it was more of a drama than the comedy , even if there are some very good laughs there. I felt like watching two movies. One was a joke with Robin Williams that should have been the whole pelvis for the movie, but you also get a techno thriller movie with political agony in the middle. I really do not know how to classify this movie. But I can tell you it was good and I laughed, not as much as I had hoped, but at least Williams is back in the right direction. See this, but know before you leave that it's not all comedy and is a bit intense.
