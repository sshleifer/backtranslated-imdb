An almost wonderful mix of comedy, romance and medical chaos with a single doctor danced in his fifties, tired of going to rock concerts with nubile heads, attending a patient of his age whom he met at of his tours. Julius Epstein's screenplay shows a lot of sophistication, even if he does not have enough material to fill the last third of the image, and you can almost feel the film slipping. The subplot relating to the hospital being investigated for its poor-quality business affairs has not been satisfactorily developed, and in any case it seems extremely concocted. Nevertheless, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a great team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney very friendly. The director, Howard Zieff, continues to be talked about, and even when the one-liners of Epstein have the impression that Neil Simon rejects them, Zieff continues his journey with joy. The results are serenely attractive and sometimes quite sweet. Followed by a failed television series. *** of ****
