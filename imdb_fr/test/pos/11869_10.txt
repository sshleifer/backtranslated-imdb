this film makes me laugh even thinking about it. such an intelligent comedy! very accurate but easy. the casting can not be better. all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play exactly the best, and there is no stupid laugh or screaming through the entire movie. the layers and the progress of the story work perfectly together and the rhythm runs smoothly. the best of all is that when the Village People's YMCA is registered, it highlights the importance of Indian status, which was only briefly mentioned in the film, which is the brightest and funniest highlight among many comedies. I give him a dozen times especially that comedies are so underrated.
