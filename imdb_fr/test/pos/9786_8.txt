Milo is a neglected, underestimated horror film from the late '90s, but the atmosphere and atmosphere are more like a 1980s horror film. It looks like a group of little girls are led to "see things" at the office of Milo's father, a gynecologist, and as a reward for seeing what's in jars (yes, a gynecologist and something else ...) a girl "doctor" with Milo. Hmm, his first patient and he lost it. Now, Milo is a terrifying little boy who always wears a veil of yellow rain, rain or shine, and he talks funny ... but that's not all that's strange about him. Fast forward to the present where these girls are adults and a wedding is planned for one of them but the tragedy strikes and leaves to a girl coming from outside the city the choice to replace or not her friend in as a teacher, what she does. And then strange things start to happen again. Which of course involves this little boy in an icy rain. It's not overly violent or graphic, but has distinct goose bumps that are not found in many modern horror movies, and it's worth the detour. One wonders why it's so hard to find good horror movies nowadays, but here is one that is criminally neglected and really worth it if you take a look at it. . 8 out of 10
