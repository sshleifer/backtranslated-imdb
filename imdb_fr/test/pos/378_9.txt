Interview with Hitchcock, a book the size of Truffaut, it is obvious that the fear of police Big Al dates back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station with a note. The note said, "He was mean, imprison him for an hour." The police are obliged and since Hitchcock deeply fear to be falsely accused and taken away by the police. <br /> <br /> "Strangers in a train" is probably one of the best in his series of "unjustified defendants". The film is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith. This is the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She has always been fascinated by malicious criminals. <br /> <br /> The opening of Hitchcock is very strong and leads you immediately to the protagonists: Guy Haines, famous tennis player, and Bruno Anthony, the criminal in the making. The two men share a chemistry that at that time was probably much more than the public could chew. Bruno tries to persuade Guy that they could commit the perfect murder (without leaving any clues), if they exchange their victims. Bruno is going to kill Guy's wife who would not want to divorce and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The motivations are respectively love and money. <br /> <br /> Bruno's performance is seductive and homo-erotic. It's not something that was done by accident. In fact, Hitchcock has published two versions of the film: an American and a British. In the American version, Bruno's seduction volume has been slightly diminished. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is a very deep film, but more importantly, it's another great Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of a thrilling scene is when Guy climbs the steps of Bruno's father's room. Hitchcock felt that public attention should be distracted at this point so they do not understand what Guy will find in the room. Hitch treats us into a huge threatening dog at the top of the stairs, which provides the necessary distraction. <br /> <br /> The film's most famous shot takes place during a tennis match. Bruno constantly harassed Guy so that he could fill his share of the market (kill his father). When Guy looks at the audience, all heads turn around. All but one - Bruno. He looks at Guy with a smile "I'll get you". <br /> <br /> The end is another example of suspense. The two men are fighting over a key piece of evidence in a carousel that is running at breakneck speed. A worker crawls underneath to access the controls. When we have finally finished our ride and the film ended with proof of its innocence, we are exhausted and without anything (for those of us who are biting their nails!). <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is easily one of Hitchcock's best films "wrongly accused". Some also attribute to him one of the best villains (Bruno). Overall, the movie may seem a little out of date, but it's a thriller lesson made by the master himself. I will not refuse Leonardo, if he came to teach me the painting of the Renaissance, you should not do it either. <br /> <br /> << Comment posted to FilmDailies.com >>
