Being from the east of the Palestinian Authority right on the border of northern New Jersey, I always feel that this documentary is more than a movie. I have friends from New York and New Jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that "still exists" in low-income areas outside the "Big City" lifestyle. If you have not seen this movie and never wondered what was really happening in the urban jungle, take a look at this movie. Not really big actors, it's as if they had just released these guys from the street and say they play, which adds to the realism of the film. The performances are nevertheless FANTASTIC! SEE THIS FILM!
