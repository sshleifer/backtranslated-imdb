Nurse Betty was without a doubt one of the most creative films ever published. It was funny, but it also had a lot of touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear and the rest of the cast made their characters incredibly strange. The story took a turn such that it was incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're fed up with recent movies, check out Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie at the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!
