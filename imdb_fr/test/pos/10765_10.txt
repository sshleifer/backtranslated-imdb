I was lucky to see this at this year's Tribeca Film Festival. I was stunned by the quality of the realization and the distraction of this wonderful little film. Filmmaker Griffin Dunne did a great job assembling this multi-character film and several scenarios that fit so well. The main story involves the family and it is a very stimulating and engaging story that has involved the viewer in every scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, while retaining this commercial advantage: an "independent" film for the masses, if you prefer. The performances of the actors are all excellent but Diane Lane shines the most. Diane Lane is simply stunning in this wonderful film and should be nominated for Oscars. The first few days, I know, but Lane plays her down here.
