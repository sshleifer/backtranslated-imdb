Gives as much resemblance to Dean Koontz's novel as Jessica Simpson with a rocket scientist. If you have read the book, I suggest you leave it as far as possible from your mind before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Watchers is your typical "A boy meets a dog, it turns out to be great An experiment in a smart government lab, a dog and a boy are pursued by a super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by the same lab, and, oh yes, did I mention the dubious agents of the government chasing the monster chasing the dog? "movie. <br /> <br /> Corey Haim is the boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the government crazy, and Sandy the dog is, well, the dog (named Furface here; Einstein in the book). <br /> <br /> The effects of monster are ridiculously ridiculous, much of the dialogue is laughable, the script is rarely understandable or credible - a good example is the unreserved acceptance by Haim's character of intelligence the dog, as if every street Fido can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no! Hmm, it must be the chow chow, right? Haim's performance is enthusiastic but fragile, as he leads the silly dialogue with as little address as possible. Ironstone has been the highlight of many bad movies, and this is no exception. It easily gives the best performance of the film, although I have to add that the dog (which is itself a good actor!) Comes in second place. <br /> <br /> In summary, atrociously silent film, and yet. . . And yet, I watched it three times in a week. And yet I can not help but appreciate it. Hey, what can I say, I have a taste for junk food - and Michael Ironside (although I've never tasted Michael Ironside - I'm sure there are laws against that). But any movie that can make me laugh so loud (yes, even involuntarily) can not be so bad. It's a guilty pleasure, a film "yes, I know it's insulting, but I love it anyway". <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to evaluate that. On a normal scale, I'm forced to give him a D-, but on my own cheese balance, he runs into an A.- <br /> <br /> Yeah, I know. I am weird like that.
