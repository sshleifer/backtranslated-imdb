This was the second cinemascope show that Fox produced after the dress. Notice how some of the Roman sets are corrected to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all the elements of first class, beautiful photographs, a moving soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer has composed specific scenes). However, the main game is a little weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is not interesting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as Babylonian temptress "Nefer". I find that this film in general is strong on the plot, which is rare for these great shows produced at the time. Overall, the film is an interesting and entertaining social commentary on what Egyptian society could have looked like.
