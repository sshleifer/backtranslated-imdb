If you have not seen it yet, you really should, on DVD. I can not believe how much I enjoyed that! It's incredibly realistic and believable. Admittedly, much of it is speculative, and I would have liked to know more about what was speculative and about the proven facts (they are few), but it goes rather well with a theme "Cruel Mother Nature". This will remind you of the nature programs you saw on Animal Planet and Discovery Channel. Only animals here are dinosaurs. They act naturally; they eat, kill, mate, play and fight for their survival. You will find yourself rooting for some and against others. <br /> <br /> The effects are generally excellent. Sometimes they will look a bit too much like CGI, but you'll see them from a different angle that makes them more realistic. In some cases, you will actually be convinced of seeing a dinosaur. My favorites were Coelophysis, raptors, diplodocus, iguanadons, allosaurus and arctic bipeds. However, I was very disappointed by the T-Rex, which sometimes seemed a bit too computer-generated. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should definitely see this production. It's educational, well done and very fun. For what it is, it's an A!
