This must be one of my 3 favorite episodes of the original TV series. <br /> <br /> What makes him great is the battle of mind between The Romulan Commander and Kirk, as well as the leading role of Mark Lenard, who later played Spock's father in other episodes of television and movies. This is a case where people of about have reached the level of talent that surrounds them and where Shatner, Nimoy and the entire cast deliver an outstanding performance in this episode. and I like the direct approach used to show us the characters, feelings and thoughts of these characters, and their freedom of expression expressed by the actors. <br /> <br /> This very entertaining episode is ranked 10th out of 10. AWESOME !! Desert Buddha
