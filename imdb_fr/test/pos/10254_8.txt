... instead, look at it as a big story of becoming an adult on African-American men in the mid-1960s in the Chicago ghettos. For anyone under the age of 50, "What's Happening" is a light and bizarre sitcom with very few four-year (1975-1979) serious moments involving a group of African-American high school students living in a working class neighborhood. I really liked - it has no real connection with this movie. "Cooley High" started as the basis of "What's Happening," but its serious nature did not fit into the test audiences. So it was redone as a comedy, although the credits of "What's Happening" still indicated that it was so. based on this film. <br /> <br /> This film begins with light, but tackles many aspects of life that are characteristic of the turbulent 1960s and other timeless aspects of growth. The guys talk about sex, betrayal, unemployment, despair and even early death. The end is quite powerful and serious, and the film has an excellent Motown soundtrack. Highly recommended. Unfortunately, this film is not new enough to be broadcast on premium cable channels and is not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few movie theaters.
