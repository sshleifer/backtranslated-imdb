Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not a total success. The Ultimate Challenge is of course the price of admission alone, but again, as for many Mania, there is too much filling between the two. The crowd appears for almost everything and, as always, provides us with the reliable Gorilla & The Body advertising team. Having a Face vs Face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania was absolutely unheard of at that time, it just made things even more tense. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Koko B. Ware / Frankie V "The model" Rick Martel. For a match of about 3 minutes, it's as good as it can be. I wish it was a little longer, but what I got was really good. Martel wins, with the Boston crab. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Team Championship. Demolition Vs Colossal Connection | C | / W Bobby Heean. Huge Pop for demolition. The match itself is pretty dull, I often had trouble paying attention. Andre really did not do much, so in a sense it was more like a 2 in 1. There is a strong talent involved here, and it's a pity they can not produce better. Demolition wins this title, with the Pattened maneuver at the top. The crowd blows the roof of the finish. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Earthquake / W Jimmy Hart. Against Hercules, I got what I was expecting here, a boring fill match, with Earthquake doing its job. I'm not really a fan of either, so it did not really interest me. Quake wins with his seated splash. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Brutus Beefcake Vs Mr.Pefect / W The genius. Deafening pop for Bruti. Really good match up, with unfortunately not enough time given to develop even further. This really caught my interest and remains one of my favorites on the map. Beefcake wins with a slingshot at the pole, to the approval of the crowd. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper vs. Bad News Brown. HUGE pop for Piper. Nothing more than a boring fight, who does not know what she wants to be. Some fun antics of The Hot Rod, but nothing else. Remarkable for Roddy painting himself half-black and calling himself "Hot Scott" <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation against the Bolsheviks. Record beaten, but other than that, nothing to see here. Harts wins with, The Hart Attack. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The barbarian / W Bobby Heenan. Titan Santana. Average for the time he had, but observable anyway. The crowd was rather dead for her, except for Heenan's intervention. Jessie's hilarious cracks, about Tito's food is more fun, so the game itself. The barbarian wins with a loose and flying clothesline. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed match. Dusty and sapphire / W Elizabeth. Vs Macho King & Sherri. I'll add that it's a big pop for Dusty and a bigger one for Elizabeth, who looks absolutely gorgeous. I thought it was OK. It was lively at least, so nothing so great. I'm not a fan of Dusty 'so. Dusty and Sapphire win when she rolls Sherri. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> The Orient Express / W Fuji. Vs The Rockers. The crowd is rather anemic for this, surprisingly. Decent probably, but with these guys involved, it should have been better. Constant attention to Fuji is a bit of a drag on the game. Express wins by counting when Janetty gets salt. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jim Duggan vs. Dino Bravo / W Earthquake & Jimmy Hart. Duggan, like an idiot, brings out the American flag in Canada. Duggan gets a lot, but it may also be due to Bravo's Canadian legacy. A bad match all around, I do not care about Duggan, but that's not why it was so bad. Too short in the end, to really count. Duggan wins when he hits Bravo in the back, with the two by four. Duggan is splashed for his troubles. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Million Dollar Championship. Ted Dibiase | C | / W Virgil. Vs Jake Robers / W Damien. Some slow points, but when everything was said and done, I had a lot of fun. Two strong wrestlers who gave everything, gave rise to an entertaining match. The crowd visibly attracts Ancy at times, making the wave. Dibiase wins by counting. Jake has the last word in giving some of his money, to the delight of the audience. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> Big Bossman vs. Akeem / W Slick. Nice pop for The Bossman. Too routine and too short to really say anything, finally. Akeem was a gadget, I never liked it too much. Bossman wins with his slam. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Rhythm & Blues segment was a failure. The crowd was not in <br /> <br /> Rick Rude / W Bobby Heenan. Vs Jimmy Snuka. For a refill match before the main event, it was not so bad. If he had had time to go further, he would have been excellent, that's for sure. Rude wins, with Rude Awakening. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Title for the title. Ultimate Warrior | IC champion | Vs Hulk Hogan | WWF Champion | This one talks about the atmosphere of the crowd and the reaction of the crowd, mainly. Warrior had a pretty decent sound, but in my opinion it was a little disappointing. Hogan surpasses him completely, with his. This is one of the best Wrestlemania matches in history. With two people who are not really known for their fight, they have managed to create an incredible match that makes people talk for centuries. I've seen it many times, and my level of respect is growing for all of them, for their efforts, given that I'm not a fan of either. Even hardcore fanatics who yearn for pure struggle can not criticize this one! The warrior wins with his splash. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Lower result. Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry, if anything exceptional. It's memorable for the main event, the location and the crowd, but it's not one of the best if you ask me. That said, I appreciate it and recommend it to other wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> 7/10
