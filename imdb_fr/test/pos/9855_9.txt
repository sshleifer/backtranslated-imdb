What a crazy movie! It lasts 12 (!) Hours and you do not understand who these people are and what they do! The main plot concerns a group of clueless actors trying to produce "Prometheus" a lot of subplots, like the disappearance of Thomas and a madman looking for Mr. Warok ... what is the meaning of all this ???
