Anne Frank's diary is the second best-selling fiction book in the world, and for good reason. Nevertheless, watching this documentary about his life, which informs some of the details in which the newspaper stopped, I thought, "Just another documentary on Anne Frank." I found it competent but not extraordinary. It was my complacent attitude because I was already well aware of Anne Frank's story; most of what the documentary had to tell me was not news to me. <br /> <br /> Everything changed, however, when I came to the end of the documentary - when I saw Anne Frank's movie. The emotional impact of seeing these images, barely a second, made everything that preceded it a thousand times more real - but not just all that was in the documentary; Everything I knew about Anne Frank suddenly became more real, more personal. His story always moved me, but when I saw that footage, what I felt was stronger, deeper, and deeper than any other cinematic experience in my life. (I knew beforehand that this documentary contained live images of Anne Frank and that I even saw these images in a film review on television, but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience. It's unlikely to ruin everyone here.) <br /> <br /> I realize now that many people still do not know the story of Anne Frank; it is sometimes discouraging to witness this kind of ignorance. I say to myself, "How could anyone know the story of Anne Frank?" That being said, though, ANNE FRANK: Remember, with reading her diary, is the best place to start. It's a story everyone should know.
