Another classic Raquel Welch! This image was released on November 10, 1969 with Raquel Welch as Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is about to meet her friends Michele and Jackie. On her way, she meets her ex-husband who wants a second chance. Nikki walks away from him and goes to the table where she sees Michele and Jackie. Alan approaches again and she starts to get away from Alan when she pulls him in the back. Nikki is taken to the hospital while Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michele goes to the hospital where she meets Jackie to find that Nikki is dead. Alan then chases Jackie, which he hits with a car, then tries to overthrow Michele. Michele jumps in her car and heads for Los Angeles. Once there, she calls Lloyd to Las Vegas, her boss, to let her know she's okay. Lloyd tells him to go to the club to call the losers to see Jeri about a job. However, there is a problem! The bartender has a drug problem and Alan knows it. Alan and the barman talk a little. Back in Los Angeles, Michele not only gets a job as a dancer with Jeri, but also collaborates with Jeri, the Joe bouncer. Now some thoughts on this picture! This image was much better than Raquel last, and this one had a non-stop action. Luke Askew played very well to Nikki, his ex-husband. He was your typical murder with the look that goes with it. Regarding the performance of Raquel Welch, the only word that comes to me is fantastic. She was great in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before. The outfit she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking. In fact, all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking. Of course, no matter what Raquel wore because she looks great in all or nothing. I give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons. The first and by far is Raquel Welch who is the main actress and deserves 10 stars. The second reason is that this movie has been an end-to-end excitement from start to finish.
