Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I start? Years of hard work have paid off for what is undoubtedly one of the best documentaries ever created. <br /> <br /> The images and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries bearing the Attenborough stamp, are rare and have not even been known by most people. This alone should be reason enough to buy this series, especially if you are the curious type who wants to know. <br /> <br /> Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It becomes a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode. How many ways can different sea creatures swim, kill, poop, mate and lay eggs, and should all these ways really be explored? But if you have a deep interest in marine life, this repetition should not become a problem for you.
