This film caught me from the start. We see a beautiful teenager visiting a grave, and Elton John's powerful song, "Friends", begins to be interpreted as she walks alone in the streets of Paris with a suitcase, naively ignorant of car theft and the prostitution that was going on around her. The whole film is a magnificent, dreamy and romantic collection of young love scenes, holding hands, living in the countryside, wild horses running freely, fields of wildflowers, sunsets, wine toasts, evenings at the corner of the fire, fun and general innocence, all put on romantic music by Elton John. It's magic. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I missed seeing this film growing up. I'm sure it would have left a strong impression if I had seen it then. I remember the radio advertisement for the 1971 film, explaining that it was a special film made up of Elton John's music and the chorus of the theme song "Friends" that appeared in the advertisement ("Makin ..."), but at that time I never heard of it and I never saw it until I rented it 35 years later in a video store. At that time, the film had been edited, censored and all sorts of unfortunate people on angry political agendas were using all sorts of ugly words to describe the film. What can I say? Since then, the world has gone mad. <br /> <br /> The story goes that a 14 year old girl is forced to settle with her cousin in Paris after the death of both her parents. (It was their grave that she was visiting in the opening scene.) One day, while visiting the zoo alone, she met a 15 year old boy, they got along well and agreed to meet the next day. The next day, while driving together, the boy accidentally drove his car into a lake in a monstrous car accident. It was his father's car, he could not bear to go home to face the anger of his father, so the two teenagers began to live together in the French countryside, with the reciprocal past they hated both of them. They settle in a vacant cottage, the boy acquires small jobs to support himself, their supposed friendship turns into love, the girl gets pregnant and manages to have a baby at home. All the while, the police are trying to find his missing son. On the first anniversary of the couple's theft, the police finally located their employer through an in-person investigation. She was told she could see him the next morning when he comes to work. The next morning, we see the boy leave his cottage to go to work, say a sweet goodbye to his girlfriend / wife and happily do the wheel while the scene freezes on the fact that his girlfriend beckons him goodbye . At least that's how the video version I saw ends. It is an unexpected but timely ending, presumably illustrating the last moments of happiness before the boy is brought back to his parents and his happy life with his wife and baby is broken. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as the story and the images are, the plot is terribly unrealistic and highly artificial. I think it's better to just enjoy the film as an imaginary dream of a young person and not to go further in the analysis, because any logic and credibility quickly collapse when the analysis is deepened. Why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and unvisited for a full year? What did they plan to do when the owners came back? Why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant? Did not they think it was unethical to use the homes and food of others? How could they expect to get dental care or other emergency medical care while living outside of society? How could the boy have a car accident on a country road without collision or any other car around? Where are there places close to civilization where wild horses run freely? How is it that a teenager does not have sex as the main concern when he takes a girl to a zoo? (The lyrics of Elton John's song simply do not fit.) Why would they take off their clothes when they sleep outside at night when it's cold? Etc. The wild horse scenes are designed to appeal to girls, as is the unrealistic theme of "friendship before romance", as well as all the backwash and tickling scenes with predictable results, the flowering fields that cross, the mist filters, the scenes filmed through the wildflowers in the foreground, the baby ducks, etc. It works, but it's really artificial. <br /> <br /> Yet it's a film about youth and freedom, and that ideal has not changed since the 1970s. Today's youth are still treated as property or lost animals, which must be recovered by the police instead of being treated as mature human beings who have the same needs for romantic love and freedom as the adult world and who have the capacity to be responsible for freedom. Therefore, the message is universal. Why would not a suite work? It is clear that this story speaks of a magic reprieve, which lasts a year, of the real world. Such a situation could never have been prolonged indefinitely, assuming that it could even occur in the first place, and a story about real life later would lack the magical appeal of such a state of existence as well. unreal. I really hope no teenager took the film seriously enough to try such a stupid waterfall. But I also hope that the teenagers impressed by this film in the 70s have learned something and have since tried to make this magical world a more realistic reality for others, instead of perpetuating the various hatreds and repressions of the society, especially about their own children.
