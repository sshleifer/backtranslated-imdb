Leos Carax is brilliant and one of the best filmmakers and cameramen in the industry. It is not surprising then that Pola X is an almost perfect shoot of the most heartbreaking story of all time. Seriously. If I could find a way to climb inside my video monitor, I would have crushed Peter within an inch of his life. Nobody has the right to be as absorbed and stupid as him, except perhaps Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights of Emily Bronte. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a big glass of brandy. I have never been so angry with a main character. Okay, that said, Pola X is a breathtaking movie that contains one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in a movie. here, by the way. Pola X will beat you to hell, so make sure you're ready to do it if you decide to watch it.
