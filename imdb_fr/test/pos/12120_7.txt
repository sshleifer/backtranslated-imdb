One of the first works by Fuller (a veteran himself) is of average quality, but precisely touches the many conflicting aspects of life in post-war Germany. The main character begins the film in April 45 as Sgt with C Co, 157th Inf, 45th Div, which really ended the war in Munich, as in the film. (The same unit in the previous month had fought hard in Aschaffenburg, and then released some of the Dachau facilities). For the uninformed, the film may seem confusing by switching between showing the good and the bad of the German people. But all those who have been there or who have at least read the text know that most of what is described in the film are things that really happened in Germany 45-47. The only inaccuracy that I noticed is minor: during a boat cruise on the Rhine, he passes the remains of the Remagen bridge. But his unit really crossed the south of there, north of Worms, Germany.
