As another IMDb critic puts it, "... imagine 2001: an odyssey of space in the desert" and you will not be far from a brief summary of what to expect from this movie (I deeply hesitate to use word "film"). A lecture on philosophical views on creationism, the myth surrounding the existence of the human sciences, before and after, was, what is and what will be. For some, maybe a "2001" on the sand, but they address different philosophical views, one on evolution and the future, hope and potential of humanity, while Fata Morgana itself is a bit more metaphysical. I only hope that I will be able to convey it effectively enough. <br /> <br /> The Herzogs style will not please everyone, and those who are not perceived as a perceived part of the film scene perceived as hardcore may find it very likely and find it extremely difficult, and risky even not to go to the end of its final after 72 minutes. Fata Morgana merges a montage of images of the Sahara, including villages, villagers and various other places for a slightly surreal end, music of various genres and an almost mythical narrative. Fata Morgana is extremely slow, but ultimately very rewarding. <br /> <br /> For starters, with a montage of several filmed shots of planes landing for nearly five minutes, you've already arrived at the film's introduction, extremely confused, and the feeling that it will not look like nothing that you have seen before the echoes are clear in your mind. Divided into three parts, creation, paradise and golden age, Fata Morgana tries and juxtaposes images of the natural beauty of the desert with the instruments made by the man who tarnish it. Its three segments are told by different people, each specifically belonging to the section they express, and emphasize the long soliloquies and montages of the desert. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a film about the existence of man on our earth. It examines the natural beauty for which the Earth was designed and, at the same time, the beauty potential that we have in us, shows us in particular our negative contributions to the world in which we live. Each shot was purposefully constructed, using what can only be described in the context of this film as "The Holy Trinity of Filming" in pictures, lyrics and music. Each part of these three pieces provides something special for each shot, but once they are together, they create something bigger than all their parts, they create unbridled beauty and deep thought in our minds. I will not be able to make this film the justice it deserves with simple words, maybe if I had images and a score, and I know it will not be appreciated by the masses, but it's profound and I will not use the term "art film" because it is only art. It's a moving art that moves the mind and moves the soul. Whether or not creationism is your wish is unimportant, as this film speaks of intelligent design.
