The thoroughness of what is involved in making a flight is what makes this movie one of the best of all heist movies. Then there's the robbery itself, a ruthless thirty-minute word that has never been overtaken, followed by what is probably the most egregious example of disgrace among movie thieves, as things start. to crumble dramatically, all heist movies. <br /> <br /> It was a hard film without resentment when it first appeared in 1955, and so does today. (He shows some of the edgy brutality of Dassin's "Brute Force"). There is no flabby moment or duff in the whole movie and Dassin captures the middle of shabby clubs and Parisian lanes like no one else and the final journey to Paris by a dying man is one of the closing sequences of more emblematic any movie. A classic.
