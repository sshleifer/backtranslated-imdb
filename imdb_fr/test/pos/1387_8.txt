Okay, I'm just going to disagree with the past comments that criticized this show. I think this show is great. (I mean when Jasmin Weber was always on and Franzi was still alive, so addictive!). And I was surprised to learn that it was a soap because it just did not look the same and feel like the soaps in America. The soaps here are absolutely horrible! At least the on-site GZSZ movies contain real music and more plausible scenarios. In addition, the role played by GZSZ is generally credible, especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff. (In addition, soap actors are among the hardest workers in the company because they have the most demanding work schedules). If his odds are so high, something must be done; The American soap operas are presented by day and, historically, they have always obtained exceptional ratings. Give GZSZ a chance! Believe me, it's good!
