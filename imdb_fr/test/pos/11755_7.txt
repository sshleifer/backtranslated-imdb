This film will probably be too sentimental for many viewers, especially for the contemporary audience. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this film largely thanks to the thrilling charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are really comforting scenes between the duo and the talent of these two actors save what, in less important hands, could have been banal. Hong Kong's cinematography of the filming period is another highlight of this film. Overall, a romantic drama better than the average, 7/10.
