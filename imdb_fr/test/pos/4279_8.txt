Fellowe's drama about the marriage of a couple who is threatened by a younger third party who interests the housewife (Watson). Wilkinson plays very well the role of the troubled husband who can not control the cheating of his wife and deals with the problem. I also like Rupert everett very much in his role as William Bule, the man with whom Watson has an affair. Although I think Emily Watson is a great actress, the way her character was written did not make me too friendly (I know a cheater is not supposed to be nice, she had no reason behind them) . The scenario was perhaps the weakest part of this drama, although Fellowes' management is good and the performances are also pretty good. This film is better than Infidel, but is by no means a masterpiece. --- IMDB rating: 6.7, my grade: 8/10
