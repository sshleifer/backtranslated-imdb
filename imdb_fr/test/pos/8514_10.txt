Like most people who watched James Bond 007 movies. Most people never knew that Thunderball was behind the first 007 Film to be released, but after Ian Fleming, wrote the story with Kevin Mcclory and Jack Whittingham. The other two authors sued Ian Fleming and won the case by providing evidence that Fleming had taken over the ideas of SPECTER (Special Executive Counter Intelligence Terrorism Revenge Extortion). So rather than doing Thunderball, they (fleming, broccoli, saltzman) continued to make Dr. NO. <br /> <br /> This movie had the best of the best, To get bullshit sean back again, he was paid over 5,000,000 for NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery had problems on the set, that's right. But overall, this movie was excellent, with (Thunderball, License To Kill, Dr. No), these are my favorite of the bond series. David Dryer was hired for Special Photographic Effects, he was working on Bladerunner at the time before ever saying it again. The $ 100 million yacht makes the flying disco look like a canoe. This film played the best Villian in a bond movie just behind dr no. Klaus Maria Brandeau held this neurotic affair together calmly, with a little wit for her authority over the link. Barbara Carrera was excellent as fatima blush. <br /> <br /> The music was better than all the scores where John Barry was doing the background music in most movies. Michel Legrand is not big in the United States compared to Europe, he has played with miles Davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years. It's sometimes a bit bland, but the 007 theme that appears three or four times in the movie NEVER say that NEVER, IT'S SO cool, I like it more than the original. <br /> <br /> 007 is back One More Time <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton did a good job explaining what I thought, you CAN NOT CONNECT WITH A SUPERMAN OR SUPERHERO, he or she must be human and have feelings. He was by far the BEST SERIOUS SERIOUS OF FLEMINGS BOND VERSION. But Sean Connery proves that he can still play the role that has led him and others to follow him. I bet at 75, he could still play a role of villain in a movie of MCCLORY 007, if any. <br /> <br />
