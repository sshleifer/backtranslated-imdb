In fact, William Girdler was an opportunist who was looking for an element of action regarding everything that was popular at the time. I mean, a blaxploitation movie in Louisville, Kentucky ... who would you believe it?!?! I can only imagine how enthusiastic he must have been for Pam Grier, a hot topic, to be the star of his photo. If you know the genre well, Sheba, Baby of Girdler, do not go away too far from the formula. Despite a change of location, the film still speaks of a ruthless businessman called Shark, who shoots funds on lending companies, using consorts to threaten them to get their signature. <br /> <br /> Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former police officer from Louisville who works in Chicago and returns home at the request of her father's partner, Brick (Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Sheba's father, despite Shark's intimidating tactics (his man in town is Pilot, a Wannabe gangster equipped with slippers that are not so menacing, rather jocular in nature, so meager that they engage men struck outside the city to shoot himself at the Shayne Loan Building), will not give up his business and it costs him his life when a warning by the use of brute force has killed him. Sheba will take revenge on all those responsible for the death of his father. In other words, Shark's ass is budding. Can you dig it? <br /> <br /> See Grier with a magnum is enough to sell this film in particular, the novelty of the place being in Louisville. You can even watch a speedboat chase, Grier shootout with gangsters (..not necessarily the most refined kind that we can be used to seeing in Chicago or New York during this blaxploitation period), a lot of blood gushing from gaudy bullets. bodies torn by shots and colorful characters (like a ready-to-wear shark in pimp suit named Walker and Pilot, who is one of the least scary gangsters you're likely to see) who during the movie, most have the misfortune to come into contact with a very angry Sheba. The plot itself is nothing special, but Grier still deserves to be watched and Girdler orchestrates many action sequences to entertain his target audience. A modest success for Girdler, and one of his most accomplished films.
