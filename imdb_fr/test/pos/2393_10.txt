I was invited to the screening of Eddie Monroe on September 30 and was pleasantly surprised by the story, the great role of actor and the talented realization. I had a hard time believing that all this talent is in an independent film. Powerful performances of Vario (Uncle Benny), Sara (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris (Eddie Monroe). The cast was filled with colorful and fun characters. This film reminds me of one of those movies that you will come back to in 20 years and will discover that it has launched many celebrity actors. Just like "The Outsiders" where we find Tom Cruise, Emilio Estavez, Patrick Swazey, Ralph Macchio and others. Look Hollywood, there are new stars on the horizon and they can be discovered in a small independent Long Island film called "Eddie Monroe". Good work!
