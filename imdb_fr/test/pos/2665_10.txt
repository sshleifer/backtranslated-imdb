A criticism that I delay for too long ... <br /> <br /> Clearly, 2001 is one of the best sci-fi movies made to date, if not the best. Stanley Kubrick was a cinematographer genius and it's one of his best works. And although it is misunderstood by many and respectively unknown, it is considered one of the best movies of all time and I will have to accept. In 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and nobody has done it since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough at the time, and seeing how the effects are maintained today, there is no reason to wonder why. The film always looks wonderful after almost forty years! Take note of CGI people. Thanks to the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick has created some of the best special effects ever made on celluloid. This alone has almost created the frightening emptiness of the space atmosphere, which is also attributed to realistic music and sound effects. I can not think of another film where you can not do anything in space, as is the case in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in the space realistic, it is an ingenious tool for setting the mood and it works perfectly. <br /> <br /> Apart from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a role in establishing the sensation of the film. The music played, all classical, completes what the eyes see and makes you feel the importance of the journey of man through his evolution from monkey to space traveler. <br /> <br /> The story, though apparently simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and essentially trigger certain events that are an integral part of the film. What are they? Where do they come from? What are they doing? These are all questions that arise as history grows and is asked to find its way. While most of them have a general idea of ​​what happened in the story, each person will have to decide what it means for them. In any case, we decide to answer this question, which leads to profound solutions. This is not entirely left to interpretation, but in some respects. Make the experiment for more details. The end result is pretty terrifying, no matter what your personal solution. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a long film, which sometimes slows down, it must be faithful to the portrait of the man. This is not a subject that would have behaved well in a shorter film, a more rhythmic feature film. Those with reduced attention span need not apply. <br /> <br /> Finally, here is the incarnation of a ruthless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine had such a scary screen presence. Which reminds me that for a film with such deep ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius. <br /> <br /> One of the best films made to date and one of the best science fiction movies. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this movie at least once. <br /> <br /> Very strongly recommended.
