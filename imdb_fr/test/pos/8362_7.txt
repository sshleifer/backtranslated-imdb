The journey into the past in the past is at best tenuous as a subject. In this episode, a man who thought about the possibility is on the date and place of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He tries everything he can think of in the short time he has with predictable results. Of course, it's pretty crazy. He is arrested and finally entrusted to the very man he is trying to arrest. Serling was brilliant enough to let him go back to the present, but is the present the same? It is sort of a forerunner of "The Time Tunnel" where time travelers were entrusted each week with the same task, overcoming what had already happened. Unfortunately, the consequences of the distortion of time and the future always cancel out the result. Unless you have something like Ray Bradbury's "The Sound of Thunder".
