the scarlet coat is about Bendict Arnold betraying his country, but he is not really in the film but the focus is mainly on Major Boulton (Cornell Wilde) and Major Andr√© (Micheal Wilding). Wilding steals the film as an officer and gentlemen. like a friend in Boulton. While Boulton tries to find out who Gustavus is, the man who flees between the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom. Wilde has to deal with the British suspicious suspicion Dr o'dell (George Sanders) who follows his every move and loves to intrigue Anne Francis is a very pleasant film.
