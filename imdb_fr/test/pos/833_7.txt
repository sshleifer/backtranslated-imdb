After seeing Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. <br /> <br /> The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent movie (not the best of Van Damme, but certainly not the worst.) The cast of VD, but it makes sense. <br /> <br /> The storyline and plot have all been done before, so it's not new. I mean it's Van Damme. We do not really expect much of an incredible conspiracy, are we? So let's talk about what we all want to watch this movie: the fight. Without revealing anything, I thought the way the fights were shot and shot was well done, much better than a few. recent movies from VD such as Second in Command, in which the final fight is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you've seen Undisputed 2, he seems to know how to photograph the fights and enjoy them. Some of The Shepherd's fights reminded me of the old VD stuff, which we all want to see. The fighting was good, and I said "ah, awesome" a few times out loud. But I was hoping a bit more considering the quality of my thinking for Undisputed 2. <br /> <br /> Something intriguing intrigued me in the daughter of VD in the film. it's Bianca Van Varenberg, the true life of JC. I had never seen it before, so it was a treat. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not bad at all. Yes, the story has already been told, but at least JC was trying to make a good movie. Next time, add more melee combat! I think he still has what it takes to make another big-budget movie ... his game has improved since he started digital TV and he's really fit at 47. I do not know about you, but I'm one of the people who thinks most of his digital TVs are really good except for Derailed. All he has to do is get in shape and make a movie about martial arts ... and I think people would react well even if it was not Jet Li. This film is really worth location. =)
