I will not comment on the story as such. I agree with most people's comments that this is a good full action movie, with a well-told story and good acting. <br /> <br /> This film deserves 100% for cinematography for its opening sequence. The opening shot is beautiful and I still do not understand how they did it. The film is worth watching for this one shot! Too bad that the DVD currently released is a film and no information is provided on the making of the film. Hope someone comes with the special edition. <br /> <br /> And what's even better is that the opening sequence also becomes the end, which leaves you totally to bet! Great thing. A must for a collector of classic cinematic moments.
