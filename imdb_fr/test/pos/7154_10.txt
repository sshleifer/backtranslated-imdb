Wow, I just watched this Blockbuster movie and I love finding jewels like this one. Although the shot was made within the limits of a budget and it lacks a bit in the clumsy editing (accident, hospital scenes, penultimate scene), I give 10 stars to this first achievement! I absolutely loved the concepts that inspire reflection and if you are a free thinker and open to original ideas, I highly recommend this film. I think director and screenwriter Jay Floyd should receive some attention and more opportunities in the film industry. According to his credits, it could be another Quentin Tarantino.
