I first saw it when I was a child (LES PETITS RASCALS were on television the year I was born) and I recently bought it on DVD. Between the two, I watched it every time I attended the event and made specific notes: 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how some of these elements were racist: Farina as a Nubian slave, doing voodoo, for example. I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they tried to do it now. <br /> <br /> Notice how the Camembert fights in The Three Stooges 'HALFWITS' HOLIDAY and THE Sweet Cake and the cake look like this ... and this movie came out a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. There was obviously an inspiration from LA BATTLE OF THE CENTURY in SS and Laurel & Hardy for these films ... remember that at that time, they were all flying among the best !!! <br /> <br /> Another note: lovers of Laurel & Hardy, this bakery seller is none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in TBOTC, the "beating" who gets into his car and the place in back. It always escapes me why she was never credited?
