Okay, I'm passionate about history and agree, I'm a movie buff. This film is of course in my top 10 of all time. I love the action scenes and the unique weapons of this period. I have some doubts about fighting a two-handed sword on horseback, and the Raisuli sword looks more like a katana than a scimitar, ... well, I never fought horse backs either. <Br /> <br /> I also like attempts at philosophical proverbs.The typical tribe of the desert probably did not know how to read the Koran, so he kept his word. Several writers criticized Connery's brogue, on vacation as a youth, I met a family of South West Africans, the Dinosaur National Monument, and even though they talked to each other about themselves (yeah, the Germans of the second generation can hear the difference), they spoke English with a Scottish thug. your pronunciation Scottish Missionary?
