One of the best! As a fan of civil war, I was very happy with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives an extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. By watching this fabulous story unfold in a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, sorrow, shame, harmony and cruelty come to life. I was introduced for the first time to this series when I was in eighth grade. Being a young boy, one would think that this serial of civil war would not have interested me. To be honest, this story stole the hearts of everyone in my class and it's just the first book. I bought the novel and studied the tastes and the differences and it was great. I am now 17 years old and I still love the story, the characters, the subject and I remember the time of the Civil War. As a filmmaker of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
