I watched a movie made for television about the destruction in Waco, Texas. Clearly, David Koresh was a murderer, a sect leader who raped children, eager to kill as many police officers as he wanted and bring his people to heaven on a blood-stained staircase. <br /> <br /> The film was nothing more than a propaganda detailing what we had already read in the newspapers. I'm more and more sure since I watched the great documentary Waco: The Rules of Engagment. All the statements made in this film should not be considered as the truth of God, but they tell the whole story instead of regurgitating only what the police have decided to say. <br /> <br /> For those who have forgotten, Koresh was the spiritual leader of the religious movement named The Branch Davidians. Charges of drug use, kidnapping, possession of illegal weapons and rape (among others, I am sure) have raised suspicions of local police and then federal police. In attempting to execute a search warrant, the ATF (Office of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) and the clan participated in a shootout that left dead and wounded on both sides. <br /> <br /> That's when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) got involved. The communications between the two were lively but eventually broke. The FBI prepared for an invasion by attacking the building with lightning grenades and gas. When the building was completely burned down, including in Koresh, the FBI refused to admit responsibility, claiming that the "cult" inside the building had set it on fire itself. This image heard from Jim Jones and other violent religious organizations. <br /> <br /> The photo has many masks to tell its story. It starts with a sample of congressional hearings, perhaps the "truth" regarding the record. What is telling is that the politicians remained partisans even in a situation as difficult as serious. The Democrats were only concerned to defend every action taken by the police. It was the Republicans who seemed open to the other side. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to report all the new information and analysis provided by this documentary. In addition, a list would remove the movie opening as and when. An example would be the heartbreaking fact that children died in the compound. Filmmakers are probably more supportive of Davidians, but remain relatively open. In this case, the federal authorities seem responsible for the mistreatment of a situation involving innocent children. However, parents must also bear some responsibility for leaving their children in this predicament when they could have disclosed them to many local authorities. <br /> <br /> Probably the most damning new information. arrives late in the film and implicates the FBI claim that they did not fire on the building. This is left to interpretation, and I will not say more than what I can say is that what can and can not be said is disturbing and shocking. <br /> <br /> Federal officers are not held in a critical or corrupt light. more than Koresh. The biggest condemnation seems to have been against the media, refusing to tell both sides of a story. This element seems to prevail in recent documentaries, rightly so, I believe. It's time for the media to pick up on news stories and abandon this on-going quest for what will attract the biggest audience and the best audiences. <br /> <br /> It's hard to mess up a documentary. In most cases, lighting a camera and putting together interesting pieces of life are common and tell a fantastic story. What few people can do is shed light on a subject that forever changes the way you consider it. Waco is that kind of movie. ***. 5 of ****
