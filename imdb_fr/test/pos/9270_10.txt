There are so many episodes that make me scream over the stories <br /> <br /> that I would like to choose the best. Rocko and Bill form a strange couple who is beyond help but manages to confront the victim and BS. They will emerge from the difficult period to train Dan in their criminal life. <br /> <br /> Canadians will notice the strange joke of Toronto or the federal government, and because the CBC has organized a very good show of Frantics that Dan was part of the show, which shoots them and in the episode "Dan's Umbrella", CBC / Radio-Canada is swept by the embers. <br /> <br /> When Dan says Radio-Canada would never waste taxpayers' money for a useless venture, Rocko walks into the room and gives Dan his Friday-Night tape with Ralph Benmurgue. This show is a failure and most people will not understand the joke unless they know the history of the CBC for making sure that people do not watch or broadcast good shows they watch.
