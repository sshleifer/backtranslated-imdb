After the atomic bomb struck Hiroshima, charred bodies lay around him, deformed victims try to communicate with relatives who can not even recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation sickness. This black and white film, even sad and scary, is not without humor. The story revolves around a young woman, Yasuko, who was hit by a black rain after the blast. She is trying to get married, but everyone is still dying, and there is a fear that the same thing will happen to her. After finding a suitable companion (who loses his reason after being too long at war), she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness. This film is an excellent portrait of atomic attacks on Japan, it will scare you and you may cry. The acting is good, not too dramatic like many other ww2 movies that have been made.
