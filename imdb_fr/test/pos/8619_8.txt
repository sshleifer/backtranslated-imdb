Another fabulous film by Catherine Breillat, this time about the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie. Use comedy ?? a new genre for Breillat ?? we have a behind-the-scenes view of film making but in a documentary style. The character who plays the director in the film is based on Breillat, the sex scene in question is taken from his previous movie, "To My Sister", just like the main teenage actress. But the film, like all of Breillat's work, is not just entertainment. It is strewn with philosophical observations about the nature of sexuality and demonstrates a dedication to "purity" (as opposed to pornography) which is the cornerstone of Breillat's work and dedication to true emotion. We see the directorial character harangue the young lead actress and actor to extract the best, hypnotising them in the roles they need to play, bringing out a part of themselves that the director can see but that they can not see in themselves the summits of action that it requires of them. It makes significant films, no titillation, but it shows the work necessary to produce this, and thus gives us an insight into the process of making films (resolutely French) and the psychology of men ?? female sexuality.
