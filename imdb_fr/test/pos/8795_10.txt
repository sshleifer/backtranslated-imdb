The only way to truly understand and understand the characters in this movie is to have experienced the situations yourself. For many people, this film is almost a fake biography, a kind of snapshot of a weekend in our lives. (I did about 85% of the things in this movie and I witnessed the remaining 15%, usually all the same weekend) For me and the others, I know it's good to have this movie in the background, except for some pictures. people we remember in some way and nights where there are spots and blurs, this film is our generation "Studio 54", a piece to add to our notebooks so you can look back and smile . Personally, I'm happy that these days have passed, but it's good to watch this movie and say "I remember when .........". Thank you Justin for making this fake biography of a weekend of my life.
