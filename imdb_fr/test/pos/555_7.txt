This film was a new direction for Natalie Portman. A much more adult role, even if it comes from the traces of a child in the film itself. Ann (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who plays her newly divorced mother, Adele, leave a small town in the middle of nowhere to travel to Beverly Hills. There, these tortured souls try to cope with their new life and new relationship as the character of Portman grows. Without knowing it, at first for Adele, she grows up and becomes a better mother for her. <br /> <br /> Ann sees her mother telling her that she wants to become an actress, or at least, she thinks. Adele uses this crutch whenever there are problems in their life. We see their struggle between mother and daughter to be reconciled and to remain alone, after giving up their old life. <br /> <br /> The acting game is remarkable. They apparently become mother and daughter before your eyes. You can almost feel that there is a link beyond the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not really take us to new ground in these types of films, the fact that the game is well done, and the story is not too imperfect, I recommend it . <br /> <br /> I will say however, she will probably disappear soon, I do not think she can have the power to stay necessary for a huge Christmas. movie season beginning in about a week. See now before that happens if you like one of these actresses.
