The subject of this film is potentially depressing: a man in his thirties, unemployed, little educated, three children of a lost relationship, living in his parents' house, but dreaming of making feature films. But after about half an hour of film, you realize that Mark Borchardt has a bottomless reserve of motivation and ambition - it's just that everything is channeled towards his need to make movies, and nothing other will not make him happy. The film jumps across the spectrum of emotions, but in the end, you feel happy because you come to know some great people. Go see that - you'll end up wishing it's longer.
