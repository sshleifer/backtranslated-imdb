Pola X is a beautiful adaptation of 'Pierre de Herman Melville; or, ambiguities ". The comments here surprise me, I wonder what led to the extremely negative reaction. <br /> <br /> Shock value is the least appealing thing about this movie - a minor detail that has been disproportionate. The story tells of Peter's fall - and the subsequent destruction of his surroundings - which is clearly demonstrated in his features, his behavior and his idiolect. The dialogues and the soundtrack distinguish this film from all the films I've seen and turn a fundamentally traditional scenario with controversial twists into an unforgettable emotional epic. <br /> <br /> I heard about this movie and watch, like me, with an open mind. I hope you will be rewarded in the same way as me. I felt nervous and nervous around half an hour, but the movie is far from scary in every sense of the word. He will leave you with 1000 thoughts, each of them embarrassing and exciting. I know that I rush here, but I feel the need to compensate for the negative perception of this film. It's the best I've seen all year.
