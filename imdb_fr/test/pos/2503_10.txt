So well done. Photography, sound, music and performances were the best. It's also a fun story that makes you smile at every scene - I loved it and I'm a 60-year-old heterosexual man. Each character seemed to be doing their part. This is Mrs. Capshaw's best performance I've seen - she's played in more movies than I thought, but it was a wonderful achievement. I guess it's an advantage to have Spielberg's money behind you, so you have a big budget and all the money you can buy better technically. Two of the cast members already have their own TV series - it's easy to understand why. Tom Selleck is doing his usual good job.
