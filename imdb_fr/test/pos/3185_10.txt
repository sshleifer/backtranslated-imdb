My family and I do not normally watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack depth and are not worth our time. <br /> <br /> be careful, my daughter-in-law and my daughter, so we took the time to watch it this afternoon. The film exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really good, as was Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves that he was effective in his role. I have never been so touched, moved and affected by a local movie before. Imagine a cynic like me dabbing my eyes at the end of the movie? Congratulations to Star Cinema !! Congratulations Jericho and Claudine !!
