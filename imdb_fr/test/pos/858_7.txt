When I first saw this film, the first thing that jumped at me was the role of Kelly Overton, a young actress (and the movie star) whom I saw for the first time. totally blown away. She's amazing on screen and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the future holds for her .... <br /> <br /> The film itself was good in that it let Kelly Overton go unravel and take the wiever take a walk ... not much again when I had the impression to have seen everything before .. but good experience :) I would recommend this film ... if only to see Kelly Overton .. this theater actor storms the screen ... this movie a vote of 7 ... 5 for the actor performance and 2 for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> And on a last note .. sorry for my bad english .. if it's gibberish for you: Pz ignore me ...
