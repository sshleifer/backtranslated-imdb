This film is worth it, despite what you might hear. The performance of Marie Dressler (I hope to spell it) as an old drunkard is reason enough to see this movie. It's an incredible performance. She is in a state of stupor drunk in three scenes for a long time and she never does the same thing twice. You can actually smell the alcohol when it's finished. Unbelievable. And Greta, of course, talks very well about his first lines on the film. Eugene O'Neill's story is sound and, like most of O'Neill's stories, very deep and intense. It's not a light entertainment, but if you like these great characters of the '30s and' 40s, you'll love it. Part of the film is technically fuzzy, but overall, it's worth it.
