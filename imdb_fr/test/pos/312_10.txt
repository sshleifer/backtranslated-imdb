Somewhere on IMDb, we discuss the greatest director of all time (Spielberg, Copolla and others are named). The biggest argument has been around Spielberg and whether he is a great director or not. The problem with Spielberg is that although he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth. Saving Ryan is really remarkable from a technical point of view, but his message is dull and, even if it's a lot of fun, it does not sound like anything. about everything. AN is the best film I have ever seen because it combines great filming with a deep philosophical perspective on so much, starting with war in general, the clash of civilizations, the condition of a soldier in war (a is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither, French says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they are trying to ask themselves if these claims are true or false. But a good movie, and a great work of art in general, is supposed to arouse arguments, not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, or maybe he does not, nobody does not hold the truth anyway. You can watch this film for its outdoor beauty, amazing scenes, acting and memorable quotes and you will be completely satisfied. But what really makes this film a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can not help but compare Fahrenheit's recent documentary. Copolla and Moore address similar issues, but although Copolla presents things from an outside and objective point of view, Moore adopts a very partisan position that actually compromises a documentary ... It's a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. Anyway, if you want to start understanding the Vietnam War, the war in Iraq, the Second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this movie, and not the other ...
