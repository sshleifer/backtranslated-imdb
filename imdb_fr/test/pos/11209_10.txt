It's probably been a year since I did not see Uzak, but it leaves a very good memory of the two main characters, the jaded photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin Yusuf village. <br /> <br /> It's a long film with very little dialogue and a rather limited plot. This obviously annoyed a relatively small number of viewers. But the film builds such a cruelly credible portrait of Mahmut and Yusuf that there is as much emotional tension as in the most peaceful thriller. <br /> <br /> Just to be clear, there is no padding in this movie - long-term breaks where no one speaks, as much in the emotions of the characters (and in yours, watching them ) that you could support. Go see him awake and alert, and you will be caught off guard instead of being anesthetized. <br /> <br /> Uzak sounds true in many ways, and this sincerity is probably his greatest accomplishment. People are not dealing with events and problems, but rather with each other. In fact, throughout the film, there is probably not a point where the main characters (Mahmut, Mahmut's ex-wife, Yusuf and Mahmut, are not opposed). <br /> <br /> A lot of it is true all over the world: country, perhaps the deliberately naive expectation of cousin Yusuf that a job on a ship falls on his knees; Urbanized cynicism of Mahmut and reluctance to sympathize with Yusuf. <br /> <br /> Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf's misunderstanding that Mahmut could tolerate his tight stay; Yusuf evolves between machismo ambition and awkwardness when he seeks to know a woman. <br /> <br /> Uzak is undoubtedly a rather dark movie, and one of Ceylan's strengths is not to hit the head with themes that he explores. For me at least, I fully believed in the behavior of his characters. All the little unsuccessful attempts at connection and cruelty sound so true. And yet, I did not leave with a message saying, "The world is like this," but instead, I received, "This is how we sometimes treat each other."
