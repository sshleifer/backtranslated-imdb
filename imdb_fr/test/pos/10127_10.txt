The radio was a very good movie, and honestly, I never cry in the movies. But it made me cry. It really touched me when Radio's mother died and he just did not want to get out of his room. I felt really sad about how, if you were mentally retarded, you could not really understand death. I really liked the movie and it's a must see.
