I saw this film as part of the Midnite madness in Sitges. Set in 18th-century England, the plot covers the life of Arthur Blake, from his first experience as an apprentice burglar to his final confession on the eve of his execution. <br /> <br /> The plot progresses through a series of mishaps involving Arthur and his partner, meeting various unsavory characters and strange situations. <br /> <br /> The first thing that strikes in this film is the precision with which they managed to capture the eyes of the horrors of the Hammer era, the atmosphere is fixed with many cemeteries laden with fog, scenes of rowdy taverns and excellent set design / costumes. <br /> <br /> For a film titled I Sell the Dead, I was expecting the main focus on horror ?? do not get me wrong, there are hectic times and gore, but the tone is very comical, determined by the situations in which the characters dive and their dialogue. The closest comparison of the scenes between the two main actors (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the interaction between the characters seen in the classic English comedies Only Fools and Horses, The Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise. <br /> <br /> The acting game is strong and the cast of very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm raises the film above many other viewers in Sitges. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film offers something very different from the current horror wave and will leave a smile on your face.
