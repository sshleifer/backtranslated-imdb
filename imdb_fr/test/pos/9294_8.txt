The hilarious team that brought you "CNNNN" and "The Chaser Decides" returned to the ABC with its new series "The Chaser's War On Everything". Shot in front of an audience, the Chaser team is doing what it does best: relocating key political figures, international celebrities and media personalities. <br /> <br /> Satire is simply priceless and nothing is sacred. . In recent weeks, the hunters have sued the Queen (during her visit to Australia) for the removal of John Howard and threatened her with Kim Beazley (Australian opposition leader). <br /> <br /> A The particularly funny part is "Mr. Ten Questions", showing an overly enthusiastic journalist approaching celebrities (recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asking them ten questions as insane as " what is your optimum length of grain of rice? " Just for the record, Theron ignored him and walked away, and one of the Backstreet Boys got angry and "refused to answer him with an answer." <br /> <br /> A segment that recently scrambled my fists opened the team decided to become an "amateur statuette" to earn extra money. When he realized how hopeless he was, he put a real statue in his place. THE PERFECT SCAM! He had thirty dollars in twenty minutes! <br /> <br /> A brilliant satire of everything that happens in Australian society. Two bravo! <br /> <br /> (By the way, the show will not be aired during the three weeks following Easter, because "even if all the members of the team are atheists, they are also hypocrites.")
