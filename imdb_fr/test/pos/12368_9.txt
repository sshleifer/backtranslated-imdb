On the eve of New Year's Eve, the Salvation Army editor's sister TB (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit him on his deathbed. Meanwhile, the alcoholic David tells two other drunkards of the cemetery the legend of the ghost coach and his coachman: according to legend, the last sinner to die at the turn of the New Year becomes the collector of souls, gathering the souls his trainer. When David refuses to visit Edit, his friends argue with him, they fight and David dies. When the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died at the end of last year. George revisits some parts of David's odious life and, in flashbacks, he shows how wicked and selfish David was. <br /> <br /> "Körkarlen" is an impressive and elegant silent movie, with wonderful special effects (for a 1921 film). The characters are very well developed; However, the story is dated and there is a strange and unexplained situation, when Sister Edit says that she loves David Holm. Why would an enlightened woman love such a despicable man who wasted his life corrupting others? Despite being religiously dated in the present days, he gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption at the end. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "To Carroça Fantasma" ("The Ghost Coach")
