After reading so much negative press about this movie over the years, I had always avoided it, but the advent of the cheap public domain DVD prompted me to finally watch it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he was transferred from a bad copy. The modern prequel, shot on tinted paper, is unclear and the contrast nonexistent. Faces are sometimes difficult to distinguish. That said, the story is entertaining and Lou appears as an accomplished actor, more than in many boys' movies. <br /> <br /> Once the film goes to the story of "Jack", the film goes to "color" and I use this term vaguely. Most shades are orange or brown. The greens look particularly bad. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Ford as "Polly", the giant's maid, was a huge plus for me, as I appreciated her on one of her "Andy Hardy" debuts. <br /> <br /> With so many negative comments about the quality of the print, I'm always happy to give this film a score of 7. That made me laugh a lot and it's more than the majority comedies that I watched decades can handle. <br /> <br /> Watch out if you have the opportunity.
