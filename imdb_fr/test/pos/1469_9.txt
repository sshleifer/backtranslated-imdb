Going 'Down To South Park is an hour-long documentary about South Park with interviews with Trey Parker and Matt STone, as well as all the other people working at South Park.There is not much to say, it shows the story of South Park and what it takes to make a single episode. It's basically a backstage in the series. It shows the different goods that South Park has made (it's really the central comedy that broadcast them).
