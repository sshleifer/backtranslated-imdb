I have seen this movie many times and every time I look at it, it becomes weirder and funnier. Perhaps it is the lack of research on the character "punk" of the character of Nicolas Cage or simply on the cheesiness factor, because it was a typical film of the 80s ... nevertheless, it is a story of cute love with extremely funny and unique characters. I think it's right up there with "Fast Times" and "Weird Science" (movies par excellence from the eighties!)
