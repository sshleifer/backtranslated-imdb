Having grown up in Phenix when I was a kid, I recognize a lot of local people in the film, so for me it's like a trip back in time to see "The history of the city of Phoenix". In fact, my great-uncle is in one of the very first scenes. Uncle Drew is wearing the Hawaiian shirt and pulling out his chair to better see the singer / stripper. <br /> <br /> If you did not go, like Mr. Page and myself, you might not be able to understand the story he's telling. The New York journalist calls John Patterson a racist, probably without ever having met Mr. Patterson or his father. And why do you want to talk about Mr. Patterson's job now? It has nothing to do with the movie you are supposed to see again. How can you sit and judge of them or this film when you probably have not gone further than the South Bronx? In my experience, people who do this simply try to feel morally superior to the people in the film. According to most of the testimony of the day, Mr. Patterson was basically a good and honest man. Their families were respectable people, as were most of the people who lived in the city of Phenix. <br /> <br /> By the way, is it so difficult for those living outside the South to believe that there are good and decent people even in small towns in Alabama? And why do they assume that anyone living in a small town in the south of the country is racist? My parents lived there and yet they did not tolerate it at home. Others have not tolerated it either, but the myth that everyone is racist is perpetuated by the willful ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The film itself is simple and straightforward. That's not the whole story --- Hollywood added a certain sensationalism when making the film. Some parts were quite targeted. Other parties have bordered on fairy tales. And if this is the source everyone uses to decide the small town population in the south of the country, they need to understand what most of us do - it's ONLY a movie.
