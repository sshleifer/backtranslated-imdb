Let's face it, a lot of bad movies are done all the time. For those working in the cinema, you have probably spent a lot of time and effort on many of these less fantastic intrigues. Sometimes, and this is my opinion, it's the act of making the film that is important to us. Tell a story (as simple and unrealistic as it is). In addition, the collaborative process is a unique key feature in film and theater. To produce a production of any caliber, it is necessary that the talents of different people, according to its magnitude, give life to its history. The most intriguing part of American Movie, however, is not the movie being filmed. It is the filmmaker himself, as a character in his own life, who calls our attention. None of them serves as a model for the filmmakers we know and have worked with. But, let's face it, these are archetypes of small parts of us that are trying to be part of this cult activity of independent cinema. (Very good, a very small part of ourselves) They are people who live under the rocks of their own lives and find themselves trapped in the movie novel. This brings me to my next argument. American Movie captures the raw spirit of independent cinema. Bad stories told about (today) digital movies with neglected effects and horrible performances - because that's what they can do best with a budget of a few thousand dollars rather than several millions of dollars per day in the studio. This is the difference between low low LOW end productions and studio productions. The independent filmmaker just wants to create a linear or even non-linear story to turn as well as he can with the money he invests for himself and the resources around him to see a finished product on his TV ultimately. Robust individualism materializes in all forms of art. I think this film is a brilliant document of truth for many filmmakers. And no, I'm not full of me. Dude, these people are hilarious. Their problems seem hilarious, their characteristics are hilarious. Best replica of the film: "All is well! ... All is well! ... There is enough to live for! ... Jesus told me the truth !!!" Said a million times by a funny old man. Hat at Tom Beach. Chicago Rules.
