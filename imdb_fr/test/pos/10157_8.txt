The kidnappers turn out to be a man and a woman he knew, but the woman is a little sweeter than the man. <br /> <br /> The song "Que, Sera, Sera" (Whatever we are, we're, "is one of the best songs ever sung in a movie. <br /> <br /> The wife of Doris Day, the player of Stewart, sings the song mentioned above, his performance is worthy of an Oscar and has not even been nominated. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10 .
