Of course, most people will refer to "Fishermen's Island" as a silly and trashy hokum, but can you honestly quote another film that presents these exciting themes? This Italian gem is synonymous with pure entertainment and features activities such as voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish-creatures, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, the treasure hunt, an isolated island filled with deadly traps and scientists completely crazy! All this and more in a simple movie? Yes please! Opponents of Italian horror movies can easily label this film as a cheap operating version of "The Island of Dr. Moreau", but the truth is that it's more than that! "Island of the Fishmen" offers thrills and adventures from start to finish with surprisingly compelling special effects and amazingly stylish camera work. The story begins in a promising way with a small group of prisoners, survivors of a shipwreck, who land on a tropical island. They meet the sadist Edmond Rackham who reigns over an indigenous tribe - and a legion of genetically created amphibian monsters that live in the swamps of the island. There are so many twists and more subplots in the story that it's almost impossible to write a summary, but, believe me, this gem is worth checking out. Sergio Martino proves once again that he is an ingenious filmmaker who has the talent to be both commercial and creative. It makes good use of the beautiful position of the island and the interior decorations are very impressive. Amazing underwater images and imaginary landscapes really elevate this film above the normal operating standards of the late 70's. I do not quite understand why Roger Corman so reworked the original and launched it in the US market under a different title ("Screamers"), as there is very little to improve. The cast members are all regulars of Sergio Martino (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton who is a rule of orderly support) and give great performances. If you can get your hands on the recently restored German version, you get fifteen extra minutes of action. To see him!
