Of course, with all the others, I had to expect a lot of Hollywood revisionism to have them dead from their boots on the legend of Custer. The mere fact of playing Custer with Errol Flynn is a sufficient indication that legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part, my expectations have been met (certainly in a lively and entertaining way). <br /> <br /> Yet even in this visibly biased (and highly criticized) account of Custer's story, I have been struck by some of the remarks made in this film that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solid , seemed to contradict the typical clich√©s of manifest fate and unvarnished heroism usually found in early twentieth-century Westerners. <br /> <br /> For example, even if the film tried to whitewash his hero, some scenes still evoked the more imperfect and stupid character of Custer: <br /> <br /> 1) His initial entry to the gateway to West Point, in which his arrogance and pomp is a clear aspect of his character. <br /> <br /> 2) His miserable record at West Point, which seems to be as much attributed to Custer's lucidity as to the demands of military service as any other factor; There are moments in the way Flynn plays Custer at West Point where he seems downright stupid. <br /> <br /> 3) The promotion of Custer to the rank of General is presented not only as a ridiculous mistake, but also as a crazy comedy. I was almost expecting the Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello to walk around the stage. <br /> <br /> 4) Custer's stance against Jeb Stuart in Gettysburg is not bleached as a brilliant tactical military leadership, but is portrayed as irresponsible and extremely fortunate. <br /> <br /> 5) The problem of Custer's alcohol is certainly not ignored. <br /> <br /> And although the music and some of the ways in which the Indians were shown in this film are certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, I am still surprised that the film explains in detail why the Indians were justified in attacking Whites who entered their territory and explicitly blamed the battles. in the Black Hills squarely at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can claim that the nasty man in the play is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as white devils making false statements of gold in the Black Hills. Of course, this part of the story is true, but I did not expect to see it portrayed so unequivocally in a film like this. <br /> <br /> And another thing: generally, in these films, it's the Indians. who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of basic common sense to avoid getting drunk every time they approach alcohol. In this film, it is actually the 7th Cavalry troops, not the Indians, who are represented in at least two scenes this way. <br /> <br /> In total, this film slides in surprising moments from the middle of the Hollywood berth.
