The film is partly a thriller and partly a public service announcement when we see the events through the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and of course victims. In this intelligent drama, lessons are given about the contamination and the surviving chaos while, at the same time, a behind-the-scenes look at how the crisis is handled encourages viewers to be wary of the guards and to be afraid of the attackers . The film, originally broadcast on the BBC, raises doubts about the preparation of officials. The performances are appropriate, discreet but never fantastic. The film is only a beginning, a provocative beginning to a wider discussion but, in my opinion, it works, giving the good chills and causing the audience to reason and ask questions.
