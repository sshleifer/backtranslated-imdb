haggard does not even need to be noted, since it was never designed to be rated as are Oscar-winning films and he never intended to win an Oscar (obviously ). if you only watch a few of the products that Bam and Bran have tried, such as quick shots, this is a movie that's more than cky or jackass (though they're cool too). For pure pleasure, I give this film a 10; almost every scene made me laugh until my sides hurt, like the movie falcone film. If you have not seen it, see it and buy it. Personally, my favorite character is Brandon (falcone). It's so smooth, natural and random that it's hilarious. haggard is definitely a film that, in general humor, is matched only by the presenter and Napoleon's dynamite.
