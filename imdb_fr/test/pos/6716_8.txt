"Lifeforce" is a really weird adaptation of Colin Wilson's novel "The Space Vampires" written by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby. An American and British space exploration team makes a mind-blowing discovery: an alien spaceship resting inside Halleys' comet, containing three entities that look like people, one of them being a feminine beauty ( Mathilda May), so seductive. <br /> They find these discoveries in their own spaceship. Big mistake. <br /> <br /> It turns out that these creatures are emptying the lives of human beings and, as an American colonel Carlsen (an intense, edgy and engaged Steve Railsback) and British SAS Colonel Caine (a solid Peter Firth ) looks with horror, an infestation of vampirism seizes London, with the fate of the Earth in the balance. <br /> <br /> This image certainly does not lack imagination. It sometimes moves a little slowly but offers so many strange and fanciful ideas and striking visuals that it's hard not to be amused. Director Tobe Hoopers' first film with Cannon Films (followed by "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" and the remake of "Invaders from Mars"), it makes it a truly unique show. Incorporating elements of science fiction, vampire movies, zombies and sagas at the end of the world, it's not like I've seen it before. <br /> <br /> Railsback and Firth are ably supported by such strength British actors such as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gotthard, Aubrey Morris and John Hallam. Mathilda May is very memorable as an enigmatic and mesmerizing villain; it is certainly not offensive that she realizes much of his nude scenes. It should also be noted a touching musical score of none other than the composer of "Pink Panther" Henry Mancini. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous, but I thought it was fun too. It's a blazing and lively entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
