I just saw a very original movie that I would recommend to everyone, including "the young and the restless". However, I suppose that some of the grossness, violence and sexual innuendo of the film are not suitable for "all your children". Anyway, before the sand fills the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the movie: "Nurse Betty". Renee Zellweger plays Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls into a trance and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera. Because of this, she goes to Los Angeles to find her so-called lover of soap opera character Dr. Dr. Rubell. To fuel the fire, she is also pursued by a ruthless impostor "A life without life" who think they stole their drugs. You could say that's how nurse Betty spent "the days of her life" throughout the movie. This very "non-general" situation eventually led her to the "hospital" series of her beloved soap opera. However, the only problem is that Betty thinks all of this is real. It's as if his mind was in "another world". Okay! Enough! I will wipe my mouth with soap and no longer mention soap names. I already registered my vote for Renee as the best Oscar-nominated actress. In addition, Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Rubell was as good as in his actor biography. To sum up, my last diagnosis is that everyone should ask "Betty Nurse". ***** Excellent
