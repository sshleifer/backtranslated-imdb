This film is wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin Hood is perfectly cast and Marian is beautiful. Personally, I think Marian's German man is the funniest character, with Latrine and Sheriff! Although space balls have become boring and stupid after a while, it still keeps your interest! C ONSEIL This film was great and never bored. A great cast is in the roles, and it is perfectly falsified, and has so much meaning, and can be watched again and again! You will love this movie if you only watch it, unless you hate comedy or if you do not think Robin Hood should be manipulated. But this old story becomes boring and this movie gives it a new flavor!
