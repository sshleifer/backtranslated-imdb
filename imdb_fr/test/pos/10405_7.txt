I can not rent enough this movie. There was a lot of that hand-held camera that I adore (and some hate, because it makes them sick), like REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. <br /> It's a long film for its kind, but I did not even notice because the movie was so interesting. By showing only the images of a paranormal reporter, the film maintains the rhythm, making it a real-time experience for the viewer. <br /> <br /> I would never call this movie the "scariest horror film ever made". , I must say that it is certainly one of the best I've seen. The fear factor is built here by details in the images, camera problems, events related to each other that give a very mysterious and captivating tone to the film. Horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imagination. The end is perfect and know that you could have nightmares afterwards. A second visit is strongly recommended. <br /> <br /> Look at her alone in the dark, do not expect anything and you'll have fun.
