This film is a masterpiece. It was exhilarating from start to finish. The story of a porn star by screenwriter-director Paul Thomas Anderson is told with style, grace, humor and even poignant feelings. The actors and characters they play are all first-rate, including Mark Wahlberg in the lead, who turns out to be a solid actor and who can make a film. Burt Reynolds perhaps gives his best performance of all time as a porn director who discovers Wahlberg. The film recreates the late '70s and early' 80s with flawless precision, from the disco scene that begins at the film to holding Don Johnson's "Miami Vice" of Wahlberg in the final scene. Most regular viewers who see this film will probably compare it to PULP FICTION, but it really has a lot more in common with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese. The film is a triumph of style. The opening tracking plan that begins the film is just as impressive as those of THE PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS. The writing of Dylan Tichenor is simply phenomenal. I could not believe that the editing was not nominated at the Oscars (GOOD WILL HUNTING was a better film ?!). The best scene of the film must be the one with the firecrackers. I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense. When I saw the film a second time, I had exactly the same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, this may not have the same impact on television as in a movie theater with good stereo sound. It's unfortunate that many people did not see this movie during his theater tour, because it's the best way to watch it. Anderson's use of the big screen will suffer on television (get the DVD or a mailbox cassette). It's amazing how Anderson makes it easy to watch, because it's just his second film. Music, sets, costumes, photography, offbeat characters, sex, violence, happiness and sorrow are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with cinema.
