I recently saw a blur test, and I'm surprised it was really good! It's a movie about different groups of kids, your hillbillies, your rich snobs, your typical teenage couple, as well as two geek guys and a hippie post baby. Together, but as separate scenarios, each group goes to the Gold Coast for Schoolies Week. Australia has never had a problem writing comedy, and Australia is never short, nor actors who can play comedy subtly and with the right degree of quirk. The cast is full of stellar Australian actors with a huge talent and a lot of screen presence. Keep your eyes on Craig Horner, a recent graduate, who is optimistic for a week-long party that gets lost in his shenanigans. Travis Cotten and Mark Priestly, who successfully tackle a thorny physical comedy as two fools and Jessica Gower as a cute but confused teenager anxious of love. Veronika Sywak makes her film debut as a teenage girl's dream, and manages alone among a plethora of much more experienced performers. Do not miss Matthew Newton, skillfully portrayed as a sleazy limousine driver. Australian fantastic
