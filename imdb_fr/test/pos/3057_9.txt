Unfortunately, I have never seen the full version of this movie. I saw the 87-minute version twice, in the 1950s. Even with more realism than usual with Julien Duvivier, it is a wonderfully unusual piece, full of great plans followed, crossing and crossing the beautifully atmospheric decorations of Andrejew. Beautifully lit also by the photographer Andr√© Thomas, Black Jack is nothing but the pleasure of the connoisseurs. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, a screenplay makes a list of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, brilliant and bizarre characterizations. George Sanders gives a refined performance, while Agnes Moorehead is admirably played by an eccentric millionaire (who turns out to be a rival racketeer). She also made the most of her role, Patricia Roc. The film was shot in Spain in 1949.
