It would be misleading to find this coin stuck between an obsolete prequel and a machomovie of the 80s reworked in the Saturday afternoon program of the UPN affiliate. He deserves better and definitely uses the best attributes of his talent. Bracco and Walken join forces to produce a film that, although predictable for regulars of their kind, makes the routine, "troubled minds" that they are so good at portrayal. For a chance to ride in a psychological roller coaster at La Fuqua's "Training Day", plunge into the world of early 90s TV movies to find "Scam"!
