A fanatical soldier kills a man because he is Jewish and tries to equate him with another soldier. Not as good as the novel on which he is based ("The Brick Foxhole") in which he was a homosexual who was killed ... but Hollywood did not touch him in 1947. That said, it's still A very good movie. Antisemitism is very well treated, but the public understands that fanaticism is bad ... well! But it was in 1947. The film is well played by all actors (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the tone is very dark ... as it should be. Very atmospheric too. A great success deserved in his day ... worth the detour.
