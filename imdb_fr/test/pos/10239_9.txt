Dick Tracy, a horrible film with horrible makeup, disgusted me with the prize of the best makeup academy. The Nightbreed (based on the short story "Cabal") is fantastic, the acting is excellent and David Chroneburg is a really scary and formidable antagonist. <br /> <br /> The plot centers on Aaron Boone, who has been recurring nightmares about a society of monsters living under a cemetery. Does he compose it or is it real and call it? His psychologist (Chroneburg) convinces him that he is a murderer, a killer of families. <br /> <br /> Troubled and suicidal, Boone seeks refuge in Midian but the monsters do not want it at first. He is also followed by his girlfriend, Lori, who refuses to abandon him even after his death and returns cold and monstrous. <br /> <br /> But Decker is not about to let Boone continue. He raises the inhabitants of the region to assault the Midian, as a holy war in the name of gods led by the devil. <br /> <br /> The Barkers' theme of the misunderstood monsters can come from his experiences as a homosexual, but they still are. always strong and honest. Nightbreed puts the genre on his head. The monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but the man is chasing them. <br /> <br /> A cut of more than 20 minutes was originally submitted by Barker, but the studio cut it into a fractured masterpiece. Barker is hard at work trying to locate the missing footage for a cut-off version of the directors' film. Until then, this version will have to do.
