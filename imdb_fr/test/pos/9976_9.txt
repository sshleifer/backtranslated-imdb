When we think of golf movies, we think of Caddyshack, but what about children? Go straight to this movie! Disney uses a formula that is proven to make a film that will appeal to adults and children. The game in this movie, in my opinion, is pretty good and the main cast, for the most part, is very young! This film is also extremely well filmed and unique, from all angles of the game of golf. I think this film should be rewarded with some academy awards for editing, or something like that, because the entire film run is excellent. Although the end may be a little predictable, the film is doing well alone! It also shows that you do not need to swear, nudity or violence to make a good golf movie!
