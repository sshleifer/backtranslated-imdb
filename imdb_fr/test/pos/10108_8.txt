I may be one of the only passionate horror fans to think that the recent overload of Asian shockers is so overexcited! Movies like "Ringu" or "The Eye" ?? who are rented all over the world? just did not convince me and they looked more boring than scary. Well, this direct opinion does not go to the South Korean gem "A tale of two sisters". It's a story of elegant and extremely complex psychological terror that REALLY enters the skin! The plot, based on a local folk tale, may be a little too confusing for this film to be ranked among the greatest genre achievements of all time, but the atmosphere and the reinforcement of the tension arouse suddenly sure feelings of great respect. This is one of the few films that can not be labeled: the events of "Two Sisters" are at once a hallucinatory horror, an intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait. In addition to a fascinating story, "A Tale of Two Sisters" also contains all the fantastic elements I usually miss in Asian horror movies, such as captivating music, good acting and innovative camera work. . The mansion where the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated as a truly scary place where secrets and dangers hide behind every door. Several sequences (such as dinner with parents or the nighttime appearance in the girls' room) are almost the pinnacle of fear. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I like to believe that I saw my share of scary horror. "A tale of two sisters" is a great cinematic adventure and a must for Asian movie fanatics. A small warning for people with a short attention span, however: this movie requires you to keep your eyes and ears focused at all times. It's also a movie that needs to be viewed multiple times, even though no one will ever get it 100%.
