What this movie is not: cool, entertaining <br /> <br /> What this movie is: visually interesting, hard to cross, intentional <br /> <br /> I feel this movie puts the viewer in doubt or she is ready) through a clip of the time when they experience a world without language. It's very similar to the way animals have to experience the world. You do not really watch this movie as much as you attend a series of dreadful events in what you "feel" in real time. <br /> <br /> Constantly, it lasts much longer than is comfortable. This film could be edited for a short film of 20 minutes and it would be a totally different film. It would be cool and fun, but the experience would be lost. I've seen a lot of cool movies, but I've never seen one like this one. If you can have your head in the right place for this one, you should be able to really appreciate (but probably not "appreciate") what they have accomplished here. 10 of 10.
