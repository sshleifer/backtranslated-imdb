Where the hell is Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Paradise? Hell? A parallel universe? When the annoying man leaves the subway platform and meets a rolling train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; in solo, the last arrival, in a realm of the dead dead where go all the suicides. Dressed as he was at the moment of his sudden departure from the body biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man who treats and transports man disturbing arid plains to a city. If the eyes turn, he is a deadly bell-ringer for the kind of urban landscapes he once inhabited, if his memory suits him. Andreas keeps the gaze of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man separated from people and objects, who has trouble finding his bearings; at home, or rather in his assigned apartment; or at work, where the boring man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard (Johannes Joner), his boss, told him: "You'll get used to it", which is not limited to difficult figures, we suspect, in this world, as in the old world. <br /> <br /> If life does not make sense, as the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre has said, the same can be said of death. The subculture of office life could be a paradise for a man, but it seems like hell, in the context on which Den Brysomme Mannen operates. Working in the afterlife, in essence, is working for the rest of your life. The social relations between Andreas's office colleagues can be normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates a distancing for the viewer because he / she now recognizes the tedious work of white-collar workers White, Kill the hours with their unimportant chatter and the designated tasks they perform during a day, like the automotones, every day, seems irrational in its obvious absurdity. To see speculatively replicated daily life, "Den Brysomme mannen" gives the impression that normal human interaction is a dead comedy, while everyday life becomes a spectacle that transforms the meaning of Karl's "alienation" Marx, because here, men in the office, "identifies" with his work, like actors in a play that conspire to give the impression that their fictional self is real. But the annoying man never participates fully in the facade. He is always aware of the cracks. <br /> <br /> On a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the after-effects of a horseman, who impales himself on an iron fence while the pedestrians walk, indifferent to his intestines. that create red splashes on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassiveness from his own colleagues after intentionally cutting his finger, in the hope that he will feel the pain, on a paper cutter. He does not have. It's just another sensation, besides being able to taste and feel what is lost for the boring man. This inability to be comforted in simple pleasures amplifies the need for love of the boring man, where simple pleasures outweighed his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt (Petonella Barker). They get along well. He takes her home. She invites him to enter. They become a couple. He's moving in. When they have sex, however, it's not good for Andreas or Anne, who seems to get more pleasure from the interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that is inaccessible in this world, but love matters to the troublesome man. So he tries again with Ingeborg (Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. "Den Brysomme mannen" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that demand performances of both man and woman. When Ingeborg does not arouse the same tender feelings towards Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture to leave Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic city, but strange, with an opening that resolves itself, and offers multiple interpretations. <br /> <br /> Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy to her confession of love for her, the boring man walks in the same subway station, stands on the same platform, aggressively eyeing the same couple and sinks. This time he can not die. How can you die when you are already dead? Struck several times by train, Andreas's face turns into ground beef. his body bends beneath angles previously only seen in art. When the annoying man realizes that love and death are out of his reach, he looks for the club man who was ready to say what is not said in this city of the living dead. What is: death, not life, does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Going to the bottom of the mystery behind the location of Andreas determines the narrative, and to the credit of the filmmaker, this enigma is addressed satisfactorily, in a scene that recalls the "Being John Malkovich" of Spike Jonze, when Andreas crawls into a tunnel to make his way to another world, like a newborn baby, which looks like the gateway to Malkovich's brain by which Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl. Andreas's attempt to cross the big gap presents an attractive paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary is a perfect synthesis of the atheistic belief that "heaven is a place on Earth." But at the same time, paradise is proved by the reality of hell; the place where Andreas is sent after being banished from the city of his destination.
