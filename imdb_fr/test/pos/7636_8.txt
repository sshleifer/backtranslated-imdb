It is true that this story is not realistic, but romantic comedy is not a kind of realism that I think. What matters is that the characters are friendly and, if necessary, sexy. Shalom is beautiful and relaxed and Jake Weber is handsome in a casual manner. They have enough chemistry to make history credible in the region that matters, sexual attraction. I would love to see one or the other in another movie. And yes, the clown is pretty cute too.
