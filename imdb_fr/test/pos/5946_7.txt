A funny parody with great attention to detail about the look of 1960s spy movies and how the action was organized at the time. The fight sequence in the hotel room was very entertaining and the cast was perfect with a Peter Lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. A big plus: Jean Dujardin is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight. In addition, his eyebrows deserve to be recognized for their excellent work. <br /> <br /> Funny, apartement side: the people behind me in the theater did not stop gasping after each plot, as if they were watching a "real" spy thriller. The trailer for "Get Smart" has been screened. The preview looked embarrassing at the movie with lame attempts to incorporate the jokes and gags of the TV series. It looks like a bomb and contrasts with the relatively sublime jokes and gags of OSS 117, though, of course, the OSS had its share of failures. The general tone of the OSS, however, was not an insult to the public's intelligence, and the content did not seem as if it had been "soaked". I had the distinct impression that if I had understood the language, I would have caught more jokes, and one in particular (the gag gun) was mismanaged in the interpretation of the subtitles.
