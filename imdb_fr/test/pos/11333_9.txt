How do you describe perfection? Mood of love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong are practically dancing on the screen and delivering outstanding performances that accompany you hours after you leave the theater. Each scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and a selection of shots, first-rate acting and sensual soundtracks. Nat King Cole sings in French and sets the tone for the entire film. Maggie and Tony look wonderful, Maggie slips into really glorious cheongsams and Tony always looks dapper. I have seen this film many times, and every time I see it, I find something new to look forward to. Like!
