It's a good underestimated movie and Rip Torn, well known as him, is a seriously underrated actor. I read Howard Frank Mosher's novel many years ago. How Craven captured the book and the beauty of the northeastern kingdom of Vermont! I was lucky enough to grow up in the VT in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the "Irasburg incident" took place. I did not see Stranger in Kingdom, the incident-based Craven / Mosher collaboration (and another Mosher novel), but this film inspired me to find it.
