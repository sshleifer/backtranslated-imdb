This film shocked me. It was so realistic and the story was incredibly touching. They speak German and Russian, which makes it more credible and real. It's a must-see movie. The actors are great too. Really a good job. The plot takes place in a German troop of the second world war. They must go to Stalingrad, Sovjet, to fight against the Sovjetian armies. You are more in touch with all the soldiers in this group and you follow them through all the dangers as they are captured in Stalingrad. They find themselves face to face with the death, the blood, the sorrow and the coldness of Russia. It's a must-see movie and you can not afford not to see it.
