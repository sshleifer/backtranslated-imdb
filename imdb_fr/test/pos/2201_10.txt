I own a copy of this movie and I have always loved it. I'm commenting here though, because I saw PBS's presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. This production was staged by the San Francisco Opera and performed by George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 80's, Hearn replaces Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou won the Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won the Tony for her portrayal in the role of Ms. Lovett) perform Sweeney on Broadway. They had to do the film about the time I saw the show. To this day, the most moving moment I remember in the theater is when Hearn sang "These are my friends". ("These are my friends, see how they shine." "My arm is complete again!") <br /> <br /> Hearn's performance in the production of the San Francisco Opera convinced me that he had not lost anything in nearly twenty years since I first saw him play on Broadway and later in the film. What talent! He's friendly, funny and scary - all at once; and he can sing, my boy can sing. All this reminded me how great the movie is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
