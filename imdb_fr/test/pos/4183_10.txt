Like much of their music, this film is either underestimated or overlooked by the casual observer. It's great and, in many ways, ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> The images are funny, disturbing and, at least, engaging. <br /> <br /> The music is amazing. <br /> <br /> This is not the sound "candy pop" which they are unfortunately associated. It's the sound of a group in exploration and revolt. <br /> <br /> HEAD, alone, should place The Monkees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me why these guys are not here?
