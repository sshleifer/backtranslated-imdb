I saw this movie when I was a kid about 30 years ago and I have not forgotten it to date. I can not say if it is a good image. But at that time, I immediately fell in love with Jean Simmons. The memories focus on the film's very erotic feel, but I still remember the plot. Simmons was so very young at the time and there is another movie that gave me the same feeling: The great expectations of David Lean. And again it was the young Jean Simmons. Too bad that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video; I would like to correct my memories ...
