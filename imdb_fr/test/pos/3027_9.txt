What makes watching and watching movies a pleasure is when from time to time, when you least expect it, a movie like The Cell presents itself and capsizes you !. This movie is a great horror that has everything you can dream about when you want to be afraid of your mind. Without going into history, all I'll say is that it has a good start, a middle and an end that keep you on the edge of your seat while being pierced by amazing special effects. The acting is good without being exceptional, but it does not matter, because the subject and the way it is presented on the big screen make it one of the best horror movies I've seen for a long time. This is one of those films that you think started as a novel, but saying that the credits do not look like an adaptation, we have to thank especially the writer Mark Protosovich . 9 out of 10
