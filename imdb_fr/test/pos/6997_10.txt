I really enjoyed this movie. It was pissed off without being a sociopath. Vin Diesel brought the character of Riddick to life and made you feel good and bad about it at different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect. (The movie on the snowmobile - oh yeah, it's called "Triple-X" or "xXx" - was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black, he plays an anti-hero to the fullest. I do not think you can go wrong when Vin plays the main role in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood could award him the role of adventure movie star - fake! I think the script for "XXX" was weak and Vin could not do anything. Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi - see it! <br /> <br /> - Zafoid
