I know what most people will think of this movie without even having seen it ... "The typical film of a famous singer ... It will be a pink film, a teenager movie, it will be stupid. .. "like that ... And yes, it's ... I mean, it's a pink movie ... But, you know what? ... I liked it. Seriously ... It's a very romantic movie ... I think every girl in this world dreamed with something like the plot of "Popstar" ... met his favorite singer, knows him as a person ... and even a romance with him ... no? ^^ I really liked watching this ... In addition, it's really funny ... <br /> <br /> I think the actors did a good job ... There are many characters magnets ... And, Aaron Carter (JD) is no exception ... To be honest, in the first five minutes of his concert, I thought, "It's going to be awful" ... But then, he surprised me really nice ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I must say that the musical performances of the film are great! I particularly liked the role when JD (Aaron) sings without music (with a guitar only) a very beautiful song ... This guy really has talent ... Time will tell ... <br /> < My advice for you? ... Look at the! Do not be prejudiced ;-)
