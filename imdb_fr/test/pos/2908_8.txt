This Fox show was a great success when it was released in 1954. Sapperously produced, with superb music and scenery, an intriguing distribution, it moves slowly, but in an interesting way. Edmund Purdom is remarkably handsome as an Egyptian who becomes a renowned doctor, juggling with three gorgeous women: a maid Jean Simmons who adores him passively, the temptress Bella Darvi who escapes him, and the sister of the pharoah Gene Tieney who wants it as SON pharoa The popularity of the film has not decreased since its broadcast on AMC (preferably on widescreen). Purdom is particularly good, her character seems to have marked women and finally never be married and be a "thinker". Darvi is amazing and tempting in her role as femme fatale. Victor Mature, Michael Wilding, co-starring with Peter Ustinov. Check it out.
