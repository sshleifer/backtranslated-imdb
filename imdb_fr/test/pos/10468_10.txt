I do not know if this film strikes me in the heart as it does because of feelings of friendship, love, closeness to others or the warmth of this transformation that creates the cuisine of Babette, but when the party starts and for the rest of the movie, I often choke. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a movie that feels good, but without a grain of mawkishness or an easy sentimentality. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed. Babette's festival tells its story with restraint and care and allows us to discover for ourselves the values ​​of grace and love. All we need to know is that Babette Harsant (Stéphane Audran) was a French refugee who was lodged by two elderly sisters in a small community on the Jutland coast. The sisters direct what remains of their father's flock. He was a convinced pastor who taught that salvation comes from renouncing oneself. The sisters have made sacrifices to duty and to faith. Those who remain honor the teachings of the pastor and his spiritual counsel, now long dead. However, with age, the small community has become quarrelsome and controversial. The sisters do what they can. For the 100th birthday of the pastor, Babette wants to prepare dinner for the small group that the sisters will invite. The sisters reluctantly agree, but when they see the supplies ordered by Babette, they and their guests worry. They are accustomed to the usual food of the community, consisting of dried cod, boiled and a soup made of bread, water and a little beer. Although Babette has made improvements over time, what they see now seems close to ungodliness. The dinner will also be visited by General Lorens Lowenhielm, who a few years earlier had chosen ambition rather than his love for one of the sisters. <br /> <br /> What are we living? There is the austerity of faith of the aging community and the wind-blown stone cottages in which they live. There is warmth in the light of a candle in the small, cluttered dining room of the sisters. And then, there is the transformative power of Babette's artistic talent when we watch her cooking, let's look at Erik, a young boy who helps him, serves and pours, and look at the old parishioners, with the help of a good wine and an exquisite cuisine, rediscover little by little their love and friendship community. The general serves us as an unexpected guide, for he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they eat. The general tells a story to his dinner companions who do not understand, the story of a famous woman who was the exemplary chef of the famous Café Anglais in Paris. "... this woman, this chef, had the ability to turn a dinner into a kind of love ... a love story that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite." He too is turning into a man who will accept what he has become while still knowing the value and love of what he decided long ago not to accept. An old couple is kissing. Two older men remember past friendships. And Babette, who spent all she had won the lottery during this dinner, had the opportunity to become the artist she once was in France, an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship. <br /> <br /> Babette, as poor as she was when she arrived years penniless earlier, will continue with the sisters. The general driving with his aunt returns to his domain. And the elderly guests leave the house of the sisters to return to their cottages. They stop and watch the clear night sky and the stars above. They spontaneously hold hands in a circle, dance and sing this hymn ... <br /> <br /> "The clock rings and time passes, eternity is near, let us use this time to try to serve the Lord with heart and so that we find our true home so that we find our true home. "<br /> <br /> They smile at each other. Everything has been reconciled. <br /> <br /> Babette's feast is a wonderful film filled with sober emotions, non-tacit understandings, wisdom ... and, of course, a meal that will leave you belly fat when you leave the theater. If you win a lottery so you can afford what Babette has created and have her talent and artistic talent, here is what she has served: <br /> <br /> Turtle soup (turtle rich soup) , served with sherry amontillado Blinis Demidoff with Caviar (small buckwheat pancakes with cream and caviar), served with champagne Veuve Clicquot Quails in sarcophagus with Périgourdine sauce fine burgundy Salad Cheese and fresh fruit Rum Baba with icy fruits and fresh figs Coffee and brandy
