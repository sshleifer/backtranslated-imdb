Chris Smith is a high caliber filmmaker who has the rare talent to spot a good story and then get by. Smith's "American film" is Wannabe director Mark Borchardt's faithful record, a loser looking to give money to his old uncle to complete his short horror film. But never, under any circumstances, seek gainful employment or support the children he has conceived. <br /> <br /> The skill of producer Smith is such that Mark seems more sympathetic than anything else. Even if he seduces Uncle Bill with sugar dreams and executive producer credits, it's his desperation to be someone, to associate his name with that of Scorsese and Spielberg that touches us. <br /> <br /> "American Film" also belongs to this rare sub-genre, often attempted but rarely realized, which successfully combines hilarity and horror. The humor comes from Borchardt's belief in Ed Wood in his own genius. For his terrible attempts to intervene, for his replacement for a cameraman who has disappeared from his film-loving mother, and for his friend Mike, adorable but damaged in the brain, whenever an actor or a crew member is missing . <br /> <br /> Horror comes to see what Borchardt can not do: it's this very American attitude - I want, I'm allowed - that prevents him from seeing how much he has to learn the job he chose. He is so confident that he can not fail, this failure is guaranteed.
