I just watched this movie on TV and it was great. <br /> <br /> had planned to watch it while I was working, but I ended up watching the whole movie without doing it, it was so good! <br /> <br /> The actors may not be very aware, but the story is catching up. the fact that actors are less well-known only makes the possibility that events happen more credible. I did not feel biased towards a character, because I have no judgment on the types of characters because I have never seen any of the actors in a movie before, which made it even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> he.
