I watched Grand Champion at least twice now. I enjoyed the story of the movie, the characters and actors were not bad. It's refreshing to see a G-rated movie. It's a good movie. The story is mainly from the point of view of children. Interactions between children and adults make the story interesting. I recommend this film if you are looking for a family film. If you liked the little rascals, you will probably enjoy it. I watched this movie on the cable. Either on the Encore family or Showtime. This is not a film I would have seen at the theater. But, I go to the theater for the effects of the big screen, so most comedies, romantic movies or dramas that I do not prefer to the big screen, I'm waiting for the TV / cable edition. Gather your children, make popcorn and enjoy!
