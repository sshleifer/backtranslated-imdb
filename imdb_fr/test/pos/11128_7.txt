In New York, a group of first-year students join the High School for Performing Arts after successfully completing their audition. For four years, their dreams, disappointments, successes, love and personal dramas are revealed to the insecurity of Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy), the homosexual Montgomery (Payl McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), hope Coco (Irene Cara), the ambitious Ralph Garci (Barry Miller) and their friends until graduation. <br /> <br /> Twenty-eight years ago, "Fame" was a great success, with the story of teenagers looking for a place in the show business, and I loved this movie and the band original on CD. I just watched "Fame" on DVD, and now I would say it's a good movie with only a lot of potential, but with too much wrong sideplay. The story follows too many characters and leaves many situations unanswered. I do not know if Alan Parker had problems editing to reduce the duration of this film, but what happened, for example, with the ballerina who goes to an abortion clinic? What happened with Leroy and his teacher, did he fail because of his grammar problem? What happened to Coco after undressing her blouse in this crook's apartment? The musician playing the synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot. Anyway, "Fame" is always a delightful entertainment and a cult movie for me. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fame")
