The recent history of Hollywood remakes of horror / ghost films from the East has been bleak. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get yourself a copy on e-bay or similar. <br /> <br /> It is well photographed and the sound is superb. Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS compatible audio system is recommended. Obviously, it's subtitled, so if that discourages you, I would not care about that. Dubbing rarely works and would not want to be done here. <br /> <br /> It is also really scary, with excellent performances of a cast that will not be familiar to the Western audience. I would particularly like to distinguish the character of mother-in-law, who was quite brilliant. The end will make you want to look again, if you can cope with it. The plot is relentless and offers no reassuring release moment along the way. <br /> <br /> If I have a little criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in some scenes of the Japanese version of The Ring. However, for years we have been accepting direct copies of other peoples' ideas about Western films, so I had a limited point of view that did not stop me from giving 10/10. I believe that most fans of this genre will derive a huge "pleasure" from this film which, I hope, remains a classic.
