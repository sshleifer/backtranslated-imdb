This show is brilliantly hilarious! I started watching in 2007 and had never heard of it before. After an episode, I became addicted. I'm never home to watch it, so my wife bought me the complete series on DVD. Non stop laughs, should I say more? I wish it was always on TV, because it's really worthy and much better shit on TV. <br /> <br /> I would like them to make a movie seriously that would not go to see him. The name of Kevin James alone will bring a huge fan-base to any movie, the guy is (hurts your stomach) funny. <br /> <br /> Just a very good, realistic, credible show. If you have the chance to buy it on DVD, do it, it's worth it.
