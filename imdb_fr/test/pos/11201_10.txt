It's not a movie to impress with high-budget, high-tech photos, fast camera movements, or sparkling costumes designed by a zealous and hungry director. But it's a film from a director who is also a very good photographer, who has a very good sense of seeing things as a human being and not as a demi-god unlike most filmmakers. It is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best "performances" with gestures and mimic unreal or, at best, scholars. It is rather a film in which they act as real as possible. In reality, they are not professional actors at all. The dialogues between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings are as real as they can easily be yours in real life. You tell the same lies to people around you with the same regret that you avoid expressing with words. You show the same signs of annoyance to an unwanted guest. It's the same feeling of disconnection that you feel in modern city life. And it's your chance to see you from the outside, imitated by the main characters. I have seen all the movies of Nuri Bilge Ceylan, incl. his short film Koza (Cacoon) thanks to those who put it in the DVD. Many would compare it with Tarkovsky, Ozu and maybe Bresson or Bergman because he is becoming a real author. And he is sincere in saying that his films are not for making money but for giving meaning to his life. This is the kind of sincerity you will find in Uzak.
