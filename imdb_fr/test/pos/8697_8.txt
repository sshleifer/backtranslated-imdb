Absolute sensor of a movie, and given its age, years ahead of its time. I saw it for the first time the week my father came home with a neighbor's television, which the guy had scrapped. A handyman with everything electric, dad made it work in two days. It was July 1955 ... and then probably only the third house on the street to have TV! This film is pretty much the first thing we've ever seen on this 12-inch grainy, shiny old screen. "It's beautiful old man," I remember my mother had told me! <br /> <br /> Almost 50 years old, and it does not look older - kind of like the First World War in this regard! A fantastic little fantasy on a London omnibus carrying thirteen passengers, who hangs and kills one of theirs. Then, in the flashback, we discuss the lives of these people and what led them to be on the bus the same day. <br /> <br /> Returning to the crash at the end of the film, the identity of the victim is revealed, perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960 film THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER. <br /> <br /> If you ever come across this gem, I suggest you watch it!
