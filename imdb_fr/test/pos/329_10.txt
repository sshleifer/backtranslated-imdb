Hello everyone! I went to this movie without any expectations, although I knew that Maniratnam would have given a great movie! I was stunned !! The context is the struggle between Sri Lankan Tamils ​​and the government. The story tells how a young girl, Amudha, who lives with her adoptive parents in Chennai, India, goes to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The highlights of the film are the performances of each actor and actress and of course, cinematography, editing and all other technical details. All the casting notes and the team. I have to talk about cinematography because it brings out the war in such a way that you feel present. Excellent work! Although the sequences of war remind me of Saving Private Ryan, such work has never been attempted on Indian Screen. Overall, the movie is great! And hat to Mr. Maniratnam. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratnam once again proved that he was a director capable of propelling Indian cinema to the height! I would love to watch this movie again and again. An excellent film and must see.
