I decided to extend my review for my favorite movie of all time. Unlike other event-based war films, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer on a psychological journey through the mind. Pure surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, but you can not turn your eyes away. Apocalypse Now, inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, slowly casts its protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen) into the madness, probably in the same way that Kurtz sank into madness. The production of this film is known for its delays due to the monsoon season and for the unexpected performance of Brando (he reads his lines from memory cards). There's a documentary called Apocalypse Now: An Apocalypse of Filmmakers that shows the hell that everyone has experienced creating this. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular of all films. While the helicopter's blade is heard in slow motion and the napalm is dropped into the trees, The Doors' song "The End" can be heard. The next picture shows Willard in bed with the fan lit up. The noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan. We are told that he is doing special missions for the army, mainly assassinations. When his next mission is entrusted to him, he is disconcerted. "Accusing a murderer here is like giving a ticket to the Indy 500." The man he has to kill is a respected colonel who went mad and isolated himself from the tribesmen. Kurtz orders atrocious acts committed by these people and he must arrest me. Willard is not going alone though. He is transported on a boat with several soldiers and they meet several battles. Along the way, they meet Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Kilgore "Hoorah" about the war. Willard thinks that if Kilgore is so crazy, what could Kurtz look like? Many scenes show Willards sinking into madness: the attack of the tiger, the massacre of innocent Vietnamese, the incessant rain, the corpses stacked scattered and the death of the members of his crew. When he reaches the Kurtz complex, he is greeted by the villagers and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of Kurtz's immediate murder, Willard begins to talk to him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand, wants to die. He is tired of the war and wants to become a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in unison, a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people. Once they realize that their leader has been killed, instead of killing Willard, they salute him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is breathtaking. The colors are grain free, which is rare in older films. I can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the landscapes. <br /> <br /> The game set is great, everyone plays their role well. Many criticize Brando for whatever reason, but I think he plays his part as a depressed and war-ravaged man. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack and the haunting score give the mood of the film. I wonder what instrument they used in this guitar sound when the credits scroll? There has been a lot of parody about this movie, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character of the same name in a police show behaves like an idiot: "Your character provides comic relief for the series, like Uh, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. "Those who saw the movie know why it's hilarious.
