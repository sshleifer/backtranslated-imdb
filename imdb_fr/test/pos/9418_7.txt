I watched two very different Holmes adventures this morning, but you'd be surprised at these similarities. <br /> <br /> It was probably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (If I was king, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce, and director Roy William Neill. It was not their first adventure with Sherlock Holmes, as they had done a few years before. <br /> <br /> The team made an excellent team, but I prefer the Hammer version, which I will talk about later. <Br /> <br /> Holmes relies on a lot of disguises to do his job, and I'm constantly amused by the ways they show up when they find something. They always seem to get started when they find a new clue. <br /> <br /> The story of keeping a bomb site of the Germans during the Second World War was interesting and allowed you to stay focused on the mystery.
