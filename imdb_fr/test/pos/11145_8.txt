The story takes place in a rural German region on the eve of the Second World War, in a unique setting. Two British agents are held by the Germans on a farm. Since they are not yet technically at war, it seems that both sides must have understood what was going to happen. The two agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) escape into the countryside and separate. Milland meets a gypsy, Marlene Dietrich, one night while she is alone in her camp preparing dinner. Their encounter is a fascinating and captivating scene, not so much for Milland as for Dietrich, who brings sexy sensuality to a brand new plane. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy to hide from the Germans, but he remains attached to his mission, which is to locate the scientist who knows the formula of a new toxic gas, but who is not a convinced Nazi either. Hollywood life and its customs are predictably described, but knowing that they would be one of the targets of the extermination of the Nazis adds some tension. The film is halfway between a serious story about toxic gas and the urgent search for the formula, and a colorful but not too convincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. However, they are both very good. it is the fault of the film that did not give them, or their relationship, a fairly dramatic realism, relying on and exploiting obvious cultural differences for dubious humorous purposes. Nevertheless, there are some interesting and interesting points here and there, surprise meetings with German soldiers and agents of the Gestapo, where Dietrich reads a good palm book and Milland almost as good simulator, announces on the radio that the Germany was attacked by Poland and everybody gets up and salutes. Mitchell Leison may have missed opportunities here and there, but he took full advantage of them.
