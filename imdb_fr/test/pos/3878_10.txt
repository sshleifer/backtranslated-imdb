Because of this series that was cut early, I never understood why until recently I read the story of the series. I had the feeling that this show had never been considered one of the biggest shows. This show is iconic in nature and deserves the film that it was always intended to have, if not with the original cast of A, at least with the cast incorporated in the story or a long cameo, maybe at the end commemorates it to the late Colonel Hanibal Smith (Preppard). This distribution has given so much to bring us joy by growing up that they deserve a last uprising, because the fact that the series ends openly because they cut the series is reason enough. This crew and this distribution made us understand to our children the essence of being a good guy, and especially to see how bad the world is today. I think a softer version like the original one should be set in motion. I have already read the excerpts and I know. These are not the plans but if anything is a movie directly on DVD, I would definitely buy it. I really do not understand how crappy shows get the finals of the series, but this great show that is happening regularly these days and is probably looked more than some current shows still has not been thought for the Incredible Hulk series, Knight Rider, Airwolf and Team A because this kind of shows endures over time, I'm pretty sure that the known ones you see on the detectives will not remember in 10 years, so why not bring something back and show to people what is the power of staying and how are these old shows really all.
