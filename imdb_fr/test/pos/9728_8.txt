Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir play in 1940's 1940 movie "And One Was Beautiful" featuring Billie Burke. At an hour and fifteen minutes, it seems to have been a movie B. Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, that many women want, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is the most committed of the two who likes to fix cars, and Helen is the blond social butterfly with the beautiful dresses. Ridley returns to town and, convinced not to be at a party, Helen decides not to attend. As the party is given by a family friend, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a tight dress. Ridley is here and the two are connecting. But Ridley is more superficial, and when he sees Helen at a dinner party, the two go back to a club. He gets drunk and Helen starts refusing to get in his car because he will not let her drive. After walking for a while and breaking the heel of her shoe, she gets into Ridley's car as he passes. He faints and gets behind the wheel, accidentally knocking and killing a cyclist. <br /> <br /> Ridley does not remember anything, so Helen allows her to take responsibility for the death. The heel of a woman's shoe is in the car and Katherine sees her sister burying her shoes. Plus, something like Helen makes her realize that Helen is not telling the truth. Ridley is convicted and goes to jail. Helen marries a man she does not like and leaves for South America. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie, although at the time it was not an A-list casting. Cummings plays a role that Robert Taylor would have played (it's an MGM movie) - he's handsome and very kind, even though he does not have the dazzling eyes of someone like Taylor. Laraine Day is one of my favorite actresses, a person that MGM lent on a regular basis because she did not know what to do with her. Why, I wonder - a wonderful actress with a great face and voice, she has animated a lot of movies. This one is no different. Her Katherine is determined, friendly and totally charming. Jean Muir is an ugly actress. <br /> <br /> So who was the beautiful? We all know that even though MGM did not know it. <br /> <br /> Small jewel highly recommended.
