I really appreciate what Jung-won did before his death. All. I mean, his choice for love is selfless. If he chooses Da-rim, it will be good for him. But Da-rim will need more time to recover from his death. Obviously, he does not want that to happen. As in the movie, he chose to give up. So it was a temporary agony for Da-rim. <br /> <br /> For comparison, My life without me is very different. Their behavior shows a big difference between Eastern culture and Western culture. I can not say which one is the best. Everyone has the right to choose. It's totally up to you. Life is equal for everyone. We can only live once. Any choice is acceptable if you think it is good for you. <br /> <br /> In reality, the slowness of the film can not be used as an excuse to reject the film. Relax a little. You will get more from the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean movies I've ever watched. 9/10
