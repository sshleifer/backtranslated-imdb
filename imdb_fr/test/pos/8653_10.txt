The film is an excellent and very thoughtful watch. I think it's a movie about your appearance if you live in a world created by catalogs. The scenes are all perfect reconstructions of an Ikea catalog where they even look at furniture on their TV. When they enter the kitchen, they enter another perfect picture of what a kitchen would look like in a catalog. When he is reborn or you want to call him, he comes back to the harsh reality of life. I love the moment when he tells his new love that he left his partner. He makes fun of commercial bliss by saying that you can have everything and that it is nice to have the same things, but some things you do not want to share. A film without children also allows Say, to make a perfect ten.
