Successful films on metaphysical topics are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good example. You can attribute this great subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an incredibly good job. The purpose of the film is to show humans, and even the world, from a non-human point of view. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three parts: creation, paradise and golden age. The images of each are in counterpoint of the voice off. Although the text of 'The Creation' (from the Mayan myth Popol Vuh) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene does not further illustrate this myth. He dwells on the waste and various specimens of destruction (fire, smoke, accident vehicles). The images of "Paradise" are anything but that, and "The Golden Age" is dark and comical ?? the highest culture is the strange musical act at the side of the road. <br /> <br /> The Popol Vuh suggests that humanity is the central object of creation, but the film does everything in its power to cancel this notion. Its mythological framework has no reference in human historical time. There are no human characters to talk about. When a boy stands with a dog during a long shot, the initial suggestion is his point of view; in the end it's a lot more the dog. Similarly, the lizard is a stronger character than the man who introduces it, and the partner of the turtle seems barely human with its big fins. <br /> <br /> Animal stories and documentaries about nature are always anthropomorphic, but Fata Morgana has none. While the dunes look like a woman's body, the comparison goes both ways. Presumably, only humans can easily distinguish their creation from nature, and here planes and factories are presented along mountains, lakes and waterfalls. People and civilization are all part of a larger natural landscape. <br /> <br /> In 1979, Herzog changed the idea by reworking Nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.
