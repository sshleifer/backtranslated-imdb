This film should be seen for the music, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Of course, the soundtrack is not really hi-fi, but there are many excellent versions available in the classical music selections. The cantata can be appreciated for itself, but having seen the film helps. <br /> <br /> The story itself is a rather classic anti-German Soviet propaganda in wartime. An amusing anecdote is that Stalin was later so eager to buy time by soothing Hitler at the beginning of the Second World War that Eisenstein had been briefly detached in a German film, like penance. <br /> <br /> Prince Alexander Nevsky (revered as a saint by the Russian Orthodox), after gaining his nickname by defeating Swedish looters on the Neva, resists Russian resistance against invasion by the Teutonic Knights and concludes his victory by a stern warning to other potential invaders. <br /> <br /> An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians being enslaved by Mongolian soldiers and does nothing to prevent this, as the Teutonic knights are his priority. The historical Alexander Nevsky paid tribute to the Mongol khans, like his father before him, while working to consolidate the future independence of his kingdom.
