If we consider three films on a similar subject, this one, which was made in 1930, "The Covered Wagon", made in 1923 and "Wagon Master", made in 1950, the distance between "The Big Trail" and "The Big Trail" The boxcar is only 7 years old while the distance between 'The Big Trail' and 'Wagon Master' is 20. It's amazing, because it shows how much the films have evolved over the years. these seven years and how, over the next twenty years, the changes have come late. "The Big Trail is technically close to" Wagon Master ", but stands out from that of" The Covered Wagon ". The story is about the Missouri pioneers in western Oregon. Tyrone Power Sr. is the man who runs the caravan, he's a tough, mean guy. John Wayne is the good guy and the film puts too much emphasis on his beauty, not leaving him the chance to be the Wayne we're used to. Marguerite Churchill is such a proud woman that one wonders why Wayne does not forget him. Raoul Walsh was a master of the caravans and cattle that crossed the west. He directed "The Tall Men" in 1955, which has much in common with "The Big Trail".
