It's a movie that deserves another look - if you have not seen it for a while or a first look - if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play of the same name, it tells the story of an older actor who runs a Shakespearian repertoire company touring England during the Second World War. He discusses his stress of trying to play a Shakespeare each night as he faces problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older actors or physically disabled - valid young people who can be conducted for military service. He also discusses his relationships with various members of his company, including his dresser. So far, all this seems pretty dull but nothing could be further from the truth. Although tragic overall, the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions are strong. The two main men have both received Oscars nominations for Best Actor and rightly so. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves human drama, theater, especially Shakespeare, or who has worked behind the scenes. Behind the scenes is another facet of the film that will fascinate most viewers.
