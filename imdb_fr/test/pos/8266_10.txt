I copied my video from this video on DVD so I can enjoy it at any time and it makes it a very successful (and rare) wedding gift! This is just an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a beloved romance. Everything is perfect and it has aged incredibly well. There's always a chance with something as old as it may sound a bit squeaky alongside more modern dramas, but 'Precious Bane' is better than him. doing a superlative Prudence and a young Clive Owen pacing the taciturn Gideon Sarn. <br /> <br /> I challenge everyone to watch the final sequence without at least sniffing the romance of it all. It's the perfect movie to watch when it's cold outside and you're snuggled on the couch. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend it enough.
