This film has just won the Best Film Award at the Cleveland International Film Festival. His American title is apparently Spring Autumn. The acting is superb. The story takes you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life inflicts on him and pricks him a bit. Encouraged by his best friend (and partner of a less serious crime), he engages people at every opportunity but still often reveals his heart of gold. His wife, who is slow to handle, has lost consciousness and is making a decision that changes his life and is heartbreaking to watch. The resolution of the story is beautiful.
