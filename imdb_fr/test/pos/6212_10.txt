Supercarrier was my favorite movie in the late 80's when it came out. My father filmed it for me and I watched it all the time until my mother-in-law filmed Oprah on it and my heart tore. I would like to know if or where I can get it. I was looking for him. I think they even released a Supercarrier 2. It was not as good as the 1st, but I would like to have them all if I could find them. I do not think it's a bad movie. It was a very interesting movie with a lot of action, but there was a story of love story. The actors / actresses in the movie were great. It also helped me to understand that it's not just a man's world, but it's also a world of women and many women can do the same things, if not more than what a man can do and women also deserve a lot of respect for their homework.
