What is there to say about an anti-establishment film that was produced at a time characterized by such a void, social indifference and authoritarian contentment? Cassevettes' first big independent film was not an instant hit at the box office and still has not received the critical attention it deserves. I make comparisons with this wave of independent American projects including "Beat" filmmakers such as Robert Frank and Harry Smith, with the nascent scene emerging in Paris at the end of the 1950s, known as the "French New Wave" . <br /> <br /> They discussed poetry, philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with the rediscovery of American cultural supremacy; even at this stage, this particular and very spontaneous film production fought against the establishment of such political and bigoted lexicons, which hindered the development of the arts in the middle of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> Cassevettes' film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we, as a culture, are blinded by our own prejudices and races. The great thing about most Cassevettes works is that his films have almost a minimalist knock-on effect; a mental reaction is evoked through subtle relationships of character, not so many images. That's why his work seems to linger, as he takes a more intimate approach to defining characters that rely less on explicit actions and more on interpretation. <br /> <br /> Although my favorite film of Cassevettes is "Husbands", this one is his most important.
