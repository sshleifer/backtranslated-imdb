I saw this interesting film in parallel with the French-Chinese film "2046" at the recent Dubai Film Festival. Both were intelligent works made the same year (2004/2005). Both had the main characters living in a "hotel". In both films, the hotel is more of a metaphor for exile than a place. Both were about love between a man and a woman. Both had wonderful music and fascinating performances. What a coincidence and yet, the differences in treatment of the subject between the two films! Somewhere at the beginning of the film, a man walking on a sidewalk turns to look at a woman and, in the process, hits a street lamp. The audience bursts into a volcano of innocent laughter. But is not it a brief overview of the film synopsis that entertain you for 2 hours? While the film is a marvelous mix of black comedy (for example, using a stethoscope to listen to the neighbors' conversation), the film builds on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati had presented at earlier cinema - stoic faces that lead to comedy altogether unlike Robin Williams's equally clever world or the comforting Danny Kaye. A sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoical character, while transferring money from the hotel to the bank recalls the works of Tati. <br /> <br /> But the film is not a simple comedy. The anti-automation statement (counting funds and reaction of bank staff to the statements that concern it, the manikin that serves as an ineffective warning to the lady who is speeding, the reference to "Moulimix" as a "society" "fictional for which he works, etc.) indicate that the director offers a comedy charged to the viewer. Laugh, yes, but think about it and enjoy it further. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film lies in his short staccato script (directed by Paul Sorrentino) that proposes a comedy mixed with philosophy ("Truth is Boring," "Daddy died, but no one told him says, "Bad luck does not exist - it's the invention of the losers and the poor." The director then continues to give you a fascinating lecture of the main character on insomniacs.You will not sleep through this lecture. /> <br /> Sorrentino offers entertainment related to the subject that Italians know best - the Mafia.It is an existential mafia film. <br /> <br /> Since "The truth is boring", the director provides a dessert as part of the fine meal of the superb actor (Toni Servillo), good music, work of intelligent camera (Luca Bigazzi), a beautiful enigmatic actress (Magnani, granddaughter of the great Anna) and a powerful scenario: dessert is for the viewer who must determine if the above in the film is the truth. If that was the case, is not it?
