I saw Riverdance - The new show and I liked it from the first moment! It's an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dances, music and choreography! Leaders Jean Butler and Colin Dunne captivated me with their exquisite dance! May they still shine and continue to dance. Their chemistry on stage was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. It looks like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my favorite and will probably always be. Long live Riverdance!
