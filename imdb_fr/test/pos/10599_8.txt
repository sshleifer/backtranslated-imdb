I saw this film with the hope of laughing, but when I watched it, I did not stop laughing for weeks. They are such bad actors and it made this movie so much more fun to watch. (BTW Ryan Dunn did not eat the little car, he pushed it in the ass) The random appearances of the skaters and parts of Vitos were excellent. Give me Vito grapes! No Valo, your grapes are at the store. I would not recommend a person under 13 to look at her, frankly, she would not understand half the jokes or what they are talking about. I love VLB and after watching this movie, I could not help but go buy it or Viva La Bam series. What's wrong with this stupid comment? There must be 10 lines of this kind of Bull-sh1t? I should be able to write one as long or as short as I want. I will continue typing until he tells me that I can actually send it. It's just a waste of time, I was just expecting to say what I wanted, it was not too much, but I'm told that I have to continue to put more and more and then that corrects my spelling, so if I did not spell it out, you get what I mean again. It's ridiculously long. <br /> <br /> ~ Those who live near the sword are shot by those who do not ~
