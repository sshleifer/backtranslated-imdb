A particularly charming film for those of us who saw this when they were young because after all, it was meant for young people to watch - when we look at it again as an adult, it is better that glasses tinged with pink can enter the scene. It was the first of the 16 Jungle Jim films and later, Johnny Weismuller, a thick TV series, did the same for Columbia (in the last 3 movies, he had to use his own name because they had lost the rights) after having suffered the inconvenience of playing Tarzan for Sol Lesser. Johnny Sheffield also gave up playing Boy to become Bomba the Jungle Boy in a series of 12 films. <br /> <br /> Jim and his group embark on a perilous safari in search of the hidden temple of Zimbalu held by an obscure tribe of devil doctors who seem to have the secret of a poison that could also be a cure cure against polio. Edgar Rice Burroughs probably approved. After 16 years of monosyllabic conversation, Weismuller seemed embarrassing in stringing sentences, not that it mattered. During the brisk walk, we meet many jungle inhabitants, interesting but generally mischievous, with the exception of the sinister crocodile who will eat the leading lady with his leg taken under a branch and the elephant rush surreal (archive footage stuck in a corner of the frame). Skipper the dog and Caw-Caw the raven have gone through many adventures, none of which have proved essential to the plot in case you concentrate! The biggest problem with the film is the farcical climax, which can be exciting but also unfortunately remind you of the end of a series. and the excellent original series was made 12 years ago. Although personally, it would not bother me either to spend a few more hours! <br /> <br /> The only thing that weighed in all this was Weismuller; in many ways, a nice old-time children's movie - not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
