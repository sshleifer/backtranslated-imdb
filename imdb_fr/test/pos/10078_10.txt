It's strange that the lesser-known films are sometimes among the best you've seen. This film contains all the elements of a modern thriller, firearms, techno, villains, money, etc., yet it stands out from the average of your Hollywood movies. I would credit this to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has self-confidence and Lorraine Bracco is one of the hottest and sexiest women I've ever seen on screen. Another major reason why this film stands out is that the scenery was transferred to Jamaica after the start. The Jamaican resort is so beautiful that you would like to be seated by the pool at night, with a Run'n'Coke. . . I know I did it. I'm very happy to have seen this movie - it was too good to miss!
