I was expecting FAME to be an edifying film, but the result is the opposite. The intrigue that follows the lives of several determined students attending a school of performing arts has great potential. However, FAME builds his characters beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions in the end. I was very surprised when the graduation scene broke out - we thought the DVD had jumped or something like that. All the characters have internal and external conflicts and hardly any of them are resolved at the end of the movie! You may think there are too many characters, but it's probably too many scenes. It is obvious that the film was cut and shortened because it sometimes lacks transition. I think Laura Dean like Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I really connected with the ambition of his character and follow his heart. Boyd Gaines in the role of Michael, the poor stereotypical student who can not read but who is a divine dancer, is also very good. I did not particularly like Irene Cara's character Coco, but it's not Cara's fault since her screenplay is weak and her character is not fleshed out. His voice is beautiful and hearing his songs justifies watching the whole movie. In summary, the film could use many improvements, but quality actors and good music have their place in the history of the film.
