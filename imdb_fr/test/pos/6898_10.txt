It's so refreshing to see a movie like this with a real mood and personality instead of a bunch of CGI cartoon gadgets. It is a great parody of horror that has real thrills alongside very good scenery and performance. His laughs are subtle, but plentiful. Because there are very few, if any, CGIs, there is no need to shake the camera violently to mask the effects of shit. This makes the film immensely viewable compared to other films of this genre that have come out in the last decade. <br /> <br /> Much nicer than the big-budget rubbish released today by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> See.
