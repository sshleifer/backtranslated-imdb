Apparently, a B ... B movie has to mean better acting and a better message than the one we get today in the big-budget "A" photos. Modern films for young women are certainly not designed to encourage depth of character in relation to superficial egoistic behavior ... nor to increase the self-esteem of girls who do not conform to "feminine" norms. (After all, criticizing the fake and the foil, as this film does, will not help sell more girl-dependent products * do not * be satisfied with their natural attributes or inner beauty.) > Lar / The day is kind as a mechanically inclined tomb boy who "sneaks" into rooms and admits his inability to flirt. She shares links with Robert Cummings because of similar interests, a shared sense of humor and honesty, loyalty and good friendship that he gradually appreciates for his sister's superficial "charms" glamorous, selfish and selfish. own selfish and foolish playboy tendencies). <br /> <br /> Although Laraine is as beautiful in appearance, it is refreshing to see the inner beauty more valued and the representation of true friendship leading to the most rewarding relationship. I hope girls (and guys) will get that kind of realistic message today. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Hollywood started making "B" movies again, with a modest budget, and trying to be satisfied with modest profits ... what am I saying? Sacrificing the blockbuster mentality to create something sincere on a small scale, it would be a bit like expecting a guy to loose the shallow sexpot for a sweet girl who really cares about him. This is madness. <br /> <br /> Please, someone already invents a machine to go back in time! I belong in 1940. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film is higher, but the end is a little too abrupt and perhaps lacked a sufficient indication of the change of heart of Robert Cummings. (I like the fact that B movies are short and catchy, not inflated and complacent, but this one could have taken more than 70 minutes.) He also found it a bit unrealistic for a widow and young children to be not affected by a sudden death in their family ... or be so indulgent to the one who provoked it. I mean, I guess it's * nice *, but a little more mourning or bitterness would have been natural. Perhaps a deliberate choice to make this family act light about their loss, to mitigate the impact of the tragedy and to ensure that * we * forgive the people involved in the death - since it does not happen. acts anyway as a plot, not the real purpose of the film. Still strange though.
