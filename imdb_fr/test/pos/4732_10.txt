If you value your freedom! <br /> <br /> I first became seriously interested in The Branch Davidian's debacle after reading an article in the British newspaper "The Fortean Times". Wanting to learn more, I rented this documentary and after watching it, I was stunned by what I saw. This film aroused my interest in the subject and I have read several books on the subject since then. This film is a must for people who only know the facts reported in the so-called "mainstream" media. The lies, the double talk and the contradictory statements made by the leaders and politicians presented in this film will make you think twice before calling people who question the actions of governments in this "nut" fiasco, "loonies" and "kooks". What is frightening is that I know people who consider themselves liberated "intellectuals" and "liberals" who are still convinced that the government has acted rightly in Waco and refuse to watch this film or read one of the books on the subject. They continue to insist that they are not worth their time, because it is a real propaganda on the part of weapons, Clinton hating firearms, religion fanatic, crazy right-wing anarchist. A publication of an organization composed of many "great minds" claiming to be devoted to the promotion of "reason", "common sense" and "rationalism" condemned the film, saying it would poison people's minds and strongly suggested to delete this film. . They even hinted that the Davidians had sent for him. I will not mention his name since I am a coward. If you're one of those who reads this (of course, you probably would not read it anyway), I can only say that it's unfortunate that you do not open your mind.
