One of the low-budget 70s classic movies, this film was found in a videocassette store in London for only 50 books. (It's worth noting that the package features the star of the movie as "Charles Bone", which looks like a porn star, but once the credits are played, it is obvious that the photo is aligned to the extreme right of the TV screen, so that all actors members have the last missing letter in their name) <br /> <br /> From the moment the narrator presents to us miserably the situation according to which the desperate tenants from a darker building in New York, you know you're roller coaster ride cheese. The direction comes from the "Ed Wood" single draw school - if one or two extras were watching the film crew, then what's going on? <br /> <br /> The film ends with a twist of scenario that puts The Usual Suspects to shame.
