He plays Billy Tepper, an extremely smart joker, as well as Wil Wheaton and Keith Coogan, his best friends, Joey Trotta and Jonathan "Snuffy" Bradberry.

They are mouths and actions can kill them. When the government desperately tries to find a way to help, Billy, Joey, Snuffy and a few other boys decide to take charge.
