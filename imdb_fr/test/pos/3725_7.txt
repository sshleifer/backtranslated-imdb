The first work of Luc Besson is also his first foray into science fiction, a genre he will return to fourteen years later with "The Fifth Element" (1997). Although this film has been heavily influenced by Hollywood cinema, it remains very enjoyable. In 1983, "the last fight" reveals Besson's own science-fiction approach. He picks up a thorny subject and his efforts are discernable for doing an elegant job. Shot in widescreen and in black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually the entire population of the Earth and we will never know what the disaster is and why men can not talk. Hordes of barbarians have formed. In parallel, a man (Pierre Jolivet) lives alone and arrives in a Paris unrecognizable where he is received by a doctor (Jean Bouise). <br /> <br /> There are no words in Besson's work. The actions of the characters and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the backdrop are disconcerting, the film never looks depressed. It seems that the man and the doctor are trying to reproduce gestures and actions related to humanity before the disaster. The movie begins with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him speak through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. It is all the more intriguing that these paintings seem to come from prehistory. After this reasoning, one could argue that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) embodies the evil and threatens the efforts of the man and the doctor to find what was ultimately a human being. Ditto for the band of villains at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The pessimistic smell that such a film could convey is not really in the foreground and leaves room for a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have won without music, except the one that the man can hear with his tape recorder. Luc Besson had to make better films and continue to seduce like this, he also boosted the career of director Pierre Jolivet who left behind an uneven work: "Force Majeure" (1989), "Simple Mortel" (1991) "My Small Business" (1999) or "Single Girls" (2003).
