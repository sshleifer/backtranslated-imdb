I love this movie (I do not know why it's called Pot Luck in England - what a nonsense and this name totally irrelevant!), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, ​​not as an Erasmus student, but with other strangers. even. It reminds me so many good memories of the pleasure I had with all the friends I made of different countries and the city itself. I really want to see more 'The Russian Dolls', I guess it will not be published here? My brother saw it in France and said it was really not that good, but that it had the same cast (Wendy's brother is apparently getting married). Anyone know anything about this movie? and if he can be released?
