During my 13 years of schooling, from kindergarten to high school, only one day ago my class went on a field trip. When I went to school, you went to school from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm and the classified trips were not undertaken. But, for some reason that I did not remember at this advanced age, we went to see a movie - National Velvet. I do not remember the film, so on the eve of my 57th year, I decided to see him again. <br /> <br /> This is a film about an era that no longer exists. A time when people trusted others and did not lock their homes. A time when people enjoyed the benefit of the doubt. It was a time when the family was the most important thing. This movie shows all this and more. It reflects the love, trust, care and kindness of people. <br /> <br /> It's not bad for all families to watch this movie from time to time and discuss their message. <br /> <br /> It was a treat to see the young Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney at its best, the Oscar-winning performance Anne Revere, Angela Lansbury before Murder, She Wrote and Donald Crisp, who played for almost sixty years. <Br /> <br /> Which movie!
