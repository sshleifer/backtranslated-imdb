OK, why complain about this movie? It's fiction. Do with. If you want to see the biography, go watch it. This is an original fictional version of what happened in Wisconsin. The obsessed people will complain, like any deviation from the facts. Sad but true. I think making Kane Hodder the man who gave his name to the movie was a great idea. I thought it was not so good at first, I'll be honest. But that made it even more scary. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or movies based on real events, I think it's a good movie. But if you are obsessed (like some people), stay away from this movie and all the others.
