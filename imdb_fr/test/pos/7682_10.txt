I was a projectionist while I was in the United States. and remember very well this movie. we had just been installed with Stereo Sound !! o-o-o-o-o !! Well, it was a big deal in 1959. The instructions came with the reels. The opening played while the projected image of the curtain was closed and I followed with the closed theater curtain too. intermittently, the theater curtain was closed and after five minutes, I would resume the film with the closed projection curtain, while the music served as a curtain on the second shutter. Being the first stereo film I have ever seen and being such a great music production, I certainly enjoyed watching it every time I showed it for the race.
