If you're a fan of Jackass, Viva La Bam or CKY, you already know what you're going to do. But this is one of the rare events where a suite is better than the original! And does the man make this movie pack a low average shot. But I mean that in a good way. This is the same kind of murderous and heartbreaking madness we know and love and expect from Bam, Knoxville & Co. But this time with even more laughter than ever! With Johnny Knoxville's senseless tolerance of pain, Bam Margera's love for the harassment of his family and friends, and Steve-O's rude factor, you've got a helluva movie. The bar for stunts, skits and the general chaos of the Jackass team was lifted. Jackass 3? Doubtful, because it is almost impossible to improve perfection.
