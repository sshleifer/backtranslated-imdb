I finally found a version of Persuasion that I like! In this version, Anne does not look like a kitchen maid, but rather a pretty skinny and aging woman, quite as she is described in the book. Captain Wentworth does not look like he's 50, he does not seem to be angry all the time, but as described in the book, he's not as old as Anne and is rather beautiful. And they play their roles with such conviction and realism ... that's what playing means. They were credible. They created real characters, and it was as if the characters in the book had come to life. If you have not seen this version, I urge you to find it, order it or ask for it at a bookstore or library, if applicable. This is worth the price and the wait. <br /> <br /> I looked at the 1995 version and the 2007 version and this one dominates the other two. Why this is not rated better is beyond my understanding. The book reflects the tenderness of their relationship and this film brings the book to life.
