I liked that a lot. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are cold, it's not as agitated as a Blair witch. And I thought they did a good job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Many people were screaming on the screen! <br /> <br /> Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He is a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes. <br /> <br /> Kane is a lot less scary and more credible than most film psychologists. I did not know how he would react to various situations. There are not many twists here, but it's smart and original in its own way. Good, scary, B-movie slasher fare.
