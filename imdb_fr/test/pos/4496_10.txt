OK I did not read the book ???? And maybe the book was better ???? WHO KNOWS ??? // But I loved the movie. It was fun, not a little boring, nice and especially heartbreaking. The friendship between the two children was so pure and innocent. These children played very well, especially the servant's son. Oh my God, it's like the shape of God on the face of the Earth. ARGHHHH he steals our heart so easily. ********* Spoilers ************* The other friend of the rich guy is a kid and his confusion and frustration can be understood. BUT I got angry when he gave up and ignored his friend when he needed consolation. In any case, he was only a kid and a little stubborn. I hope the film would also have shown the old kid's version. Arghh can hardly think of the end. This film is sad. I felt terribly sad during the end. Tears flowed in my eyes. Yes, the background notes are fantastic, the scenes are great. The kite scenes are fascinating. Well, it becomes a bit of an adventure in the middle. Wonderfully acted and superbly interpreted. The children have done so well. GREAT Direction. I do not know why this movie failed to convince WOOO critics. But that's sure WOO did to me. 10/10 to see ??????
