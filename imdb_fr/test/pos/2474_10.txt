The most amazing movie I have ever seen. I did not read the program and I came across the film by accident. I thought it was a real documentary and I felt sick of what I saw. I did not find out that it was a finished film and I searched the web for more information on "Punishment Park" in the United States. It was unbelievably real and it's easy to believe that it really happened in the United States. Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-American after watching the movie and discovering that it did not really go that way.
