I saw both movies and I have no doubt seen that the reconfiguration was the best, I know that many people would disagree with those who became fans of the original will probably not appreciate this recomposition, but I thought it was so good that I'm going to see it again tonight, the original scared me because they kill the kids, I mean who does that in the movies anyway .... but in the one the children have at least a chance in two ... The only negative point of this film is when the babysitter (Jill) walks towards the sounds she hears and runs outside in the bushes to search someone, obviously, no sensible person would do that while keeping the kids, that's the only thing I found wrong in the movie, and even though they probably had to put that to create some suspense I do not want to give too much for all who have not seen it, I recommend you to do instead of listening to all those people who say his shit and worse than the original, this is a better movie for teens because it displays things that most of us are afraid of, but when I was in the movies there were at least 10 adults over 70 who were watching him, and they appreciated him if they liked I think you'll do it! I give it a 9 out of 10!
