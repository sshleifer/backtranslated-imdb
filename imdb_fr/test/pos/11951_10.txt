It seems to me that many people have never seen this film, and those who have generally called it "hogwash" ... it's really serious. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this film, I admit It was almost one of these people ... Thank goodness, I'm patient, otherwise I would never have found such a classic . <br /> <br /> As good as this film is, this film is also a must for anyone who is a fan of 80s movies, or a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know there are a lot of people who will tell you that this film is somehow a derivative of Better Off Death ... And if it is? They were two excellent movies! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10/10
