If you can watch a Bond movie of 1983 that is not as good as Octopussy and enjoy it anyway. <br /> <br /> If you can accept production values ​​that are not really above the level of a TV movie. <br /> <br /> If you can watch Sean Connery with wrinkles on the forehead under an obvious toupee and always see James Bond. <br /> <br /> If you can pass an inexperienced Basinger, a weaker Largo and a happy Q. <br /> <br /> If you can learn to like an idiosyncratic score, avoid Barry with his worst day . <br /> <br /> If you do not believe the hyperbolic critics he was greeted with the release. <br /> <br /> If you can answer a poker battle and a video game face and enjoy both the same thing. <br /> <br /> yours is never again and all that is there. <br /> <br /> And besides, you'll probably enjoy it, my son!
