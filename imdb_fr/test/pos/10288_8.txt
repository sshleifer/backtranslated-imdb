All credit goes to screenwriter / director Gilles Mimouni who shaped this sinuous and misleading story of deception and treason. While maintaining absolute control, he keeps the audience at bay, never allowing them to be fully aware of what is happening. Even his clever denouement lets you guess. <br /> <br /> The three central representations are also first class. Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci have done everything to add to the mystery. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey completes her strength in her supporting role. Giving details about the plot or the specifics of the characters would not be fair. <br /> <br /> Thierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to guide us through this enigma, and the editing of Cardine Biggerstaff gives a head start to the story. The theme of Peter Chase is sublime in his marriage to the ideal of the scenario. <br /> <br /> One could say that Gilles Mimouni tries to face several deeper problems on the theme of love. For me, it is simply an elusive and haunting enigma that weaves a fascinating canvas. Only the French are capable of such a temptation. Hollywood would have spoiled that with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> Nobody does thriller like the French. <br /> <br /> Vincent Cassell intrigues as a deceiver Max, Romane Bohringer obsessed as new Lisa and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as Lisa's first. The plot of Gilles Mimouni is a whirlwind of deliberate deception and inevitably crossed threads. <br /> <br /> All the credit goes to his manipulation of the intelligent plot and the performances of the three protagonists. As Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
