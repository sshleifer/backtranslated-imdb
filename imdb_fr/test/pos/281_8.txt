Excellent and moving story of the end of a particularly intimate affair. Again, the intention of the film, to quote another comment, is that each relationship can be unique and intimate. A short film of great quality that caught me off guard, but yet has the power to attract me on the couch and watch, fixed and silent, for the duration. Bobby and Tessa are extremely moving characters. Anyone who has known the end of a love story will find this cathartic movie. Beyond that, the idea of ​​"film in a film" is going very well with this cast and is quite attractive, although in a somewhat melancholy way.
