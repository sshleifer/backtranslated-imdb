It is a film about love, violence, illegal business and Romanian moguls. A Romanian history combined with a Western adaptation resulting in a modern international film that can be understood by both the Western public and the Eastern European public who have long ago forgotten about the conservative communist regime of cinema. <br /> <br /> A film full of scenes of violent fights very numerous and which create situations more and more strained over the film. <br /> <br /> A story that impresses with his vision of the difficult life of the neighborhood. Two young men are doing illegal car races. They work together as a team and thrive on their craft, but when a local mogul asks them to lose a race, things start to get confused and the bomb rocket lights up, creating a very tense film which will keep you close to the screen until the end, when you will still ask many questions well after. <br /> <br /> A brilliant interpretation of Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac, a high quality production and writing for the young, but the talented director Radu Muntean also gives Furia a unique charm. All this and many other elements that can be noticed while watching have created a must-see movie for all moviegoers around the world and its message is clear to everyone, regardless of race, language or country. This is a real hope for Romanian cinema that tries to follow the more advanced Western cinema. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy watching it because I'm sure everyone who saw it liked and understood it.
