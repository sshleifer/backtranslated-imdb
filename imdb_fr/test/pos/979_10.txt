Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing, excellent production and an emphasis on clever ideas versus teenage PAP. The two stars work well together, and - what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Put "Irkel" and Lee Majors in the film was a brilliant touch. Watch this movie with your kids. If you do not laugh all the while, you do not have to be careful.
