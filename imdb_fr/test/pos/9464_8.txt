At first, honestly, I thought it would be a lame movie. But after seeing this, I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was very funny with the supporting actors (especially this character played by Snatch's "Bullet tooth Tony", what a contrasting role between these two films!). Now, I'm not one to say if an actor is good or not, but his act, in particular, was quite enjoyable. Even though the plot has become a tiny-bopper love triangle (albeit a very funny one) halfway through the movie, I think that should not escape, which I think, the movie is really: just entertaining. So, if you stumble upon it, whether it's DVD or theater, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
