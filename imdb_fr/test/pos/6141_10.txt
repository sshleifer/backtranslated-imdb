Although several scenes of Wirey Spindell can be described as "above". I thought it was refreshing to see something that was ready to go to a nearly taboo twisted comedy level. <br /> <br /> Wirey Spindell is a good movie with a good dialogue. I would not say that this movie is for everyone, but the movie is in my top 10 list. <br /> <br /> If you can look beyond the occasional offensive and watch it for the movie that it is, I would do it. I hope you can see it from the same angle as me.
