One of the best films of the 1980s, this fact-based film tells the story of a troubled high school student who kills his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a river bank and later boasts with her friends. . What is just as serious is their inability to FEEL something about it. <br /> <br /> Disturbing but incredibly captivating look at aimless and apathetic children who have no respect for their parents or any kind of authority, who seem almost doomed to death. live lives of rebellion and carelessness. This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget. The young cast does an honorable job - even Keanu Reeves, in one of her leading roles, is better than usual. Of course, there's no reason for Layne's character (Crispin Glover) to be as crazy and off-kilter as he is, but it's only Glover who is himself. The veteran Dennis Hopper plays particularly well the role of solitary who, in spite of his sordid past, is saddened by the attitude of this group of children. I would like to point out the scary behavior of Daniel Roebuck as a young murderer; It is an underrated actor and, apart from Hopper, it is probably the best performance of the film. <br /> <br /> I saw "River's Edge" for the first time a long time ago, when it began to be broadcast on cable TV channels; However, I did not understand everything. I saw it in its entirety for the first time several years later and now I've been seeing it for a while, which is probably the last one. <br /> <br /> Among the most moving moments is Madeleine (Constance Forslund). where she shouts that she should perhaps leave her children as their worthless father did. I also liked the scenes where Matt (Reeves) confronts his troubled younger brother (Joshua Miller) and where the teacher, Mr. Burkewaite (Jim Metzler) laments the fact that the girl is dead and that none of her students seem to worry about it. . <br /> <br /> I will never forget this movie, not as long as I live. It's too sad for that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
