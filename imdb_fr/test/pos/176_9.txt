After seeing The Skeleton Dance from Walt Disney on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked to YouTube, I used these same sources to watch a remake made in Technicolor for the comic book unit Columbia and animated by the same man, Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the previous black and white, are really used here with a lot of imagination and a lot of new gags, like when one of the musicians of the skeletal group constantly strikes on a wrong note or when one loses one's head and removes one other or when the dances with each other with some of this other party are as funny as the previous short film. It becomes a little repetitive towards the end. Nevertheless, Skeleton Frolics is worth seeing for all animation enthusiasts who wish to compare this with the previous Symphony Silly.
