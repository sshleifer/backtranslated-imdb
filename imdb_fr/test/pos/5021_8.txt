Wow, I think the overall average rating of this movie on this site is incredibly low. There is really no reason not to like this movie. "Michael" is a simple romantic comedy, but quite original, and easily enjoyable. The plot involves a group of journalists / experts who will examine the mysterious appearance of an angel (John Travolta) in the Midwest. The angel is less holy and mundane than one would expect, and that's what makes it fun. His interest in women and the Beatles gives a new twist to the question of angels. The romantic side of this film involves Michael the angel trying to reunite Andie MacDowell and William Hurt. Both may not have the greatest on-screen chemistry of all time, but they are certainly enough to make it work. All those who rated this film so low (a 5.4 ??), come on! The movie is not so bad. In fact, I found it quite funny and memorable. Of course, it's not the best thing you can see, but it's still good. It's a film that, in my opinion, has been remarkably underrated. It's fun, romantic and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
