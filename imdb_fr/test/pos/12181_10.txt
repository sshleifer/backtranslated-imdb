I have quite this adaptation of Anne Rice's book. Although most of the film is shot here in Australia, it offers a large amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) woke up recently after a long sleep and decided to betray his oath to reveal himself to a group. When he becomes a popular movie icon, his vampire comrades go crazy and complicate his death. Meanwhile, Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), orphan of supernatural studies, who owns an ancient vampire genealogical tree, has become deeply obsessed with Lestat. His boss, David (Paul McGann), understands his obsession and reveres his obsession with vampire Marius, (Vincent Perez), a former vampire and man who made Lestat a vampire too. Jesse receives the newspaper of Lestats and reads his first murder and a meeting with the queen of the damned Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat gives a concert in the Valley of Death, he learns that not only angry vampires will be there, but Akasha could also come. Meanwhile, Akasha has other projects. She goes to a vampire bar and a bar and kills everyone on her way. With Lestat tempted with royalty and love with love by Akasha, the ancient vampires consisting of Marius and Jesse Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) plot against them. Join Her Or Die? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was fantastic, the fighting scenes were fantastic, the music was fantastic and the place was beautiful. Aaliyah unfortunately died in a plane crash shortly before the screening of the film, but she looked beautiful on the set and on the set. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10 because it was a fantastic movie and I urge you to see it!
