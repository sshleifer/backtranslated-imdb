Will a company want to make a (good) DVD of this movie! ??? In addition to being a fantastic film about relationships and friendships, "Four Friends" is the ONLY movie I've ever seen - and I literally spent * years watching movies! - This reflects the essence of the 60's experience (and I was there!): Idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, betrayal and, ultimately, its optimistic but bitter-sweet ending. And all of this is accomplished without being a story of one of the many upheavals of this era, although many are simply touched ... as part of the tapestry. But the story mainly concerns the characters and their friendship about 10 to 15 years ... and the fact that they have survived and deepened despite the tragedies of this turbulent decade. Absolutely a joy and a film to see absolutely ... even if it is not an old hippie !!!
