What can I say about this film that will not give you any preconceived idea when you see it? Very little. The plot has to do with the return of a teenage girl's hospital after she broke up. The following is the movie. This is one of the most hallucinating films of recent years. Everything in the movie is slightly off center and leaves you feeling uncomfortable long after the movie ends. It's not a perfect movie. The film has problems in its last half hour that make a story already confusing, even more confusing (if you read a number of comments here on IMDb and elsewhere, you'll know that a lot of time has been spent trying to understand what's really going on), I'm not sure what I really think about this movie, other than the fact that it scares me and disturbs me in the same way as the most famous horror movies. If you like horror and you do not mind not having a clear summary, I suggest you try it because it will probably break your skin.
