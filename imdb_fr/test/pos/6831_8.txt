A nice kidnapping hug that takes place in New Orleans, but the main drawback, in my opinion, is that it contains too much political intrigue and double crossovers, and not enough sexy young actors , brightly colored scenes, original cinematic and biting style. humor. These aspects combine to give a refreshing and daring cinema, which gives a whole lot of recent films an unbearably dull aspect. Let's hope that SÃ©bastien Gutierrez continues with such talent - he looks like a talent to watch. The dishonest investigation group of the film is eclipsed by the investigative partnership between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, whose humor is essential to make the film what it is. Both men shoot their mandatory south shots just like the Yanks, and it's a pleasure to hear those two pillars of British cinema kissing with a fluidity similar to Lethal-Weapon's ... just a pity that the scenes have the ability to fly are exclusively theirs. Anyway, with a little less politics and authoritarianism (!), The film would be almost perfect, so I'll give it a healthy 8/10 and I hope a few people will remember a little better than the box office.
