This film always strikes me very emotionally in the end. Although the film's questions - interracial romance and adultery - were controversial at the time, this film far exceeds the narrow parameters of revolutionary novelty and unique uniqueness. We have here a true love story, written by the woman involved in this love story, told in a brilliant and aggressive style that extols the virtues and the glory of passionate crazy love. I love this recognition of the unique emotion that makes life worth living. Jennifer Jones is full of grace and William Holden is simply magnificent in his role as a journalist. A wonderful movie that only people who have experienced this kind of love can truly appreciate and understand. And for those who have not yet been in love, even the hope that one day a flash can strike for you is worth living - because love is worth having even if you lose it shortly the "substance" - the essence - of life. This film works for me. An experience warmly felt!
