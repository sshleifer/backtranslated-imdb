The film deals with universal themes, not mentioning any country in particular: it can happen anywhere - and has, in substance if not in shape. Those who are concerned about the problems of the 1st Amendment, censorship, etc. - but do not want to be bored with lectures - need art like this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire. <br /> <br /> Rickman is definitely an underrated character actor; it shines in this movie, showing multiple acting skills that you must see (I have not seen it yet give a bad performance, even in not so big movies). Stowe may be giving her best performance (and proving that she has one of the most striking eyes in Hollywood) - in two words: breathtaking, convincing. <br /> <br /> The scenography is perfectly suited to the situation, function and mood. Sound editing is intensifying appropriately. The total contrast conveyed by the animation sequences is a perfect symbolic device, as well as a welcome and a respite for most of the essential place of history. The scenario is tight and essential, with a dialogue that is both dramatic, realistic and engaging (that is, as it should and should be). The most amazing thing to face is perhaps the fact that 1) this is the first time the director has come out; and 2) he is the writer. In one sentence: a tour de force - with three recommendations: to see him, to own a copy, to see him several times to understand all the secrets and seize the genius.
