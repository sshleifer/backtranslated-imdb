Some time ago, I watched a video of Paul Thomas Anderson in which he expressed the great interest he had for pornographic films and how this industry could have produced better films and therefore a complete genre and not only sex on videotape. Paul Thomas Anderson put his own conviction of the porn industry into the character dramatically interpreted by Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose main dream is to make a "real" film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and, at the same time, exciting with beauty. and with the "big cocks and tits". As soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he thinks he has found the new star of his films. And so begins the story of young Eddie in the porn industry. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a movie in a nightclub where you can see all the people who will be part of Eddie's life. can see them outside the porn industry, live their daily lives. But soon, we can see them in the porn industry and after a single party, the story of the new Eddie begins, that of Dirk Diggler. All will have real success with Dirk as the main star, winning numerous awards and helping Jack realize his biggest dream with a series of films about Brock Landers, Dirk's new character. This type of exploitation film is a resounding success and, for Jack, these are his first "real" movies. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "horrible 80s" where there will be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and his friends. But we all know that excesses can destroy anyone and that erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star. The film focuses on their life after total success and how everyone is going through a very difficult time with many problems because of the bad image of society. the porn industry and at a time with many excesses. In the decadence of Dirk, having tried and failed in the music industry, there is a brilliant sequence that can sum up perfectly how things are going for Dirk and his friends. This sequence is that of his first transaction with the appearance of Alfred Molina, which results in a total disorder. It's funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and his mates, but there's always a solution if you get back to what you know and when Dirk returns, Brock will be back. <br /> <br /> characters in my kind of summary but I must say that all are incredibly well developed. The casting is just superb with the best performance I've seen from Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a powerful performance in a very moving character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc. are memorable. All their characters are filled with fun and sad moments. <br /> <br /> Finally, I love Anderson's extraordinary cinematic style here with a unique view. to the porn industry in the late '70s and early' 80s. I used to say that "Magnolia" was my favorite of Anderson, but for now, after watching everything except "Sidney "I can not say that I have a favorite because I love them all! <br /> <br /> PS: somewhere, I read that this movie is Anderson's "Scorsese movie", so I'm more than sure if you like "Goodfellas" and "Casino", you'll like also this one. I love "Boogie Nights"!
