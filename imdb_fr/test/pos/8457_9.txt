The first thing you see in this movie is a static angle (which will be repeated later in the film), illustrating the ongoing chaos (invisible to the public) in a studio broadcasting information. Shortly after, the typical story of the character of Fonda is presented from the same angle. Do not let this mislead you; the film does not speak of a journalist, a woman struggling to succeed in a profession dominated by men. It's just an introduction, a way to start the movie (although it's used later). The real point of this production is gradually revealed, and the first we see is early in a long scene. The whole movie has this rhythm; not slow or stretched, but deliberate. It's never very fast, even in the few sequences that we normally expect to be. This rhythm (especially because it seems to slow down further as a result of the revelation of the plot, the fact that the troubling and unsettling nature of the film is misunderstood) is strong, almost painful to the viewer. That makes you, if it were possible, to jump on the screen, grab the officials by the collar and shout to them to do something to remedy the situation. I never wanted to get up or even to leave the eyes of the screen for a moment. The subject is extremely important to know, and it is perfectly treated here. No over-dramatization (well ... very little, anyway), just an accurate presentation of the problem. The direction is amazing. The empathy felt for the character of Lemmon is profound. The editing is masterful ... a scene at the very end illustrates this perfectly. The publisher, judging by his filmography, is greatly underestimated. The writing was excellent. The acting was excellent, especially from Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who also produced it). The lack of score is perfect; no music is needed to improve. The end is sublime and effective. The film has some negatives ... among them, part of the dialogue is obviously and undeniably mainly an exhibition, a particular part of the film, although dramatic, does not seem to correspond to something that follows it. Not everyone will watch the movie because of two characteristics that are usually attributed (and rightly so) to bad movies. stimulation (which can be confused with slowness) and (lack of) score. One could argue that it is a negative thing, because everyone should look at the points they present, but maybe that would be better; to treat the heavy subject with intelligence and respect (for the subject as for the viewer) ... something like that, maybe it should not be spoon-fed. I was fascinated by the movie and I was very surprised. I recommend it to anyone who thinks they are strong enough to handle it. 9/10
