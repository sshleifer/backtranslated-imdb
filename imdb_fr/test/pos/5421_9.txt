It's a very strange little film that at first did not impress me. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation here is certainly not pretty - although after a while you noticed that the simple and ridiculous designs have a strange charm. This is probably because the script is as complicated as the animation works. <br /> <br /> The movie shows a senior couple sitting at the table playing Scrabble. At the same time, they are obsessed with this game or other bizarre activities (like the husband's compulsion to see things - even the chair and the table)! And all of this happens when the TV warns of imminent atomic annihilation - Armageddon is definitely here! Naturally, the neighbors howl and unleash - during which the couple continues unconsciously with this silly game. Heck, even their cat knows that the end is approaching, that the couple begins to quarrel over who could or could not cheat - leading to a very surreal end! The film deserves congratulations, both for its originality and for its humor. Although he did not win the Oscar, he was nominated for the best animated short film - which he deserves.
