Klaus Kinski appeared in a considerable number of spaghetti westerns in the 1960s and early 1970s; he was usually thrown into secondary parts as bad villains. Kooky Klaus is given the lead role of Crazy Johnny Laster, a disgusting and perverse sex maniac who proposes a plan to remove a beautiful heiress to obtain a considerable legacy. Johnny and his gang become wanted fugitives after the plan unfolds disastrously. Screenwriter / director Mario Costa brilliantly portrays the sordid and compelling portrayal of a discouraging work that is gravely ill and twisted: the plot unfolds at a steady pace, the tone is appropriate and serious, and the thrilling action scenes are set on stage skill and brilliance (the shootings in the rock quarries are particularly striking and exciting). Ironically dressed in white, oozing the oily charisma of every rotten pore, and jumping on beautiful women whenever he has the opportunity, Johnny Kinski creates a fascinating and monstrous brute. Kinski is simply spectacular as this gloriously repulsive person; he received excellent support from Gabriella Giorgelli, an attractive and hushed girl, and Steven Tedd, as well as Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino, Machete, a ruthless band leader, Giuliano Raffaella, Gary Pinkerton, and Paolo Casella, Glen. Congratulations are also in order for the moody and spirited score of Stelvio Cipriani. It's worth seeing for Kinski fans.
