Another masterpiece that requires a DVD release, but some libraries have VHS and are worth it. Just a brilliant piece on many things, mainly euthanasia, "respectability", religion and basic human relationships. The scenario effectively uses intelligent humor not only to deal with a problem like a severely disabled child, but also to bind parents in their love for "Jo". As a couple, Alan Bates and Janet Suzman are perfectly matched for both acting virtuosity and giving life to their deep and intelligent characters. <br /> <br /> I recently saw the brilliant performance of Bates in "Butley", released in film a few years after "Joe Egg", he embodies a cynical teacher, intellectual and funny, although Butley is much more dark as his Bry character here. If you play such great performances in "The Go-Between", "Women in Love", "Whistle Down the Wind", "The Caretaker" and "Georgy Girl", not to mention the most obvious "King of Hearts" and " Zorba the Greek ", and I would say that Alan Bates had a comparable career with Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and other great British actors of his time. <br /> <br /> The director Peter Medak also had one of my favorites of all time, "The Ruling Class", released the same year (1972) under the title "Joe Egg", which includes a career year in anyone's books. He had some sort of uneven filmography ("The Krays" was another highlight), but these two jewels will mark him as a great director.
