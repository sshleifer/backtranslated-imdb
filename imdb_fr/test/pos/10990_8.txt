Being from the Buffalo area, I knew that the movie had read many articles in local publications. I was very impressed by the film, especially its ingenious intrigue, acting and local scenes. Happy to see so many old quality stars in different roles. I think especially those over 50 will find the film excellent and you can leave the theater thinking that your time has been well used.
