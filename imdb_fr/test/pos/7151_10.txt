I saw this film at the Sundance Film Festival and I was also surprised that it does not generate more attention because it was not only powerful, beautifully crafted, but also very original. The audience was fully engaged and the biggest part of seeing such a film in a festival is the opportunity to talk with the director and present it during the question-and-answer session. They literally had to kick us out of the screening room for the next movie - we could have gone much longer. The film is both provocative and hilarious. It would be a shame if this film is not broadcast more widely. I hope it will at least be available on DVD, because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.
