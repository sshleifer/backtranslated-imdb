Being of Cephallonian descent, I was pleasantly surprised watching the movie. I heard about the true story of my family still living in Kefalonia, but when I watched the movie and read the book, incomplete fragments of the story were filled. All is true, the Italians sang, the oppression and the earthquakes that shake the island so often. The 1953 earthquake killed my great-grandfather and the book and film portray the feeling of the times with great compassion. If you have not seen the film, look at the book and read it, it's not just a love story, and yes, there were a lot of Italian women in love with Cephallonian women; Italy after the war is a true representation of history.
