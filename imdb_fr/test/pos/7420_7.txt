Terry and June were some of the classic British sitcoms in my opinion. You knew what to expect, and it's not so typical! :) Unlike modern sitcoms with totally artificial intrigues, this show is always a breath of fresh air. It is good not to see or hear remarks about bodily functions or not to see a family PERPETUALLY late for breakfast or a family with impossible teens. And that's where the secret lies: Terry and June relied on a middle-class couple living in relative harmony instead of today's tense conspiracies with the dysfunctional family of rigor (made to look real ). <br /> <br /> Personally, I vote the episode "Bridge to far" as one of the best. In a way, Terry's antics remind me of Basil Fawlty, the two sometimes becoming incredibly embarrassing! <br /> <br /> Terry and June are highly recommended. Prepare your tea and cookies!
