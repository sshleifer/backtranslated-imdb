Billy Hughes is a young dumb woman working for makeup on a cheap horror image filmed in Moscow by an American filmmaker. One night, Billy is locked in the movie studio. Later in the night, she learns that someone may be in the building and will check. It is then that she falls on a woman being brutally murdered, while she is filmed. After escaping the clutches of the murderers, Billy informs the authorities, but he has a red face when men show that it is an act. Billy knows what she saw and soon, her life is once again in the turmoil of the underground that believes she has something important. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this heart-throbbing sleeper happened to me, but I thought it was a much older movie. However, there is one thing: it must be one of the most discordant and intense thrillers I have known for a long time. It's just an excellent builder of suspense and most of the time everything is set up! The first half of the feature is amazingly captivating with tense sequences that have your heart in your throat and cover us with an alienating environment of a disturbing atmosphere. Underling is a very humorous black series. Flaws appear in the story, as they lose that furious hold he had so early and his clumsy humor (or better, a comical relief for putter) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richard's characters is a game of chance because he is too energetic. In the long run, it probably could have happened. Despite some difficult moments, this aspect did not bother me. For me, the sweet end with which they decided not to feel good did not feel good. <br /> <br /> The interesting and mysterious premise was mysterious and disproportionate and contained disturbing objects. The context and the sensations were multiple, there was something new in the way all this was played and nervous jolts and unbearable tension mingled with a series of twists and sudden twists. Really, they made excellent use of the new idea of ​​this disability and to handicap the situation, staging it in a foreign place where few people speak English and we are thus trapped in confusion. The delicate Marina Zudina gives a heartbreaking portrait of the dumb american girl Billy. The way she was able to express the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave her some roughness and credibility. Director Anthony Waller turns the film in a rather elegant, timely and clever way, without losing that sullen look that stands out from its rigid environment and an extremely aerial musical score that disgusts you. The only real name to appear was a small cameo from Alec Guinness. The performances of the actors were good, especially the murderers of Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as Russian murderers. <br /> <br /> This fascinating feature, composed mostly of strangers, is far better than your dark, dark-thriller thriller. Highly recommended.
