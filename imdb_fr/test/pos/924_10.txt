I believe that I share the same psychological vision of the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, but we share a synthetic mind: the world is not empty of metaphysics in the midst of total coincidence. Barely ruled by a man or perhaps a prime minister-poet, Poland could play the role it played during the Second World War as a social and cultural "low pressure zone". She is both critical and Christian towards the Jews, but often no less critical of herself. . In Kieslowski's worldview, there is innocence and guilt, as symbols of Catholicism: the white Virgin versus the black. In Red, the Black Madonna is the one whose judge fell in love when he was young. The flashbacks are intimately related to the present, even if it's a coincidence: the camera simply switches to the other side of the street or the red jeep of the young judge who passed in front of the car of the young woman after having accidentally hit with his dog. What we understood later is that we jumped in time with these same camera movements. His love was unanswered, so his life was not as he had planned. He lost his ability to love others and animals. As a judge, he has the feeling of spying on the lives of others and when he retires, he just keeps on doing it, spying on his neighbors this time. The innocence and sense of justice of the young woman (literally) who accidentally interferes in her life reinstall her best judgment and it is thanks to her that he spontaneously confesses his espionage behavior to his neighbors and to his the police, accepting and even keeping up to date. stones thrown accordingly by its windows. During the process, the story is repeated between this man and the woman he likes that this time he is old and the woman is not the same. Kieslowski may have struggled with this gesture because the former judge was his alter ego, and it is said that he was infatuated by Irene Jacob. The two women play the same essential role in his psychology, that (!) Who has his heart and his soul and can therefore do it or break it, even as an old man! It's as if the "powers in the air" or God brought them together. Coincidences are too coincidental to be mere chance or even chance. There must be a mystical, supernatural, or theological source that influences life decisions of unfathomable depth. The study book that has fallen and opened on the exam question page is another example. Or when the old judge said all his heart to the young woman, the wind outside the opera suddenly slammed the doors open and broke the windows. The gigantic photo of the young woman predicted that on television, after the drowning accident occurred during the crossing of the canal. These moments are actually accentuated by the human voice of the liturgy or by what resembles it (Van den Budenmayer).
