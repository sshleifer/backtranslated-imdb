Teachers in junior and senior high schools will find "The Cure" as an excellent teaching tool, both as a companion to "Huckleberry Finn" or as a stand-alone course. Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme, the powerful message of friendship and love, as they evolve between Eric and Dexter, is a powerful message for teenagers. The written prompts centered on the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also suggest a classroom discussion on how Eric evolves from a manipulative user to a loving friend.
