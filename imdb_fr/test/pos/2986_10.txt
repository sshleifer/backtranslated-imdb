A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all kinds of feelings that I had when I was a lot, a lot younger. I loved it, and the music of Elton John. I remember seeing in movies when I was a kid and for some reason (limited release?) I never met anyone else who would have seen this movie when it was released. <br /> <br /> The dreams he has inspired in me for decades have never left me, and seeing the film has recently made it back in time, but I admit that my children (in their twenties) did not experience the same emotion. A generational thing? <br /> <br /> Why is it not on DVD?
