I never read a novel by Jacqueline Susann, but I also saw Valley of the Dolls, inspired by another of her books. On both occasions, I thought the movie was probably better than the book and would continue to improve with age (certainly unlike books). The reason is that a film focuses more on a specific style of fashion, design and behavior. And in this aspect, The Love Machine offers a lot of things. The scenography perfectly matches the story. And all the characters come in too. They are perfect for completing a well balanced overall picture. They are superficial and do not develop, it's true, but in this film, I would not want it to be otherwise. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings takes over the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a scam. Fashion photographer, he looks visibly old and seems to be taking risks. Robert Ryan takes over the role he played in Caught of Max Oph√ºl. He is again Smith Ohlrig, greedy, bored and boring, without inspiration or inspiration. It is possible that Ryan does not want to be part of this image and act accordingly. On the other hand, he might have thought a lot about it and given a carefully thought out performance. Anyway, it corresponds to the picture. Dyan Cannon is awesome (fantastic wardrobe!), She dominates every scene in which she is and participates in the two highlights of the film: the engraving of a luxury bed and the reversal of the character of Hemmings with an Oscar statuette . <Br /> <br /> The title, The Love Machine, means, of course, ironically. Robin Stone is a kind of Barry Lyndon of the pop era (the film is also slightly kubrickysh). The fact that he chose a television channel to climb to the top seems to be a mere coincidence. He sees love (meaning sexual favors) as a means of personal promotion. There are rather frightening allusions to a troubled sexuality that are not explored in the film. Homosexuality is treated with a lot of casualness, probably not the norm for the major movies of the time. The open cynicism of television executives does not have to be compared to other good films on the subject, such as A Face in the Crowd, Network or Truman Show. They produce shit, they get along with each other and know they're going to make a lot of dough with it. <br /> <br /> I did not regret having spent the 108 minutes with this film and I would not be surprised if it aroused the interest of a cult, provided it has the chance ( that is to say an output on DVD).
