This excellent musical film, in beautiful Technicolor, is so wonderful that it is enough for every person of Irish descent to feel proud. Filled with joy and celebration of all that is Irish, a beautiful cast, with brilliant sets and beautiful theatrical ornaments, charming Irish music and the superb tenor Irish voice of star Dennis Morgan, it's lucky that Irish have such a wonderful movie to enjoy again and again! Notice, not only for St. Patrick's Day, but for the whole year. <br /> <br /> One of the jewels that Jack L. Warner produced at his peak as a studio headmaster in Burbank in the 1940s. <Br /> <br /> Shame on Warner Brothers not have this beautiful image available in personal video and on DVD!
