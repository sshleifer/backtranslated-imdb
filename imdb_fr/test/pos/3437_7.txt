"Jaded" should not be considered as an erotic thriller, because sex scenes are not designed for the pleasure of watching, unlike movies like "Indecent Behavior" or "Friend Of The Family". <br /> <br /> "Jaded" is not an easy way to live because its history is difficult to conceive and not so common in society. From the beginning of the film, with the first scene, you expect stronger scenes. <br /> <br /> The rape scene was not (in my opinion) a well-created scene. I think the director did not use the proper camera techniques throughout the film. That's why it sometimes looks dull and becomes boring almost towards the end. <br /> <br /> The performances are extremely good from the five female characters. These women have given strong, intense but credible performances that demonstrate the dramatic abilities of actresses. <br /> <br /> The legal concepts have helped a lot in understanding the difficulty of the plot, because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple rape. From the point of view of Meg's defense, sodomy must be penalized as rape (huge crime level B) although it is a different crime. The defense of Pat and Alex claims that Meg appreciated and asked for it. This is where the film becomes interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only thing that is certain is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of crime. <br /> <br /> Look "Jaded" if you like legal issues that are not very common in your society. Otherwise, try because it's a very good and strong drama.
