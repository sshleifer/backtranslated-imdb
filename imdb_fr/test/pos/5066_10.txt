It was an excellent film with a good acting and he keeps your attention until the end. Maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject, and that's why they laugh so much. This could also be too deep for many viewers who are giving movies like the American Pie series higher. an Egyptian man by Moroccans, not Egyptians. He is not supposed to be a hardened agent and therefore proves naive interrogation techniques used. It's more credible than if it was perceived as an "old hat". <br /> <br /> The story jumps a bit and can be confusing, but it also forces you to stay focused on what's going on until the end, when everything comes together when the puzzle is implements. Supporting actors helped to bring the film. I found the film powerful and stimulating.
