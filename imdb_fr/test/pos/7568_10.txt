Zeke Rippy (Mic) is awesome, we totally believe in it. And it's scary, I spent half the film covering my eyes, the other half at the edge of my seat. It's cool to see something so scary and effervescent that it's not blood and guts - but it made me have bad dreams. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a fantastic movie.
