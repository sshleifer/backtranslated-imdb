Beautiful, emotional and subtle. I watch this film in an art center with a smaller screen in a movie theater with 95% of seniors. I would like the biggest cinema like Lowes to show it here. Great cinematography of Wong and Christopher Doyle. Since I understand Cantonese, it is much easier to understand the movie. As simple as the story is, many English-speaking viewers have not understood everything. Three old ladies next to me do not stop barking and have no idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler; They were surprised when I told them that Mr. Chow had slept with Ms. Chen and that they had a son. She went to Singapore to try to tell him but did not do it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> The translation into Mandarin of the title of the film actually means a moment of flowers or a memory. The phrase usually used to describe beautiful and wonderful memory that was inpermanance and short. The whole movie is about the title. Not to mention the flowery "Cheung Sam". <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was definitely the corner of the street in the alley. It looks so beautiful, the sun shines on the old faded wall, the night in the dark, in the rain, really a poetic moment. I felt a strong sense of intimacy in their relationship seeing them stand against the wall and speak softly. It was very heartbreaking when Mr. Chow repeated his departure, and Ms. Chen cried on her shoulder ... Bravo Wong Kar-Wai! <br /> <br /> As much as I love the latter, Chungking Express remains my favorite top. However, I will also give a 10 to this one. CTHD has only received 7. <br /> <br /> If you like art, you'll love this movie. Do not miss it.
