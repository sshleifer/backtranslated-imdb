WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> This film was on the shelf of a movie store and, since I saw a handful of very old-fashioned horror movies, I had very little expectation for this one . Well, I put it on and almost immediately, I was sucked. As I watched, I immersed myself deeper and deeper in the story and very quickly, I watched with full interest. This film is amazingly spectacular and I loved every second. The story is about a boat trip on a river in Australia. It seems safe enough until their boat is ambushed by a fang that is ready to eat. When I looked at the back of the case, I thought this movie was going to have zero visual effects, like in Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I saw the crocodile for the first time He was incredibly real! Do not laugh when I say that because I'm serious, but it's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. He really created a breathtaking tension and suspense with this intense situation, I mean, think about it; Your stuck in a tree, nowhere to go, nowhere to hide with a predator hungry at the bottom of the water. You can not tell me that it does not scare you a bit. He even managed to give me a few shivers in my arms, like when Adam was caught in the trap and Grace and Lee were left baffled. It is a very attractive film. There may have been one or two parts where I found myself slightly indifferent, but other than that, I would say it's my favorite animal attack movie I've seen.
