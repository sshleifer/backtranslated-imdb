Yes 1939 / The version of Robert Donat-Greer Garson was the best ... Perfection..Donat won the Oscar in a very difficult year..Pable in GWTW & James Stewart in the role of Mr. Smith. were 2 of his competitors. .wow was a difficult year. Most critics in New York hated this version. so.didnt see in the theater! Finally seeing this AM on the TCM and appreciated..Peter O'Toole was excellent and happy to have been nominated for the Oscars for this award, and particularly delighted that Oscar finally awarded him a special prize last year ... Petula Clark was as good as Mrs. Chips, but her character, I think it was badly written ... Some good songs in particular. You & I ... sung by Ms.Clark and later recorded by many others, including T.Bennett / S. Bassey & Carmen MacRae .... the B & W version was more authentic .. but that's is a good movie beautifully photographed in color & panavision ... nice to see & Bravo, again, Mr. O'Toole!
