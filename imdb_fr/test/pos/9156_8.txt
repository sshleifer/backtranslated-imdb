This show was really good in many ways, although it is certainly an atypical Western with the hero (?) Circulating on a motorcycle rather than horse, because of the setting of 1914, very "late" for a western, which tends to be between 1866 and 1890. I remember a controversy about its cancellation at the time but did not watch it during its time on NBC. When I had the chance to see and love him, it was a decade later, when I was in the army stationed in Germany, and this was broadcast every week from the beginning on television armed forces. At that time, Margot Kidder was known as Lois Lane, but I still consider her as Nichols's girlfriend. In many ways Nichols looked a lot like Maverick; both were much more attracted to becoming rich with little effort than fighting. It's in the small TV magazine that they distributed to the PX (it's not really an authorized edition of "TV Guide" but that resembles it as much as possible without being bothered by copyright ), which first taught me the true story of the cancellation. I really wonder how would have been the next season with the most violent twins if they had really succeeded as planned. Of course, at the time of making this show, the "Western era" of television had been declining for about a decade; I hope one day to be able to write that "the era of reality" has been in decline for so long! While "Gunsmoke" and "Bonanza" kept running, they were coming to an end and it had been years since a new Westerner had really developed; I think this trend has done a lot to retain "Nichols", and was the main reason why NBC executives doubted to find a wide audience. For me, a good western, unlike a show of the contemporary era, is a bit timeless, as are other "vintage" shows; fashion and other changes do nothing to make them look more "old-fashioned" than they were supposed to be, and I think that watching this show, ten years after its production, is really what made me understand this point . In addition, this show is an early association of Garner and Stuart Margolin, who is truly one of the greatest acolytes of all time, not just in westerns.
