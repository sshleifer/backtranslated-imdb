Despite many films dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed to the real dilemma in which an artist is captured ... <br /> <br /> the decision to reduce popularity or create something new and to define his own style. <br /> <br /> Chiahweson's desperate search for inspiration and broadening his consciousness led him to live as he did, restless, scandalous and, well, drunk! <br /> <br /> But he has nevertheless defended and maintained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect for his master, respect for nature and progressive search for improvement and perfection.
