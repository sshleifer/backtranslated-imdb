I stumbled upon it. I was at my friends' house and he was just starting to watch it. So I sat down thinking that we would pull the breeze as it unfolded in the background. However, in a few seconds I was immersed in this dramatic documentary and we both spent the rest of the time concentrating entirely on that and not telling us a word. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of the first solo sailboat race around the world, let alone the tragic events of a man's attempt against all odds to be a redemption for all his woes of life, but ends up becoming an example. Having no knowledge of the story, I watched it with the same fervor that I imagine those who read about the race at that time, immersed in what was happening and eager to get more information, hoping that the only lover I'll manage with luck and beat the pros, making the shocking twists of history all the more tragic as I felt like living the story . <br /> <br /> The story is told with great care. and the interviewees clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy, which gives great information, but also contrasts with the archive footage of the interviews made at the time of the tragedy, the recordings and photographs of the solitary sailors are also very well used, and the insight into the minds of the sailors and how lonely was affecting them was superb. <br /> <br /> I'm shocked that this story is not more known or has been turned into a film, but also grateful. . Recognizing that we have this dramatic documentary that tells the story of those who knew the man, instead of a senseless adaptation to the film, and recognizing that I captured this jewel of a film by chance. <br /> <br /> It's a must, whether you like the documentary or not.
