I just saw this movie in Austin, at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and it was my favorite. The gymnast is a film not to be missed. It is an honest story of "reconciliation" about relationships, self-discovery, aging and the courage to change and move forward. Not only is it a good story, but the glorious aerial representations of Dreya Weber and Addie Yungmee will take your breath away! See this movie! It will soon be at a festival near you. This film deserved to be taken immediately by a large network or a studio. I will definitely buy it when it becomes available on DVD.
