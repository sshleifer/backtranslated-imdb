In 1982, two extraterrestrial films came out a few weeks apart. Steven Spielberg's ET, and The Thing by John Carpenter. Among them, AND was the one who won the hearts of people all over the world, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so fascinated by Spielberg's hot and fuzzy extraterrestrial fable, they stayed away from The Thing. <br /> <br /> It's not difficult to understand why. Both are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic story designed to warm the hulls of the still-beating heart. The other is a hard and uncompromising film that describes extraterrestrial life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess the audience felt that ET was a much more cute prospect than The Thing's tentacles and her slimy saliva! <br /> <br /> It took a long time, but The Thing continued to win a substantial cult audience. Like it should be. Because The Thing is this rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the classic of 1951 and reinvents them in a surprising and imaginative way. Indeed, Carpenter does his job so well that he manages to make a film that is in all respects the equal of the showrunner of the genre, Alien. And it's even rarer! <br /> <br /> Carpenter's film follows his sources more faithfully than The Thing From Another World. It keeps the icy rubble of Antarctica as it is the perfect backdrop when trying to create a high sense of isolation. But although the characterization is a little thin, the remake fits perfectly into the mentality of the actors and amplifies the uncertainty and the fear that surrounds them slowly. <br /> <br /> Carpenter Carpenter's collaborator, Kurt Russell, returns after the success of Escape From New York, reinterpreted as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot of an Antarctic research station (what they are looking for is what everyone is looking for). The trouble begins when a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to shoot a Siberian Husky from the air. <br /> <br /> They end up dying for their problems and try to solve the problem. mystery of what happened, they take the Husky and add it to theirs. Except this Husky is not a Husky at all. But a stranger who changes his form. The Norwegians found it frozen in the ice and when they thawed it, they slaughtered their crew. Able to absorb his victims at will, he can duplicate a living being down to the smallest detail. Soon, paranoia and suspicion cross the team of 12 people, until no one knows who is human or who is not. <br /> <br /> The Thing is one of John Carpenter's best films. In fact, I'm tempted to say it's the best movie he's ever done. Even surpassing the classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason I put The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it looks like his last movie that could truly be called classic. All the others later felt like Carpenter was slapping him. Films that did not flow with the cold sophistication and dissonant intensity that prevailed in his previous works. <br /> <br /> But The Thing had John Carpenter at the top of his power. He has never generated so much suspense to this point unbearable. Not even in the fierce Assault on Precinct 13. From the second where the alien is known, Carpenter rises the tension level relentlessly. And when he gives his punches, they come with an excruciating jerk. <br /> <br /> The film is a mix of pure atmospheres and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem contradictory, but that fits perfectly in the hands of Carpenter. Inviting Rob Bottin to the glory of Screaming, he supports some of the most amazing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror movie. Amorphous forms. Half-formed human features strongly contrast with gaping jaws, spider legs, and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed, the effects of the film are so amazing and messy that The Thing has been criticized for being too realistic! <br /> <br /> This type of thinking completely misses the point. This only minimizes the values ​​of the film. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects adjustment room when it is needed. It's in the quietest moments of the movie where he seems particularly attentive to history. The Thing is an often confusing tale of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterization has never been one of John Carpenter's strengths, but it does work to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know the cast, it only complicates the current situation. We are never certain, from one moment to another, who is who. And for this reason, The Thing resists very well and keeps its mystery during the following views. <br /> <br /> A special mention must be attributed to Ennio Morricone's excellent film music. A thump every two seconds. This creates a strange and sinister feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole movie is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they submit to a blood test to see who the man is is rolled with such dexterity by Carpenter, you can end up biting your nails without even realizing it. <br /> <br /> The Thing is a pure classic. Even the end leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is solved. An underrated film, well worth the reassessment it received. And so much better than ET!
