Surface is one of the best shows I have ever seen. NBC is so stupid to cancel a big show like this and, worse yet, leave it half finished. NBC or someone else should give Surface at least one more season, just so it can be completed. It's like NBC is giving you a book to read, and half way through it, he decided to take it away from you and you can never find the end. I just want to see what happens to everyone and especially see what happens to Nim. I think I can say this safely about most Surface fans, that we want to save Nim! Nim took us all hearts and then NBC cut them in half. Go NBC, give Surface one more season!
