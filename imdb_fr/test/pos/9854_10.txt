This documentary is not only one of the best documentaries I have seen, but also one of the most moving and tranquil films I've ever seen. He follows the lives of two young Sudanese men, Peter and Santino, trying to integrate into American culture. Peter and Santino are first friends, but they separate more and more, Peter going to Kansas City and Santino staying in Houston ("a country called Houston"). The beauty of Santino is in his eyes. He takes people on his back, he takes charge of an apartment filled with other Sudanese, paying the rent, doing everything for others. He is a silent victim. Peter does his own thing and studies high school while playing basketball and making Christian friends. It seems that director Megan Mylan did not know what she was getting into with the beauty of this tale. Peter and Santino are incredible characters that touch you. But the true strength of this film lies in its comments on American society. It's not judging. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be for outsiders. I suggest you find this movie and watch America through the lives of these two fascinating and fascinating people. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
