If you want to see what could be classified as the "scenic" version of GYPSY, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy being recorded on the MERMAN record of GYPSY, then you really like to watch. MIDLER as Gypsy's mother, ROSE. In my opinion, Midler has the volume, the vibrato and the gifts that Merman had before. <br /> <br /> It's not often these days, listening to the latest updates of musicals, that I have that tingling sensation that makes wet hair. My neck pique, but Bette Midler certainly shows his talents in this film. See how you like them, apples. <br /> <br /> I know you may not like that, but for me, Ms. Midler is the most definitive. "Gypsy".
