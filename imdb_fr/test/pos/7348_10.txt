OMG, it's really the best show in the world. It vibrates louder than Jackass and CKY and is so funny and entertaining. I like the show. The 5 seasons are great but for a quick summary: Season 1: - Perfect if you want to plan a treasure hunt, watch the house get undone and enjoy watching Phil bing hungry. <br /> Season 2: - Great if you want to see them buy Castle Bam, attend a killer concert, see the wonder that is Mardi Gras and the pleasure of going there, attend a demo derby and attend the creation and opening of a Tree Top casino. <br /> <br /> Season 3: - Perfect if you want to see probably the first Driveway Skatepark, a civil war, Johnny Knoxville, a pirate ship and Don Vito winning one of Bam's reindeer games. <br /> <br /> Season 4: - Great if you want to see them in Europe, they have jobs, build a state and a bayou and The Dudesons Season 5: - Great if you want to see them in Brazil , Ape's birthday, Mike Vallely, The Metal Mulisha, Bams Lambo disappearing, Bams Hummer being destroyed, a play-boy night in the bams pool and the very last Viva La Bam :(
