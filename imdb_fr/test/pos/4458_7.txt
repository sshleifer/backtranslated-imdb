If you like who-dun-its, you'll love this movie, considered by Fulci as the best Italian crime novel (giallo). <br /> <br /> This is not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb everyone. <br /> <br /> Many people would be offended by a local beauty who would try to seduce a 12 year old boy. She was joking, but she was still naked and he would have jumped at the chance to jump on him. She also tries to tempt the local priest. <br /> <br /> Young boys are missing and there are several interesting suspects. You have to look carefully to find the killer. Can you? Do not jump on the first guy, it's too early and it's too obvious. <br /> <br /> Anyone familiar with Fulci will be able to guess the murderer, who died at the end of a violent death. What crazy reasoning he had.
