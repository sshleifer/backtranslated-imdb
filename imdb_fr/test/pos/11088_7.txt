"The Falcon and the Snowman" tells the story of two young men, a CIA employee and a drug trafficker, disillusioned with US foreign policy and selling state secrets to the Soviet Union . The events of the film are based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the lead roles and develop interesting characterizations. The support troop also performs well, especially with a performance by David Suchet of Hercule Poirot's fame as a seasoned Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> The movie is usually effective at laying down, developing, and two boys caught in something they did not understand well. However, it seems too long and cumbersome at the central points. The end, however, is tense, amazing and effective. There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack, but unfortunately also a soft and repetitive synthesizer track that does not match a spying story. There are other more interesting spy movies than "The Falcon and the Snowman", but it's still a decent movie.
