What a pleasure. It's really a travesty. Only the French can do these things without being rude. And therefore, you have a great time watching Jean Dujardin play the con. Most of the film rests on his shoulders and he has them wide enough to make a good movie. He has the perfect way to exaggerate the kind of guy James Bond, which is not the same for Mike Meyers at Austin Powers for example. The dialogs are also good enough to catch the viewer's attention, with a lot of stupid jokes, it's really perfect. The two women in the main roles in the film are the comparison with the main character, and it was a challenge. There is no real plot in this movie, but it's not what you expect in this kind of movie. You just want to laugh an hour and 40 minutes, and that's exactly what the movie does. He deserves the success he has in France
