Delicious! He never claims to be a masterpiece, but it is a mini-jewel of British comedy of the late seventies. Since the producers wanted to sell it abroad, the film is played by an American (the character actor Richard Jordan), but at least he is not a Hollywood hunk. He is surrounded by the cream of British talent, led by David Niven, a magnificent prodigy and superior. <br /> <br /> Ivan the Terrible from Niven naturally gets the best liners and all the best responsive shots. It also manages to be surprisingly threatening and intimidating. The moment in the snooker club where he drops his charming facade and threatens Richard Jordan will shock viewers who think Niven is just a star of comedy in a light show. It is full of authentic power and cruelty so we can see at the same time how Ivan gained his nickname. All the more surprising because Niven was ill at the time. Shortly after shooting this production, he loses his power of speech in the face of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This is the last picture that Niven made on which we can hear his own voice, that the impressionist comedian Sid CÃ©sar will double thereafter. <br /> <br /> At his side, you can see many familiar faces of the cinema and television of the seventies. Elke Sommer (showing her boobs in politically incorrect bimbo mode at the time of the 70s), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye, etc., etc. Davy Kaye had one of the biggest bursts of laughter by holding a security guard on the phone call. "Who's ringing ?! ... That damn Dial-A-Disc! You're an idiot!" <br /> <br /> Great shots of London streets; making the movie a time capsule of red telephone booths with vintage patina with big handsets round dial, black taxis driven by "blimey Cor, gov!" cockneys, as well as ladies and gentlemen modeling all kinds of retro clothing and retro hairstyles of the late seventies deeply dubious. <br /> <br /> Unlike classic Ealing comedies of a previous era, the "hero" is allowed to escape his crime and escape into a life in the sun. As times had changed! The code of morality according to which scammers in movies always had to be punished disappeared long ago in the seventies, with anti-heroes like Pinky Green gaining status thanks to their brazen anti-authoritarianism and their determination to " to turn the heels "Establishment of well-suited big cat businessmen. We are encouraged to cheer as Pinky leaves, unpunished and free as a bird with her ill-gotten gains. Compare that at the end of The Lavender Hill Mob! <br /> <br /> Extremely entertaining, strangely dated in its modes and attitudes, as well as in night worship viewing activities. Perfect to watch at midnight after pub closing; If you are a certain age, you feel a bit nostalgic and have always wanted to see David Niven in a branch of McDonalds, silently intimidating an American via the use of a retractable telescope!
