THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! The decline of western civilization ...... what a brilliant title huh? And coarse a great movie. It's the best concert film I've ever seen. The movie Talking Heads "Stop Making Sense" is a second place. I first heard about this film when I released Waynes World in 1992. I watched the name of director Penelope Spheeris and found the name cool, what else did he realized? I thought the name was pronounced like an envelope. After watching the movie guides, I came across the critically acclaimed movie Decline, and I realized that Penelope was a woman ... my mother corrected me. I spent 8 years of my life trying to understand it. I finally saw him on VHS in Vancouver, where I currently live. It was worth the wait. This captures LA's punk movement very well. This is the anxiety of adolescence among his best. My favorite is the band The Germs which needs subtitles for lyrics because Darby Crash sings so loud that you can not understand it. I laughed when I saw that. The Black Flag group lives in an abandoned church and the X group is a very intelligent group. We also laughed at the letter written by an idiot in Slash Magazine about the fact that we did not need to save the whales. There are countless miles of ocean where we can pour toxins! I became a big fan of Penelope Spheeris after that and I saw all his punk-Dudes movies was OK, and Suburbia is a cult classic! I own both on VHS. It's a real underground filmmaker and I love his stuff. I would have liked to see this movie in 1994, when grunge was so popular. I was a big fan of Nirvana at the time, but alas, I saw that in 2002, and by that time I had become grunge and now I'm listening to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim. A real change of pace, I know, but what can you do? But if you want a faithful portrayal of the punk movement, that captures it better than anything. Much better than 1991: The Year Punk Broke. It's a difficult film to trace, but if you have a hand, praise it, even if you do not like music, it's a great job. Nowadays, it may be easier to find popular DVDs. By the way, Penelope has produced a little-known Albert Brooks film called "Real Life", which I also own. Funny tricks in today's reality TV! Decline in rent ...... Highly recommended! Thank you!
