Happy 25th birthday to Valley Girl! Great soundtrack, plausible story, fantastic performance ... captures the spirit of the 80s; the slang of the currents and the excluded. A wonderful interpretation of life in high school and the "downtown" of the suburbs. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack contains songs from Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola $, Josie Cotton Psychedelic Furs, Men at Work, The Flirts and Bananarama. <br /> <br /> This film is really Romeo and Juliet (without the double suicide), shot in the 1980s in Los Angeles. Julie's father, played by Frédéric Forrest (Sonny Bono, do you mind?) Is hysterical as a hippie idealist dad who wonders how he was born in such a materialistic offspring. Yet he does not judge, do you like ??
