"It all depends on your way of seeing things, we are halfway to paradise or hell," says the priest, Pastor Harlan, in "Northfork". The film of the Polish brothers is ambitious and will suit any intelligent viewer, provided he has patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment offered by the film take the viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is evident in a less obvious sociopolitical and theological commentary that should prompt a casual American to reflect on current social values. The adoption of the surrealist film (coffins that emerge from the depths of artificial lakes to float and disturb the living, homesteaders who "crucify" their feet on the wooden floor of their homes, angels who need several glasses to read , etc.) and absurd images (of half-animals, half-toys still alive, doorbells that make the musical interpretations of a harp, a blind angel who continues to write illegible leaflets more delicate, etc.) could make the viewer unfamiliar with the absurdistic traditions in literature and the arts of wondering what the film does not say as entertainment. Although European cinema has better references in this field, Hollywood has already made such films in "Cat Ballou", Lee Marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap several decades ago. "Northfork", in a scene of citizens leaving the city by car, seemed to pay tribute to the row of cars of "Citizen Kane" Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic. <br /> <br /> The film is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient - the most interesting epilogue (one of the most beautiful that I can remember) can be heard as a voiceover towards the end of the credits. The directors seem to leave the best moments to those who can stay with the film until the end. If you have the patience, you can savor the layers of the film - if you swallow or swallow what the polish disturb, you will miss its many flavors. <br /> <br /> What is the film about? ? At the most obvious level, a city is being liberated to make way for a dam and a hydroelectric project. Even the cemeteries are dug up so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial places. The real estate developers peddle the properties on the lake to 6 people able to expel the inhabitants. Of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and is therefore able to order chicken broth soup, while others can not use anything. <br /> <br /> At the next layer, you have Christianity and its interactions. townspeople. Most of them are fervent Christians, but there are many who hide the survival instinct at the expense of true Christian principles, exemplified by the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions. <br /> <br /> At the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with almost angelic humans and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who is holding a cartoon on Hercules and dreaming of a mother finds one in an androgynous angel called "Flower Hercules". Although the filmmaker gives clues that Flower is an extension of the young angel's delusional imagination, Flower's subsequent actions belie this option. You are well in the world of angels - not gods but pure spirits - and therefore not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is visible on these shots. <br /> <br /> At another layer, Irwin's miniature airplane becomes a real plane that will transport him and his angels to paradise 1,000 miles from Norfolk. <br /> <br /> The last layer is the social comment ?? "The country is divided into two types of people: Ford people and Chevy people." Is there a difference? They think they are different but both are consumerists. <br /> <br /> To the religious, the film says "Pray and you will receive" (words of Father Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). For the consumerist, the film says "it's what we do with our wings that separate us" (each of the 6 expellers also have wings, a feather duck / goose in their headbands, but their actions are different, often far from being angelic, as suggested by the different reactions of a scratch on a car). <br /> <br /> The film is certainly not the best American film, but it is a remarkable work that opens the way - superb images, remarkable performances (especially Nick Nolte), and a loaded script offering multiple levels of entertainment for a mature audience.
