To be completely honest, I am completely intrigued by the original concept of "Sleeper Cell". After watching the best part of the series on FX Channel (UK), my Sky broke, which means I missed the crucial final. But what I saw, I assumed it was a good story, I played well and I did not look at '24', I thought it was great, AND it was confirmed for a second season ... <br /> <br /> One of the best TV shows I've seen. Much more realistic and believable than "24". Excellent character development and line of land. Do not strike Islam, but give a thoughtful and thoughtful approach, showing the difference between a radical terrorist Islam and a true Islam. Everyone should see this show! <br /> <br /> Stringy xx
