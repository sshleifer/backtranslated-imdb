Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion, this is by far the best movie of the series and my favorite movie. This film is not taken seriously because the directors knew that all the necessary social commentary was presented in the first film. Golan and Globus made this movie for Bronson fans, not for critics, and it works. DW3 has been unfairly criticized as "trash" and "a tired entry into an exhausted series". These statements would be true if the film was meant to be taken seriously or to broadcast a statement, but it was not. If you take it as it is, DW3 is just a fun, action-packed action, with Charlie doing street punks what we all want to be able to do. The action is nonstop, the atmosphere is awesome and the movie is just the best Bronson movie ever made. You can say that the Cannon group spent a lot of money on that. It is thought that Bronson found the film too violent and that is why Winner did not direct any of the following entries. I can understand his concern, but as always in the case of suites, you have to push the envelope even further to achieve a previous entry. In any case, this film was not more violent than any other film made during this period. What makes DW3 the best of the series and my favorite movie (not the best, but my favorite) is the action, the presence of Charlie, the memorable villains and his ability to get viewers to follow the movement. The first film is perhaps the most technically well done, but this one is the most fun. For once, Charlie actually has smart lines (although he does not say much) and a story, a photograph, an action and a direction halfway very interesting for the second. Charlie has never been as intense or as cool as in this one. Yes, it's exploitation, maybe it promotes stereotypes, and it may be the same story as before, but Bronson's films have always defended and will always defend the common man and give his audience what he wants. Many claim that the DW series manipulates its audience, my answer is that the movies do not manipulate us, it is the fans who are responsible for it. We ask Bronson to get rid of the deserving scum and, in turn, Winner and Co. delivers the goods. And for those of you who still want to push it back, remember a few things. DW3 was the # 1 movie in the US when it came out and was among the favorites of millions of viewers vis-Ã -vis video and television, because they realize that not all movies need to be epic, they just have to be fun. ********** / 10 You can not do better.
