This is the old story: children party in an old house, demons are unleashed, death and free nudity ensues. As you all know, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Many people (many horror fans, to be precise) have good memories of this film and it is always with a slight apprehension that you revisit an old film to see if it is still as good as you thought. Fortunately, it is. <br /> <br /> He has something for everyone (well, everyone who happens to be men, I guess). From a fun title sequence to a shoplifting scam involving Linnea Quigley's cunning ass use to the "mirror" scene all the way to the end for demonic pleasure, it's a blast from end to end. end. <br /> <br /> Girls are cute, guys are. . . . Man, the scenes of death are well done with some good effects of gore and, unlike some horrors of the time, it actually keeps a good sense of the atmosphere and a constant tension. Do not get me wrong, it's always fun in the first place, but it offers nice and weird moments that should appeal to most genre fans.
