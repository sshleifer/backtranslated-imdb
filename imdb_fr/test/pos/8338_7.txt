Charles "Chic" Sales is absolutely great as the only member of the Leeds family willing to testify against a gangster who has seen a police officer and an informant murdered. He fought at Bull Run during the Civil War and his patriotism is high, even after his son-in-law was beaten and one of his grandchildren kidnapped by the gang, intimidating all the other members. The fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says. In any case, he would not want his grandson to live in a country ruled by gangsters. The conflict between civic duty and personal security is deeply rooted in this Oscar-nominated story. Walter Huston is also notable as a driving prosecutor threatening the family of perjury if he does not confirm the killer's identity in court. The rest of the cast, including the sleazy murderer, Ralph Ince, is excellent, and the film is quickly directed by William A. Wellman. There is also a good suspense, as sales disappear as the trial is about to begin.
