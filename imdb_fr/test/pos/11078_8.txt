This anime tells the story of the battle for King Mamodo. Every 1,000 years, 100 Mamado children are sent to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original Japanese, the creatures are Mamono, literally meaning a magical / evil object). Each mamado is associated with a human partner and receives a magic spell book. The Human can use this book to unleash incredible powers in the Mamodo, and when a Mamodo is defeated, his spell book is engulfed by the flames (alternatively, a book of Mamdodo can be captured and burned directly). After that, the Mamodo returns to the Mamodo world. <br /> <br /> The main character is Zatch (Gash in Japan), a 6 year old mamodo with electric powers. He is associated with Kiyomaru Takamini and a 14-year-old genius. Zatch was initially reluctant to fight, but he decided to fight to become a "kind king" and decided that the battle for the king was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell has made a comparison with Pokemon, but a better comparison is Digimon's. Like Digimon, Mamodo and Human have a unique symbiotic relationship. Moreover, unlike Pokemon, both series have a real plot. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell describes the growth of characters and the evolution of relationships, as well as adult stories (such as love against racism, slavery, mind control, etc.). It even has twists and decent mysteries.
