In reviewing this film, I think it is one of the greatest Hitchcock films. The first time I saw it, I was blown away by the suspense, the action and the images. He has a striking end, the disturbed murderer, the innocent man surrounded or victim of circumstances, excellent shots, for example. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and the Penn Central in New York. She also has excellent supporting actors with Hitch's daughter, Patricia, as Ruth Roman's younger sister and faithful Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock films. The episode of the ride at the end is one of the most heartbreaking in Hitchcock's work. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker in the role of Bruno Anthony (his last full movie) gives a superb performance as a foreign deranged on the train, which launches into the life of Guy Haines (Farley Granger), star unsuspecting tennis. Granger plays the nice guy who is caught in a messy divorce. The film begins with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men coming out of their cabs to board the train. Finally, they meet and history takes over. The stranger is unusually interested in the star of tennis and becomes a stalker as the film progresses. The action moves from place to place, including Washington, the fictitious little town of Metcalf, the Forest Hills tennis championship and a passenger train carrying the two leading men on separate missions. Towards the end, the rhythm of a tennis game is inseparable from the plot as it runs against time. The camera cuts the faces of athletes as they fly and serve in a series of remarkable shots. When the fierce struggle is over, the hunt at the climax takes place. Hitchcock loves trains and it's good to see the Penn Station long gone. The trains are featured in the 39 steps, the movie Lady Vanishes, The shadow of a doubt, Spellbound, North by Northwest and this movie. <br /> <br /> This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the beginning of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense - the 1950s and I am convinced that one day he will be honored in the temple of the Hitchcock fame.
