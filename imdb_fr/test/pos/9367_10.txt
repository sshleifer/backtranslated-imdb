The real best film of 1947 also deals with anti-Semitism and is superior to GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT by Elia Kazan (the final winner at this year's Academy Awards) in virtually every department. Edmard Dmytryk's almost perfect direction, John Paxton's laconic script and J. Roy Hunt's expert expressionist lighting are wonderfully complemented by a superb overall cast. Although Robert Young (who plays an easy going cop, methodical and very friendly) and Robert Mitchum (who actually has some witty remarks to throw) are the film's nominees, his Oscar nominees Robert Ryan and Gloria Grahame - as well as Paul Kelly, in the modest but defining role of Grahame's pathetic husband - who describes the film's most memorable descriptions; Ryan was so convincing as a homicidal racist that he was finally cataloged for a while, excelling in equally ugly roles in such films as ACT OF VIOLENCE (1948), CAUGHT (1948), THE RACKET ( 1951), CLASH BY NIGHT (1951), THE NAKED SPUR (1953) and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also notable for its atypical structure in that Ryan's "flashback" sequence, a complete fabrication, is shot in a simple way, while the truth emerges from the scrambled and distorted memories of the true protagonist of the film which, moreover , not even played by any of the stars of the movie! In addition, CROSSFIRE originally had to deal with homosexuality (according to Richard Brooks 'original novel, "The Brick Foxhole"), but this taboo subject was unacceptable to Hays' office at the time - far from the situation current (when at least) 3 gays-themed movies are in the running for this year's major Oscars! <br /> <br /> The copy used for the transfer of Warner's DVD shows regrettable signs of wear sometimes, but the audio The comments of experts in black, James Ursini and Alain Silver, are good, even if I do not share their opinion, to know that Dmytryk's career steadily declined after his troubles with HUAC. MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), YOUNG LIONS (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965) amply prove it; That said, his collaborations at RKO with producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945); hopefully, this will be part of Warners' upcoming Black Film Box Set) and CROSSFIRE - his best work. In any case, in my opinion, the latter is not only one of the key films of the 1940s but also one of the best blacks ever made, point to point.
