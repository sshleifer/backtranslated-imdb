What is nice to watch random movies at random times is that you never really know what to expect or where the next big movie will emerge. Recently, my viewing took the form of stapled classics such as "Raging Bull" or "The Adventurers of the Lost Ark", but this time, my VCR took away modern conveniences and dropped me right in front of " The Lionel Jeffries Children's Railway ". It's a cleverly directed film about three young children, a mysterious event with their father, a resettlement in the open fields of England and, finally, the rewards inherited simply by waving in the trains. At first glance, this seemingly simple children's movie does not seem so promising, as it has been lost for some time on the rarity of VHS, but in the first fifteen minutes of this film, one realizes that it does not This is not just about your common place. Children's movie ?? "Railway Children" was created at a time when purity was more than just saying "no", when the family meant everything and where the adventure was ready for you around every turn of the railroad. It's more than an adorable film, it uses amazing cinematic techniques, it keeps the usual viewer glued to the screen with unanswered questions and offers three perfect companions the journey of this 110-minute trip. "Railway children" is a lost treasure that must be seen by families and movie buffs. <br /> <br /> Several moments stand proudly in "The children of the railways" that transform it from mediocrity to excellence ?? one happens to be our three children; Bobby, Phyllis and Peter. Modern cinema assures us that these three children can not provide enough darkness, laughter and understanding of the world around them, but Jeffries' children prove the opposite. Smartly spoken lines (both acting and scenario), sincere kindness and dedication to this small village, until the final meeting at this station; these children are more than mere children who make a story, they lead us with emotion, persuasion and realism that the children of today do not see. There is more imagination in this small VHS than in the cinema for years. A favorite scene that could have been treated with the generality, which I saw in other movies, was Bobby's birthday scene. The way Jeffries floated it between guests and presents was exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes excited from every scene, as well as our mind. Another scene that caught my eye is where kids were working on gifts for Perks. By asking a man for a gift, Jeffries simply said, "No, I will not do it, I do not like the benefits." The reaction of children is hilarious ?? offering moments for kids and adults to enjoy throughout. Filmed in the 1970s, this tiny element provides real laughs that most modern comedies. It is a creative film associated with a remarkable choreography and staging. <br /> <br /> That is to say, even though I liked this film, it was not perfect. Jeffries did a great job in letting us know what happened to the father, but it felt like the event happened, the kids were left in the dark and everything suddenly resolved at the end. More details for the father, not much more, would have solidified his character and would have given us the opportunity to see more of the children's reaction. In addition, there is a scene in this film, one of those grandiose big screen shots of the English countryside that is breathtaking, but when you look a little closer, you see cars in the background. It made me laugh, but did not distract the general image too much. Cinema like this is sorely lacking nowadays, and curiously, it seems that only the British have the courage to produce it. Movies like "Love, Actually" or "Vicar of Dibley" demonstrate the power and excitement of community cities, places where everyone knows each other and we are not afraid to be neighbors. It's more of a theme that the American public could have more ?? more understanding of what's going on outside, instead of staying isolated from your own events. <br /> <br /> All in all, I loved the "children of the railways". I did not know what to expect when I integrated it for the first time into the VHS player, but from the opening scene to the train explosion through Perks, Jeffries proved he could handle easily the most child-friendly story. Her ability to make child actors feel like real characters, to involve less adults and to involve children as adults was remarkable. It's a film that should be considered as a strong alternative to all that Disney releases. The themes of friendship, kindness to strangers and forgiveness that continuously occur parade through television with grace and power. "Railway Children" is more than a children's movie; it is a feature that should be an essential part of viewing the modern audience. Not only does it look great in the English countryside, but it also teaches (and shows) how life would be better by focusing on imagination and courage, instead of fighting against bad guys from CGI. <br /> <br /> Grade: **** Â½ on *****
