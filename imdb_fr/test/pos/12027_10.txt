I laugh my ass for an hour. I had no idea who Dan Finneity was. Why did not I hear about Dan Finnerty? He is hysterical and his singers alternate as well. They make all those women songs that we would never want to hear a new experience. They sweep these songs. It was on Bravo last night. Why is this type of Dan not like "ultra famous"? Superb voice! Charisma to engrave! He blew me away with this show! I just read on the Internet that he was formerly a member of "Stomp". I guess he can not do anything more. I saw "Stomp" in a UCLA theater a few years ago and these guys were amazing. This show last night was directed by Dreamworks! Does that mean that Spielberg did that? Why do not we put Dan Finnerty in a movie? At the end of the show, there was a standing ovation and every time the camera went up to the public, everyone was in, singing or dancing. The whole show had this incredible energy. The only complaint I would make is that it was not longer, but looking back, when we see the amount of energy provided by these guys, I guess it would be impossible for a human being to play with so much taste for over an hour. Man I loved this show!
