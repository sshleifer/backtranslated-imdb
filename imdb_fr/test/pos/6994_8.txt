Pitch Black is a surprisingly good movie. I was not a fan of Vin Diesel before seeing Pitch Black, but after seeing Pitch Black, my respect for Vin Diesel grew. He did a great job playing Riddick, a man wanted for many murders. His character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me, as if close to the end, Riddick would get on the ship and save his own ass, leaving everyone behind him to die. I like this film and how it deals with the human instinct. This film has a small budget, but this film proves that you do not need incredible special effects or a lot of money to make a good movie. I think all the characters made this movie. I give this movie 8 out of 10;)
