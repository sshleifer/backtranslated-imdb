For those who do not know, the books of Asterix are a series of comics about a village of indomitable Gauls who resist the invasion of Caesar with a magic potion that makes them invulnerable. There have been several animated feature films (one, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix, capturing the spirit and spirit of books while it was an original screenplay), before two perfect actors, Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardieu, did not play the major role of adaptations that had a colossal success throughout Europe but made no impression in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> The uncut French version is very funny, but unfortunately does not seem to be available in a version with English subtitles outside the British DVD. While there is still no sign of a theatrical or DVD release in the United States, the Miramax version of Asterix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra is also featured on this DVD (and has already been shown on British television) and you will never know it. edited (at least 21 minutes) and dubbed in English. Maybe Harve took him for a movie in Hong Kong - after all, he never saw a foreign film that he did not think could be improved by heavy re-releases and set for a few years . <br /> <br /> Expected Asterix and Obelix Against Caesar was lovingly nicknamed in English from a very good translation script by Terry Jones, but was not otherwise. This kind of thing is really not the Miramax method. The results are not good. The film was the best attempt to get the mix of slapstick, anachronisms and classic humorous classics on screen, but many of the classic references have disappeared (such as the Raft of the Medusa raft or references to Cyrano de Bergerac de Depardieu), next to everything that seems too French or that could slow down the situation, so that the first 20 minutes are now a real job. Missing several strokes to the sequences, Depardieu's game was reduced (his game was already quite small because of his serious health problems during the shoot: the American version was partially demoted numerically to change the unhealthy pallor of his face in the original!) and as usual with dubbing, because the literal translations in English do not match, the lines are so rushed that they are no longer funny or the dialogue has been completely changed (some of these changes are certainly funny, like a character dreaming of a world in which he could move the lips in French and hear the words in English). <br /> <br /> Not a total disaster, but very disappointing given the quality of the full version. It would be nice to think that Miramax would make a Shaolin Soccer and release both versions, but since they put both movies in the closet for two years, they paid $ 45 million (another classic case of chronic buyer's remorse) Harvey's: that's why Disney was so modest about their excessive spending) and still had no escape plan, it may be too dreamy. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that such an accessible and entertaining film is now available. to be available only for non-French speakers in such a clumsy and torn version. It seems that the brave Gauls were able to defeat Caesar's legions, but are not tall enough to face Miramax's jackamoot.
