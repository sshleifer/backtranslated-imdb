Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody of Mel Brooks. His mission is to parody the legacy of Robin Hood and the couple of films dealing with the mythical thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood. He is looking for some good men who will join him in his quest to overthrow the evil Sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the beautiful hand of Maid Marian. Robin must also deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis). Tracey Ullman is the personal witch of Prince John, Latrine, who has his eyes on the sheriff. <br /> <br /> Will Robin find his merry men? How far will the prince go to silence his weight in the absence of his father? Why does the sheriff hate Robin so much? To find out, you'll have to watch ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS !! Check out Dom De Luise's hilarious cameo playing the Duke of Jersey. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
