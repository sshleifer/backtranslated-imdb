I watched this movie at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas a few days ago. Punk! Everyone and everything involved in the movie was added to his punk. Music, of course. But the film itself captured all the punk genre. Even a grandmother and a school teacher (me) can appreciate artists who can turn their ideas into reality (well, actually, at the cinema level). This film features a handful of young directors and clearly and intelligently shows the "why" of their anguish at not being given the go-ahead for completing the Waldo film. The (relatively) happy daughter gave a good comic relief, a nice respite from the continual (but understandable) rags of the guy who left them in a lurch. I must love Stu, though. And be sure to watch / read the credits - they are the icing on the cake!
