Looking at "Wirey Spindell", I could only laugh at what was happening on the screen. Wirey certainly has a lot of games from boys and women but I do not understand why the actor who played Wirey in H.S. was 10 years old. Then the actor changed his age to love playing Wirey when he was senior in HS ... but whatever, I found it funny.
