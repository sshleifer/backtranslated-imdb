I really enjoyed this film. I found it very amusing for me because I feel it reflects the romance of the turn-of-the-century American-Irish culture. There is no message. There is no violence and no sex declared, just an entertainment worthy of 1947 and Dennis Morgan had the chance to sing very good songs. A very good movie.
