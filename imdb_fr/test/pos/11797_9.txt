At more than one level, I can understand what is happening in this film in a very personal way. And all I can say is that it's true what Dexter's mother tells Eric at the end of the story: he actually healed his son by taking away his feelings of sadness and loneliness . <Br/> This film highlights a philosophy with which I can very well agree. We will all die one day or another. In the end, it's not the time we live, but the pleasure / good times / happiness we have during this time. It's not the quantity, but the quality that counts. <br /> <br /> I guess all the other words used here would not stop you from seeing this movie, if you have not done it already. I would really like to see him released on DVD. Without a doubt, it would be immediately added to my "classics of all time"!
