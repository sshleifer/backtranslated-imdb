Four unfortunate women leave the sad London to spend an APRIL ENCHANTÃ‰ in a castle on the Italian coast. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes to life in this charming little film that perfectly illustrates the virtues of a script and an acting alphabet. All the elements come together to produce a film that, although almost forgotten now, still arouses a sense of appreciation for the appropriate resolution of the story. <br /> <br /> Actresses perform each other brilliantly. Ann Harding is the free-spirited woman who yearns for "wisteria and tranquility," far from hazy London. Katharine Alexander plays the silent housewife who wishes to assume the elegant responsibility of acting as the castle's hostess. Jane Baxter is the beautiful, noble young woman who temporarily escaped her crowd of male admirers. Jessie Ralph steals every scene in which she finds herself as an old lady who only wishes to be alone with her memories of the past. <br /> <br /> The men of history are also well melted. As Miss Harding's husband, Frank Morgan has a rather complex role as a mouse researcher who undergoes a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer. As Miss Alexander's wife, Reginald Owen is wonderfully pompous as a man well equipped to break into England (his hilarious attempt to take an English bath in an Italian bath is made even more fun with the help of Charles Judels and Rafaela Ottiano while the castle is harassed servants). Finally, Ralph Forbes, one of the best forgotten actors of the decade, is happily eccentric as a lightweight owner of the ladies. <br /> <br /> The film's legends will recognize an uncredited Ethel Griffies playing the role of owner of the Hampstead Housewives Club.
