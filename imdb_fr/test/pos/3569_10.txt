Alleluia!!!! ?? Finally, a real Colombian film crosses the border to show how much Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French origin who is tired of seeing the portrayed in such a perverse and ignorant way by Hollywood and others. world (after the United States), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (not to mention Ugly Betty), that it is the capital, Bogota (€ 9 million) is the "world book capital" Or is this beautiful city hosting the world's largest international theater festival? I hope that Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (-Mr. and Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeckis, Diane Thomas (Romancing Stone) will one day visit Bogotá to see how wonderful it is and focus on vitality and the cultural diversity of Bogotá, instead of producing movies such as Maria Full of Grace, which Joshua Marston has greatly benefited from (for this great film) without ever thinking about the ontological damage that his film would contribute to perpetuate on "the image unfairly tarnished "from Colombia. <br /> <br /> -In any case, you will appreciate at least a lot of Bluff! -Oh, and thank you IMDb for your invaluable work / excellent !!!
