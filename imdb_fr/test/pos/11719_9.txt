An intense and obscure action drama with the exceptionally rich support of Casey, Keith, and. al, many of whom get the best roles in their career and run with it. The film has a strange shape - often, the action slows down to let the characters get lost in strange but well-made dialogues improved - during the stagings, almost all of "Machine" was found in humorous monologues perfectly delivered. - and the director of Reynolds deserves a lot for having Reynolds the star, a little behind and leave them room. And unlike most action movies, we really like the characters, which makes the second half of the show run smoothly or badly, with their diverse fates revealing themselves in an unusual way. The combination of character development, brutal violence, a jazzy soundtrack (Tarantino must be a fan - look at this and then "Jackie Brown" and you'll see what I'm talking about) make this movie sometimes defective (The bad guys are a little melodramatic) is one of the best modern cop movies and, in my opinion, superior to most modern overrated blacks such as "Body Heat" and others.
