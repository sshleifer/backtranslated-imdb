I saw this movie today (opened yesterday here) and I was simply thrilled. <br /> <br /> I saw a review say that the reviewer thought it would be just another teen movie, but was later discovered based on Twelfth Night by Shakespeare. .. and then began to try to justify loving this film on Shakespearean ground. I really think it goes too far: the only links I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic vanity of a girl pretending to be a man; (b) the intense humor of men and women that stems from this fundamental vanity; and (c) certain names (including Viola & Duke). <br /> <br /> Apart from these names, the thematic common points (a and b) are really good themes for any scenario, and the scenario of this film is no exception. Beyond that, it is a teen movie just delicious and very contemporary / traditional. And that's a perfectly legitimate genre, even if highbrows has to find an excuse to like it ... like referring to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The film is bright, fast, emotional, stylized, funny ... full of teenage hormones and teenage humor and masculine / feminine humor suitable for all ages. And that's really the best part of IMHO: really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is represented in a completely attractive amusement. These stereotypes are parodied relentlessly but affectionately, with such complexity of invention that I am still a little perplexed ... but I do not really feel disappointed in this respect, it's not that kind of film: you go well fast and fun and you get a laugh and a moan and then move on to the next split second that happens. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is really pretty like Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum is a wonderful Duke; David Cross does a marvel on the main gold top. All the actors and characterizations were good and on target. The cinematography was excellent. <br /> <br /> Superb animations from the beginning to the end ... go see!
