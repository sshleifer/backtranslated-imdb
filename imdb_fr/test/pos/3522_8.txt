(WARNING: SPOILERS!) <br /> <br /> Five young people ignore the warnings of Ranger George Kennedy and climb into the misty mountains of Oregon where they are hunted down and slaughtered by a pair of huge deformed hillbilly twins. When only two people are left, Warren and his daughter Connie, they find their animal instinct to stay alive. The film ends with Connie thrusting half of her arm into the throat of one of the killers and choking him to death. A very powerful, albeit slightly overestimated, backwoods slasher film that effectively utilizes lighting, sound and photography makes a cut above the usual FRIDAY 13 cashing. Led by an appealing and friendly cast, especially Deborah Benson (where is she now?) and Gregg Henry, this interesting companion of SQUIRM (1976) and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) of director Jeff Lieberman should not be missed.
