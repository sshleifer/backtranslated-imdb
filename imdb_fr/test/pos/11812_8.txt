I really liked the movie, I found it very funny and dramatic. But I just have a question about music is the movie. I could not find a soundtrack (even if there is one). And more specifically, I wondered if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is played while the boys go down the river to go to New Orleans? I thought it sounded like "My great escape", but I searched the Internet, in books, for just about anything I could think of, but I can not find it anywhere. If anyone could help, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
