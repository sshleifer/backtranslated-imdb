Just to correct something in a previous review, I do not think this movie is only for people who know London, this is the case of a very specific situation used to make universal comments. In an introduction to the published script, Jack Rosenthal said that it was supposed to involve characters who, through this exhausting knowledge test, gain some self-knowledge. <br /> <br /> I think it's one of the most perfectly written dramas I've seen: technically, he's extremely adept at conveying complex details, but he's also happy with the how it involves you. At first, you do not know more about this London Knowledge test than about the main characters, but you let yourself go with them until it's of vital importance to you. You become extremely proud of these successful characters and you are crushed for those who do not. Especially the one whose fall, without giving anything anyway, will make you fly your head. <br /> <br /> In addition, Nigel Hawthorne's character, Mr. Burgess, is called Vampire and not Dracula. You do not need to know that, I'm not saying it's crucial, but it's a measure of the drama: once you've seen that, you'll want everyone to know it and you'll evangelize about it of every detail. <br /> <br /> I hope you can see it. <br /> <br /> William
