It was Laurel and Hardy's last silent film for Roach Studios. However, as the public had a real thirst for "talkies", this same short film was redone by the team a few years later, with only a few minor changes. LIREGHING GRAVY was basically the same plot, except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy owner - not a goat like in ANGORA LOVE. This goat angle is the worst part of the movie. You may understand that boys want to keep a pretty little dog (after all, it's snowy on the outside), but why they bring a goat to the house is just unnatural and useless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home and they were tired of keeping it and keeping it. Huh ?! That makes no sense - if it was a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same thing ?! In addition to being an unconvincing plot, the film itself is purely Laurel and Hardy, with a familiar plot and familiar roles for comedians. This film contains a lot of laughs, but unfortunately is not one of their best films to conclude their silent career. This aspect of their career seems to have ended by whining.
