This film is one of the most memorable films I have seen. I reluctantly went with a Turkish friend who recommended it. I am not an enthusiastic supporter of music documentaries, but when Aynur Dogan, a Kurdish woman who has been banned from singing in Turkey for years, sings her piece, the theater is filled with wonder. I would do anything to listen to a CD of this haunting and beautiful song. And she is just one of the many artists interviewed and registered, talking about their experiences in Istanbul. Even now, a month later, I remember Aynur's singing in an acoustic auditorium and I was trying to remember the music as it resonated in the cinema. Congratulations to Faith Akin, the director of this film, and his great idea to capture the many beautiful sounds of such a cosmopolitan city. It would certainly encourage me to visit Istanbul.
