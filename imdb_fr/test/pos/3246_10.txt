This film gives you more of an idea of ​​the behavior of the Australians. Even though The Castle is a very good Australian movie, there is still a bit of it. This film is by far the best Australian film I've seen (I have not seen Dirty Deeds yet) and would probably be my favorite movie. The fact is, if you have not seen it, go see it. If a crime / action / comedy is your thing.
