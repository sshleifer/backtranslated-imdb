I tend to be furious when I hear about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often, he is classified as a talented filmmaker, only to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. It is true that his films contain more dirt and disease than the usual average American production, but his films are always very diverse and the intrigues are terribly morbid. Do not torture a little duck, that's another story! This film is a pure gem of Italian shock cinema! I dare to call this film a masterpiece? It's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all the brilliant aspects of true horror. The film shows the search for an inhuman serial killer in a small Italian mountain town. The bodies of 3 young boys are found, horribly mutilated. There are a lot of crazy people in the city but every path leads nowhere. Among the suspects, there is a greedy good-for-nothing and a scary woman, obsessed with witchcraft and voodoo. As a real brain, Fulci knows how to find the tone that gives goosebumps to his film. He portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and unmissable environment of gruesome events, supported by a dizzying soundtrack. Fulci is also developing as a genius storyteller here. The script is always one step ahead of you and the intricate plot will mislead you more than once. In other words, it is a unique giallo (mystery of horrible murder). The gore is not presented as being grotesque and explicit as in Lucio's last milestones (including the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond and the New York Ripper), although there are still some nauseating and difficult shock sequences to watch . <br /> <br /> Do not torture a duckling is the most convincing and effective accomplishment ever undertaken by Lucio Fulci and easily ranks among the greatest Italian horror movies ever made. Right next to the masterpieces of Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The film is fascinating from beginning to end, some aspects of the plot are extremely realistic and the tension rises at full speed! A must for horror fans and a top priority for Italian shock lovers!
