I love that movie. I just managed to get a copy and saved it to watch it on my birthday. This film raises several questions. One is. Who are the monsters of this world? To be different is that. Different. Real monsters hide behind masks of banality. They are the ones everyone sees as "a nice quiet guy" who "did not bother anyone". Or they are worse, they are the characters as played by Croneberg. Men who take pleasure and power to cut people and create their own blood books. I love shapeshifters, people who have gifts and those who can be horrified to be watched. This film addresses and explores what is normal. Who are the "others" and what fear does to some. Even though I gave this movie 10, I'm still tired of screaming women or are so entrenched in their way that they can not see what's going on and be a vehicle for the things that destroyed Median. My other complaint was why did they ever make a second movie. For my part, I would have liked to see the rest of this fascinating story that keeps me captivated from beginning to end.
