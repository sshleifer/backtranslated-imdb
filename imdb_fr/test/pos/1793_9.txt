Rainer Werner Fassbinder was the first to be accepted by the general public. In his fifteen hectic career, he managed to create an astonishing work in film and theater, both as a performer and producer, actor and director. Although this film does not please many viewers, the film has a lot to offer. The scenario is quite simple. A man is ostracized from his upper middle class family because of emotional and economic problems, and is unable to control his downward spiral. THE MARCHANT OF THE FOUR SEASONS is filmed with servile devotion to elegant details, and each set is very carefully designed and constructed. Each object on the board seems painstakingly arranged so as to cause layers of emotional texture. Many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to testify to Hans' desperate quest for spiritual significance or direction in his life. Much thought has been given to how lighting and color were used to contrast and improve the drama. Several times during the film, I froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the composition of the plan. I streamed this movie and the print was almost perfect and unparalleled. Fassbinder uses his actors in an almost unnatural "anti-natural" style. He does his best to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or familiar way, which creates a rather overheated effect. However, it almost injects the hyper-reality "of the narrative.Rather than presenting a banal melodrama, the lack of almost militant actors forces the viewer to confront the film in another way.Fassbinder's film intentionally prevents the viewer to easily connect to the characters "trials and tribulations. You are constantly outside, looking. It will be a disconcerting experience for many, but I thought it was a unique and satisfying artistic adventure.
