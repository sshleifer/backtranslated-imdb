Excellent episode, shown that Dean not only tastes good by choosing Cassie for his girlfriend, but that he also has a heart and that he can only love a woman, and that he is not just a guy who loves it and who leaves it! Aweso e episode. Applaud them on this one. I only hope that they will find their relationship with Cassie next season (if there is a next season ??) I would like to see her return to their "supernatural" life, especially that of Dean. I also like the fact that the African-American woman chosen to be the special woman in her life who escaped. I hope they will not spoil it and end it as its episdoe ended. The girl who played Cassie was really a spectator and it was good to see the WB interfere in what we all see in everyday life: the interacial coupling that has become common and acceptable (finally!)
