Well, I would say it's a very nice and touching movie, despite its flaws. I did not believe for a minute that Matthau knew the first thing about the profession of dentistry. In addition, Hawn's character seemed to recover quite quickly from the suicidal depression at the beginning of the film. Not to mention all that seemed rather ridiculous. However, the film succeeds thanks to its rhythm, its humor and its stars. Matthau may not have been a dentist, but he was as amusing as ever. Bergman brought a lot of sensitivity to the film (especially during the stage where she and Matthau go to have a drink after work) and a lot of humor. I think it was his performance that brought my brother to see this film after hearing some scenes. Hawn's performance is remarkable, even though an Oscar may have been a bit outdated. Basically, do not take this movie too seriously and you'll have fun.
