The first film at the festival Fangoria in Vegas and the most difficult. It's not a movie for everyone. A number of subsequent films used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories. This image seemed determined to do its own thing. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini showed some comical chops like the naughty on it. He dominated all the scenes in which he was, turning his cloak like Leslie Neilson playing Dracula. It was great to hear his explanations after the movie. He had such a good sense of humor about the role. <br /> <br /> I was happy not to have too many preconceived ideas, because the film was full of surprises. The story was funny, profane and unusual. There was a lot of love lavished on the look. More importantly, he had a strange edge. Unlike most subsequent movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, it was a movie that used its appearance for a particular purpose. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of films at the Fangoria Festival with bigger budgets. but none has dared to be so different.
