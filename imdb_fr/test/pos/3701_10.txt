It is 3:30 in the morning. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie about six minutes ago and it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> A teenager spends a night of passion with her mother's lover and everything is spoiled everyone is life. The really interesting thing about this movie is that you can not really blame anyone. <br /> <br /> Everyone has played to perfection, and the story has been a source of reflection. <br /> <br /> You should really see this movie if you can get your hands on it. <br /> <br /> I give him a 10.
