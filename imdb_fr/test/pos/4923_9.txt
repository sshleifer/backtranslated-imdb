I watch this movie at the beginning of each summer and it keeps having fun. Here, jokes are packed near each line of dialogue, giving you more bang than the average Simpson episode. Some of the jokes will fall flat or will only cause a slight laugh, but others will let you roll, then there are some that stick in your head ... "The public is now deaf." the video knows it's a video and does not pretend to be anything else. It's easy to sit down and let the bombardment of humor begin. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture and ironic comedy ensures that everyone can enjoy it. I was in grade 6 when I first saw this video, and I have to admit I still find it so hilarious now that I started university. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch during the summer, in the same way that you could watch "It's a wonderful life" at Christmas or "The Ten Commandments" at Easter / Passover. More than that, it's just funny like hell.
