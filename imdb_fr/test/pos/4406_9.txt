The film, which spent hours driving in the narrow streets of North London trying to avoid horrible congestion, immediately appealed. Add to that my interest in what London looked like at the end of the 70s and you have the basic premises of my version of the television paradise! On paper, the film ticked all the right boxes, and just after watching "The Knowledge", the film itself certainly kept its promises, or even exceeded them. <br /> <br /> Visually, I was amazed at the difference London took a look back at the time (I was living in Islington in the 90's, long after gentrification transformed the region) . It was really grubby, tired and laid back. London may still have bad residential neighborhoods, but the general atmosphere of the place is much cleaner, brighter and more enjoyable nowadays (depending on what this movie shows rather than my own memories). <br /> <br /> Regarding the story and the role, of course the best grades are going to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! He acts deliberately in an unpredictable way, alternating total severity and surreal mentality in order to make the Knowledge Boys disconcerted as he submits them test by test. <br /> <br /> In summary, it was an excellent trip for the least. back in a very specific time and place that I find endlessly fascinating. But even if you're not particularly interested in London around 1979, you'll always enjoy following the spiritual dialogue and the friendly characters from "The Knowledge".
