Written by Gerald Gardner and Dee Caruso, brilliant writers of Monkees television, Who Way to the Front is the latest of "Jerry Lewis" movies until "Hardly Working" is almost ten years later. Jerry's comedy is obviously an acquired taste and, of course, he can sometimes be his worst enemy when he directs the film as a producer / director - but even in the most sordid films of his films, there are always brilliant moments. WHICH WAY manages to be fun, entertaining and yes, quite fun. It sounds a bit like all typical Lewis movies. The pace is very optimistic and there are many excellent support players - a kind of JERRY DOES HOGANS HEROES. All this sounds like an unsold TV pilot and you'll love it or hate it --- but I hope you're going to make fun of it
