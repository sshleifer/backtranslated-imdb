The North Star camp and his extraordinary advisor, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray) would like to end a long series of defeats against Camp Mohawk, a typical Ivy League venue where only wealthy children can attend. Meanwhile, we see Tripper trying to love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow councilor Roxanne (Kate Lynch) while other teenage counselors meet and fall head over heels. The film arrives at Camp Olympiad as the rivals compete in competitive sports competitions, Tripper almost achieving their failure another year. The film also shows the growing link between Tripper and Rudy (Chris Makepeace, famous for "Vamp"), a Rudy (Chris Makepeace), whose father is often absent all the time. Rudy does not seem to be among other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time jogging in the morning with Tripper or eating his blackjack peanuts. The film contains mainly stories of teenage comrades who cut and bumble. <br /> <br /> You have hottie advisers, the total nerdy Spaz (Jack Blum) with his glued glasses and his aching acne, the nose beak "Hardware" (Matt Craven) who likes to blow things up, the big kid Fink (Keith Knight) who often puts his face in the film. There is a basketball game where poor Spaz can barely bounce the ball against his rival Camp Mohawk, let alone shoot a shot with poor Fink by throwing sneaky flying balloons between his knees that pass over the panel back. There is a campfire coupling (with a scary story of Tripper on a crocheted killer) and boys slobbering on the lovely ladies. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know it's sometimes hopeless to try to burst all the bursts of laughter. can and sometimes indulges in sentimental failures (such as scenes with a sad Makepeace and Murray), but just as much as this last viewing, I found myself laughing. I'm licked and I can not help but like it. It's a summer camp movie that just wants to entertain you. I can not explain, nor reinforce enough, the overwhelming joy that springs up when I see the sleepy Murray hand reaching up for the alarm clock that sounds loud when pronouncing a summer camp movie is about to begin . His intercom jokes are especially fun. But let's be honest, the film is a series of comic vignettes with Murray dead-panning, endless ... without there being anything wrong. The movie, however, could not survive without him, would not it? Hard to think of this film without Murray in mind. It's a happier time and I think that nostalgia for this summer camp experience largely explains why we, the adults, are still in touch with "Meatballs". And poor Morty (Harvey Atkin), the camp leader who longs for everything going well and beats Camp Mohawk for change, is the constant source of fun for Tripper and the gangs, because they often play him gags. he sleeps on his bed! Great enthusiastic actors who seem to have as much as us.
