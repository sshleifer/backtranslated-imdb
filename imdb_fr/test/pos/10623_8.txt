While reading the comments, there seems to be a lot of nonsense about the emotional banality of The Pianist. I find it difficult to understand given Isabelle Huppert's outstanding performance. Huppert is striking - she manages to perfectly convey the woman on the edge, full of self-hatred and illusion. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderfully rhythmic and judged. It would be so easy to present the main role as a ridiculous character - consider the scene in the porn store for example. Huppert is able to achieve this, partly because of his brilliant performance but also because the director makes his surreal life real and identifiable. <br /> <br /> Do not neglect this movie. It's one of the most amazing and interesting movies (and performances) I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Trust Boris!
