Pam Grier takes the names and kicks off the heroine of "Sheba Baby", the entertaining actor of director William Girdler's blaxploitation, "Asylum of Satan", with D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker . "Sheba Baby" is one of the difficult films that Grier appeared in the 1970s, including "Coffy", "Foxy Brown" and "Friday Foster". Short-lived Girdler co-wrote this night with producer David Shelton, a private boilermaker, in which he embodies a stubborn, stubborn shamus who refuses to rely on a man to help him manage his business. Unfortunately, "Sheba Baby" is not as good as the blaxploitation movies that Grier did under the supervision of director Jack Hill. Hill led the African-American group from North Carolina in "Coffy", "Foxy Brown", "The Big Bird Cage" and "The Big Doll House". Anyone who analyzes images of African-American women in the cinema should know these epics. The main problem of "Sheba Baby" is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks. Of course, the bad guys are happy clowns who can not touch the side of a barn with a howitzer. As the main opponent, Dick Merrifield calls himself a mean and selfish villain with choices such as: "Anything worth stealing is worth stealing". In addition, the composer Monk Huggins provides a strong and atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with Barbara Mason, is "Good Man Is Gone". "Sheba Baby" presents Grier in the role of Chicago fashion designer Gumshoe Sheba Shayne. She leaves the windy city to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to help her father. When she arrives in Louisville, Sheba learns that her father, Andy ("Detroit 9000" Rudy Challenger), has problems with a local black gangster nicknamed Pilot (Urville Martin's "Hammer" cigar) who asks Andy to sell his loan company to Pilot or to death. <br /> <br /> Initially, Pilot sends a team of morons to ransack Andy's office, but our heroine's father catches them in flagrante delicto. They turn Sheba's father into a punching bag. Interestingly, during the fight scene, Girdler rarely shows fists smashing the flesh. Previously, Andy's right-hand man, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker of "Horror High"), sent Sheba a telegram asking him to return to Louisville, but she had not received it right away thanks to his lazy partner. who did not know it. where to find it. Brick and Sheba connect, revive their romantic flames and share a night in the bag. Brick spends most of his time urging Sheba to stay calm in the face of adversity. As a former police officer in Louisville, Kentucky, Sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions later. After arriving home, Sheba borrows her father's car and barely avoids being shattered. As she walks to her father's car to get into the car, Andy receives another harassing call from Pilot. Previously, Andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his credit company to Pilot, but Andy changed his mind and agreed to speak with the thug. A satisfied driver informs Andy of the dynamite attached to his ignition with a delayed action fuse. In other words, getting in the car will not trigger the explosion; the explosion occurs ten seconds later. Andy and Brick rescue Sheba before the car explodes. Earlier, Sheba had agreed to let her father solve his problems without his intervention. "Dad, I know you think I'm doing a man's job, but I'm not going to stay away just because I'm a woman," Sheba told him. After her near-death experience, Sheba swore to know who had sabotaged her father's car. She hangs up an old contact of her time as a policeman and threatens the guy with his gun to extract the information. Only after Sheba crushed the man's face in a bucket of chlorine dust did he relax and tell him about a return to the city's railway museum. A brick accompanies Sheba and a shootout ensues. An angry pilot escapes through the skin of the chin. <br /> <br /> Later, the pilot sends a quintet of contract thugs from outside the city, armed for the trash Andy's office. These guns ignore their no-kill orders. Not only do they pull ribbons on the loan company's desk, but they also blow up Sheba's father with a shotgun. Sheba responds quickly. Handling her nickel-plated revolver, she wields three of the four assailants in the manner of Dirty Harry. The last handyman throws his gun and pleads for mercy. Sheba has her finger on the trigger when the homicide detective Phil Jackson (Charles Kissinger of "Abby") and a uniformed policeman arrive at the scene. At the hospital, Andy Shayne dies holding his daughter's hand. Naturally, Pilot is furious with this revelation and his fury borders apoplexy. Sheba then tracks down a loan shark, Walker (Christopher Joy of "Cleopatra Jones"), and asks him for information about the pilot while holding him under the threat of a gun in a car wash. This is one of the best staged scenes with a lot of disturbing shots of car wash equipment swirling and buzzing. Walker warns the pilot of Sheba. Driver and his henchmen confront Sheba in a parking lot and exchange the front. Sheba fled on foot for a carnival nearby. While the police block one of Pilot's men, she deals with others. The pilot accidentally pulls on one of his own and Sheba overthrows him. She pins Driver on a roller coaster track and threatens to hold him until the roller coaster cuts his head. The pilot manages to escape after shouting to Sheba about the identity and phone number of the great man Shark (Dick Merrifield of "The Hellcats"), whose reputation is so immaculate that Detective Jackson describes him as "the guy with all the right answers." "Sheba Baby" is not top Pam Grier. However, the idea that our heroine can handle everything on her own without the help of guys makes her interesting and entertaining.
