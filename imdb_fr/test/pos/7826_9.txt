It is very easy to understand why The New Professionals was a failure, at least in New Zealand: he did not follow in the footsteps of the original, he followed Bodyguards, who considerably outperformed the series with his boss formula at two agents. Cmdt McIntyre was a late-night George Cowley: hard on his team, but defending him to death. The shadow of the cast was huge. <br /> <br /> Well, not as huge as it should have been in the UK. Here he was networked in prime time. It has even been marketed in promos as follows: "These are the professionals". Someone else obviously noticed the difference. We were fortunate not to have this program broadcast in different regions at different time slots. <br /> <br /> It is the strong production values ​​that sealed the contract for me. As other commentators have noted, he followed the great British tradition of the one-hour actor, but at the same time incorporated personal elements. Something is developing between Liz and Ian, but it has never diverted him from the plot. Most episodes were based on incendiary diplomatic incidents, the kind of thing that helps Spooks from time to time. <br /> <br /> Unlike many shows of the 2000s, the plot has not been sacrificed to the detriment of whimsical direction -stylish photography. Directors like Christopher Young have kept up the pace and have done their job. They used good locations, making bodyguards smoother than if they had been slaughtered in alleys or alleys. It was contemporary, it would still be beautiful today, and it is one of the best examples of British action in the 1990s, showing that the UK can always do it better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Maybe except for the Germans and their Cobra 11.
