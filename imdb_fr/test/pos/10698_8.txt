Ninjistsu has always fascinated me, knowing that it will go further than beyond. In "Ninja III" it's fun, scary and intriguing. A ninja is shot by the police and uses his mind to take revenge. The victim, a charming young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). She falls in love with the cop involved in the shooting. The love scene where she pours the V8 on her body knocked me out! The death of the ninja attracts the attention of another Japanese called Yamada (Sho Kosugi). He comes to America not only to save Christie, but to put him back in the grave. Simply because he extinguished Yamada's left eye with a shuriken (shooting star). The fight scenes were excellent. I liked the game when the plywood fell on Yamada, and he slit it with his foot. And when he was caught, he told the officer with whom Christie was involved that everything would be fine. Rule of thumb: never underestimate a ninja. He took out the other cops without killing them. And he did his thing without worry. Of course, Chirstie did his best to try to put the ninja in his place for use as a tool of revenge. It was a good movie, ideal for martial arts lovers. 3 out of 5 stars!
