I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the story and the development of the character. Fulci perfectly mastered the creation of a horrible atmosphere with inventive camera work, vivid cinematography and wonderfully explicit realism. <br /> <br /> This film is no exception, unlike its more recent films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Undead, home near the cemetery, etc.), the characters here are extremely developed and the emphasis is on the supernatural and the suspense created by a classic dunnit among the lush hills of Italy. The landscapes sometimes evoke a precious folklore and are immediately contrasted by mud and a blood-stained terror, surrounded by dilapidated ruins. The gore in this film is not as widespread and seems more moderate compared to Fulci's more recent films. However, fans of Splatter and Giallo will probably be satiated by a few close-ups of oozing wounds and the last five minutes of the film. <Br/> <br /> All in all, it's a fantastic and mature film from one of our great Italian horror directors.
