Destined to be a classic even before being conceptualized. This game deserves all the recognition it deserves. At a time when first-person shooters like Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are catching the attention of gamers, graphic adventures are on the way out. With lots of wordplay and humor, The Curse of Monkey Island is a game that will appeal to all ages. Life can only get better after playing The Curse of Monkey Island. * Prediction * The Escape Suite from Monkey Island is also destined to become a classic. I guarantee it.
