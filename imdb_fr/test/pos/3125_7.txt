This film is about two horse dealers who agree to escort a small group of Mormons across the desert. Along the way, they meet a murderous family of thugs who threaten peaceful people and put their pilgrimage at risk. <br /> <br /> WAGON MASTER is what I would call a "little" John Ford film, as it is not the budget or reach of some of its other Westerners. In particular, this film does not have the big stars like John Wayne, but allows some of the usual support characters to take center stage. Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Ward Bond, long-time Ford players, were elevated to protagonists and the one who appeared as "the" main actor was probably Johnson - although the other two had almost as much time and concentration. This is not a bad thing because the film worked very well without the big star - and is well worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Now, that does not mean that I loved the movie. It was very good but certainly not perfect. In particular, when it comes to music, you will probably either like it or hate it. I found the music of the Pioneer Sons a little schmaltzy at times. It evoked a good mood, but sometimes seemed to dominate the scenes. I think a little would have worked better. Plus, with their incessant songs in the background, I was still expecting Roy Rogers to come out at any time. Another minor problem is that the plot was incredibly simple and the end was pretty much presumed. <br /> <br /> However, and I am happy to say that there is a "however", although it is rather a formula and sentimental, the film has always worked well. This is mainly due to John Ford's good leadership, as well as Ben Johnson's outstanding performance. He was able to provide an excellent anchor for the film. Another benefit for me is that I saw this the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another film about Mormon migration. While BRIGHAM YOUNG was a bit silly and too "holy" in his performances, here the Mormons were less "perfect" and looked more like real people - with weaknesses and personalities. Oh, and speaking of BRIGHAM YOUNG, it would seem that Jane Darwell was the favorite girl of Mormon-themed films at that time, as she was a main character in both films. Considering that she died at BRIGHAM YOUNG and that it was about 20 years before WAGON MASTER, here is a waterfall! <br /> <br /> If you want to take a look at the famous Jim Thorpe, he's in a small role where he plays the impassive Indian dancing next to Jane Darwell around the campfire.
