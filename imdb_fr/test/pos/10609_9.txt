I had no expectations (I have never seen the previews of "Marigold") and I enjoyed the characters, the contemporary music and the dances pointed in this light film. Even though 98% of the dialogue is in English (which is good for me), I would like the DVD to be subtitled to help you in some of the quick moments where the character's focus may be hard to understand. I would not judge this film against Bollywood films, but only on its merits as a fun entertainment (a musical film). <br /> <br /> I'm addicted to Ali Larter as an actress (and her bonus interviews indicate she's a nice person). Since then, I have watched this film several times (each time better and better).
