"The Cure" is a very touching and poignant drama. The film focuses on two neighborhood boys who become good friends. One of the boys has AIDS. The boys become good friends despite Erik's fears at first. The film shows the boys' journey to discover "the cure", which is in Ohio according to "The National Examiner", and how it affects their relationship. The acting is wonderful (I have never seen Annabella Sciorra do better), and the film is just touching. I could not stop crying with the shoe scene. He is a good larcorer. Keep the kleenex nearby. 8/10
