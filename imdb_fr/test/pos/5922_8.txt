Billy Wilder continues his long film career in the 1950s with a biopic of Charles Lindbergh, the young American pilot who was the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927. Jimmy Stewart plays the role of Lindbergh, but he may be a little too old for his part, he always brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his down-to-earth kindness that makes him an iconic movie star. Wilder leads solidly, balancing history with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what Lindbergh faced when he decided to take up the challenge. It's certainly not his best job or Stewart's, but it's a movie gem. It raises your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be American. Overall, it's just fine.
