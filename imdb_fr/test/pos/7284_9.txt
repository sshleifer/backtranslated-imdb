Sometimes, when looking for a movie, nothing is possible except a good thriller. Dead Line certainly suits. <br /> <br /> A little warning though: if you are going to watch this movie, you'd better not know too much about the plot. <br /> <br /> The plot thickens with the film. A tension really remarkably well built goes up. <br /> <br /> It's deep and horrible. It goes to the darkest places of the human mind. <br /> <br /> The plot also presents some very surprising changes. <br /> <br /> Wait for the night, turn off the light and watch this movie.
