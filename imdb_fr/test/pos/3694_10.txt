You know, people who make comedies so often forget that it's really good to be scandalous. Well, not this time. Unconditional love has everything. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a film with Cathy Bates in the romantic head ... and it works. Not only does it work, it works very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so much that I hurt myself, but the main characters were so human, so honest and so real. But is not that where the big comedies come from? Do not the characters need real feelings, real emotions and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do it in this movie. Unconditional love is a film not to be missed, especially if you really need to laugh, or if you are curious to see the psychotic dwarf in his red raincoat.
