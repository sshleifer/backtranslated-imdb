For a brief moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and the techno bar is amazing. I would probably follow it until my ultimate death too! Best vampire movie of all time but with a touch. The fight scenes are great. Wesley Snipes displays a track and field that you can not see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very credible as an ambitious new recruit who climbs the hierarchical ladder by any means necessary. Excellent movie 9/10. Where is the blade II?
