It's one of the greatest movies ever made. Brilliant by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This film is both disturbing and extremely profound. Do not be fooled into thinking that this is just a comedy. It's a brilliant satire on the medical profession. It's not a beautiful picture. Healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons who spend all their time making money outside the hospital. And yet, you really believe it's a hospital. Producers took care to include real medical terminology and real medical cases. This film really reveals how difficult it is to run a hospital and how bad things were in 1971. I loved this movie. P. - I noticed that the incompetent wheeler surgeon, an incompetent, played the role of chief of staff in LA law. The young doctor played Lou Grant. I also noticed that the registration nurse has since appeared in Becker and other programs.
