this film had entangled me in this endless loop of reflection for days after ... I was certainly not the snob of the movie that some seem to look like here, but I thought it was incredibly well played, and a powerful creation, if lacks a little subtlety in the execution. I admire films that can actually recreate the feeling of watching a play, it creates a strange mess that works well with this movie. I'm also a big fan of Alan Rickman, so that could be my bias. Personally, I found that the lack of spatial landmarks was a good thing - it could actually be anywhere and probably. I say go gently on what has been a powerful experience for me, and probably for anyone involved in any political activity.
