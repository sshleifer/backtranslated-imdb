There are one or two other short films from the Shemp period that I like more (ie BRAINS SCRAMBLED BRAINS), but I think we can say - without a lot of argument - that in this episode In particular, Shemp gives his best comic performance as a stooge team in 1946. <br /> <br /> Scene for stage, this episode does not let up: Professor Shemp Howard's singing lessons with Dee Green, who break the glass, its vain attempts to win the hand of a lady in marriage (it's your little snookums ... do you want to marry me * click *) in this tumultuous finish, she never fails to keep me in the stitches. <br /> <br /> I would be remiss if I did not mention this immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (the always lovely Christine McIntyre). In fact, is not she rather undressed and too much in love to greet the man she thinks is her basil "cousin"? Who knows, maybe the basilisk was a "very" distant cousin, which makes it legal in some states (to my knowledge). >: -]
