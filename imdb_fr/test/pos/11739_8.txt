During a second viewing, it is always a wonderful romance that is, in my opinion, much better than the film with which it is associated on my set of 2 DVDs, the classic film of Leo McCarey, "An Affair To Remember" . Still, it seems to have fallen slightly out of favor (only a 6.6 rating here on IMDb, and rated by many critics as "slimy and slimy"). It's sad because it's a clever romantic drama with a very good work from the two main actors, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. The film should be well known for its superb color cinematography and unforgettable musical score. I do not like Valentine's Day very much, but it gave me an excuse to see this movie again and I'm delighted. Although I still think that the death of Holden's character is too strongly announced, which removes the suspense of the final scenes, this film is very moving and I really appreciate it a lot.
