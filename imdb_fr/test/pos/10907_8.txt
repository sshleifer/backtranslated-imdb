It's really a funny movie. His dance scene with the band is one of the funniest scenes I can remember. I thought the "I'm gay" scene at the high school graduation ceremony was a little surreal, even if it was funny. As I watched for the third time, I began to read a small segment that I missed. One of them was when Matt Dillon's girlfriend, a classic, tried to use a dial-up phone she had never used before. Kevin Klein made this film with Tom Selleck. It was also the first time I could enjoy Debbie Reynolds; she proved that she can be funny. She confirmed this in the television series "Will and Grace". A discovery that I discovered after the third viewing is Lauren Ambrose of the glory of '6 Feet Under'. She stands out with her red bangs, but it's obvious that this is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very funny on the principle of high school.
