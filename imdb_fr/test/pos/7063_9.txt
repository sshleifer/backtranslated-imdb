No, it's not Citizen Kane. But would you expect it to be with a name like "meatballs"? It's the best summer camp movie of all summer camp movies. Does anyone quote "Little Darlings" line by line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that came to mind when I was in college and stayed with me all these years. Whenever I feel geeky, I mumble "Spaz, Spaz, Spaz, Spaz." Or, when we walk in the scrub in the forest, I say to my husband, "I am Wudy da Wabbit." (He does not understand). "It does not matter, it does not matter." I mean, this thing is classic! <br /> <br /> Disappointed with the DVD, though. I wish there were special features, maybe a comment or a making-of. But the film itself is a perfect snapshot of a teenager's life in the late 70s. Maybe not MY life ... You can not help but want to run in the woods in shorty, mid-high socks and feathered hair every time you see this movie.
