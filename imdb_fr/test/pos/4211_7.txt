They made me a criminal is a remake of Warner Brothers' previous film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan, in which Douglas Fairbanks, lead actor, played the role of winner of the trophy. <br /> <br /> Even with the current restrictions on production by Hays Office, this remake is actually better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly treated badly as a pugilist. John Garfield, with his background and style, enters a role for which he was born. <br /> <br /> They made me a criminal was led by Busby Berkeley and Jack Warner believed it was important to stay busy between musicals. In fact, Berkeley would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM. <br /> <br /> Berkeley is doing a good job keeping the action at a good pace. I particularly like the scene where four of the Dead End Kids and Garfield swim in a water tank and get stuck when the water level drops. They are doing quite well and with a little ingenuity. <br /> <br /> May Robson, who runs the summer camp for kids, and Claude Rains, the detective The Garfield Trail.
