Here is another good surprise. Whenever I hear a movie being redone, I grit my teeth. Movies such as "Gone in Sixty Seconds" and "Jackal's Day" are redone and the results are less than stellar. So, when I heard that "Italian work" was starting to be redone, I was expecting it to be a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Well, I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews and finally see the movie, and turned out to be wrong. Admittedly, it's neither original nor predictable, but it's really fun. From start to finish, you are caught in a very fun ride. The scenes with the Minis are excellent and the characters really enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> So, even if there are flaws, who cares so much that it's fun? <br /> <br /> Overall, 8 points out of 10. The only lost points are, perhaps, the few details and a slight lack of realism. But you will have so much fun that you will not even be able to stop and realize it.
