One of director Alfred Hitchcock's best films is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day and their young son) on vacation in North Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world-renowned singer. They meet a native speaker who helps him out of an incident on a local bus. Later, the Frenchman whispers something in Stewart's ear after being attacked and dying. The rest of the film is an enigma while Stewart tries to save them and solve the mystery. The film is immersed in the mystery and strangeness of exotic locales with the strangest events. You never really know what's going on in this movie, why people are coming up, to the end, and even then you're not sure. The final scene takes place at Albert Hall and is one of the most famous of the film, lasting 12 minutes, without dialogue. Hitchcock originally made this film in 1934.
