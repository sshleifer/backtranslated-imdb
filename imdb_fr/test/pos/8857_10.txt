The silly phrase "You can not touch that" surely applies here. With all the scary horror and sci-fi movies coming out, as well as all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything that's worth 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared me when I was a pre-adolescent. <br /> <br /> It is, without an ounce of doubt in my head, the most gorifying, the most disgusting, the most screaming The sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director ( sorry, even you, Mr. Spielberg), has already realized. What really gives it power, however, is not gore (it's mud and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the feeling of fear, isolation and mistrust that results in the characters and the viewer. <Br /> <br /> You can not be farther from Antarctica, and the story unfolds in this icy, glossy white setting. Several Americans, researchers and soldiers, are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog ​​running in his life to take revenge on Norwegians armed with firearms. Before they know it, the American outpost battles a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature of its choice. It can turn into disgusting and bleeding and bloody forms before the end, but once finished, if you do not see it in progress, you will not be able to see it among humans or other normal terrestrial animals. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just some of the remarkable actors. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a big genre. In fact, it still scares me. The extraterrestrial blood "jumping" out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches me still makes me jump !!! <br /> <br /> Still the scariest of all.
