I am a fan of action movies but, until today, I have never seen a film before or an advertisement for this film in Italy. So I went to see "The Long Kiss Goodnight" on pay-per-view, hoping for nothing special. <br /> <br /> But what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I have found is the presence of a few holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and fun action movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Samantha / Charly's transformation from the role of the ordinary teacher-wife to a cold-blooded agent who is recovering from amnesia seems like a good idea. Action scenes and stunts are the best I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best phrases I have ever heard and his chemistry with Geena Davis is good. <br /> <br /> And what about Geena? She is wonderful, she plays the best action heroine ever and makes convincing and compelling acting games. <br /> <br /> So I think this movie has had poor box office performances and bad reviews, as most critics and some of the audience have difficulty with strong female roles. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
