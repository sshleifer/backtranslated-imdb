I agree with the posters before the characters were exceptionally strong and credible and all the actors at their best. I particularly liked David Boreanaz's stretches in a role so different from the one he had played, proving once again his incredible gift for comedy. The first part of the film was light and fun, the blackmail party was a little surreal but interesting - and everything was downhill from there. <br /> <br /> I found it frustrating that at least two of the three girls (Keira and Lisa) are coming out of blackmail and betrayal without trace, a trace left in their psyche. I know the movie has changed the darker end of the play - and I'm not saying I missed the murder part. But I probably needed to see both of them pull out of the game one way or another and I was left moaning with frustration at the end. (That's why I only gave one 9) <br /> <br /> But it's really an interesting movie.
