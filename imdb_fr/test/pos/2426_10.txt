First, let me say that this movie is not suitable for everyone. He has a very strange subject. An old girl living alone and leading a boring life discovers a young man in a park right in front of his townhouse. She sees him sitting in the rain and invites him to dry and warm up. The man does not speak and the woman assumes that he is deaf and dumb. Yet she is fascinated by him and sexually interested by him. He finds it strange and continues his silence even if we learn later that he is not at all silent and that he reports to his sister everything that happens between him and the woman. I will not give the rest of the plot. If you can find this movie, watch it. You can not leave the eyes. What makes it so interesting? Well, it's totally unique. I have never seen anything like this and watching these two together is very uncomfortable. Especially when you know what this single, boring and obsessive girl is capable of doing. You will not forget it soon.
