I had not seen this funny series on the fox for a long time and the wait was worth it. The children of the series have something to tell each episode, and even my dad will sit and watch him. This is not a show for all ages that is not silly for kids. It is as always standing but on the next level. Everyone says what everyone says and everything everyone does. That said things that we all think, but in a rounded manner. The first time I saw the show, I could not believe it was fox, and that he was allowed to stay on the air after a couple of episodes, from choosing Hilary's boyfriend to choosing Kenny's boyfriend, it was worth it.
