After spending five seasons on the small screen from 1976 to 1979, "George & Mildred" converted to the big screen in the mid-1980s. Instead of letting Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke keep their writing roles, Dick Sharples wrote . Unfortunately, this film adaptation did not seem to affect the audience. Shame. I liked it better than the series itself. It was a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Mildred Roper (Yootha Joyce) wants to know if her husband carelessly, "George" (Brian Murphy) remembered his wedding anniversary. Of course not, but to try to convince his wife, otherwise he would reserve a table at the restaurant where he had proposed his marriage to Mildred several years ago. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at the restaurant, they discover that the place has changed hands. Seeing finally through George's lies, Mildred insists that they celebrate their birthday in a fancy hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel, George is wrong with the bandit "Harry Pinto" (Stratford Johns) for a ruthless hit-man, who wants a rival to be exterminated! <br /> <br /> Not an outstanding comedy as such, but a good fun mood all the same. The plans to revive the series after the film's screening unfortunately ended when Yootha Joyce died of alcohol poisoning. <br /> <br /> Funniest moment - George spoke to his favorite garden dwarf. His neighbor, Tristram, slips behind him and says, "I think it's time we chatted." George, thinking to have developed the power of speech, leaves the gnome in shock! <br /> <br /> Merry Christmas to other IMDb users including "AdamFontaine", "Cyril Blake" and "TheLittleSongBird". Have a good one!
