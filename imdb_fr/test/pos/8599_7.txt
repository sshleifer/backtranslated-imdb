Nothing is worse than the genocides of our world's history. This film tries to describe the horror lived by a particular family - a common narrative device - in the world of atomic bombs of Hiroshima. The most memorable parts are the sad images and images that the people of Hiroshima face in the aftermath of the war. However, history focuses more on the effects on a specific group of people and how they manage their lives; In other words, if you do not really care about them, the movie becomes boring. It is hard not to care, however, when the homeland of a family is destroyed. I do not know if I would recommend this film because it says very little politically and, honestly, did not hold my interest in family issues.
