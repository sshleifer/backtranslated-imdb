Some will say that the principal director of animation Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability. <br /> <br /> (No. Too much of them focus on John Lassiter's "formidable" ability to steal other intrigues from pretty puppet shows and then be touted as a genius. but I move away from the subject.) <br /> <br /> Miyazaki gave us film after film important themes related to maturity (whose theme is ecological) and intelligent writing that even the most spectator jaded who would normally despise any animated film could take full advantage if he had the opportunity. Nevertheless, Miyazaki (or almost) never forget who will certainly be among the public of these films: children. <br /> <br /> That said, I can not think of another filmmaker with this ability. Where are you going to have a movie where a three-year-old (my nephew Link) will stand still, marveling, a 7-year-old girl (my niece Amber) worshiping hers (and able to appreciate Frankie Jonas' "star power") and Noah Cyrus, a nephew of 12 years (my nephew Aaron) whose comment is "of course it was good! All that Miyazaki-san does is good!" Beautiful realization and animation (uh, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the characters of the mother (and I bet the oldest charas too) and loving the "kindness" of the child <br /> <br /> C ' Miyazaki-san seems to have the most respect for him, and he seems to be speaking to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker, and apparently "Ponyo" could be seen as a simple story about a little girl-fish who tastes the human world and wants to join him, and to the friend that she makes there, a little boy is named So ske (a bit like "The Lit tle Mermaid "), but there is a whole new level at play here. As usual, Miyazaki will populate her film with extremely strong female characters. Ponyo's mother, Soske's mother, the elderly ladies in a retirement home are authentic characters with their own unique spirit and an extremely strong will. <br /> The girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. Once she decided to love the human world, she simply used her own will to make her dreams come true. Her father tries to keep her innocent and to keep her like a magic fish, but the young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human by simple determination. <br /> <br /> Once human, she teams up with her friend Soske, whom she loves very much (although perhaps not as much as Ham). Soske is invited to be the man of the house (at the age of five) when his mother, Lisa, decides to help people in the nursing home where she works during a typhoon inadvertently caused by Ponyo in her quest to become a human being. Frankie Jonas (yes, he is related to the Jonas brothers, can we just go beyond that please?) Give perhaps the best performance of the film as a young Soske (which is good since it has the largest number of lines). His character also has a strong will, but also a very respectful and friendly character - characteristics that you will probably not encounter in a child character from this side of the Pacific. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto, has to face the decision of his daughter and the desire of his foreign wife to allow him to be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske "will remember him with tenderness". And again, Miyazaki REFUSED to allow a character to become the stereotype of the "villain". Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism on this subject, it is, honestly, what makes his films magical and yet relatable. Nobody in real life is completely a "bad person". All humans are of different shades of gray. And that's exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /> <br /> And then there is the animation itself. At a time when CGI would certainly have helped deal with the many effects of this movie, especially water, Miyazaki chose to embed NO CGI. While the hand-drawn animation was colored using digital media, each film in this film was hand-made, and I was extremely grateful. The animation of the character was extremely fluid and it even seemed to be a lip sync (quite unusual for an animated film). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with a colored pencil and had an effect quite on the audience. Here's what the animation looked like - and what it should look like. <br /> <br /> In the end, I found Ponyo very nice. Certainly not the best of Miyazaki (in my opinion, this honor is still held by Kiki's delivery service), but remains a fun 10-star movie for the whole family.
