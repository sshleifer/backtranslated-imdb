I just watched this, a short film by Harold Lloyd that featured his character "glasses" on the DVD of "The Harold Lloyd Collection" by Kino Video. He's actually a scammer whose partner is Snub Pollard and who is discovered by Bebe Daniels, herself who performs fake sessions. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard recruit many customers by throwing fake "lost" rings. I'm going to stop here and say it's quite fun, especially when Harold and Snub enter the place where Bebe works and meet terrifying objects and put on costumes like Snub trying on one of Bebe's outfits. Not too burlesque, but what was there was also pretty funny. So, on this note, I recommend The crooks are dishonest?
