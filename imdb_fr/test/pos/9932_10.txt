Being both a fan of Dario Argento and the Phantom of the Opera, I was dying to see his first version of the story, before the so bad, it is the "Ghost of the opera Dario Argento". The movie is just great, even the plot, which is one of the best of Argento for a consistent story. The way he turns a classic love story into a scary slasher is simply fantastic. The film has a very nightmarish feel, which helps keep you on the edge of your seat. The colors have never been better in a Argento movie since the amazing "Suspiria". The murders are smart and bloody, all in Argento's iconic style. The thing with the eyes in this movie is just unsettling and has done a lot better than in the splashes of Fulci. The acting is average, but once you have seen the film several times, you better understand the motivations of the characters and you get used to it. My two biggest complaints are the use of rock music. I think it was a good idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy metal, but it's not very well done here. The end is VERY disappointing, which is the worst thing about the movie, seeming to echo Argento's previous "Phenomena", but done terribly, it just does not need to end this way. The same thing happened in the director's version of "The Exorcist". I wished they kept the original ending. But it's still a fantastic film and really worth seeing, if only for the memorable murder sequence of Daria Nicolodi.
