For many years, Samuel Goldwin tried to bring his friend Jascha Heifetz to the screen. One night, while Goldwyn and his wife Frances were dining with Heifetz and his wife, silent movie star Florence Vidor, Goldwyn offered to play Heifetz in a movie. After a little persuasion, Heifetz agreed, provided his game was kept to a minimum. And the film, originally titled "School of Music", was born. <br /> <br /> The story itself is rather classic: a street boy (Gene Reynolds, better known as producer of "M * A * S * H"), runs away from home and found in a financially troubled music school, led by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan). As he tries to raise money for the school, the boy and other children cross Heifetz to Carnegie Hall. After a lot of noise, Heifetz finally appears at the school concert and sponsors the school. <br /> <br /> The story, although predictable, is surprisingly well written, although the film contains several minor blunders where different scenes were assembled, the most obvious being the young cellist who is sent out of the room from the orchestra We see him sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later. <br /> <br /> What is not surprising is the quality of the acting. As was customary at the time, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star of a seasoned talent: Brennan, Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Hall Porter, Marjorie Main (later Ma and Pa Kettle), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey and a Who's Who. actors of character. Actress Diana Lynn and singer / actress Kaye Connor made their (uncredited) debut in this film, as did Nelson Eddy's longtime partner, Gale Sherwood (as Jacqueline Nash). The children Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn, both experienced children, also appear. <br /> <br /> Goldwyn used the Peter Meremblum Symphony, a highly esteemed youth orchestra from the Los Angeles area, to appear in the film. Most of the children in the orchestra were not actors, but they were excellent musicians, as well as professionals (many of whom later became). Many of the children in the orchestra had a distinguished career: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn performed in theater and film, Richard Berres was producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded a reputable music distribution company, Elliott Rapaport was a recognized cardiologist, Lewis Elias was a band leader, Thomas Facey a conductor with various symphonies, Channing Robbins a prominent instructor of the Julliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins a teacher of SUNY Stonybrook and many children of the orchestra continued their career studies with large symphony orchestras. <br /> <br /> While Heifetz's role was kept to a minimum, his salary was not. He ordered $ 70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be shot at a later date, he received an additional $ 50,000 for another four weeks. Which, fortunately, has not been reduced to a minimum, it is his musical production. The composer Alfred Neumann (who was formerly conductor of the Meremblum) took care of the notation. Heifetz plays "Introductionne and Rondo Capriccioso" by Camille Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of "Estrellita" by Manuel Ponce (accompanied by Teddy Saidenberg), the diabolical "Hora Staccato" (from a recording of Vitaphone, with Emanuel Bay at the piano), an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Melody", an arranged solo violin piece from Tchaikovsky's famous "Adante Cantabile" of his string quartet opus 11 (played during the opening credits at the beginning of the film), the last movement of Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody's Violin Concerto in E minor. During all these performances, Heifetz presents many close-ups, including images very close to his fingering and his inclination, which could interest violinists wishing to study his technique. <br /> <br /> The Meremblum Orchestra also shines here, playing the tunes "Caro Nome" by Verdi and "Casta Diva" by Bellini (both singing Sherwood), an arrangement of the opening of the "Barber of Seville "by Rossini, a short excerpt from Mozart's" Eine Kleine Nachtmusik "and the previously mentioned Mendelssohn concerto (with Heifetz) Diana Lynn can be heard in the background of a scene, performing part of the Nocturne of Chopin in B-flat minor, and Mary Ruth, five years old, playing Chopin's popular "Minute" Waltz. <br /> <br /> In all, it is an excellent film, and AMC has shown it regularly until the beginning of 1992. I have not seen it on television in recent years, but copies are not difficult to obtain.If you are lucky, I strongly recommend you watch the movie.
