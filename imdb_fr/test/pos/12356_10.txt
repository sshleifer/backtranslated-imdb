Yeah, I guess this movie is a bit boring compared to some of Pam Grier's other movies. The plot is too familiar, the dialogue is stabilized, and some of the actors are not very good. But it's worth seeing for the long stretch near the end of the film, where we see Mrs. Grier in a sexy diving suit in blue, with the half-closed zipper. Yes, it seems like a frivolous point when we talk about an actress of Pam Grier's talent, but she happens to be an extremely beautiful woman too, and at the time she had a body that did not want to stop. It's nice to see him presented in a tight diving suit. Rent the DVD and tell me I'm wrong. You can not? It's because you know I'm right! :-) And yes, I really gave a 10 just for the combination scenes! ;-)
