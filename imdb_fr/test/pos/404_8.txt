I saw this recently on TCM and, thanks to IMDb, I discovered that there were seven "Crime Doctor" movies with Warner Baxter as a psychiatric detective. Baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stupid performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier. Not black, and a little campy today, the film also has a touch of the supernatural possible. The plot, the black and white cinematography and the characters are much more complex than those of Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan series. There are secondary intrigues, twists and unexpected appearances from a number of B films that we should all recognize immediately (none of them have attained A status). It's 70 minutes wonderfully unpredictable. <br /> <br /> I would love to see a series of DVDs containing these films.
