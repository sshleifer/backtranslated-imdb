Series as a whole - the best work of Jim Henson. John Hurt * is * the storyteller. Often scenarios of Oscar caliber, which is not surprising when we think of Minghella writing. An Oscar-winning actor, always. <br /> <br /> Sapsorrow - Everyone loves "The Soldier and the Dead", but something about "Sapsorrow" propels it even higher in my favor. In the first scene of the ballroom, costumes, music - perfection. Hurt and the dog usually interact with the story, but this time, Minghella goes back the extra step in the "ring" scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow. The chemistry between the characters is particularly developed, more than usual in the series, in reference to the friendship between Straggletag and the prince. Vu? See again. Pay more attention (to those of you who do not fanatically fan this piece of 22-minute film perfection). Never seen that? I am really sorry. <br /> <br /> Child of luck - not as sophisticated as Sapsorrow, but very intelligent in itself. It's a story of irony. Irony of irony, irony ... I love it. Each character is played to perfection, with the exception of the passer. He was doing drama; everyone was doing a romantic comedy. I forgive him. This is my favorite among the mostly comical episodes, "Sapsorrow" and "Soldier and Death" being examples of more dramatic episodes. <br /> <br /> Side note: The Greek myths. What is lacking in the Minghella subtlety (different author), it is partly offset by audacity because it portrays the four myths chosen with more sympathy and respect and history than usual. Also check out Jim Henson time if you can get one. For the storytellers, he stages the man himself who presents the myths, the lion of 'True Bride' and ... No annoying opening theme! Half Storyteller, half pure, spirit of muppet without mixing.
