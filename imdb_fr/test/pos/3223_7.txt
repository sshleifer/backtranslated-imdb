Every time I watch this show, I just want to turn it off and curse the manufacturers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogues, or rather the monologues, while everyone bites around nothing, become so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly endless discussion of how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, from pasta to meatballs) always manages to transform the dinner of the Gilmore family in total war. And these are only a few seconds or so. <br /> <br /> It seems so every time, many lines, with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use must be huge. <br /> <br /> But sometimes something happens. The babbling stops and suddenly these wonderful emotional and silent moments follow one another. For example, this week it was Lorelai's breakdown at the real estate agent. I just thought it was the best piece of TV I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It's almost worth it.
