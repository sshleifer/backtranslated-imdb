I'm not quite sure how I came across this movie, but I'm so happy to have done it. At first, we were shocked by the fact that it is subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother who hates reading (especially on weekends) enjoyed this film. I found the fantastic scenario and the way it was delivered in such an immaculate way only added to piss puddles on my couch. I'm not quite sure that this is so funny for the Danes, because the comedy seems to be reinforced by the lack of tone of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation. I have not watched many Danish films (or even elsewhere), but judging by this film, I guess they are not constrained by the same politically correct as everywhere else (bravo to them), this that makes the character of Eigel breathtaking fresh air, because let's face it, the special needs are funny. There are so many excellent dubbed in this movie that it puts shame on American sitcoms.
