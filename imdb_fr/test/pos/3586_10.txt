full of surprises, beautiful, sometimes cruel. just like life itself. let one ask for more. the best parts are of course the action scenes and the lawsuits. I really have to wonder how much work these guys have done to do certain scenes (whaling, polar bear hunting, etc.). This is a wonderful experience not to be missed for anyone who dive, surf or go to the beach once in a while. the music is attractive and the narration is superb and extremely rhythmic. definitely one of the best documentaries ever made and worth no less than a very respectable 10 (of its kind). some sequences are very cruel and may not be recommended for people with weak stomachs (each killer whale sequence is cruel).
