Note the release date of August 8, 1945 - about a week before Japan surrendered during World War II, so there will likely be a message for us in "Over 21". Irene Dunne (It happened one night, the 1939 version of Love Affair) is Paula Wharton, who lives at a military base while her husband's editor is at the training school. Alexander Knox (the longest day) is her husband Max. Look for Charles Coburn (Monkey Business, men prefer blondes) as the stifling and imposing newspaper head. Also look for Cora Witherspoon as Ms. Gates, The Women, Bank Dick, Libeled Lady. War history written for the wives' point of view, which was not very common at that time. Fun commentary on the shabby state of "marital housing"; Irene's wardrobe in this movie was certainly not at all shabby ... since they never had to leave their little cottage, it seems that the entire budget of the film was spent on her dresses and her hats always delicious.
