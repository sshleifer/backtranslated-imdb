In recent years, many biopics of famous singers have succeeded each other. "Ray," the story of Ray Charles, has much in common with "Walk the Line," which was directed the following year and tells the story of Johnny Cash. Cash and Charles were almost exact contemporaries, both born in their early thirties and dying in 2003/04. Both grew up in poverty in the great South American. Both lost a brother in an accident during their childhood. Both were successful in the 1950s. Both had marriage problems and both were addicts. All of these issues are highlighted in both films. There are also similarities to Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind". Although this film is about a mathematician rather than a musician, he insists, just like "Ray" and "Walk the Line", on the role played by the woman of her subject to help her husband overcome his problems. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles was born in 1930 of a single mother in a poor black community of Georgia. (His original name was Raymond Charles Robinson, but when he began his music career, he gave up his family name to avoid confusion with boxer Sugar Ray.). In some ways, Charles had an even tougher time than Cash and had to face two additional drawbacks: his blindness and the racism that struck all black Americans during his lifetime, especially in the South. Charles had a particularly traumatic childhood, witnessing the death of his younger brother, George, in a drowning accident, and becoming blind about a year or two later. He seems to have been haunted by nightmares and feelings of guilt over George's death throughout his life. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is rather slow and is a standard biopic showbiz misery riches, telling the story of how the young Charles learns to play the piano, becomes a box performer by night then became known as a major artist, falling in love on the way to the beautiful Della Bea. The best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks of Charles's childhood. There is an effective recurring image of colored glass bottles hanging from a tree in front of his house; It was perhaps one of the few visual memories of his life before he became blind. There is also a memorable scene in which teenager Charles shames a pretentious bus driver for letting him get on the bus claiming to have lost sight of Omaha Beach (in fact, he would not have than thirteen when landing in Normandy). <br /> <br /> The second part of the film becomes more interesting as it progresses in a more controversial territory, focusing on Charles's drug addiction, the problems of his marriage caused by his liaison with Margie Hendricks, one of her choristers, and her battles against racism. In the early sixties, Charles caused a sensation by refusing to play in front of a segregated public in Georgia (although, contrary to what the film says, it did not win him the ban to perform in that state). He also fought racial divisions within the music industry itself, performing not only traditionally "black" music styles such as gospel, rhythm and blues, but also traditional "white" styles such as as country and western (considered by many Americans black music of redneck community choice). <br /> <br /> As Peter Bradshaw, film critic for "The Guardian," noted "Ray" is a sunny film that diplomatically turns away from the darker side of things. He fails to mention facts such as the death of Charles's beloved mother, Aretha, during his teenage years, his brief marriage to Eileen Williams in the early 1950s, and his possible divorce from Della Bea in 1977. He also plays many of his illegitimate children. There are similarities here with "A Beautiful Mind" which also omitted a number of controversial details about the subject's personal life, including a divorce. <br /> <br /> Ray Charles fans will definitely enjoy the movie for music, but it's worth watching even those who do not know much about it, mainly because of the award-winning performance of Jamie Foxx in the leading role, thus reproducing Charles' manners so much that we think we are looking at a blind man, so he himself is seen. (Unlike Joaquin Phoenix in "Walk the Line," however, Foxx did not make his own song - presumably Charles' distinctive vocals were too difficult to reproduce). He is well supported by other artists, including Sharon Warren (Aretha) and Kerry Washington (Della Bea). The film is uneven and oversized, but nevertheless rewarding. 7/10
