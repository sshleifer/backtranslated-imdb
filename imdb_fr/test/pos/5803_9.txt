This show was so exhausting to watch and there are only two numbers: Substitute For Love and Paradise (Not For Me) where you can sit and contemplate. The opening of this show will remain in history as the most visually exciting, as Madonna enters the stage via a giant Swarovski crystal ball that descends from the ceiling and the large screens on the back show images of galloping horses. The horses play a role in this show because of the fall of Madonna. The infamous scene of Madonna on the crucifix is ​​on this show, because a big screen represents 12 million, the number of children orphaned in Africa because of AIDS. In the end, a website address appears for anyone interested in donating. We then go on to the theme of the environment and show again images of politics and religion. There is an interlude, then the show resumes on the music of I Love New York and Ray of Light. This part of the show is one of my favorites. The dancers make funny movements of the hand. Towards the end, there is the music number with the song Disco Inferno mixed with the song and the dancers make more known their presence. The end is full of energy as the show ends with Lucky Star and Hung Up tunes and hundreds of golden balloons fall from the ceiling at the end of the message "Have you confessed?" gets up. The DVD is worth buying and when it came out, the soundtrack of the show was added as a bonus. Jonas Akerlund did a great job with the footage of this show, keeping it consistent with the style of the tour.
