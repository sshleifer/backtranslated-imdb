It's a very moving film. This is the story of a special bond between a child and his grandfather. A villager (Arun Nalawade) brings his grandson, Parashuram, to the city for eye treatment. But just know that Parashuram (Aswin Chitale) has a rare eye cancer and must undergo surgery and will lose both eyes. The film talks about the emotions and the turmoil they are going through and how they accept everything. The film avoids all melodrama and tells this story in a simple way. Although the film is in Marathi, the language is not a barrier. This proves that to make a good movie, you do not need the usual songs, superstars or masala. Excellent performance. This is India's bid for the 2004 Oscars. I hope she will have at least the nomination. Would give 10/10.
