Many people make fun of Steven Seagals' acting abilities. And I really see why if I remember Fire Down Below. Well ... ok his other films are acceptable (as far as his acting game!). <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews on The Patriot, I did not expect anything from this movie. I hardly passed Fire Down Below and I read a lot that The Patriot was even worse. So, I was really surprised by this one. In my opinion, this is one of his best films. If there were more action sequences and some fighting scenes, it would be THE best. I liked the story of the staging and the actors. Cammilla Belle was just amazing. She will have a great film career in the future. The few action scenes were very well done. And Steven Seagal was very credible in his unusual role.
