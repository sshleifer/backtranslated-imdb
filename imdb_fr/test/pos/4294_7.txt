Although this film takes place in the sophisticated upper English classes, it is a simple torn couple story. It has a slightly dated look, being an adaptation of "A Way Through the Wood", a 1950's novel by Nigel Balchin (once very popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who despite an academy award for the screenplay of "Gosford Park", himself has a somewhat anachronistic character, wrote the script and directed it (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version, I saw Julian's most enlightening audio commentary. His main goal was to make sure his characters were correct and, overall, he was successful. In this he was helped by two outstanding performances of Tom Wilkinson in the role of City lawyer James and Emily Watson in the role of his wife Anne. He also kept the court; the race time is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> James and Anne have a townhouse in Chelsea and a cozy former manse in Buckinghamshire. Anne is a few years younger but they are childless. In appearance, they seem happy, but James, one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. Just at the end of the street, the aristocrat, the Hon. William Buel, who does not belong to the morality of the middle class, and is more than happy to enjoy it. But there is a complication, a road accident, in which an elderly cyclist is knocked down on a country road by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover, just like the Hon. Invoices. Soon, James, Anne, Bill and the widow of the victim (who happens to be the cleaner of James and Anne) are drawn into a plot to conceal what really happened. The stress is on the corrosive effect of all this on the relationship between James and Anne. <br /> <br /> The third person in this group, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the cast's point of view, his languorous and superior way suits the room, but he does not really succeed. It's partly because he's supposed to be sick for a while and looks good when he's supposed to be sick, and vice versa. The game seems underdeveloped. It is interesting to note that John Neville, as the father of Bill, who has only one significant scene, manages to establish his character in a magnificent way in the time he has. <br /> <br /> The universe of five-star hotels and superior restaurants is beautifully evoked. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people are able to convince themselves that the Edwardian era still exists. Basically, the film talks about what unites a couple and what tears it. Nigel Balchin was breaking his marriage when he wrote the book, and Fellowes did well to convey the atmosphere. As he says, his adaptation is relatively free, but the central theme remains the same.
