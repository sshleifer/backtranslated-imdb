This film has really used its places with amazing shots, dark and disturbing. The film moves very slowly, but allows you to watch constantly. Modern Love worked well this year in the Gold Coast Film's fantasy program, offering the audience a glimpse of a typically neglected Australian cinema. More importantly, it is comforting to see Australian cinema not confronting the clich√© of Australian characters and the intrigues we have seen being destroyed over the years. This film will compliment all festivals and open the debate after its screenings. The performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic. An interesting exploration of family relationships and environments.
