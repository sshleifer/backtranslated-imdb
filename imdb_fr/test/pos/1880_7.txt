(Some spoilers) It took Bruce Campbell about 19 years to finally display his masterpiece "Man with the Screaming Brain" on the screen. But Campbell had to change his story by doing so, because of financial problems, in Sofia, Bulgaria, not where he originally wanted the shoot to take place in Los Angeles, California. <br /> <br /> In the film, Burce Campbell plays US The pharmaceutical magnate Willian Cole, who travels with his spoiled rotten wife, Jackie, Antoinette Byron, in the former Communist Republic of Bulgaria. This is where William wants to help finance the almost non-existent public transport system in Bulgaria. <br /> <br /> It is poor William's misfortune to get involved with Gypsy Tatanga, Tamara Gorski, and his ex-boyfriend Yegor, Valdimir Kolev, a former KGB taxi driver. The two, William & Yegor, will unconsciously end up wringing their heads, because of William's skull, because of Tatoya's jealousy and vindictiveness. <br /> <br /> After the assassination of William and Yegor, their bodies are delivered to Dr. mad scientist Ivan Ivanovitch Ivanov, Stacy Keach, from his faithful assistant Pavel, Ted Raimi, to have their brains experiment. Mr. Ivanov has this theory in that two heads are better than one. And now, with the material, William & Yegor, at his disposal, Dr. Ivanov will finally prove it. What Dr. Ivanov will discover sadly is that by merging the two heads, or brains, their brain waves will overlap and cause not only a malfunction, but will turn against each other! <br /> <br /> William with Yegor's right lobe, inserted in his damaged brain, seeks to find Tatoya and make her pay for the damage she has caused him, as well as Yegor. Yegor, for his part, is stuck in William's head who loves and does not like, both in food and drink, are totally opposed to his. This causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains fighting for control of William's body! <br /> <br /> Things get even more complicated when Jackie discovers that Tatoya murdered her husband, William, who confronts her in the dangerous and high-crime section of Bravoda, called Gypsy Town, ends up being murdered. Reported to Dr. Ivanov by his assistant Pavel, he is determined, without a body, to implant Jackie's brain in an experimental robot on which Pavel works. The operation is a resounding success but the only drawback is that Jackie, with his brain in the robot, must have his brain recharged every few hours! Or, like a real brain lacking oxygen, she will die with the batteries of the robot. <br /> <br /> Combination of comedy screw like in the 1930s and horror film with William and Yegor running the Bulgarian city of Bravoda trying to find Tatoya and make her pay, with her life, for the sad state of her life in which she put them both. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** Dr. Ivanov saves the day by discovering how to prevent the two brains from fighting, and therefore to cooperate with each other! This is done by him instead of merging the brains. Dr. Ivanov maintains them independent by implanting a neutralizing cell wall between the two non-cooperative gray matter globes.
