I think it's great to see how Chiller chose this series and showed it for this generation. Filmmaking has come a long way, especially with special effects, and to be able to watch archived shows they never knew, they will certainly be able to see the progress being made right now. MONSTERS is neither bad nor spectacular, but entertaining. It takes creativity for the types of stories they have imagined and each generation seems to have its own series of horrors. This particular series was not as awful as Friday's 13th, The Series, nor as adult oriented as Freddy's Nightmares ... it was something a whole family could watch while still laughing and scared. . I'm glad Chiller Channel shows it in its line-up, I'm pretty much aware of the episodes I missed when I was growing up.
