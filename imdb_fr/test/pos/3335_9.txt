This clever little film demonstrates the virtues of the rock, the place and the kind of masculine force that we no longer have, nor even aspire to have. The Saint is a paladin who has only the best motives, not to mention a refined vocabulary and diction. No need to increase the volume or read the dialog box. George Sanders is so charming and, yes, discreet that all this talent, this intelligence, this physical presence and above all, his masculinity, seem almost normal. A little normal! George Clooney can not begin to master the scene as Mr. Sanders does (and does so without Mr. Clooney's aggression). He could play the puzzle (witness The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Rebecca), but when he was good, he was very, very good. Really, a man for all the reasons and seasons.
