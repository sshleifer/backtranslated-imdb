Like another poster mentioned Ch. 56 (a local Boston TV channel) has shown it several times over the years on Saturday afternoon. They associated it with the first sequel "The Return of Ginat Majin". <br /> <br /> Now, I have not seen her since ... but she never left me. Aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded colors, it was a pretty good fantasy. Technically, it's not horror ... until the statue comes back to the end. It's about a village ruled by an evil man. There is a giant stone statue there that the villagers continue to pray for help ... in vain. But things go too far, the law comes to life and destroys the wicked ... but then it also starts to attack the good guys! Well played with some cool special effects in the end (I loved how he got rid of the main villain). There was also an enchanted forest in which there was some kind of interesting. <br /> <br /> No masterpiece, but an unusual fantastic combo / horror movie. It's worth catching - but not if it's doubled.
