I really liked the movie. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a computer hacker, a computer genius, a flying man and a man with a spectacular plan to steal $ 35 million without using a firearm. This film is entertaining although it has no central idea. It's a non-stop movie with a lot of actions. All the waterfall work is beautiful. From the fast-paced speedboat pursuit to Venice at the beginning to the pursuit on the busy roads in Los Angeles, involving three mini-coopers and even a helicopter. The best boast hunt I've ever seen. I like mini coopers. Expert thieves used mini-barrels for escape cars. The pursuit between mini-coopers and motorcycles is incredible. They pursued underground. I can say that there was not a moment when I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Bridger Stella), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (left ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) have really made a good job. I like the actors of this film. I have seen a lot of heist movies but The Italian Job & is one of my favorites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I love this kind of movie.
