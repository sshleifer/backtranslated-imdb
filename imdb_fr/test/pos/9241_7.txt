Anyone who has ever wondered how to make a film without a budget should see this documentary. The determination of everyone described in this project moved me a lot and should bring us closer to those of us who ventured into the world of entertainment, be it film, music or writing. I think the filmmakers could have done a better job by prefiguring the events that led to this film becoming a documentary, perhaps using a narrator; Apart from that, the film is a good example of how show business is not about the "show", but rather the "business". <br /> <br /> I hope that the current project, "Repo Man II", sees the light of day. I think the filmmakers did a good job with the little work they had to do and all they had to overcome to complete it.
