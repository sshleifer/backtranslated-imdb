Deepa Mehta's "Fire" is innovative, daring and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the fate of conservative upper middle class Indian women, this is a film that no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das deliver outstanding performance by minimizing their characters. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the world views around Radha and Sita each time they seek each other's support. This film does not deal with lesbianism, as many have called it. Lesbianism is only part of the movie. It is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film as a taboo rather than give it a chance and examine its true meaning.
