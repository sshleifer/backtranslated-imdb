The Cure is one of the few movies I've rated 10 out of 10. I mean, everything is perfect for me in this movie. I saw it almost a year ago, and yet I remember many scenes, especially the final touching scene accompanying the credits. excellent story, making the film perfect. <br /> <br /> The message is clear - friendship, and it is displayed in the set. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say here. Simplicity is one of the things I like so much in this movie. And of course, it's fun and moving at the same time, it's suitable for all ages. <br /> <br /> 10/10, well done!
