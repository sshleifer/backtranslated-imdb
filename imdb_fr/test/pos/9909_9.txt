I really liked this movie. On the one hand, it did not have the tacky special effects that big budget movies have. The acting game was decent in this one, you're the only one who can say right away that it's doubled, but once you've overcome that, and you can not change language on the DVD version , it's cool. The plot was unique, you take a situation similar to a heat wave widespread around the world, especially in Frankfurt, where I went often, and you take a garbage strike that happens quite often in this country and you have a recipe for a disaster. I loved how the hordes of rats went everywhere and the idea that if you pick up the garbage, that's the last thing you want to do, you pick them up, the rats do not understand what they want , they basically follow garbage picking, so you're asking if the garbage collectors are on strike, picking up trash, private contractors, anyway the military wants to quarantine out of town or the wrong thing to do , then you would have all the rats take over the city, then throw in a mayor who wants to keep a limited budget, and line up his pockets, you have a realistic movie, and the female lead is also a pleasure to watch on screen, a very correct movie that I thought, I wish more so, the Frankfurt performance could have been a little better done, but for the average viewer who never went to Frankfurt ... I was born in Germany and s I've been to Frankfurt several times ... it's won. No matter, but overall, a big bravo.
