I saw this film many years ago, I tried to locate it, but it is perhaps understandable that it can not be found. It was so esoteric, yet one of the few movies you have left for a long time. I'm still not sure of the reality of the film, and perhaps, like the principle of uncertainty, darkness is what is defined. Playing is superb, the atmosphere is always filled with a feeling of apprehension, a general melancholy permeates, and yet, it is difficult not to be absorbed by the story. I rented it thinking it was science fiction (it was in the science fiction section with a totally misleading presentation), but obviously that's not the case. Or horror, or even suspense. In fact, we feel grateful that the director had the courage to make a film like this, for which there is obviously no strong audience. I know some people have complained about Klaus Kinski's short role, but I think it's very appropriate. His limited exposure is essential to forming the mystery of this film.
