I absolutely loved this series and I was very sad to see her go. Yes, it's based on Christianity, and traditionally too. As the other reviewer says, it tackles difficult issues, but it depends on your point of view. As a teenager and now a mother, I was so happy to see a TV show that was clean and good, frankly, wonderful! Unlike the other reviewer, I was comforted to see how they handled the condom business. Instead of hearing typical condom tendencies, they showed the son that he was really working to be chaste and apply it to his later relationships, which were pure and pious for her and much safer for her (100% !). <After watching this entire series, you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and out of the family (once they settle in more permanently), and the moral values ​​they teach in every episode are priceless. I found Touched by an Angel (made by the same producer) nerdy here and there (although overall I liked that), but this series, in my opinion, was much better done and had a better game. actor and was also more interesting. . It was good for the whole family and interesting for the whole family, which was a huge plus. The family was not exceptional, they had their own mistakes, but in the long run, they did what was right and you saw them grow, change and fight like any real family. It was my favorite show at the time and will always be at the top of my list, I hope it will be released on DVD!
