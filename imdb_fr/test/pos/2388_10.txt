I watched the movie for the second time on September 30, 2006 and I thought it was even better than the first time I saw it. I really enjoyed the acting, especially "Uncle Benny". I thought that Fred Carpenter had written very well and directed this film. The scenario has definitely caught your interest and I hope this film will reach the top. I felt it was moving very well between the scenes and the surprise surprise at the end, well, let's just say I did not see it coming. I also thought that Craig, the actor who had played "Eddie Monroe" had done a great job and I hope this film will help him go further in his acting career. From beginning to end, I really appreciated.
