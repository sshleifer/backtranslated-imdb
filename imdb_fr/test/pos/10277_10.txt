It's a wonderful thriller that I've watched many times and never tire of. It's all the obsessive love that five people have in Paris, lucky (bad) coincidences, false identities. The music is really captivating. There are hardly any flaws in the characters, just the end is not very credible, but a definite "must-see" again.
