"All men are guilty," says the police chief. "They are born innocent but it does not last." Add this bit of nihilism to the fascination of Jean-Pierre Melville for the idea of ​​the rogue's code of honor and you have Le Cercle Rouge. This code of honor between crooks, however, is not a cliché; it is a product of the imagination, even when the film moralists - the realistic moralists by their point of view, the romantic moralists by most of the others - have started to make films on the subject. Their theme is that it's not what we do, but how we do it. We find ourselves most often with stories about experienced men with their own sense of honor, stories where fate, fatalism and code manage things. <br /> <br /> For most of humanity, with the exception of screenwriters and directors, it would seriously hinder the way of living one's life, raising one's children and being a good friend . This mannered fatalism is in a sense a self-indulgent notion. The Red Circle is, in my opinion, a classic film for people who can secretly enjoy the adventure of missing the last bus to go home. But where, in my opinion, The Melville Samurai - Criterion Collection is a story that dominates style, The Red Circle succeeds in combining style with a strong story and compelling actors. In my opinion, the purpose of the film is nonsense ... but the film itself is a first-class experience. <br /> <br /> Melville's hopeless account of three crooks - Cory (Alain Delon), Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - is based on a little wisdom that is, perhaps to be, attributed to the Buddha: That all men who are destined to meet will ... with their fate, they can not change. Perhaps, because some believe that Melville himself proposed the wording if not the thought. Anyway, we know from the outset that this film will not end well, depend on fate and coincidences to organize us and remind us of the nihilistic philosophies that we discovered and loved when we were in high school. Once Corey and Vogel meet, then come together in Jansen's unique talents, we go on a one-way flight to steal an exclusive and highly protected jewelry story on Place Vendome. The tension arises because we know not only that the French police are pursuing Vogel, we also realize that some determined crooks are clamoring for Corey. <br /> <br /> For me, the great pleasure of the film was to admire the work that Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their characters, and the ruthless intelligence of André Bouvril, the police captain, Mattei. Melville hung on me while he was developing these characters and their own situations; he built me ​​emotionally, then released me when he made me appreciate their likely destiny and let me see it happen. Melville lays the groundwork: escape from the train, escape from the woods, last shootings in the woods, meetings with Mattei and a man who refuses to inform - with fascinating possibilities. It creates tension in all these cases by taking its time; a rare feature in film making and an even rarer trait now. And Melville takes the time to develop Mattei as an individual. Mattei is a sad and experienced man. It's a loner. When he returns to his apartment, he has a well established routine: he greets his three cats affectionately, he bathes and while the bathtub is filling up, he prepares them to eat. I do not know who is destined for Mattei, but I hope it's someone who loves cats. <br /> <br /> Nihilism is still fashionable among some creative and some critics. In most cases, I think it's much harder to put aside nihilism and simply live your life without causing too much damage. (And it's even harder to show convincingly in a movie.) The Red Circle is a film that, for me, tells me little, but it's in its own way, in my opinion, a beautifully edited film.
