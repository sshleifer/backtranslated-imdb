a great movie, with an unclear political message. it is shot in a theatrical style, i.c. most of the action takes place inside. Mayor Surov and Diana Ashcroft seem equally suspicious. The emotions are strong, as tourists and Western businessmen seem reluctant and unable to yield to the mayor's East-Russian charm, even as he tries to understand their point of view. the two opposing visions of the world are clearly indicated, but the film also shows that human emotions can not be controlled by politics. he plays powerfully and has a strong emotional impact for a film of the 50s.
