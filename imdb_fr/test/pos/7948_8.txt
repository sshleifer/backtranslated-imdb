SPOILER ALERT - AND I REALLY MEAN IT !! READ NO OTHER EXCEPT IF YOU ARE READY TO REVEAL A MAJOR LOTTING ELEMENT! <br /> <br /> Okay, first I have to say that I have a relatively high tolerance for depressing movies. I will watch and enjoy movies about the horrors of real life (such as war and holocaust) or cases where the plot is related to death and sadness BUT I hate movies like STEAL MAGNOLIAS and TERMES OF ENDEARMENT where the film is built around a manipulative death of a main character. So, already so well that this film is well done, it has a MAJOR strike against him because one of the main characters dies of an illness at the end (although they never say WHAT what he had in the subtitled version in English). <Br /> <br /> So you could ask yourself the following question: "If this hard blow hates this type of film, why did it look in the first place?" You would have a great point to ask this question, although I hope I'm not really a hit! Well, when I found it in our local library, I had no idea what it was! The film was not specifically intended for export, as the subtitles were in Korean, English and Japanese and the box was entirely printed in Korean. Well, being a fan of trying movies from all nations (I have seen movies from at least 30 to 40 different countries), I tried. <br /> <br /> Well, aside from mandatory death, I loved the movie and I hated the way it ended. While I usually hate the miraculous endings of the Hollywood guy, I wanted to see the guy saved through a new drug or a new experimental surgery. I was really disappointed that he had to die - especially since he seemed to be one of the nicest people I've seen in movies for a long time. His smile was contagious and I really wanted him to have the girl at the end. Oh well, at least I can understand the message of the movie you need to seize to seize the opportunity. Excellent acting, music, etc., but it's not the most satisfying end for me. This film was good enough to encourage me to try a little more Korean cinema.
