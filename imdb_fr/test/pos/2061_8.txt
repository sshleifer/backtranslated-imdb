"The Long Kiss Goodnight" is a nice and cool action thriller, and a breakthrough in Geena Davis' career. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but what then. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plot is strong enough to keep you engaged for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> It's done with style and avoids most action shots. Geena Davis is great as a woman of action and overcomes her usual role of "good woman". Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as a support player. The movie's villain is too nerdy and you can tell what's going to happen to him. <br /> <br /> He moves away from the usual usual actions such as Commando and On Deadly Ground and is undoubtedly one of the best actioners of all time. Good fun and good popcorn entertainment. 7.4 / 10.
