Not for those adrenaline maniacs, etc. It's a good movie, dealing with the post-war period, a psychic problem, another point of view. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez is great as a young man, haunted by the demons of the Vietnam War, who causes family problems. <br /> <br /> Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. <br /> <br /> It all boils down to the problem of how to deal with the past, with whom <br /> <br /> The character of Emilion Estevez can not manage, and the character of Martin Sheen does not want to deal with it. <br /> <br /> A protective mother examines this problem with a warm, open heart, but the closed mind reasons.
