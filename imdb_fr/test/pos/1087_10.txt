Satya was excellent ... The company was just as good but more refined, probably because of the money earned from previous films. Ab Tak Chappan is still more entertaining. The dialogue is hard, raw and sometimes hilarious. Nana Pataker shines once again in a role that only he can play with authority but whose actors are very talented. The direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfactory pace with a very dramatic climax. As a representation of reality, it may be too dramatic, but in the end it's a film, so the balance is perfect. I ordered my DVD and can not wait to see him at home. As a lover of this type of gangster movie, it's very rewarding and is highly recommended for lovers of Bollywood gangster movies "Non-Yash Raj".
