Fantastic series, one of my rare favorites (Miami Vice and Tour of Duty are the other two, and this series suits them perfectly). <br /> <br /> These guys do not want to wear frilly tights - they dress more like lumberjacks. Everything in this series breathes realism, whether it's an artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> This portrays the portrait of a Europe a little sheltered from paganism, most of the villagers still having their local deities, and there are nuns worshiping Satan and magi, witches and wizards casting spells. <br /> <br /> However, what stands out the most is that it is a series of his time. Rather than the 50s version, which was a lament against the centralized government and persecutions of the McCarthy era, this series is deeply ingrained in the 1980s, Thatcherist bleakness, and has a strong environmentalist bias. Robin's protector is a nature worshiper called Hern The Hunter, who often wears the head of a deer. He embodies (like this Robin) the green man, an alternative version of Osiris (the Egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection). it's worth noting that in these series, Robin In The Hood is not a person, but a concept: when the old is killed, a new one is called telepathically by Hern - the person may die, but Robin In The Hood lives forever, hence the concept of resurrection). <br /> <br /> The music and the score are really remarkable and interpreted by the Irish band Clannad. Looking at it, I could not help but think how authentic the medieval Anglo-Saxon folk music was. :-) <br /> <br /> All this is beautifully filmed in the lush forests of Wales, which are considered The New Forrest. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that, in the first episodes of both series, the actors must overcome their own mistakes and convince themselves that it is really a serious job. After that, they get into it and the acting is awesome! Michael Praed as the first Robin (the second is played by Sean Connery's son, Jason), Judi Trott makes a beautiful and fragile redhead Marion, Phil Rose as a stout and very generous Tuck monk, Ray Winstone as Scarlet volatile and adorable, Clive Mantle in the role of Little Little Shepherd Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as his friend and his bumpkin shepherd and Mark Ryan in the role of ex-Hashashin / Assassin Nazir, all of whom offered superb performances. The big bad guys are also stable, Nicholas Grace as the sheriff of Nottingham, the sheriff of Nottingham, and his aristocratic sidekick and jester (and the half-brother of Robin, in this case) Robert Addie in the role of Sir Guy de Gisburne . Fashion designer Richard O'Brien is also very cool as a wicked wizard Lord Owen of Clun (Olliver Cotton) Gulnar (he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second). <br /> <br /> Tithe Barn, Bradford on Avon, has replaced the Sheriff's Castle. (See bradfordonavon.co.uk under "Places of Interest".) <br /> <br /> So if you like mythology, the Middle Ages, romance, do not waste your time Xena or Hercules - That's the reality, so look at it! <br /> <br /> Alex
