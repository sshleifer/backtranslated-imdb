We see at the beginning of Little Dieter Needs to Fly Dieter Dengler, the subject of the film, an obsessive-compulsive. Or at least that's what he seems to be by constantly opening / closing the doors and keeping his stock of food in the cellar. In a way, the director Werner Herzog poses somehow the central question of why Dieter is like that. In fact, he is not necessarily obsessive-compulsive, he is just, well prepared. And why should not he be after the life he has lived? Apart from the juiciest, darkest, most exhilarating, scariest and most haunting story of survival in the heart of the picture, Dieter's story is also fascinating. Dieter's own childhood, for example, was already an arduous task from the beginning: to be in post-war Germany, to be poor in a family without food and without prospects, eating a wallpaper for "the blue walls ". But enter into a passion, an unsatisfactory desire (which, of course, is part of Herzog's bread and butter and the love of man in his films), which flies, and for Dieter, there was nothing else to accomplish. After becoming an American citizen, it results much more than he could have negotiated. <br /> <br /> Dieter is one of Herzog's most fascinating, offbeat and compassionate characters during his career, a man whose memory is marked by brutal memories of his time as a prisoner vietnamese war, though it contains at least some of the most compelling narratives of any documentary of the last 20 years. Ironically, the story unfolds - unlike The Wild Blue Yonder - primarily in many of Dieter's presentations about some of the most minute details of his stay in the various detention camps (tactical torture, insects, brutal, miserable). violence and threats, as with the story of the wedding ring) and leading to the most interesting and sad passages with his best friend Duane. They escaped the jails together, but realized that their journey to Cambodia would not be so easy. Now, for most of the time, the conversation is exciting, that is, Dieter describes his stories and reproduces reenactments from time to time (fashionable, Herzog could only do it, Dieter being already a middle-aged man, handcuffed, etc. through the jungle), we can imagine all this in the mind. It becomes even more keen to try to bring together these small details and the intensity of all these elements into a form of reality. That Herzog keeps these simple portions and knows how to keep Dieter in his answers, makes him a key figure. He's never totally "normal", but unlike Timothy Treadwell, you'll never really think about laughing at him either. <br /> <br /> So it's hard to say with his hero (whether he's war or not), While Dieter disputes this claim by saying that those who died are the real heroes, typical but perhaps to be quite true), Herzog stylizes his film with a mix of archival footage depicting Dieter's youth in detail (the episodic footage of World War II scenes and German rubble is always a captivating sight, and with Herzog a step up in timing and assembly with music), and capturing images of Vietnam during aerial jungle and field viewing. Herzog is also very wise not to introduce too much politics into the proceedings. There is no "I was used by Americans" or anything added. We even have the impression that Dieter does not have too much grudge with everything that happened to him, that it's just what happens in war (and, of course, he dropped bombs on people of his plane). Now, in most of these atrocious - and even in the little things involving what's happening in jails, bathrooms and food scraps, it's always heartbreaking - fortunately, Herzog also keeps a level of humor control. One of my favorite scenes in the film, where Herzog separates for a moment from Dieter, is the one where he shows a "trainee" movie used for American soldiers in order to show what should happen in case they are abandoned in the jungle. .with all the equipment they could possibly have, including a knife, a flare and a very fast helicopter (and this is subject to a hilarious work of dubbing aloud). <br /> <br /> Even moments of laughter only remind us of moments of absurdity in times of absolute crisis and an impossibility to really imagine what it is to be alone on a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do everything to keep this person as a form of guarantee in time of war. Dieter, in addition to knowing that flying and planes is the only way of life he would ever want to have (and Herzog ends the film on a somberly dark elegiac note, where he flies over a large field of planes), knows what it is. must survive at all costs. But also, as in many movies shot by the protagonists of Herzog, there is an almost unalterable spirit that will linger if you are strong enough, even through horrific moments (the fate of Dunae) and problems until the rescue in the helicopter (is it American or a spy, they ask the helicopter). Dieter is a man of heart, and he pays Herzog a fantastic, tragic, creative, well-deserved, perhaps too short tribute to his life. And of course, that pushes me even more for the upcoming dramatization Rescue Dawn.
