In this early work on Fulci, the director shows his most popular side as well as a talent for convincing storytelling and a more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally, I think he has been decried unfairly throughout his career as a gore esthete. It's a pretty skilful procedure and surprised me with its text-rich narrative that shows its mistrust for the small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as for the twisted ideals of the Catholic Church. , the last of which seemed to have cut The film was on its knees at the time of its release and could have given the director another direction so early. The lack of comparative gore in the film shows a more urgent and psychological imperative for the movie in its dominant "mystery", but the gore and puppet it uses are used wisely here, especially in the scene where a murderer falsely accused is insane lynched by a crowd of men in a cemetery and left for dead in a show of vile and old vigilance, cleverly choreographed on modern tunes taken from a diegetic radio. <br /> <br /> Another example is the final scene (which is really impressive) in which a priest of striking beauty falls from a cliff and the puppet used is clearly shown in a close-up that accentuates his demonic appearance and its obvious ugliness. Curiously, considering his later works, Fulci also invokes the idea of ​​modernity seized in the hamlet that retains its anachronistic superstitions and ignorance, while the idea of ​​black magic is just that, a picturesque idea of ​​supernatural evil who never ends up manifesting voodoo dolls by making her witch nothing more than a disturbed woman. Another thing that pleased me was that he added to these strata of characters by transforming a bourgeois city dweller into an ambiguous figure: is she the corrupter whom the priest fears for his protection and perhaps more revealing for him? even? This giallo lends itself well to becoming one of Fulci's most personal and substantial films, in that we actually receive a fair influx of ideas.
