From the golden period of British films, this has my vote for one of the funniest of all times. Presented yesterday to my Film Society in front of a delighted public, I was surprised to see how much the comedy lasted (filmed in 1950!). This is really due to the expert timing and inimitable play of two of the best actors that Britain has produced: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Adapted from a play by John Dighton, this farce is strongly managed by director Frank Launder. The plot is simple: a ministry mistake places a girls 'school in a boys' school. I will always laugh when I think of this movie.
