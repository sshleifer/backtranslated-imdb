Director and co-writer Alejandro Amenabar has not made it easy for viewers, a story that is a little too long but very disturbing, based on the fight of a Spanish man who is looking for assisted suicide. "Mar Adentro" ("The Sea Inside") is captivating and its impact far exceeds the time spent at the theater. <br /> <br /> The award-winning Canadian film "The Barbarian Invasions" has seen a family accompanied by a coterie of devoted friends addressing the wish of a beloved, though irascible, man to end his days. In this film, the center of attention suffered from a progressive incurable cancer and its descent into a terminal phase was rapid. Even though the scenes were moving, death was inevitable - the question was how to do it gently with a solicited intervention. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly played by Javier Bardem) is a different story. For more than two decades, he was quadriplegic because of a diving accident. (Very sharp viewers can detect a terrible irony as to why he ended up in this state because of his unsuspecting plunge.) Formerly a world traveler and lover of beautiful women, he is now trapped in a motionless body His needs are fulfilled by a truly devoted family who willingly gives up much of his intimacy and time to nurture his beloved relationship. <br /> <br /> Rosa (Lola Duenas), single mother of two little boys, enters the Sampedro home out of what could have been the mere curiosity to learn the fate of the paralyzed man, but she becomes both a central emotional support element for Ramon, as well as a fun but sometimes aggravating presence. A nice performance of Duenas. <br /> <br /> The problem, of course, is that Sampedro is not sick in the normal sense of the word. He could well live for decades more with proper care. Thus, his soft but persistent desire to end his life with "dignity" creates a moral dilemma for friends and family who, unsurprisingly, react from different ethical and religious perspectives. <br /> <br /> Ramon is the quad poster of a group dedicated to the evolution of Spanish laws on assisted suicide. "Death with Dignity" is their motto. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who uses Julia's volunteer lawyer (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health problems that carry an indefinite but catastrophic prognosis. Happily married to a devoted wife, she is emotionally related to her client. <br /> <br /> What follows is an extremely sensitive game of values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and his wife, their technophile teenage son, and not the intellectual Ramon, and his old father who can not help but cry on the cataclysmic descent of his son in absolute disarray. <br /> <br /> Morality and the right issues are tackled through excellent actors and short vignettes, including a courtroom scene in which the formalism triumphs over any judicial interpretation that may take into account the feelings and views of Ramon. It may be Spain, but the problems are still relevant in most countries, including the United States. <br /> <br /> The debate between Ramon and a Jesuit priest who gives a lecture on the first floor is particularly amusing. tetraplegic, but whose hidden dogma disguises the absence of soul. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mabel Rivera, Ramon's sister-in-law, Manuela, for her authentic and heartbreaking portrayal of a strong woman who holds the family together. And the same compliment applies perfectly to Belen Rueda, Julia, who goes from an objective lawyer to a close friend of a woman who is heading for a dark destiny. <br /> <br /> The director imposes no value judgment allowing each character his feelings effectively and sometimes emotionally. Like "Dead Man Walking", this film can support any vision of its deadly subject. <br /> <br /> Nobody can stop a person from committing suicide if determined, but the universal tragedy of the world Ramon is that without assistance, life in a body where only the heart beats and that the head can move is a sentence that no court could pronounce on the most depraved of criminals. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is well adapted to the history and the superb scenes Galician contrast with the limited views that Ramon lived formerly in the whole world since its special bed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
