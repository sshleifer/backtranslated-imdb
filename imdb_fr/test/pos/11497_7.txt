Jolene (Heather Graham) operates a nightclub in New York and lives with her husband, Carl (Luke Wilson), a photographer. After about 500 days of marriage, Jolene returns home to find a note from Carl indicating that he needs "some space" ... and a bouquet of daisies, his favorite flower. Jo quickly places the daisies in the blender and presses the button. Shortly after, she goes on a trip to find Carl somewhere in the west because, after all, she is "engaged" for Carl. However, when she eventually finds him in Texas, Jo camps near his home, at first, hoping to find clues about his decision to leave. She meets a beautiful sculptor-neighbor (Goran, he can not spell his name!) But Jo discourages his attraction to her. When she learns that Carl might have a new girlfriend, she decides to consult a Mexican-American mystic (Alfonso Arau). Jo is engaged but does that mean something to Carl? It's a very imaginative and humorous look at the wedding vow. His original script and offbeat style are downright contagious. Graham is just great as a helpless woman who has trouble letting go. Wilson does not give his best performance but suits as a mixed husband. The rest of the cast is pretty cool, though, with Goran, the gorgeous, as wonderful as the sexy neighbor. The landscape in New York and Texas is very beautiful and the costumes are fresh and fun. If you like romantic comedies AND independent movies, this one is custom-made for you. He is heading for a different rhythm that is the most attractive but remains in the category of ultimate happy end.
