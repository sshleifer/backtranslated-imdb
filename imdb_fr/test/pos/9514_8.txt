In fact, I caught an advertisement for JAPAN SINKS in a Japanese magazine last year and wondered what it was until I saw the movie trailer. It was then that I remembered that I had seen the English translation of Sakyo Komatsu's novel a few years ago. I got it, and it was pretty good, just as realistic as it was chilling. This is enough to ensure that the reader has no news of earthquakes in Japan. <br /> <br /> Now, I read the book and saw the 2006 version of the film (the first film was released in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was pretty good, although there are major changes from the novel to the movie (but that's understandable). The story is simple: a major tectonic change will drag Japan into collapse in one year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are shaking the country as frenetic efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. A scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the country and save what's left of the landmass, but can it be implemented on time? I saw JAPAN SINKS at Otakon in 2007 and, despite some problems I encountered - it took a little too long, and some of the character's moments were a bit too dark - I was blown away, though. The whole concept of a whole nation sinking into the sea had become terribly real and its effects were some of the best I've ever seen, rivaling everything Hollywood has done. The film also does not favoritism with the main characters, some not going to the end credits. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was surprised by some of the negative comments made about this movie. Difference of opinion, I suppose. Personally, I liked it. And I read the original book.
