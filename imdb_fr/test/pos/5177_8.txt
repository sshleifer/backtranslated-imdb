Living just down the road from Georgetown, Co ... I remember this movie well and thought it was great! The story seems to be something that John would do even in real life, but there is something I will always remember most about the movie. For those of you who do not live in Denver ... every Christmas, the city of Denver in Colorado County offers a magnificent collection of lights and decorations at the Civic Center in downtown Denver. Well ... as happened when shooting this movie, a Nativity scene was needed. So ... it was borrowed from the Civic Center display ... with permission, by the way! Someone had forgotten to advise the powers in place, and that would have been stolen! Frantic search began with law enforcement for a few days. Finally, someone spoke and remembered to have lent it to the Georgetown film crew! It has been returned and put back in its place! In fact, it was not really in the movie ... you can hardly see it during the Christmas show with the kids. It still created a disturbance ...
