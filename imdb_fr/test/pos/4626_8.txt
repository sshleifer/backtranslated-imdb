2:37 admirably succeeds in showing us what Australian teenagers feel and do not say. These are the stories of real kids and I think we would be naive to think otherwise. The only new thing that 2:37 really brings us is an Australian point of view. We often watch American children in trouble, but often fail to connect the same problems to our own teenagers. Executed with a clever and clever cinematography, I nevertheless found (after the immediate recognition of the final song disappointing) that the musical direction lacked sophistication. I congratulate the fabulous cast of this movie. These are regular looking Australian children who invite a lot of sympathy because of this. This film reminded me why sometimes, high school was bad, and unless you are disgusting or you like to go with heat and fuzzies, go see 2:37.
