This film is my family's favorite Christmas film because it's a beautiful picture of what Christmas really is. These days, living in a big city that I hate, I like to watch movies about life that I have always dreamed of having. The city in which this film is shot is my dream come true for the life I have always wanted and the true sense of community that has been lost in today's society. I do not really feel the true spirit of Christmas, but watching this movie helps to find that feeling. My family filmed this movie a long time ago on television and now our copy is worn out. I would like to buy some copies on DVD for my family and me. If someone can tell me where I can buy copies, please just post the info. here and I will continue to check. Thank you.
