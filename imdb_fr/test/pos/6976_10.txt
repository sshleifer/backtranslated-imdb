In some scenes of Rain People, the precursor of Francis Ford Coppola at its peak in the seventies, the situation is similar to that of the 1969 Easy Rider, but not exactly in the same frame of reference. Here we have a tragedy about people disconnected from society, alienated in some ways by the choices or limits imposed by one way or another. This is one of those rare original dramas where some scenes are completely new. Even with such a low budget and a very free attitude towards the shooting of the film, Coppola is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and the incurved and unexpected degrees of a relative character. to the helplessness of another, or vice versa, or both. And, as one might be tempted to see how this is really the architecture of 1960s suburban life, there is this loophole of the film mentioned above, but of a more concrete, almost timeless quality, with the drama and the underlying issues. . In a sense, if Bergman were on the road as a quasi-guerrilla filmmaker to get the strange truths of everyday life, this might be the case. <br /> <br /> But with all that is very direct and sometimes self-aware photography (even if sometimes with a more documentary approach, similar to its indeterminable characters), the actors are all set up. Shirley Knight, an actress I do not know too well, plays a complex and divergent role as a pregnant woman who runs away in a sort of existentialist enigma about what life has to offer. There are times when she plays an awesome role and one of my favorites (if not my favorite) is when she phones the phone for the first time. A scene so tense at both ends, and in every little gesture and inflection of a word, one speaks with so little. It's amazing in a way that reflects the others in Coppola's films. Then comes the character of 'killer' played by James Caan. It is also a dangerous character to take, because it is a mixture of childish puzzlement and fun with marked memories. Think of Forrest Gump if he did not manage to beat football and the spirit. It's one of the best, being the most minimalist - for a guy who usually plays tough guys in movies, here's one who's also part of the knot of Knight's story and character. Robert Duvall is also very good in a cop role as a policeman with a hard side and a damned past; It's a bit of an early sample of other characters with whom he would play later in his career. <br /> <br /> The characters, and what Coppola may run into being worried about, are really what makes up the film, whatever the story is, it's definitely not resolved in the usual way that you could think or wait. The last ten minutes are like those of Coppola, where the specific tragedies of all parties are diminished by the emotional and psychological implications that it will leave if the principles are amplified to sublime and sad. This is, for his time, courageous from what tries to be represented (in freedom as well as in defects and ambiguities) in the subject. And the style of the photo adds a fragmented view to the set with fast, graphic and stand-alone flashbacks, contrasting with the longer shots of some crucial scenes. It is a road movie of his time, but it also has much more work than under another filmmaker less likely to take the nature of these excluded characters. One of the best films of 1969.
