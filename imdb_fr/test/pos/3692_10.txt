My husband and I both loved this movie. At first, my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got to sit in this one. But after a few key scenes, he is totally sucked up and in the end he is convinced that this is one of the best movies. Kathleen Bates has never been so wonderfully adorable and the rest of the cast is just fantastic. Thank you for this beautiful movie.
