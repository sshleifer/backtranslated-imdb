My God, it was a fantastic movie. Whenever we look at this we take to another place of "WOW". Rhett and Scarlett were brilliantly interpreted by Joanne and Timothy. They did a fantastic job revising the roles of our two favorite heroes. Everyone! It is to see absolutely ..... Do not deprive of this film. If you liked Gone With The Wind, you will love this mini series. Come on Rhett !!! Go Scarllett !!!
