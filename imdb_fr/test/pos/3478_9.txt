When I was 10 years old (currently 14 years old), I swore never to see a movie that, I knew, would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago, I had been pretty successful, except for Shakespere for English classes ... etc ... I was always looking at things that ended happily. But then, I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, who was cute, not good but fun enough to watch. After seeing this a few times in the last two or three years since I first saw it, I started to like it, especially music. So I did a search on her and I found IMDb ... I saw "Inside I'm Dancing" and I assumed she shot another film about dance. It's later during an image search (from Rory, looking for a poster from Gilmore Girls for Locker). I retrieved an image of that film ... Then I looked for a trailer, I found the trailer and when I saw Rory say "you have the future" I remembered my wish and I realized that it would not be a good movie for me. But it stayed in my mind until we were at the video store and as it was $ 5, so I bought myself to buy it. After seeing it, I just wanted to get out of my head because it was so sad. I was still not going to get close to it until I had cerebral palsy as a word of vocabulary. Then I just had to see him again and this time, all I did was laugh, even in the saddest parts, I did not feel depressed anymore because I realized that, overall, this movie was happy and inspiring. .. I love it and it's now my favorites, I'm sure this is the worst comment you've ever read. But watch the movie is worth it.
