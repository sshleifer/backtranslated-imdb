I too saw this movie when it came out. I was a teenager at the time and I saw her with my girlfriend who later became my wife. I remember the film made me feel that it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if my memory is good. The boy was a bit strong, but the character of the girl was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and it could have been the intro of the first time with my girlfriend then. I have not seen the movie since and wonder why it was abandoned. I would like to look again to see if it was as good as I can remember. Elton John's soundtrack was excellent.
