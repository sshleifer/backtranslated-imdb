The numbers do not lie, 109 people voted for this film. That says a lot about one of the most intuitive comedians of the late 20th century. And for those of you who know Bill Hicks' work, if he was alive today, imagine what he would have to say about the young president of his home country? That his short career remains unrecognized is a sad situation and this film, or rather these two films, explains why. First of all, you see how much his talent was evident from the beginning, over and over, those who knew Bill Hicks always say he's not only funny, he's also unique. The film also shows how much the quality of its material was too difficult for many players in the entertainment industry. His drinking has also contributed to his career problems, but this is less evident in this film. And then the second film is a complete performance. If you've never seen or heard Bill Hicks, this is a wonderful introduction to the person and his dark but smart humor. Especially because the subjects are now almost 14 years old, but remain ironically up to date, as evidenced by the fact that many events took place under the first President Bush. <br /> <br /> Watching them together - first the biography, then the performance - makes you aware of all the talent of this young man, the speed with which his life has passed and the fact that the media Americans can sometimes play the role of great homogenizer. Let's make sure that nothing is too provocative, that nothing is too interesting And the result? Well, as the man himself said, go sleep in America, your government is in control ........... During his lifetime, at least in Britain, this artist was recognized for his talent and was doing well. Eleven years after his death, 109 people at IMDb can say something about the film. After seeing both of them, I hope you'll understand why more people should listen to Bill Hicks.
