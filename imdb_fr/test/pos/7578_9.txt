I enjoyed two of the three films from the trilogy "Sarah, Plain & Tall". This final of the three was undoubtedly one of the "good ones." <br /> <br /> The story is simple but well told. The only mediocre performance was that of one of the children. It was interesting to see how the kids had grown since that first movie. <br /> <br /> Of the three, this first "Sarah" was the best - filmed with a beautiful cinematography. This movie did not have that, but it was the best story. There were sentimental moments really in tears and a beautiful ending. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
