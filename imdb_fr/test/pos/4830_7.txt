This is without a doubt the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without a doubt the best of the festival. I went in this movie with little or no expectation after learning that the director was responsible for the vampire movie The Forsaken. and I left pleasantly surprised. The film stars Lori Meet with In Crowd, a young mother whose husband has just died. She settles in an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters, next to a mine that houses children overworked during the day. Unfortunately for them, the children come back with a revenge killing and devouring everyone in their path. The film works on several levels. It's well done, full of suspense, it has points of good cinematography and performances capable of Compton in particular. The atmosphere is spooky but slightly disappointing, the score is correct and the makeup effects gloomy and simplistic. The film keeps a disturbing and troubling tone and the children themselves with pale skin, torn lips and hollow eyes are rather scary and relentless. The film is original and inventive without being too artistic or complicated. I do not see this film go out a lot without some editing and a slight adjustment. But they definitely have a good product in their hands and should continue some sort of theatrical distribution. However, the theater in which I saw it was horrible. The sound was horribly spoiled, which in my opinion, dropped dramatically and the film stopped in the center, because they could not center it on the screen, which somewhat tarnished the atmosphere. Overall, this is perhaps the most satisfying horror film, perhaps because it was the least expected, but it was a welcome addition to genre films.
