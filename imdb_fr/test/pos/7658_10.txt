Latcho Drom is a film study of Gypsy music from several countries. It's touching, sad and happy. Most segments seem to be completely deprived, not apprehended. The music, which ranges from the sensual flamenco music of the Spanish gypsies to the melancholy music of the gypsies of Central Europe, is exquisite. If you like Gypsy music, you will find that Latcho Drom is absolutely beautiful. <br /> <br />
