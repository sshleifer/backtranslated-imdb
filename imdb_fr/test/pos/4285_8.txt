Another performance of Tom Wilkinson punctuates "Separate Lies", a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, this is the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning, where the husband (Wilkinson) thinks he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident occurred near their home the night they organized a party with the police. It was a hit and run that killed the wife of their husband Maggie's Bassett. James begins to mistrust a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett), when he sees damage to his car. He confronts Bule, who admits to having done so and promises to surrender to the police the next day. When James arrives home, Ann is upset to do such a thing and says she was driving the car. Of course, so James is not in such a hurry to rush to the police. She suggests they call Bule and tell him their decision. "Oh, f___ Bule," James said. "Well, that's just it," said Ann. "I'm crazy about Bule." The devastation of James is only the beginning of this well-designed drama. Without giving the plot, it's a good example of how gender change is changing a story. Example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown. She has life in prison. What if the father did it? The chair. You would be surprised how many times the result would be different. The same is true here: if James had the business and the following activities, viewers might have a different opinion of the story. If Ann were in James' place, it would be amazing. At this moment, it's terribly sad. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blinded by the woman he adores, and Emily Watson does a fine job as Ann, who, once freed from her lies - her involvement in accident and happy marriage - know what to do. Rupert Everett as a Bule is very effective - indolent, pretentious and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their relationships with each other, and no one is quite good or quite bad. <br /> <br /> There are separate lies - James that his marriage is happy, Ann is as stated above - and there is a unified lie - the accident, about which all parties are silent. It's enough for Ann that Maggie knows. In the end, all must face the distinct lies that lie alone has discovered. <br /> <br /> A brilliant film.
