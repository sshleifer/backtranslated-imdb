This movie was great! Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. Both of them look good together and they got away with it.Tasha Smith was so funny as a cousin and she could not stay out of her business. Essence stood up to her daughter when she needed her. Aloma was kind and played with a dear grandmother, she really reminded me of my grandmother. Oh, I can not forget the stripper, he was so found, and I did not know if I had to cover my eyes or smile while watching him reveal his sex appeal on the big screen.Damn! he was well! Tangi looked flawless and sexy, and she's gone up a notch since Felicity. On all the movie had a lot "A" List Actors and Actress. It was funny, sexy, crazy, touching, affectionate, emotional and wonderful. This film is to see absolutely! Go on DVD now if you do not have it!
