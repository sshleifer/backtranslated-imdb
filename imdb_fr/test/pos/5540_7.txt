Michelle Pfeiffer ideally embodies the frustrated cursed widow of this colorful black comedy. Matthew Modine plays an awkward FBI agent who praised him. Dean Stockwell steals the show as the big shooter who continues to harass Pfeiffer; Mercedes Ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife. We are all in the 1980s, but that only adds to the pleasure. A nice little movie, but not for all tastes.
