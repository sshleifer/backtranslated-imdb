I watched this movie when it was released. Being very young and not too much at the movies, it was one of the most fascinating filmmaking experiences I've ever experienced and it really left a mark on me. At first, I did not quite understand well failed to do the necessary correlations between past and present when the film presents them to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Many years after watching for the first time, I managed to watch it again and that's when I fell in love with "The English Patient" so touched me and that he has become for me the best film of all time. <br /> <br /> Anthony Minghella made an absolutely breathtaking film. All places are amazing and he succeeds thanks to his camera creating incredible emotions inside you. <br /> <br /> Of course, the music of the movie is so much of the emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it. <br /> <br /> But personally, the best thing was Ralph Fiennes' fragile performance is a masterpiece. He plays so well the man who falls in love slowly but deeply with Katherine Clifton, opens her hearts and plunges into this forbidden affair. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking scene for me will always be that Almasy carries the victim into the swimmers' cave and wears the thimble he bought. She says, "I have always worn it. I've always loved you "and at that moment, he starts to cry with such pain flowing from within. <br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserves the Oscar she won. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a movie that anyone claiming to be movie lover should watch in his movie lives.
