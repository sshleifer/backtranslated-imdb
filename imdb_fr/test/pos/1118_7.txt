Walter Matthau can always improve a mediocre film, and this film proves it. He achieves a very realistic performance as a small horse trainer and single father, without having to smear sugar in both roles. <br /> <br /> It can be, in turn, the sweet and throbbing heart, then iron to his boys, and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training (we see that he does not want his young race horse to be overworked and injured in small races, but he seems to want to risk his horse his life when he enters the big moment). <br /> <br /> This is one of Matthau's wonderful shows, and I highly recommend it.
