I just saw this movie in preview and I can only recommend to watch it. It was about 90 minutes and when it was over, I felt it could last for hours. The stories of the protagonists are so realistic and you really feel at home. The film is essentially dialogues but I did not get bored for a minute. 18 people of very different characters and each of them played so well. I had to laugh, felt uncomfortable, I was sad and still felt happiness. Overall, it's a film that shows the different types of people in our society, how they communicate and how love has changed and today is treated as an economic affair. Dating becomes something that sounds like an audition. Everyone loved it. So please watch if there is a possibility. You'll love it!
