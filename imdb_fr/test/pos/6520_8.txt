Dan Dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance as a great Dizzy Dean. His manipulation of the character is very faithful to reality and reflects the flavor of Dean's past and his limited education. The film is of course centered on Dizzy Deans, famous for his success and his sudden journey to the sideline with an injury he chose to ignore, much to his regret. His wife is beautifully portrayed by Joanna Dru who gives a very down-to-earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the baseball player who reached a "dizzying height" so quickly. The portrait of Dizzy's late career as a sportsman is honest and flawless, reflecting his troubles due to his poor education and his colorful language, whether broadcast or broadcast. Dizzy was quite a character and Daily breathed an admirable life into his story. If you liked this film, I recommend the comedy "Kid from Left Field" (1953) in which Daily plays a phantasmagorical baseball player idolized by his young son (Billy Chapin). Daily raises a baseball player quite satisfactorily. I highly recommend Pride of St. Louis to baseball fans around the world.
