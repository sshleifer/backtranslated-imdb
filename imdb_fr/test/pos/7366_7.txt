Good (not great) little horror movie with a high creep factor (not to be confused with a movie of the same name from 1991, or the most recent (2001), Campfire STORIES). The central story of stranded teenagers telling stories of ghosts around a campfire in spooky woods leads well and connects the different stories that make up the bulk of the film (to watch for Ron Livingston's lively and sexy segment (" Honeymoon")). A solid action game and some really "scary" moments make it a cooler above average. Good example of interesting scenario, associated with a set of quality set producing a whole superior to the sum of its parts. The "surprise" end of the main story adds a beautiful scary twist, though some may see it coming. The film is not available on DVD, but can be found on VHS.
