For once, a sequel to "The Karate Kid" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did a great job playing Orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, who plays Mr. Miyagi, worked with Julie in a very different way than Daniel. Daniel and Julie both supported karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most enraged person that Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament in which to participate. And there will also be humor in this film. I liked the part where, when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to see her and saw her change her clothes during the process. It was very funny! And the classic scene "Wax on, Wax off" was also different. It was funny when Miyagi said to Julie: "Oh, oh, missed spot". The whole in Boston was far from California. The militant group of this group resembled the "Cobra Kai" of Boston. And Michael Ironside's Colonel Dugan was not John Kreese. Her group practically abandoned her when Julie kicked her seriously. They all paid the price by blowing up this classic Oldsmoblie. What cowardly act. At least they will find the redemption of Dugan's poison. This karate child establishes some morals, unlike the last three, which spoke of "honor" and "respect". Hilary Swank is extremely hot in all the movies and everything she does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!
