As an American fan of the League of Gentlemen, I had to wait months to see this movie when it was released on DVD, but it was well worth the wait (atrocious). "Apocalypse" is fantastic - funny, bizarre, clever as hell, full of jokes and cryptic references to the TV series; basically all you expect from gentlemen. <br /> <br /> The plot has already been discussed in other magazines, so I will not bother to re-crown it, although I will say that the first time I read it little hesitant. Obviously, this device - fictional characters entering the real world to confront their creators - has already been used, notably in the underrated books of Wes Craven's "New Nightmare" and in Stephen King's "Dark Tower" (where King was himself a character). The gentlemen had fun breaking the fourth wall and even adding a new element: a second fictional world ("them days"). Soon, the three realities merged and the result is exhilarating: Geoff Tipps is ennobled in the Middle Ages (and tries to woo Queen Victoria Wood); Royston Vasey's real League of Gentlemen, confronted by characters such as Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner summons a homunculus outside the Bernice church. I heard that some people did not like the "King's Evil" plot, but I found it hilarious, especially the character of Reece (who seemed to channel Judith the "Witch" of the third series). <br /> <br /> Speaking of the characters, I was relieved to find that although Hilary Briss, Geoff and Herr Lipp are firmly anchored in the heart of the film, other more familiar characters have been rewarded. At first, Bernice's confessional was hilarious, reminiscent of the faster, more sketch-oriented feel of the first series. Pauline and Mickey have cameos (no Ross so strange), although I would have loved to have seen more of Mrs. Campbell-Jones. Papa Lazarou is represented, as are Tubbs and Edward. All three are used sparingly, giving their meager screen time an almost magical feel (and what on earth did Daddy hack into, like an obscene ball of hair? of fatty pubic hair "). <Br/> <br /> The movie looks amazing, but then, what's up? The music, as always, is breathtaking. I was delighted to hear Joby Talbot's new interpretations of theme music and his slight reworking of the magnificent and majestic play that wraps up the Apocalypse and the last episode of the third series. <br /> <br /> I Some minor complaints - it would have been nice to see more of the old Royston Vasey, well known, and I felt that the creatures in stop-motion (beautiful, by the way) were a little underused. The film's budget can, however, justify both of these problems, so that they are understandable. Still, even though I loved Bernice's new church, it would have been cool to see the final battle on Main Street (the original Gentlemen's vision, according to the commentary). <br /> <br /> Overall, "Apocalypse" is amazing, especially if you're a fan of the show. I can not recommend it strongly enough. 10/10.
