I first saw this movie in 1959 at the Sydney Hoyts Double Bay Theater at the age of fifteen. I loved it then and still do. The overall cast is excellent - at that time the actors acted "naturally" and you "feel" for them in their respective roles. A "glossy" movie of the period - relationships still relevant to today's world, but now that the sexes are at the same level, women would not allow or should not allow the type of treatment posted in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it's a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January 2005. The scenes of pity were cut before the release - even at two o'clock, you want more! I signed up for Amazon for the DVD (they now have a special page). It will be great to see this movie in CinemaScope after forty-six years of panning. Twentieth Century Fox, take a closer look at your CinemaScope 50s DVD cataloguers - there's a big market. I'm waiting for the arrival of the United States in March 2004 Vanity Fair Special article on the film, which would have about fifteen pages with many photos on the set. Cheers.
