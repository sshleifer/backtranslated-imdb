Even if you are not a "theater person", I highly recommend you to see this. Based on a play of the same name by Christopher Bond (who herself was inspired by an old London legend), Sondheim did a remarkable job of bringing it to the musical theater scene. The score is just incredible - by far the best in Sondheim, and probably one of the best scores written for a musical. The show was very well interpreted, my only complaint concerns the portrait of Johanna by Betsy Joscelyn. It's good, you know, and she's a very versatile actress, but she just does not sing very well "Greenfinch and Linnet Bird". But other than that, everything is phenomenal - Angela Lansbury * has been Mrs. Lovette's role, and she's doing it so well. George Hearn replaced Len Cariou in the main role and Ken Jennings gave an excellent performance as Tobias. The end will give you chills. The best ratings for a wonderful show.
