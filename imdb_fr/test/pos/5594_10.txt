Yuck! and we all thought that Joan Crawford was the most expensive mom horror ... well Laura Hope Crewes in the role of Mom in this scathing movie of 4 characters book (and cops) the merchandise in this mom's cracker margle mangle ..... THE SILVER CORD is a truly sensational pre-code drama of RKO made in 1932, released in 1933 from a play of 1929. Every verbal exchange between the wife of a son (IreneDunne) and the fiance of the other is amazing, frank and honest, as these two youngest girls go to war. Joel MacCrea and his "beautiful" son / son paid by the delicate and handsome actor Eric Linden, 25 years old. I think this film was presented to many praiseworthy listeners in big theaters in 1933 and even offered viewers, in 2005, a very fruity melodrama animated by a crackling dialogue that is not afraid to call Mother exactly as she did. is. This film would have been impossible to achieve after the censorship code came into effect after 1934. More comments from viewers on IMDb support my reaction and you will find almost everyone lucky enough to see (and save) THE SILVER CORD will suit that it's unforgettable and spicy script in a superbly produced movie. It would have looked like the VIRGINIA WOLF of 1932. Laura Hope Crewes had to embrace RKO's sound stage for that unforgettable role ... even more than her fluffy turn in GWTW. Irene Dunne is still beautiful, casual and believable. She is still fighting for her husband and it is worth it to see The Divorc√©e created in 1929 to accompany THE SILVER CORD. Joel MaCrea is certainly in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in the beautiful and pretty stakes. I had never seen Eric Linden play an acting role before (he played the role of a leg amputee in the horror scene of a hospital in GWTW) and he is here striking and young with an excellent role as Robert, the youngest and most sensitive son. Some verbal whiskers addressed to him would not go beyond the Code office if they were made later. This is a very good movie, and if the viewer forgets a few crunches of his time and sets up for an unparalleled training match for a 1932 film, you will be well rewarded. At first, I thought Mother's melodrama was dated until I realized that the screenplay was excellent and that the viewer was making fun of her as if she were a weak old lady ... NO. .... but the other two women of this power station do not play film either, hence the fantastic dialogue of reply. This liner seen in the first reel is THE LEVIATHAN, the monster that the United States won to the Germans during the 1st World War. It was so huge and so heavy that the crews were nervous wrecks trying to fight him on the Atlantic. He is infamous for plowing the first wave of a storm in a storm and crossing the ridge at such an angle that the spine at the bottom cracks and the ship splits vertically between the funnels. He limped to the port side with clattering steel panels and flashing rivet holes ... and the crew and passengers mentally broken. He was scuttled in 1935 after being cursed and plagued by mechanical horror problems all his life. Not such a price of war after all. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue in THE SILVER CORD is quite exciting for one night: for example: "Mother, the doctor said there was nothing wrong, he said it would take a stick of dynamite to kill you. " Whammo!
