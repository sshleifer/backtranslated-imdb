It took a film loaned to Columbia for Gene Kelly's MGM studio to realize his creative talent and give him a bit of control over what he did in his own movies. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for GIs and their pin-up fantasies during World War II. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn, where Rita is a star dancer and Phil Silvers the comic. Of course, Kelly is sabotaging a little there. <br /> <br /> Hayworth catches the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother. In some flashback sequences from the gas age, Hayworth also plays his own grandmother, Jess Barker playing the young Kruger. You may remember that Jess Barker was the husband of Susan Hayward, the other legendary redhead on screen. <br /> <br /> Broadway producer Lee Broadman is also attracted to Hayward, but nostalgia does not interest him. He wants it for his magazine Ziegfeld Follies and the biggest number of Cover Girl is the title track of the film. It's done well in Follies style. <br /> <br /> Hayworth also sings A Sure Thing in an issue of the gaslight era and in the only song of the series not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, Hayworth also makes English Music Hall number Poor John. When I say singing, everyone knows that Rita is talking. Nan Wynn sings here. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit of the series is Long Ago and Far Away, presented by Gene Kelly. It was one of the greatest successes of the era of the Second World War and one of the biggest sellers ever written by Jerome Kern. It is actually the favorite of one of my aunts who, with my uncle, will celebrate 60 years of marriage in September. Long Ago and Far Away were nominated for Best Song, but lost against Swinging on a Star. <br /> <br /> What really sets Cover Girl apart and makes it a defining film for Gene Kelly are the two-digit test and the Alter Ego number. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer refused at MGM, to give Kelly creative control over his own material. Kelly later stated that the alter ego number was one of the most difficult things he had ever attempted in his career. He dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and complex. <br /> <br /> In fact, after another loan movie, Christmas Holiday at Universal, Louis B. Mayer had never lent Gene Kelly to MGM. And he has now taken control of his creativity. <br /> <br /> With this dazzling technicolor cinematography, Rita's red hair and Gene Kelly's boundless creativity, Cover Girl was and remains a classic and will be forever.
