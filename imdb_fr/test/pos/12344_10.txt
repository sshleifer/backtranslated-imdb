I thought One Dark Night was great! It deserves a 10! Regarding a statement made by a user, the dead were actually zombies in this movie. A dead person brought to life is a zombie, regardless of the method or reason why / to be brought back to life. The "zombies" of this movie are used to scare girls, not to feed on them, like traditional zombies. This film is a real star among the horror movies of the 80s. The score and atmosphere are quite strange and the audience is suspended throughout the scenes of the mausoleum. The acting is really convincing, with real expressions of horror at the sight of the undead. Although I enjoy all zombie movies, this film is a refreshing change from the typical "flesh-eating zombie" movie.
