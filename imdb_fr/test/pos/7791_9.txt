The best part of this movie is that you can watch it again and again - do not just watch it. I have watched this movie at least 10 times in the last 12 years and it makes me laugh as if I was watching it for the first time. I like good comics like the Orgazmo, Cheech n chong, Monty Python and many others, but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite films. Some of them recently in Hindi are Golmaal, Munnabhai series and Herapheri series. So all I can say is that the Hind comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is quite different from the movies I mentioned above. This is what I call stoned comedy in Hindi and very little of what is found around 1994 in Hindi cinema.
