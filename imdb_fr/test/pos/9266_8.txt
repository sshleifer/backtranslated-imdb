This movie is so different from everything you would have seen before. It's an honest and scary story of a family's fight against a terminal illness. <br /> <br /> "The Closer She Gets" is shot in a unique style. Craig Oulette films in a very different way ... using different angles and points of view, which I find very attractive (perhaps because of his experience with photographic works). <br /> <br /> Her style gives a clear picture of what the patient herself is facing, but also what her loved ones are facing. <br /> <br /> A very sad film, but extremely interesting and unique. One, I would definitely recommend watching.
