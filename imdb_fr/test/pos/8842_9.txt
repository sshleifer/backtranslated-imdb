"The Thing" is John Carpenter's best film. Merging his talents to create tension and create shocks with decent production values, he became a perfectly crafted sci-fi / horror film. <br /> <br /> By filming in really difficult conditions, he creates an isolated and credible research base that puts in tension before anything has happened. The overall cast works well with Kurt Russell, a charismatic leader even under this whole beard. <br /> <br /> By slowly building tension with bloody horror moments (courtesy of Effects Robister, currently in charge of Freddy vs. Jason) Carpenter creates a film that has rarely been matched. Considering that it came out the same year as the ET, it could not be more different! 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> p.s. the DVD is excellent. Many extras and the best DVD reviews (with Carpenter & Russell). More remixed in Dolby Digital for even more scary sound effects.
