Without a doubt, it's the big mom of all the music videos !!! Unlike most music videos that are either mis-interpreted "dance videos" and / or broken lyrics, this has been done correctly. Jackson was co-screenwriter and proof of VH1, strongly choreographed and directed this masterpiece. In fact, you could say that Thriller is more scary than most horror movies with that last glittering eye. For me, this music video is what you judge all other music videos. You can easily see Mr.J's detrimental influence on early break-dance with the March zombie issue. Because of dance, comedy, screenplay and horror. I give it a 5 out of 5.
