Watch the story of Sweeney Todd ... The strangest, most confusing but most wonderful musical on Broadway. It's both scary, funny and moving through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score, as well as his performances. George Hearn is unrivaled in the leading role, bringing a strong voice and irreproachable imitation of the legendary demon barber, while Angela Lansbury offers comic relief as she cheerfully grinds her victims into pies. If you just enjoy it, "Sweeney Todd" is a real treat.
