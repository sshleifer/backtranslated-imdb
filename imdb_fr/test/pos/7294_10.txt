This is a very unusual film that starts with a rich guy who is given a new sports car for graduation and decides to try it in the city. A rich boy meets a poor girl at 'Mabels Diner' who is a waitress and her local boyfriend is very upset and a fight begins. There is a car chase and all sorts of problems seem to be happening and the rich boy and the poor boy end up having to do community service as ordered by the city judge. The rich boy and the poor boy simply do not get along and the rich boy ends up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy's girlfriend. There are many walks in the woods and poetry and very deep thoughts about life are mentioned. The poor girl says, "Some people go through life and never find love, I can say that I have found love and that I stick to it." You will need some paper tissues if you are sensitive, there are a lot of romantic scenes and I doubt that you will guess the end of this image. The producer and director had a good idea and finally ended a film. If you like real stories with poetry and very sensitive topics, this is your movie.
