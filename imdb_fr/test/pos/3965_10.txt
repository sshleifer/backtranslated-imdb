if I had watched this movie when I fell to the bottom, I would probably have sunk into the deepest depression of my life and I might have been desperate enough to try it, the only thing that is in the real world is stealing millions of dollars from unsuspecting people, all does not come rosy (unless you're an investment banker or an affiliated government), so how important is it? I had been fired from school after school, and it stings, so it's a brilliant subject for a film, and when you let yourself go to the imagination to let you watch this film without applying the ramifications of the real world, he can really touch someone in this situation, and let them know that they are not alone. the excessive monologue tears completely the established educational system as we know it. In fact, all I can say is that, as I am in college now, looking back where I was and watching this movie, I can really appreciate it in a way that I do not could never have otherwise. it's juvenile and contrite yes, but it's an emotional and edifying fantasy about freedom, and I can not think of a better way to end my night.
