as you can read in a lot of reviews here, it's a movie you like or hate - apparently, there's not much space for opinions between the two. For my part, I think it's a good sign. <br /> <br /> I have always enjoyed this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (for example, I have never watched Titanic and I do not plan to do it). <br /> <br /> The English Patient takes hold of this shows how different people can be when they are in an exotic environment, as opposed to when they are "at home" (Katherine), this shows to how much love can be destructive in a slow, strong and quite painful way. case, the pain of those who leave behind, how one can feel useless to move on. <br /> <br /> The photography is simply beautiful, not to mention the acting. The pace is slow but timely, and it does justice to the book, the timeline, and the depth / development of the characters. To put this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here), it would be necessary to amputate the multilayer of this film. People tend to struggle with the rhythm of movies ... as if they were in a hurry to get to work ... hey - win a life! ;-) have fun ... <br /> <br /> I give this film 4.5 out of 5.
