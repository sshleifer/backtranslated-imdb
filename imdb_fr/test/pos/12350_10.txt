One Dark Night offers a typical horror movie for teenagers with a very unique twist. The ultra-covering musical score and the gothic / claustrophobic atmosphere add a lot to this little film that keeps its promises. Meg Tilly is excellent as "Julie" and guides us through the labyrinth of the mausoleum, giving a sense of apprehension and loneliness. Other teens are as effective in their roles as Melissa Newman, the ultimate heroine of the movie. The special effects are excellent, although dated. This film is highly neglected, but it can be good so that it is never ruined by endless sequels. This film is crossed by a great black magic. once connected, you really understand and have fun. The double disc DVD is available, although the original negative could not be found to restore the movie. Maybe one day it will be located. I suppose that, in a way, the carbon particles in some parts help the film by giving it a respectability of the old school and making it more unexpected in the end when all of a sudden, the effects are numerous. <br /> <br /> A rough / alternative version with a temp version of the film that gives more explanations on the disappearance of two girls, very Poe-ish ("The Cask of Amontillado" comes to the spirit of a new way!) the tension goes into the opening of the dark crypt. I'm not sure he fell in love with the main audience, but certainly worked for me and extremely scary .... moreover, there is an interesting documentary because it gives information on what was happening at the time with the actors, the team, the director and the scriptwriter; candid material, then current logos, discussions of plans and scenes, rehearsals. Very unique that this stuff exists for a small movie at the time.
