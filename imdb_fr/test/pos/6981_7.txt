The horror and science fiction reasonably effective to the "Alien" are quite well done given its limited ambitions. Some nice special effects and well-paced action sequences correctly correct the cracks in the rather tedious dialogue. When a space plane crashes on a distant planet, the survivors soon realize that a hideous terror awaits them in the darkness of the next total eclipse.
