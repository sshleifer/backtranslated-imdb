She is the man is the funniest movie I have ever seen. I laughed so much that I cried. It was also very romantic. Channing Tatum is absolutely beautiful and can really act. It does not hurt that he has a lot of scenes without shirt either. Channing and Amanda have incredible chemistry and have been absolutely wonderful together. I love that movie. When watching, be sure to watch the last deleted scene. It was a huge mistake to cut this scene because it's one of the best scenes in the movie. I highly recommend this movie. Amanda has never been so funny. And Channing is going to be a huge star. This is just the first of many for this bright new star.
