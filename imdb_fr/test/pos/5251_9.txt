While reading some of the other comments, I must admit that some of the very rare gaps in this brilliant documentary on one of the divas of the twentieth century (with Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Mercedes de Sosa )) are justified. Because originally it was a television documentary of more than six hours devoted to his career ("ESTRANHA FORMA DE VIDA" (V) 1995/1999). Much more encompassing and with a greater understanding of the inner world of Am√°lia. As for the subtitling of his songs, I totally agree! Although music, voice and performance can be - are! - universal, there is so much poetry in the words that need to be translated. I think it was a conscious choice of producers. They targeted the 200 million Portuguese-speaking speakers in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, East Timor, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Canada, the United States, South Africa, St. Tome and Principe, Goa, Daman, Diu, Venezuela, Luxembourg, Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora in the world. As for the lady herself, she did not live up to seeing this abridged DVD version of the documentary, but she had a glimpse of "Estranha Forma de Vida". And that seems to have been to his liking. Absolutely.
