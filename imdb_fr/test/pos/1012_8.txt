Despite some really picturesque places in the east and sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film does not reach the level of similar efforts of Joe D'Amato, while remaining so trashy. The author of the original book "Emmanuelle: the joys of a woman", Emmanuelle Arsan, directed and played a rather minimal role in this film, which essentially presents a pornography highlighting a very young Annie Belle in a variety of situations strange sex. Her boyfriend, played by Al Cliver of ZOMBIE, approves her sleep and even persuades her to continue her practices even after their marriage! Orso Maria Guerrini passes as a teacher who is usually married at the same time to two women, one of whom is played by Arsan herself. Despite promising beginnings and some hilarious dialogues like "Can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I can see you better naked!", Advance the film uncompromisingly until the final less than spectacular. Just like EMANUELLE AND THE LAST CANNIBAUX of D'Amato, the main characters are all looking for a lost tribe, but do not worry, there is no violence in this film and not a lot of sex. more. Just a lot of nudity and silly dialogue. I could not help but find a little esteem for this little film, if only for the complete logic of the cornball.
