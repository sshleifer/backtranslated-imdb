The history of film-adapted television is littered with aberrations that prove almost conclusively that the tradition should never have begun. There are, however, a few successful examples, quite simply. Rising Damp would seem, at first, to be the last appropriate sitcom for the big-screen treatment as this hilarious series was based within the tiny confines of a studio to the north. Also, the writer, Eric Chappell, not being paid enough to devote time to developing a completely original screenplay, he collected a series of TV episodes and assembled them to form the body of the film. This, in itself, does not necessarily mean that the script will fail. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same thing with their screenplay for Dad's Army and it worked perfectly. Although the first episodes of Father's Army, with their steady pace and excessive conspiracy, lend themselves much better to film adaptation. The episodes of Rising Damp, however, were a case of high energy from the first scene to the climax of the shortness of breath. As a result, throughout the stories and stories, the scenes of the film become disjointed. The inevitable comparisons are another trap for the film version of a television series. In this respect, the film is derisory compared to the brilliant series of Rising Damp. Despite all this, Rising Damp the Movie manages to be entertaining and sometimes daring. It may not be surprising that the best moments occur in sequences written specifically for the film. This includes a rugby match in which Rossiter made a brilliantly timed pratfall. Indeed, while all the actors manage their roles to perfection (except for a substitute sub-standard actor for the late and awesome Beckinsale), Leonard Rossiter in Rigsby shines the most. In fact, Rising Damp should have been shot as a film for Rossiter to be eligible for an Oscar, such is the magnificence of his acting talent. Criminally, he was not even named. In the end, the film fails to match the vertiginous height of the TV series while managing to behave like a comedy in its own right with some beautifully played moments. Recommended viewing. <br /> <br /> One last thing: opening and closing music is by far the worst in the film's history.
