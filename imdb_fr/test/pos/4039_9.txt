I really enjoyed this movie. In general, I'm not one to make fairy tales or to pretend, but this film caught my attention. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time on Hallmark UK ... but then Snow Queen came ... and I loved it! I really admire Bridget Fonda in this film ... she plays the snow queen with brilliance and glamor. <br /> <br /> I will not explain the subject of the story because other people have already done so, so you do not need to repeat. <br /> <br /> I would just like to suggest that if you want to watch a fun fairytale trip ... get this movie ... but if you want to buy it and you live in the UK you might have a hard time. I bought it in South Korea brand new (English edition of course).
