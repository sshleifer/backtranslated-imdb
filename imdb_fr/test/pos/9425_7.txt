It's an excellent late-night movie! What I mean by that is that I really enjoyed playing with my VHS copy at $ 3.00 (now I have a DVD copy at $ 6.99!) Many nights just before bedtime or if I have insomnia. There is just something in this movie that makes it fun to watch during repeated viewing. This could be the pleasure that Basil Rathbone has in "The Secret Weapon" by wearing several disguises that deceive the bad guys and Holmes' assistant, Nigel Bruce (Watson), but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). It could be espionage, crack code and the theme of the Second World War. It could even be the light touch that the director uses to handle the threatening situations in which Holmes finds himself while keeping the story moving. Be that as it may, "Secret Weapon" is simply a pleasant and pleasing policeman's story that takes us back to a time when the Nazis sought dominance over the world and did so with the benefit of the comradeship between Watson and Holmes. That you agree with the patriotic speeches and the noble themes "Save the world" of this film or not (I think they are right!), I find that they only add to the flavor and the fun of this good old adventure movie that resists repeated visits. I note a nice 83/100 points.
