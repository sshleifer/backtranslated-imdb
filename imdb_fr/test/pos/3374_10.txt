Honestly, I would give this movie a solid rating of 7.5, but I clicked on 10 to try and make up for the 5 pages of 1-star foolish and unjustified reviews. It's an interesting story, the whole acting game goes from good to very good (even Mrs. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual role of bimbo grimacing here, is playing well though). The sets are perfect and the cinematography always correct. creepy. This is a beautiful piece of morality and there is no reason to explain the origin of the god / being supernatural / alien / whatever "directs the series", so I am happy that the film do not try. It's really out of place for the story, which is relatively long but quite compelling and satisfactorily summarized in the end. <br /> <br /> Before you decide that this movie is terrible (or really, nothing less than ~ 7.5), read some of the dozens of "hated" critics to a star that is bursting with spelling, lack of punctuation and capitalization, and juvenile criticism. Maybe the trailer was misleading or something - I did not see it - but some of those critics were apparently expecting Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (a reviewer compared this movie to Saw!) totally inappropriate and unrelated!) Seriously, most of these reviews read as insignificant comments. According to these "critics", this film is too confusing, but too predictable, not enough action, but too much action, too smart and too silly, explains too much but leaves too unexplained ... oh - and it's apparently a "size (sic) of time". Consider the quality and source of reviews before you take them to heart. I fear that these one-star children did not understand the expression "coefficient of altruism" and were therefore absolutely unable to understand the premise of the film (although they categorically claim that they "get it" just before to explain how confusing it was!) If you know what these two words mean, you'll have no trouble understanding (and appreciating) this movie. <br /> <br /> I would really like there to be a critical reputation system here so that I can be sure to ignore the note of all those who gave this movie 1 star forever. <br /> <br /> See for yourself and enjoy the presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral "test" and assuming the consequences. It's a good time, in my opinion.
