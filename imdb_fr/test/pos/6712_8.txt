For the guy who had the idea of ​​Lifeforce, I have one thing to say: thank you, sir! Lifeforce combines Star Trek's sci-fi pump: the big-budget cinema and the low-priced horror thrills of Phantasm, and overcomes it all with t-ts, as well as real fleshy hangers ... and the Best of all, it's actually a good movie! I'm surprised someone really justified a mainstream film that allows a hottie to appear naked on the screen for an hour and a half to producers. God bless you, everyone who participated. <br /> <br /> Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) plays the role of Colonel Carlson, US commander of an international space mission to investigate Halley's comet. Carlson's crew discovers an alien ship inside the comet and inside, three naked people in suspended animation - two guys and a very hot broad (Mathilda May). In short, they are "vampires of space" ... naked "vampires of space". They crush the crew, with the exception of Colonel Blueballs, who decided he had to let the hot girl come out of his lucite display because the part of his brain that controls his nut fluids told him that it was the right thing to do. The colonel brings the ball back to our big blue ball in an escape pod. Meanwhile, another crew of the Space Shuttle discovered his ship floating in space and brought back to London the three space coffins of the Living Dead Martians. And that's when people start to turn into pork rinds and, in general, they just start losing control too quickly. <br /> <br /> Carlson teams up with Colonel Caine (Peter Firth) of the British SAS stalking our naked cutie - who has had the trouble of sucking guys left and right. Carlson discovered that he had a mental connection with Vampira, which allowed them to find her, her ultimate goal being to smash her and destroy her, as well as the big umbrella of her friends who sucks the energy of the people that the vamps are attacking. . Will they succeed in time? SPOILER MINOR: Yes. <br /> <br /> Wow. What can I say if "Wow"? This damn movie really works. I can not believe they had real British actors like Aubrey Morris (A Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (The Sexiest Men), in this movie. All actors are good. The management is good and really shines during the last half where we see the fantastic devastation of London. Special effects are not left out either. For 1985, this film had to be the best for FX. All the effects are quite impressive and many talents are presented here in the fields of animotronics, makeup effects, lighting and very pretty space scenes embellished with good old-fashioned models and matte painting. There are even bloody and bloody images for all horror fans. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a great movie for anyone who is nostalgic of the time when popular movies on big movies were 100% made with love from start to finish. finish. The creators of the film have really made sure that all bases are covered and the end result is an incredibly fun affair that will not let you turn away, because the procedure is too good. Real solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 of 10.
