Unlike the previous poster, celluloid treatment pleased me. It looked good and made the movie all the more fun to watch. For me, it did not diminish the power of the content of the documentary. In fact, I felt that the lightness of the look allowed me to lose myself even more in the content. The previous poster was just to compare the style to a Nike ad; it really has that look. But for my tastes, it worked very well (and I'm far from being a fan of Nike ads). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is how documentary shooting should be done. I can not wait to see the next episodes of these promising filmmakers.
