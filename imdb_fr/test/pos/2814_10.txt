At first, the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag, just for Stan Lee's amusement. I was expecting nothing more than a loose and animated Barb Wire version with low production values, much like those little bullshit you see on Adult Swim for a short-term fun, but you can never take too seriously. My boy was wrong! <br /> <br /> Stripperella has even better production values ​​than Marvel Toons. The animation is very good and it looks like they took this series very seriously and strived to turn it into a professional production. <br /> <br /> The humor is good too, sexy, suggestive and suspicious. It's very similar if not exactly like the Simpson's style. You may encounter clichés and a lot of predictable humor, but it's still fun. If it worked today, I would probably see it regularly. It's amazingly one of the best toons ever made.
