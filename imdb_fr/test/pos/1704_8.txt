Three American guys are walking across Europe, challenging themselves to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and hot girls as possible, but Andy is looking for true love. He discovers it during their attempt at bungee jumping on the Eiffel Tower, when he discovers and saves breathtaking Julie Delpy, suicidal and beautiful. Her attempts to find this girl and the secret he discovers drag her along with her friends into an adventure full of activities, romance, gore and inspired humor, without ever taking herself seriously, nor striving to to be something other than a wildly entertaining entertainment 90 minutes ride. I have seen this movie a number of times and found the experience much more rewarding than the original "London", although the two films are so different that it's not fair to compare the two or even consider that as a sequel.
