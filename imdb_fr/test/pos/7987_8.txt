First of all, this movie has no story. It is obvious that there was a lot of rewriting during the production - sometimes the characters refer to an impossible timeline, probably because the chronology of the entire story has never been known to anyone on the set . <br /> <br /> says the film is a bit brilliant. Pfeiffer is amazing - and I mean unbelievable, as a Catwoman; she embodies the sexy darkness and the good / bad tendencies of the character. Walken is Walken - but even more nasty than usual. Devito is not faithful to the comics with regards to Penguin, but he is good and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keaton is underrated as a Batman. <br /> <br /> And music and style are thrills of cinema. Certainly, the 3rd act does not work. But the last two scenes are knockouts, and it's clear that Pfeiffer and Keaton were supposed to be in a trilogy that was disrupted by the perverse darkness of this film. Too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had a classical chemistry and they had acted in a third part, Joel, you know, who might not have had the chance to destroy Batman for an entire generation of moviegoers.
