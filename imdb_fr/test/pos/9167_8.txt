I think the basic idea of ​​any movie is to entertain or inform. If you want information, you are watching real life movies and historical movies. Sometimes it's the same. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Did Hitch entertain me? Yes, it's true. Ok, the formula is standard. The boy meets the girl or in this case the boys have met girls. They meet together, meet together. However, the way it happened in this film was refreshing. I particularly liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. Allegra Albert's romance was a pleasure to watch, most real men are shy when it comes to wooing the woman of their dreams and if I had Hitch's advice, I probably would have my wife under the altar two times later first comment on this movie that seemed to suggest that this movie was played safely and well had a few more laughs. I tend to disagree with the fact that there are so many laughs that you can turn into a romantic comedy without making a joke of it. Besides relationships there are serious moments. All in all, I found Hitch quite entertaining, the actors did a good job (I'll look for them in other movies) and Hitch is a movie that I'm very happy to have in my DVD collection.
