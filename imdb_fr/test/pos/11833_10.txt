I just watched this movie for the first time today and I loved it ... <br /> <br /> Yes, his story is simple, it's the sweetest love story that either, and no woman could fall in love with Callum Blue beats me ... <br /> <br /> The landscape in Italy was as you can imagine, Beautiful, the bad guys were lost in the end and for that the two lovebirds are gathered at the end, it was wonderful, but This scene where a certain Italian swept the confetti after the marriage of Eric and Wanda, perfection! <br /> <br /> Take a cup of tea and watch a fantastic movie, yes, better to have a handkerchief and be captivated, I know I was and I hope to have it very soon on DVD. All the actors played their role perfectly. It was a World War II film that you could believe it was realistic, and without going beyond reality, like in other films ...
