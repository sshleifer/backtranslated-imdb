I think this film was done as well as it could have been. With only 4 months and a budget of $ 52,000, I'm surprised it's not worse. If you do not care about CG or special effects, this movie is great. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie is not very well done (I'm sure it might have been, but you're trying to do it better in just 4 months) but the story is good and the film rather exciting. <br /> <br /> Do not trust me when I say that this film is good, I also find that the King Kong of 1933 was good. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I did not watch the complete movie either ... I might have made a quick advance of a few minutes here and there ...
