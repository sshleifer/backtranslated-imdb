Since "Harold and Maude" have not used suicide so successfully in a love story. The acting game, by a first-rate cast, is fantastic. With a well structured script, things are progressing at a pleasant pace. There are moments of dark comedy, but I would classify "My Suicidal Sweetheart" in a unique romantic comedy, with a touch of black humor. The relationship between two lovers with psychological problems is both touching and engaging. The film leads you to wonder what is a normal relationship? I highly recommend "my suicidal heart". Look for it on DVD under the title "Crazy for Love". You will not be disappointed. - MERK
