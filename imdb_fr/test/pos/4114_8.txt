Much better than it is generally credited, this version of "Lost Horizon" offers not only good music and beautiful scenery, but also breathtaking mountain photography. A special edition laser disc was released a few years ago, adding over 30 minutes of previously deleted material, additional music and many bonuses. So, why is not it on DVD ?! Hard to understand the studios sometimes. Certainly, the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, a good acting or melodious hits? Singer and dancer Bobby Van is very amusing, Michael York is a tragically appropriate villain, and seeing Sir John Gielgud dressed up as Chang may seem silly but works great on the screen. Believe me, you have to watch this movie - if you can find it!
