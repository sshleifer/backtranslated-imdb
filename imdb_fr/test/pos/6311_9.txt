Okay, I'm Italian but there are few Italian films like this one. I think the plot is very good for 3/4 of the movie but the final is too simple, too predictable. But that's the only small mistake. In my opinion, the consequences of love have excellent sequences especially at first and an excellent soundtrack. I would really like the lighting to work. The best thing about this is a very good actor. You know, if you were called Al Pacino, everyone would have talked about this performance again. But this is only a great Italian theater actor called Toni Servillo. Yes, someone tells me that this movie and this kind of performance are too slow, so boring, there are so many silences, but I think it's part of his fantastic, it's the right way to describe the love story between granddaughter of Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and the mysterious old man Toni. One of my favorite Italian movies.
