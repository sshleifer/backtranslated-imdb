Superbly adapted to the screen and extremely faithful to Mary Webb's period novel, this film is a true masterpiece. Except for Janet Mcteer, a rising star of exceptional talent, and one or two established actors, the film uses mostly unknown names. Yet the drama was all the more convincing for that. The social and personal tension is almost tangible and I felt as if the actors reacted to each other as if they would have done it in real life. I saw a commentator ask if Janet McTeer really had a cracked lips, which proves how good her description was. I saw it on TV when it was shown for the first time, recorded, and later, the tape was unfortunately lost. But it remains clear as anything in my mind. If you have a penchant for the social period, it's a must see.
