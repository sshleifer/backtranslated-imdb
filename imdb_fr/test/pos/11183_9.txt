The curse of Monkey Island has always been my favorite of the series. Vibrant visual appeal, an excellent soundtrack and a brilliant vocal performance create a memorable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> The graphics of the game are by no means disappointing. Although some corners have been cut, the overall feel of the game is reminiscent of Disney feature film animations. The gameplay is simple and even a novice will learn soon enough. The game also offers a little more to more experienced players with its Mega Monkey mode. <br /> <br /> Voice broadcasting is one of my favorites. The sympathetic voice of Dominic Armato completes Guybrush and Alexandra Boyd is simply charming like Elaine. Earl Boen makes LeChuck, a villain both sinister and surprising. The charm of the game is also added by memorable characters like Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my personal favorites, Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, voice of Scrooge McDuck). I would also like to congratulate the great Kay Kuter, who has passed away today, and his memorable secondary role as Griswold Goodsoup. <br /> <br /> Michael Land's wonderful tropical soundtrack once again honors the Monkey Island adventure, one of the best tunes in the business. The game is not perfect and some places are not as detailed as others, but I was not upset by the simple end of the game, which I found very satisfying.
