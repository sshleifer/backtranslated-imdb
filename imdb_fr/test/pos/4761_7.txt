**** SPOILERS **** Buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral company can not get him out of underwear, Vito Lucia, Tony Lo Bianco, has come up with a plan to make a lot of money with help from his two twisted buddies Moon & Bo, Richard Lynch and Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> Vito gets closer to his childhood friend Buddy Manucci, Roy Scheider, as a street informant to win Buddy's trust and make him tell Vito what's happening in the streets of New York regarding street activities. Buddy is a cop who works in a sub-rosa unit of the NYPD, the Seven Ups, who does things "in his own way" to clean the streets of New York from the criminals. <br /> <br /> Vito receives information from Buddy and makes him understand that he really gives him advice on the crowd and his activities and uses this information to warn his associates of thugs, Moon & Bo, of the thugs leave their weekly catch, kidnap larger sharks and hold them for ransom. <br /> <br /> All is well for Vito & Co. until the crowd decides to take revenge and mistakenly captures beats, beats and kidnappings. Ken Kercheval, member of Seven Ups Ansel, who worked in secret, thought to be one of the hoods that took them away and scammed them. Later, Moon accidentally killed Ansel when he blew up the trunk of the car in which he was stuck, thinking that there was a suitcase full of money or a ransom in it. <br /> <br /> A fast and exciting film with this rough and grungy New York photograph that has been so effective in the movie "The French Connection" which also features both Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco who are also in this film. An incredible car chase that began in downtown Brooklyn and ended in the wilderness of New Jersey 15 or 20 miles away with Buddy, who was nearly beheaded for his heroic efforts. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider, who is not a great man, is as tough and efficient as any great actor I could imagine as Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot, he looks a little like the former middle and middleweight champion Gene Fullmer, who defeated the great Sugar Ray Robinson for the middleweight title in 1957 and acts like him in the film: Resistant, Durable and destructive. <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is very good as a Vito funeral lowlife heel who plays against Buddy and the crowd to the point that leads to the death of Buddy's partner, Ansel. Even if he's a filth, you can not help but complain about Vito since he only wants the money he gets from ripped gangsters to pay the hospital and health bills of Rose, his wife sick. Even the fact that Ansel was killed because of his actions, Vito never wanted anyone to be hurt, but as it is said if you play with fire, you end up burning yourself. In the end, Vito has a lot to explain to unkind and benevolent criminals. <br /> <br /> The film "The Seven Ups" presents the late Bill Hickman performing dangerous stunts with car chases and playing in the film. Hickman was also the man stuntman in the two great movies that drove him to the streets and highways of New York and San Francisco's "The French Connection" and "Bullitt".
