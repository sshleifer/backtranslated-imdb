I first saw "Death in Venice" in 1971) about 15 years ago, I found it deeply moving and I often thought about it. Looking back a few days ago, I realized that it was close to the top of the great works of cinema. Engaging almost no dialogue, the viewer is captivated by the beautiful cinematography, the game of quality, and especially the music of Mahler without which the film simply could not exist. <br /> <br /> "Death in Venice" is a breathtaking scene. Luchino Visconti's adaptation of Thomas Mann's story about a famous composer (he was a writer, but making him a composer in a film was a great idea that worked perfectly) Gustav von Aschenbach (vaguely inspired by Gustav Mahler) who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover personal losses and professional failures. His search for beauty and perfection seems to be over when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy around the world without ever trying to approach him. The boy, Tadzio, belonged to very rare creatures with an enigmatic and inconceivable power that captivates you, enchants you, conquers you and makes him his prisoner. Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of Tadzio's spellbinding charm. He became addicted to him; he fell in love with him. Was it a blessing or a curse for him? I think both. He died of an inaccessible, impossible and yet magnificent love whose object was perfection itself. The last image captured by Ashenbach's eyes was the silhouette of the boy surrounded by the sea and the golden light of the sun. Nothing can be compared to the beauty and charm of the scene, and taking it with you to the grave is a death you can only dream of. If he could, Ashenbach would probably have said, "I could see one of the faces of perfection, I could not stand it but I was chosen to learn that there is here, in this and that I can die in peace now, because it happened to me. "<br /> <br /> Unforgettable music, Gustav Mahler's haunting adagietto of his Fifth Symphony found perfect use in a perfect film. This reflects all the emotions of a main character: he sobs, he sucks, he hopes, and he sums up the idea that once you have the chance to meet beauty, you are doomed to die. I may produce hundreds of movies that use classical music to perfection, but nothing will be comparable to "Death in Venice". I dare say that Mahler's music is his main character - it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen. It seemed triumphant when Ashenbach returned to Venice, what he thought was his happiness but that turned out to be his death. It sounded sad when he first entered Venice from the sea for the first time. There you can hear a multitude of different feelings - tenderness and adoration, confusion and self-denial, adoration and melancholy, but always - a LOVE that provides the purest happiness and breaks hearts (literally). The film for a spectator is similar to what the boy was for the aging composer / writer / artist. We are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty, just like Achenbach by the mysterious charm of the boy.
