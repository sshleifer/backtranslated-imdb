I'm rarely a fan of movies about clever teens who have authority issues, but "Toy Soldiers" has grown in me with repeated viewing. It's as much a film about Billy Tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else, and I thank Sean Astin and screenwriter / director Daniel Petrie Jr. for not talking too much about it, but I just leave it. unfold and sneak on you. The camaraderie of Tepper's friends, their grief over Joey's death and their joy of surviving are all moving. And, I have to admit I'm taking some patriotic (and maybe slightly reptilian) cheer when the US Army guys finally arrive and just kick in the narco-terrorist's ass. Ooh-rah, General Kramer! And Robert Folk's heroic score is the icing on the cake. I'm sure I could find a hundred reasons not to like Toy Soldiers, but as long as we do not take it too seriously, I do not see the need for it. It's one of the most entertaining "bad" movies in my pantheon.
