This is one of the best sci-fi series. This involves the development of the character, some really tense moments and reasonable episodes scripts. As another commentator put it, it was a mini-series and not a complete series with filling episodes and low budgets. <br /> <br /> The problem of the series, which is in short a series of Godzilla, is that it started too big, with incredible monsters, a fantastic science, then everything was reduced to Americans of the region. Then the show ended too early because the Olympics were coming up and hey! a sci-fi show is a science-fiction show, but half-naked athletes who run without a goal are much more important. Thus, they made only 15 episodes instead of the 22 planned. The audience was small too, because people did not really surprise at 20:00. In the end, the costumes did it. Trust a marketing plan to destroy anything that looks both original and promising. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: you have a show with good special effects, like huge monsters killing people or destroying boats, then switching to genetic engineering, transforming people, human clones, end of the world, tsunamis. In addition, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive hicks or other boring people killed for stupidity. The disadvantage is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge, the series ends. No real end, no closing, just a bitter taste of tissue in the mouth, as if you had swallowed a garment.
