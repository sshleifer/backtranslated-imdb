I know that Chill Wills has usually played in some adorable old westerns. But his role in this segment is something I've remembered for a long time. Wills could be a first rate villain. Yes, the fall of Burgess Meredith was correct! This look in Hepplewhite's eyes! It expressed greed, ignorance and the threat of swine violence. Quite a performance, I think. <br /> <br /> The segment itself was good, too. Question: Could not the little black bag cure alcoholism? I guess that was the case with Fall. But the doctor would have been wise to apply the treatment as quickly as possible to Hepplewhite, if he had had it. <br /> <br /> There is a moment that was boring but also necessary. And it's something that seems to be happening in these Night Gallery segments. It's Serling's constant need to lecture. Because that's what we had, again, with Dr. Fall. I do not know what was more frustrating, losing the black bag and all his miracles or not being able to stop Fall from preaching about the bag's benefits to mankind, while rubbing Hepplewhite's greedy face into the mud and, therefore, begging for Hepplewhite to hit him. But as I said, it was necessary. At least he was for me. Otherwise, we would not have seen Wills' performance described above. Everything is done without moving a muscle or speaking a word.
