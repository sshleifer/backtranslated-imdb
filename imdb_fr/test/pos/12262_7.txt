"Broadcast News" is directed by James L. Brooks (Thank You Conditions, As Good As It Gets) and has an excellent cast, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. Everyone gives a good performance, but they are too implausible to really care. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the film are really brilliant, like the prologue and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason why it does not work entirely is that it's a film based on the characters' fun rather than on the fun that happens to them. <br /> <br /> You can not think of it as a drama, but it's often too silly to succeed there too. Still, the script is worth watching. Certainly not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 10
