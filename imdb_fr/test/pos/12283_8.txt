It's a nice project, it's not a movie as the title suggests. Good performance of Nadia Dajani who reconstructs the role of Grace. I come back to the reenactment of what happens to Mike and Grace in New York. She leaves, but he wants to get in touch with her. This project is her way of trying to contact her. <br /> <br /> I saw it at the IFC. I heard that it will also be available on DVD. I like this trend of more independent projects. This is an example of a good project. <br /> <br /> I hope he finds it. <br /> <br /> Watch and be entertained. <br /> <br /> KirbyEF
