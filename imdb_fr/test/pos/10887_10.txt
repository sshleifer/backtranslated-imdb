In my personal opinion, I think it's the greatest video game ever created! I played this game for the first time at my friends' home years ago. The next day, I went out and got mine. Since that day, almost seven years ago, I have not stopped playing. I can not help it, I can not get tired of it. I have been addicted to other games on other much newer systems, but I keep coming back for more from Goldeneye. Each mission is incredibly fun and challenging, the multiplayer mode was unique. I hope you can be as lucky as having played in four player multiplayer mode because I had brothers and friends who would meet and play this game all the time.
