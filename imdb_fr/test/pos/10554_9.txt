My father the hero is sweet, funny and cute. Gerard Depardiu is awesome like Andrew, a divorced father who takes his 14-year-old daughter (Kathrine Heigl) to the Caribbean for a vacation. André is his lover and his father is in prison for armed robbery, his mother is a prostitute and she fled with her pimp. Everyone on the island soon feels that André is a child molester. One with Isabelle (Emma Thompson, making an appearance at the end of the film) and Diana (Faith Prince of Spin City). My father, the hero, has many fun moments. Something French. He plays "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" Gigi. Everyone is disgusted and goes away. My father the hero does not deserve a 5.1, I think he deserves a 9.0.
