If you read Carl Hiaasen's book, the movie follows fairly closely, with some minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion, it's an excellent family film. Luke Wilson (Delinko Officer) stole the show from a cast of stars including Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The children of the movie do an excellent job led by Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> Brie Larson may be a bit too small to play Beatrice. I imagined a taller girl, maybe 6 feet and 175 pounds, in the role of Beatrice. It could have made her more credible in her role of defeating Dana. They should have further developed her "tough girl" character and bit her in a tire or kick in a soccer ball. She is very pretty, and I understand why she was chosen, it's a box office attraction. <br /> <br /> It's about as bad as a movie lately, no sex and very little violence. This film is a parents dream come true, a film with a strong environmental message, with children who deeply appreciate the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. This shows how much adults have failed in the management of our planet and that our children can demand more. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Mullet Fingers says, "Florida could use mountains like Montana, Florida is so flat that nothing prevents developers from cleaning up from coast to coast." . In addition, wildlife photography in Florida says a lot without dialogue. As a family film with kids aged 5 to 15, it's a great movie! As a bonus, parents will be entertained, especially if they are "lead heads".
