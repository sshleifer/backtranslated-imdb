I was lucky to have found this movie. I take Walmart $ 5.50 DVDs because I watch a lot of movies (and I rarely watch TV). I graduated from high school in 1968. So I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This film really illustrates the pain I saw at my friends' house to manage what happened to them there. I wish more people would see this film - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our veterans in Vietnam by watching these excellent actors in the portrait of a family damaged by this war. The story seemed realistic - it's not wet, but it made me feel what they were going through. I think the fact that Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez played father and son helped - it made their relationship more credible,
