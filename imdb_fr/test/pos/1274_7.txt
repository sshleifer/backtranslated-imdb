A surprisingly good movie considering the circumstances of its production. Presents performances of nameless actors who compete with the greatest talents on the planet (unfortunately, none has pursued a career). <br /> <br /> Also includes Christopher Nolan's divine ability to write a perfect dialogue. The dialogue is what brings this story, which speaks of a man who likes to follow people in search of material for his books. Well done, VERY well edited, even better written and incredibly well played. <br /> <br /> This film has everything a great movie needs, except for people who have seen it. 9/10
