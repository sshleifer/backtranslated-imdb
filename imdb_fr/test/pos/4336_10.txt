Although I agree that this film lacks real substance and should not be taken seriously, it is primarily intended for fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey) goes down once again into the streets (with the permission of the police chief, no less) and settles in his friend's apartment (who guessed it) was killed by a street gang who took control of the neighborhood (which looks like BÃ©ruit). It's funny that people who frequent Bronson are used to being killed. Bronson systematically kills them one by one, the people in the neighborhood being used against him. There is a certain dynamic between Bronson and Fraker, who runs the street gang, you can say they love their work. At one point in the movie after their fight in the city jail, Fraker said, "I'm going to kill a little old lady just for you, catch him at the 6 o'clock news." The "Giggler", a handbag thief who laughs while committing his crimes is also nice to watch. The film was shot in 1985 and most people could probably identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are featured in the film. It's nice to see Bronson (Paul Kersey) rid the streets of these thugs. Watch for the appearance of the Wildey Magnum, a piece of serious equipment that Bronson uses. I also really liked the soundtrack of this movie.
