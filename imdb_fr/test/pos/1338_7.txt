This film is the most traumatic and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. Knowing that this film is based on a true story and that I watch Jeffrey Dahmer (Carl Crew) brutally murdering his victims is enough to make me cry. I admit it was a low-budget movie with not the best dialogue, but it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a psychoic maniac. Because he was so emotionally / emotionally inside, his emotions and selfishness were so deeply rooted in his brain that it led him to become a murderer. All the people he attracted to his apartment attracted and smelled him. The reasons for which he had murdered them were not only explained by the pleasure of killing them, but by the fact that he could not bear them. . In the scene where he killed his first victim by hitting an object in the back of the guy's head, what I noticed was not because he wanted to kill him but because he was devastated by the idea that the guy leaves him. It was from that moment that he got used to this murderous behavior and made his hobby his passion - for both diabolical and emotional reasons. <br /> <br /> how much he loved her and the love he showed to his grandmother and how he did not want to leave his house showed that he had love in his heart. A scene that I found quite scary and strange was when a priest heard Jeffrey in a pub inviting him to come home, and then called him in a phone booth inside the pub so he lose patience and change your mind. at home with Jeffrey. When the guy left the pub, the priest hung up and was laughing at Jeffrey. I also found that Carl Crew played a remarkable acting performance as a role of Jeffrey Dahmer. His devilish and cold-blooded facial expressions before he slaughtered his victims were so real that I shivered in my seat. His facial expressions made me think of the way Vincent D'onofrio (Pyle / Leonard's Soldier) in the movie 'Full Metal Jacket' looked right before killing the general in the toilet barracks. <br /> <br /> If your an emotional person, I would not recommend you to watch this movie, but if it's not your case, then watch it.
