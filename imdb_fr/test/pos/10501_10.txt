I watched this movie again and still consider it very good. Chloe is one of the rare hardcore stars to really play. She appears occasionally in Soft Core, like "Body of Love" and "Lady Chatterly's Stories" on Showtime. I thought Nicole Hilbig was fine with her pretty body and charming accent. Too bad she is not in more movies.
