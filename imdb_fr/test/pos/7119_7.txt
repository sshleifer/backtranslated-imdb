I'm really impressed. I was expecting a cheeky gamer's humor and nothing else. <br /> <br /> OK, there's a ton of pretty geek humor. But the film is so well done. The acting game is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The dialogue, even if the players are sometimes tacky, I guess to satisfy the audience of players, is not bad at all. Sometimes it's even, dare I say, it's great. <br /> <br /> When the player, who built this non-traditional fighter type character rather than the usual guy (min / max), gets all these extra attacks, I did not check the rules,) c was cool. <br /> <br /> The sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production film. <br /> <br /> The story goes straight. Transitions from the world of gaming to the real world are well done. A man playing a female character would sometimes be played by a woman, and sometimes by himself. Very smart, I thought. <br /> <br /> The guy who decided to play a woman but forgot to forget he was a woman was good for a lot of laughs. He even said tag at one point, and the woman continued to play the role (sorry, I did not look for her name, she still did well.) The guy who was still trying to "get it "was a little tedious, but I guess it was more the humor of the players. <br /> <br /> There was so much to love in the movie. Lightweight. Fun! Very well done and I say that as a movie fan, not a player (and I'm not a D & D player). As I said, I was expecting MUCH less. <br /> <br /> Often, movies do not pay attention to me, I end up listening while I'm working on my computer. This one caught my attention. I can not make a much more laudatory film.
