I'm not a big fan of music, but it's one of the few that I really like. Unlike many other musicals, such as "The Sound of Music", none of the songs talk about free stuff. Each song is a social commentary, a vision of war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality and freedom. Particularly amazing songs are "Easy To Be Hard", "Age of Aquarius", "Hair", "Flesh Failures / 3-5-0-0", "Walking In Space" and "Hare Krishna". Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can not wait to see this live one day!
