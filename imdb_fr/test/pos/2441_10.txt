This film has not been seen by me for a few years. He arrived on Disney Channel in the early hours of the morning. I stayed up to watch it and found it even more fun than the first time. The story, the landscapes and the characters are as good as they come. I know that if someone takes the time to watch this movie, he will certainly find it interesting to see it a second time. It's very memorable in more ways than one. I would recommend this film to anyone because it is both entertaining and educational for everyone. <br /> <br /> s
