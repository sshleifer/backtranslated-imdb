Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a bigot who gets drunk there, takes it at first as a joke, but the story is confirmed at the evening news. Instead of calling the cops or others, Joe decides that since the guy killed a hippie, they must be of the same mind! He makes the man sing to become his friend. At first, the film seemed hard and critical, but, if it turned out itself, it became a rather complex portrait of today's society. Yes, I think it exaggerates a bit, but in a fun way that does not detract from the power of his messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this film and it's a shock to see how pretty she was, about 23 years old. It's worth being seen.
