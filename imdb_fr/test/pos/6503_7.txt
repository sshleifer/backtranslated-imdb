This film is mainly for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, especially the turntable, as was the case for the director before the beginning of the film. It was cool to focus on the bay more than expected, because New York still has all the merit, but the cult of the bay since the bay is a little out of control. This film was not new to me, but it changed my opinion that I was a bit suspicious about giving the tables the distinction of being an instrument of good faith. This film should convince anyone that everything goes well with viola and clavichord.
