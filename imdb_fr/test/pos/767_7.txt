Ben Marshall, an elderly teenager of religious origin, is informed of the financial situation of his country by his domineering mother, Laura. She suggests he find a temporary job to help with the household. In fact, the family took a widower on board. Robert Marshall, the father, is a pastor at the local church; he would rather observe the birds in the country than care for the souls entrusted to his church. <br /> <br /> Ben's work applies to an older actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her. around the house. "Lady" Evie, as she calls herself, is a middle-aged woman whose career is dead perhaps because she was not so good. In fact, the only memorable appearance seems to be a popular soap opera, but she prefers to forget it. Evie, who is a compulsive liar, tells Ben that she is dying, then conveniently forgetting her, later, when she is pure with the boy. <br /> <br /> Ben is obviously impressed by the larger-than-life personality of his employer. He took driving lessons. Evie asks him to go on a camping trip, which he does against his best judgment. He knows that it will provoke his mother's fury. Not content with that, Evie decides to go to Edinburgh, where she was invited to read at an art festival. It is this journey that consolidates their bond. Ben meets and tastes the pleasures of the flesh with a friendly Bryony. <br /> <br /> When Ben comes home, everything falls apart at home. His mother, who had an affair with a parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of the young man with whom she had an affair. The relationship between Ben and Evie survives the test of time. He also begins to see his own father in a different light. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brock, the writer of "Driving Lessons" and other memorable English films, is doing his first work as a director with this engaging comedy. The mix between show business and religion, loyalty and friendship are explored in its treatment on the screen, making it a fun time in the cinema. We have already seen the same situation as in "Billy Elliott", where Julie Walters plays a stimulating role with a young man. We had read that the film was based on Mr. Brock's own experience working with Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie. She always delivers. Mrs. Walters is a welcome presence in all the films she presents and she works wonders with her fake "lady". Laura Linney, a bright player herself, does not quite understand our sympathy for her icy mother. Rupert Grint, famous for his Harry Potter films, portrays Ben, the young man who sees Evie as a benevolent soul. Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines.
