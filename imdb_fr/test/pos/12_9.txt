I was pleasantly surprised to see this film in preview in my local theater. <br /> <br /> We've already seen this plot before (Top Gun, GI Jane, an officer and a gentleman), but hey the script still works. This story focuses on the formation of a two-person Coast Guard rescue team. Kevin Costner plays the role of a successful rescue team leader, Ben Randall, who is forced to lead the training team after a difficult mission. The film guides us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of Costner and Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this game. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this film and you will probably find out what will happen well before it arrives. However, the use of humor, the exploration of the hardness of training and the pleasure of watching Ben Randall "doing his own job as a coach" kept me alive and entertained. I really like watching a movie that makes everyone laugh, panting here and there, and applauding in the end in tribute to the movie. <br /> <br /> We all had fun (despite some of the hard times in the movie) and, I think, you too.
