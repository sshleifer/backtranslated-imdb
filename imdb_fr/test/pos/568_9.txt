I just saw the movie, through Netflix. I was intrigued by the way the movie was portrayed, but ultimately it was better. I watched this movie in different directions. I was filled with pain, hate, anger, bitterness, pain and finally relief. Watching the accused young man will break your heart and convince you that they have the wrong person. The rigor of the police makes you furious, because, like the movie Rodney King Beating, the brutality of the police, the film highlights the total lack of moral strength of these police. And the fact that they beat this boy and they got away with it just makes you mad. <br /> <br /> But, I must tell you that I fell in love with the lawyer, Mc Guinness. One of my favorite phrases, when he told us how bad the cops were ... The cop told him to keep sucking that stick against cancer. Mc Guinness told the cop ... "I always smoke before making love ..." I let him know that I was going to kiss "<br /> <br /> I have a new respect for some in this country.
