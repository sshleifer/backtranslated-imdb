All the trials and tribulations of making a film without a budget directly from the mouths of those involved. You feel all the sweat, guts, determination and dedication that Stuie put into this work of love and the frustration of being left hanging after all her work. Excerpts from interviews with everyone involved provide a fluid narrative and reflect the rough, anarchic and hardcore punk attitude that it took to film "Waldo" and then the documentary. Stuie and her company deserve all the accessories of the world for not having abandoned the increasingly difficult situation and have published "A tale of treason in Texas" so that we can see what it is like for the aspiring filmmaker in the street!
