The extremely tight vision of a war situation where the Vargtimmen couple (ok, they have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) is caught in the crossfire of two fronts. The portrayal of the parties in combat as superfluous and faceless authorities is often captured in sublime surrealistic images and draws interesting parallels with 1984 Orwell, even though Bergman reverses this personal context of a slowly emerging marital war. This is why innumerable fundamental and philosophical questions about Eva and Jan's marriage are relevant and essential, as the threat and danger from the outside open an abyss inside that was previously covered with enemies. An intense allegory on the fragile facades of civic conventions.
