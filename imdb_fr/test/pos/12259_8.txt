Spunky's reporter Holly Hunter produces investigative reports for a large news network. She is a maverick in the mouth, dazzling in her work and with little time for romantic relationships. Enter William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men fighting for his love. <br /> <br /> Brooks is an old school journalist who loves Holly because she represents all that is good in journalism. They both believe that the media exists to test the gods, educate the public and fight for the truth. Children of the sixties, they embody the hippie values. They are defenders of the public good. Knights fighting valiantly with pen and camera. <br /> <br /> William Hurt, on the other hand, is a much more complex character. At first clumsy, clumsy and self-depreciating, he gradually reveals himself as a powerful, sexy and manipulative man, able to climb the ladder of the company. Unlike Holly and Brooks, he symbolizes the values ​​of modern media: information as a show, journalism as entertainment, anchor as celebrity, truth as a subject on the editorial board. We want to scorn him and his junk food blip-time newspaper, but we just can not handle it. He plays the game according to his own rules. Do we condemn it for lack of spine? Do we condemn the game? Can the game exist if its rules are disobeyed? How have these rules evolved? <br /> <br /> This is not the "network" of Lumet and Chayefsky, and the film does not care to answer these questions. Pleased to keep things light comedy, it ends with the promotion of Hurt to the London division and the priming of Brooks on a tiny community network. Holly, having rejected the two men, remains stuck between them. The last bulwark of media integrity, this cheerful journalist remembers her roots, mourns the loss of Brooks and warns of the future William Hurts. <br /> <br /> It's a nice ending, but compared to "Network" the film seems positively banal. Chayefsky's vision is one in which global media, despite their omnipresence, offer less significant information. It provides for a world in which globalization has homogenized cultures, information has become a society and a handful of media monopolies control all international news. It is a world in which truth is subject to shareholder meetings and economic interests. A world in which viewer ratings determine content and opinion polls dictate the best stories. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps for this reason that "Broadcast News", which aspires to the beautiful days of journalism, ends on a bittersweet note. He knows what the future holds. Made in 1987, he has been living for at least a decade. <br /> <br /> But today, in the digital age, the situation is even worse. Mergers and acquisitions have left a very small number of large corporations dominating the communications landscape. The hyper-commercialism of the content has come, the barrier between the creative / editorial side and the commercial side has practically collapsed. Today, everyone can create their own blog or website, but these are basic business. As the individual's communication reach increases (because of technological advances - e-mail, the Internet, electricity, air mail, etc.), the size of his world also increases. He must project his voice at once farther and stronger, struggling in vain against this deafening white noise, the incessant static charge that is the world community. <br /> <br /> Two things must ultimately be done according to democratic theory. First, you need a rigorous influx of people in power and people who want to be, both in the private and public sectors. Secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all the important issues of the day. In a democratic society, the media system as a whole should produce this type of culture. Unfortunately, the current structure of the global system goes directly against the needs of democratic journalism and a democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? It's light-hearted, but a witty storyline, fun-filled moments and Jack Nicholson's brief monochrome elevates it above most other journalism films. Interestingly, unlike most movies on the media, it never plunges into satire and instead plays like a simple love triangle. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
