it's been years since I saw these shows. I have been looking for years for people who have seen this or who know anything about them. I thought I invented them. the one I remember most is the soldier and the death. I would ask moviegoers if they saw them, mentioning that it was a Jim Henson and that people still did not know it. they are great fables. I was very young when I was these, not even 10 and it left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. I would recommend anyone to watch them. Remember that they are from the 80s and therefore do not look like today's movies. just give them a shot. Jim Henson was way ahead of his time and died too early.
