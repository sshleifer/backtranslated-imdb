The student nurse is not a typical sexploitation film. Of course, nudity and sexual openness are at the rendezvous, but it's not just laughter. Stephanie Rothman has written a socially compelling and well-written ass and cul-de-sac that tackles the themes of racism, socio-economic inequality, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, rights humans, the Vietnam War, free love, LSD and drug experimentation. Four sexy college housemates perform their nursing internship at the same time. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to the terminal care service, Lynn (Brioni Farrell) to the Public Health Administration, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh) to Gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) to Psychiatry. These four beauties have many opportunities to undress and forge, which they enjoy, to the delight of the audience. They are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution, after all, and as intelligent as they are hot and beautiful. Sequences of both visceral and low-budget actions are dispersed. A very bloody shooting took place at the headquarters of the resistance, during which two policemen were shot dead and several members of the group. An anti-war demonstration (Vietnam) of young people of all races, with sinister clothes and painted like skeletons, becomes violent and the cops beat the protesters. The sequence of effective travel on the beach consists of beautiful sensory and memory montages, strange and confusing, with hyper-sensual notes. In short, THE STUDENT NURSES is a thoughtful and compelling reflection on the time, expressed through the true perspectives of women (as it was written and directed by a woman). But, it's still fun and exciting, despite the sobering treatment.
