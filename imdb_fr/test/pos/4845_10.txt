Without a doubt, the film is a powerful medium, more than ever before, because of the accessibility of DVDs / videos, giving the filmmaker the extra assurance that his story or message will be seen by millions of people. The use of this medium therefore implies an innate responsibility of the artist, since the film can be both educational and entertaining, which makes it necessary to treat certain subjects accordingly, with a corresponding sensibility and sensitivity. A film like Spielberg's "The Schindler List", for example, is important because it keeps in memory the memory of what you should not forget, and as history tends to repeat itself, Spielberg's film can be considered a valuable tool to prevent recurrence of this tragedy. In the same vein, Neal Slavin's film "Focus" is important because it sheds light on the problematic reality of anti-Semitism, which has touched millions of people for years, again and again, like today. any manifestation of bigotry will continue if it is not controlled or ignored. Born of a xenophobic strain, it is a disease that infects society and, without respite, could be fatal. and thanks to his in-depth knowledge of the disease, this film is an effective vaccine that could at least help stop its proliferation and, hopefully, be a step towards its total eradication. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) served his country during the Great War and has since led a quiet and conventional life in New York. He has been in the same position as Director of Personnel for about 20 years and is the owner of the middle-class, middle-class house where he lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey). Lawrence is the kind of guy who does very well by taking care of his stuff and refusing to get involved with issues that do not concern him (he feels). <br /> <br /> All this is about to change, however As with the advent of the Second World War, Lawrence and the owner of the corner market, Mr. Finkelstein (David Paymer), are inexplicably among the xenophobic neighborhood targets, which aligned themselves with the Union Crusaders. a national organization currently taking to channel their fears and hatred on the Jews, or whoever even looks like a Jew. And suddenly, Lawrence realizes that he can no longer be sidelined and watch the game play. because now, it's the game, whether he likes it or not. <br /> <br /> Slavin, inspired by Kendrew Lascelles' intelligent and well-written script, which he adapted from Arthur Miller's novel, presents a scenario that incisively examines the effects of bigotry on those against whom it is leveled ; and when we consider the fact that it is not simply a hypothetical situation, but a representation of reality, it becomes all the more disturbing, even confusing. And what makes the film so effective is Slavin's obvious mastery of his subject, as well as his thoughtful presentation, which inspires reflection in its subtlety. In the opening scene, Slavin establishes Lawrence's "character" and reaffirms it shortly thereafter in another scene, which offers the audience an opportunity to observe and assimilate the real workings of Lawrence's mind. the thought processes that direct his life. That being done, Slavin is able to take his audience with Lawrence as his problems begin to resolve. In doing so, it effectively illustrates the evolution of the problem, rather than simply expressing it and dealing with it head-on, which increases the emotional involvement of the viewer and, ultimately, reinforces the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> Slavin makes an important statement with this movie, which is not only an indictment of sectarianism, but also a warning message about apathy. And, to his credit, he never strikes you on the head and does not engage in a subjective gesture to plead his cause; instead, he proceeds cautiously, doing his best to be as objective as possible with everything he submits to your consideration. His approach is that of a film diplomat; and it's an approach that serves Slavin - and his film - quite well. <br /> <br /> As Lawrence, William H. Macy - one of the best character actors in the industry - gives an incredible performance, establishing the credibility and credibility of his character with a sensitive, honest and introspective. He never tries to circumvent the personal flaws of Lawrence's nature, but rather uses them to create a resolutely three-dimensional character, which makes him not only convincing, but also serves to reaffirm the integrity of the performance. What makes it so compelling is Macy's ability to communicate the process by which he examines his own consciousness, allowing the viewer to share the experience of his personal epiphany. In the final analysis, it is the strength of Macy's performance, more than anything else, that makes this film so distinctly. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the performance performed by Laura Dern, as Gertrude Hart, a performance that effectively complements the work of Macy, as well as that of Slavin. Dern gives a lot of substance to her character, capturing her physically and emotionally, and her colorful zeal creates a stark contrast to Lawrence's reserve that works extremely well, both for his character and for the film itself. <br /> <br /> And just as Sean Combs recently (in Monster's Ball) has argued against the immediate rejection of the acting efforts of an established "rock star", Meat Loaf Aday plays a powerful role here: Fred , next door neighbor Lawrence's movie. It also proves that a true artist will produce, regardless of the type of canvas on which it is given. <br /> <br /> The secondary cast includes Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (Father Crighton), Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (Ms. Dewitt). The type of film that makes a filmmaker proud of his profession, "Focus", offers a memorable experience that, hopefully, will also prove enlightening to those who are unaware of the existence of such conditions, and this even in this situation. the country of freedom. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
