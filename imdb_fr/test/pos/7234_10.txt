It's the best movie I've ever seen. And I saw a lot. I'm not even a fan of Troma. I had never heard of Troma before watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I had already lost hope of seeing a good movie before seeing "Tromeo and Juliet". This film is a dream come true. Shakespeare would probably be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. There is sex, violence, humor and satire. It breaks a lot of taboos. <br /> <br /> This film is neither disgusting nor stupid. It is difficult to describe in words how clever, funny, exciting and spiritual this film is. The music is excellent and is perfect for every scene. The characters are very credible and the acting is great. I really care about the characters. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not just for Troma fans. It's for everyone with a sense of humor and intelligent and credible entertainment, as opposed to the totally stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies that dare not do what this movie does. <br /> <br /> The bad reviews only prove that this film is awesome and exceptional. Love it or hate it. Like all authentic works of art, it is not understood or appreciated by all.
