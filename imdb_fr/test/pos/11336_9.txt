Having seen many other Wong Kar-Wai movies (Happy Together, Fallen Angels, Ashes of Time), I knew what to expect to come to the theater; the cinematography would be lush, the use of space and perspective would be varied, the acting would be superb, and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable loneliness. It is precisely these techniques that make Wong Kar-Wai's art what it is. What I did not expect was how much I was dragged into a movie that some critics called "unfinished" and pushed by characters who "seemed exhausted by boredom". <br /> <br /> I find it interesting to see so completely indifferent to a film that displays so clearly emotions and sets that many of us take for granted or who work hard to forget it: the immense feeling of sorrow resulting from betrayal; the guilt aroused by the idea of ​​not becoming better than the traitor; the mundane but deeply intimate moments of relationships, where the need to express oneself verbally is totally superfluous. This is what Wong Kar-Wai tries to describe in the film and what he accomplishes so well. <br /> <br /> Too many Americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film filled with dialogue; Spirited jokes, disgruntled sarcasms and crushed confessions seem to be the pinnacle of the "best" American film to offer. Wong Kar-Wai sees things very differently. Instead of the character needing to keep the audience abreast of each feeling, perception, or belief, Wong's characters clearly convey their feelings and understandings through facial gestures, body position, and, yes, silence. <br /> <br /> If viewers only watch this movie from the point of view of the character's development and action, then they may be disappointed by what they have to offer. If they are willing to be tempted and guess what the characters are feeling, they may have a very different perception of what Wong can offer them.
