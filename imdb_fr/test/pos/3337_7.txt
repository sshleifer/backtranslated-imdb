Excellent entry into the RKO Saint series with a well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, a good staging to handle some twists in the plot, a good editing to maintain the constant flow and a good interpretation. George Sanders is sweet and witty. Jonathan Hale is simply Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a gangster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can not stand the pressure. He will return to a later entry in the series. The story begins on a steamer heading to the United States, where the Saint meets but can not connect to Wendie Barrie. She eventually succumbed to the saint's charms but eventually broke her heart. The Saint helps Inspector Fernack erase his name from a frame. Some bodies fall down the road. Good entertainment and above average for this type of movie. Look at this.
