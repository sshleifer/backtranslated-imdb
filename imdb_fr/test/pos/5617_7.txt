A brilliant young man, interested in "serious" music (certainly an endangered race - who will play the violin when nobody knows how to play the violin? ") - could find an interesting fiction about street children and big stars Heifitz was the greatest violinist of his generation and the film gave him a rare opportunity to present his technique on screen.The kids, especially Gene Reynolds, are doing well and, overall, the photo is a good example of a family of top-notch TV studios in the late 30's. It's not at the top of the list of top 39 players, but it's a good way for a smart family to spend a rainy afternoon with AMC or the Video Store - good luck at Blockbuster !!!
