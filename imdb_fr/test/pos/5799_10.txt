It is difficult today and in the United States to understand this movie. We really have nothing to compare. Here is an attempt at comparison: it is as if during the last years of the Saddam regime, a filmmaker in Iraq was able to make a film that, for the first time, showed life as it was lived in this world. country. The ordinary girl's life, with all the terror and repression in its own right. Then the film was freely exhibited in Iraq. If you could imagine this unlikely event, then you could get an idea of ​​what happened with this film during the last years of the Soviet Union. Before this film, Soviet cinema was highly censored. Soviet films would only show an ideal life in the workers paradise. Then suddenly that. The alcoholism, the random sex, the ugly piece of land that is the Soviet city, the suffocating pollution, the proletariat victimizing each other and themselves, the total despair - everything is there. People were stunned. Soviet women often cried during the sessions. Many would say that's the story of their lives. It was a cultural earthquake that filmmakers only dream of realizing. This undoubtedly accelerated the break-up of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Reading the reviews here, I find that few people understand this movie. They say it was revolutionary because it contained real sex. For Soviet viewers at the time, sex was a minor event compared to the fact that it was describing reality for the first time in Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> Others compare it to current movies such as "As Good as it gets" could also compare Homer's Illiad to John Grissam's latest novel. They simply do not compare. It's not just a film, it's a social document and a transforming social force. This must be seen this way, otherwise you will not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> Other critics see it as a film about a dysfunctional Russian family. It is said that it is difficult to be sorry for Vera because she continues to return to her family. The fact is that Vera and her family are symbols of all Soviet life. There was no place to go, because the family at the bottom of the block and in the neighboring town were the same. It was life in the Soviet Union for most people. <br /> <br /> It is a film that can be seen on several levels: as a drama, it traces the landscape of despair, as a social document, it shows the living conditions of the time, as a political document, the attitude of the people and many reasons for the breakup of the Soviet Union. As a moral document, it shows the evils of an uncontrollable dictatorship and the brutalities that the victims will do to each other. <br /> <br /> Little Vera clearly shows the human burden that socialism will eventually inflict on its victims, despite the good intentions of this system. In so doing, he contributed to ending the Soviet regime, thus contributing to one of the major changes in modern history. This film achieves what few movies have ever done. This is not only a breathtaking representation of history, but it has also become a force in this fashioned story.
