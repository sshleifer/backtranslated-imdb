The Swedish director Roy Andersson's latest film, You, the Living, is not easy to revisit. One of the reasons is that, in his own words, he broke with the Anglo-Saxon tradition of storytelling, essentially the model of most Western film productions. Another reason might be that, although Roy Andersson is a little heavy in symbolism, his own, unlike those of Andrei Tarkovsky for example, have a more elusive character. It took him 3 years to complete this 86-minute feature film, and that's not because he was forced to take long breaks between shootings because of financial problems or problems with the actors. The film consists of 57 vignettes shot mainly by a fixed camera. The careful design of each of these scenes took a lot of time. The images in this film, which are closely related to the previous film by the director Songs from the Second Floor, are of great importance to history. This story is therefore told to a large extent by the environment and the environment in which the characters of the universe of Andersson evolve. and interact. Before each scene was finally shot, there would have been no less than 10 different test shootings with different actors, colors, dialogues, and so on. The result is a dreamlike version of the world around us that most of us would recognize and if the setting is like a dream, why not dream a little? As in The discreet charm of Bunuel's middle class, when someone says, "Last night, I had a dream", you can look at it. But again, what is perceived as a reality here is not very different from dreams. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film lacks plot in the traditional sense of the term, there is no main character Thus, the different characters that appear and reappear in different scenes still meet and their stories are inevitably linked. What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. The trash is a woman who smokes and consumes alcohol excessively and who dreams of having a motorcycle to get away from "all that shit", his boyfriend corpulent and especially silent and his frail and seemingly gentle but somewhat distracted, members of a brass band whose efforts to improve skills at home do not receive the welcome of their families or neighbors, the depressed barber from the Middle East and his arrogant client going to "a very important business meeting", an old man in a nightmare on the bombers in the sky, a girl dreaming to marry the young rock star of which she is so madly in love. These are dreams and nightmares against reality, but they are as effective as a statement in support of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's statement that "all human communication is a lack of communication". People talk to each other but it's like they're talking to each other. They try to reach out to others, but exclude them when they try to reach them. <br /> <br /> You, the living is a poetic film that takes place physically in Stockholm, but is universally applicable. The society in question is Sweden, its artistic language and characters are generally undeniably Nordic. Yet the subject, that is, the misery of humanity in an egoistic world, extends well beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of its theme, the film itself seems much more cheerful and loaded with humor than might have been expected. But, as the director himself says, "life is so complicated for all of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor". Therefore, this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on your sensibilities, and not a depressing turn of dark reality of human nature. It is unusual in its language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it, you will certainly find that this film is both entertaining and meaningful. It was presented this year at the Cannes Film Festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program, which offers "original and different works" outside the competition. After the screening of the film in the Debussy room, the 1,000 spectators cheered for several minutes. Should I say more?
