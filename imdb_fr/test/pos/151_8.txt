Korean cinema has the ability to upset genres, and the latest of the famous director Chan-wook Park tells the story of a good pious priest become a vampire. Add a temptress who misleads and a group of eccentrics and you get a wonderful recipe. <br /> <br /> Led partly in a style similar to the "Sympathy" trilogy, it is as sumptuous as it is dark. By avoiding clich√©s, he offers some new tips in the kind of excessive vampire. It is an existential film that attempts to delineate the moral enigma of how a person should choose to live with his conditions rather than revel in the thirst for blood. However, the film does not take itself too seriously and its humor is limitless. <br /> <br /> Our characters play their roles to perfection, playing with our emotions and savoring black humor. There are moments of reflection on all the moral enigmas involved in the film, but it is never a preaching. Some may find it too long and it may slow down in places, but it's worth giving it a chance to finish. <br /> <br /> If you like movies on the left field, there are less of them better than this one at the moment. Dark and captivating, it will attract a crowd. One, I recommend you try.
