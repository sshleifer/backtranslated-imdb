I was waiting to see this movie for ages and I finally have it! As soon as I heard the title, I knew that this movie would be my favorite movie and when I saw it, trust me, I was not disappointed! <br /> <br /> This film had everything to please, to dance, to love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much inside and it dealt with important issues (such as abortion in the 1960s). <br /> <br /> The dance in this movie was fantastic, as was the acting game! Swayze was brilliant as Gray was too! <br /> <br /> Although this film was absolutely fantastic, you can not say that you saw it if you did not see the last scene. You are breathtaking because all the choreography of the last dance was performed brilliantly. She made you dance at the end of the movie and it would not really surprise me if it made people dance! <br /> <br /> Overall, Dirty Dancing is a film not to be missed and even if half of the actors are in the "Where are they now?" period, the actors will always have this superb movie in their career!
