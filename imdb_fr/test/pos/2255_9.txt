This film reminds me of "Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind" and "Garden State" not because of the content, but because it is one of those films we only hear about by word of mouth, or reading the back of the DVD in the video store and think "why not". Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (like the aforementioned films) for its quality and pleasure. <br /> <br /> Best seen with little knowledge of the movie and a plot that guides you to watch it. Also better to do with someone else or if you know someone who has seen it - you will want to talk about it !! It's a beautiful movie that stays with you long after watching it. It's also a smart watch that requires little effort to find parts for yourself. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it :)
