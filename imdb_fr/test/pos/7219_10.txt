What can I say about Tromeo and Juliet, except if you like Troma's twisted machinations, then you MUST see this movie! This is my favorite Troma movie, and I've seen them almost all! Penis monsters, live births to live rats and popcorn, lesbianism, hot sex scenes in plexiglass boxes, incest, nipple piercing, dismemberment, unscrupulous Troma plugs and computer masturbation ... How can we go wrong? It follows surprisingly the original story very closely. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM !!!! Oh, and talking about shameless plugs ... Check out Jane Jensen's "Comic Book Whore" CD on Interscope. It's awesome!
