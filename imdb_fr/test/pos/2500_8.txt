This film was a sweet and unhealthy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie I do not usually like, but this one was just cute enough for me to stay interested. It was really funny at one point (probably why I loved it) and just as serious at another time. In addition, Ellen had her place and I always had a thing for her. <br /> <br /> By and large, the owner of a bookstore, Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. She thinks it's for her and goes crazy trying to find who sent it. She's sort of isolated from the world, so it really throws her into a loop. Finally, almost everyone who is in contact with her finds this letter and they all receive mixed signals, which creates really fun moments. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm not usually one for this type of movie, but I really hurt myself and I highly recommend it.
