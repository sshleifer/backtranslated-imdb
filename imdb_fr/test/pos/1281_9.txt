The directorial debut of Christopher Nolan is memorable. The film was very well received and helped to conclude contracts for the realization of "Memento", and rightly so. <br /> <br /> Here is an exquisite example of how films should be made. No fancy effects or drops of blood ... only brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writings. The actors, unknown to me and most people, I guess, did a good job of making the characters live. They were all credible and that's all they need. The film is confusing because it plays a lot with the timeline but in the end, it is very rewarding. The film is a bit short to be a feature film, but any extra length would ruin the style of the film and the brilliance of writing would have been reduced. Although short, the film has all the aspects that make an attractive movie (IMO): an intriguing start, an exciting medium and a surprising end. <br /> <br /> I daresay that the following is almost as good as Memento, his best film by far. The scrambled chronology is also mastered in both films, the incredible twists are present and the acting is very good. <br /> <br /> This film was made with a modest sum of $ 6,000, all) million dollars box office success. The use of b & w can be a hard pill to swallow for the general public. Here is Nolan who shows his talents to the bosses of the studio :-). And what are their skills ... I have rarely liked writing as much as in "Follow". Even Pi is not even close to the IMO, but it's also very good. <br /> <br /> It's a film that all respectable moviegoers should not miss. If you liked Memento, "follow" is definitely for you.
