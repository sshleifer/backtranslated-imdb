There was a video in America called "Cartoon Scandals" that featured about an hour of banned caricatures. <br /> <br /> Most of them were from the time of the Second World War. This is where I saw (and heard for the first time) this one. <br /> <br /> During the first dispatch, the rooster turns into a vulture with an Asian face that says: "Please, stand in line." After that, it's eight minutes of propaganda that unfolds as news. <br /> <br /> Racist visceral, but if you look at it as a piece of history, it can (and should) be forgiven. <Br /> <br /> Slice ration cards to make sandwiches. <br /> <br /> Show the ruins of Rome while calling Moussolini 'Ruin # 1'. '<br /> <br /> A minesweeper using a broom. <br /> <br /> A bomb inhabited with the pilot saying 'RET ME OUT OF ICI'. <br /> <br /> And of course, stereotypes. Every Japanese was drawn with big teeth, tirelessly, and saying "please" at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> The funniest bit? The air raid siren consisted of two bent men stabbing each other with pinpricks. "oooo-OOOOOO" <br /> <br /> Hey AOL. Let this one go out. It deserves to be noticed. My wife laughed about that. And she is 100% Japanese.
