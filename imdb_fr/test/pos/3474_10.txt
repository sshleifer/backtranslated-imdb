Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film, he delicately approaches a very delicate subject, but does not let the film turn into schmalz. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie, funny and sad bit and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see him now - FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent and Dublin plays a leading role. This film will change the way you look at people with disabilities and will also give you a very entertaining movie night. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD.
