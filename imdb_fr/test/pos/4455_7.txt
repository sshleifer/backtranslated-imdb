Located in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural Italy, it's a crazy affair. The landscape is perhaps quite picturesque, but there is madness here, hidden behind the mask of a person who looks outwardly normal. This person kills young children. <br /> <br /> This film, in style and tone, resembles the famous italian giallos of Dario Argento, these fascinating horror films whodunit, except that Argento's films are much more beautiful. However, the images of the film "Do not Torture a Duck" by Fulci are competent, with interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night reinforce the suspense in a sequence in which one of the "ducklings" is vulnerable on its own. <br /> <br /> In a sequence, the gore is a little excessive. But it's not a slasher movie. A legitimate theme underlies the story. And this theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms, not just the obvious delusional ideas of people who practice voodoo or black magic. <br /> <br /> The abundance of red herrings makes it difficult to solve the puzzle if the spectator does not assume an agenda on the part of the director. Do not send someone who might not seem to be a suspect. Twisting towards the end provides a wrong direction. However, in a mid-way scene, a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters, one of whom is the murderer. The finale of the film takes place on a beautiful mountain peak with the wind whistling in the background. We see flashbacks on clues and have a glimpse of the killer's state of mind. <br /> <br /> It's important for me to screen the film on a big screen. But ambient music is effective, and ranges from terrifying early music to understated jazz, to native Italian songs. To act is generally average, although in some cases it is a little exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Although not as visually brilliant as the Argento giallos, "Do not Torture A Duckling" is nevertheless a good film, contains a thematic scenario and enough puzzles to interest most people. viewers who love thrillers and mysteries of murder.
