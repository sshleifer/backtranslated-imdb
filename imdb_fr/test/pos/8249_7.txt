When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his parole officer found him a job at a major bank in the city. When some of the criminal mobsters of his past learn his position, they plan to exploit it and rob the bank. Pinky is first horrified by her desire to get straight to the point, but when a fate of destiny happens, Pinky begins to think that one should not look for a horse in the mouth. <br /> <br /> Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper {among others!}, This is an extremely enjoyable piece that is the quintessence of the 1970s. London and all its highly dubious modes illuminate like a Christmas tree in the clever hug of Ralph Thomas and Guy Elmes. If the viewer can accept David Niven as a former crime lord to vanity (it's not easy, I can tell you), then Nightingale Sang from Berkeley Square might surprise you. The actors do not shoot trees for sure, but it does not really hurt the image, it's a quality of honest fun that is never less than entertaining. The score and the soundtrack may be guilty of delirium during the dramatic crime scenes, but it's a minor complaint to let me think it's an underrated British gem. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan takes the leading role of Pinky (Oliver Tobias {a mass of hair} is there to keep the ladies interested, while the guys get the nice view of Elke Sommer and her exquisite legs in A decent clip containing a seriously rewarding finale, A Nightingale Sang at Berkeley Square deserves much better than the ridiculous 5.7 rating here on IMDb, but how many people have already seen it, I wonder ?, hmm, go for luck, it's good.
