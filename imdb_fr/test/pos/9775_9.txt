In a way, CHANGI lost in the AFI Awards in favor of MY BROTHER JACK. The latter, a high quality adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel, was remarkable - but, in my opinion, not as good as CHANGI. I have heard that many critics have rejected CHANGI as irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is exceptional. More than that. Brilliant. It's not supposed to be a documentary - I can forgive the survivors of Changi (or even all the survivors of a POW camp) for being disappointed with the production - but for all of us, CHANGI represents the remarkable power of camaraderie at the time of extreme adversity. It contains a part of the Australian culture that seems to be diminishing as times become easier and less difficult, but we should never forget: Australians were respected around the world after Gallipoli and the Second World War for their camaraderie and sense of humor. Rating: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE ROAD; THE LAST BALL; THE SUGAR FACTORY.
