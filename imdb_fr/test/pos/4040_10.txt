It's a wonderful movie and I still love it! It's so magical and fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so endearing, so real, you will love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will amaze you and put that little spark of magic in your life. <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone would care if the movie fits the book, I mean. the movie was amazing! I did not even read the book, and guess what? I do not care. In fact, if the film and the book are so different, you can just call them two separate stories and be happy. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was bloody! Bridget Fonda plays the Snow Queen, so nasty and so cold - just hate her. Chelsea Hobbs plays Gerda, a loving girl who is determined to find her love, no matter what, and embarks on a wonderful adventure. And I love all the sisters of the Snow Queen (the witch of the spring, the princess of the summer and the fall thief), they are so fun and so different in many ways. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for a while so forgive me if I make a small mistake ... but there is no doubt that I will always love this movie.
