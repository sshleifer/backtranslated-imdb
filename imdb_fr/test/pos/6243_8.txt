"Tourist Trap" is a fantastic horror movie of the 70s. The film is about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry and Molly, who travel by jeep in a desert area. Their two other friends, Eileen and his boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When a wheel falls flat, Woody takes him to a nearby gas station - and faces a horrible fate: a strange telecom chaos and scary dummies. Friends get tired of waiting for Woody and go to a local "tourist trap" manikin / wax museum. In front of the entrance, the car breaks down randomly and the girls find an oasis for swimming where they are approached by Mr. Slausen, who directs the attraction to the side of the road which is now closed. He takes them to the old Western wax museum and the girls stay at home while he and Jerry repair their car. Eileen, the curious of the two, walks in an old house next door, where she also falls into the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a group of life resembling models. After waiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly will pick her up. That's when the real horror begins and Mr. Slausen's masked brother, telekinetic (can move things with his mind) begins to kill the teens one by one, while controlling his large amount of mannequins transformed by the man. <br /> <Sound similar to the 2005 remake "House of Wax"? Well it is. I had heard about this film but I had never seen it when I saw "House of Wax", but I can now see the striking similarities between the two parts of the film - "Tourist Trap" obviously contributed a lot to the remake of "House of Wax". The models in this film are scary at first, some with moving eyeballs, others without eyes, and others with falling mouths singing too. The singing was extremely scary, if you ask me, and the dummies were strangely designed. The models are scary at first, they are so true but they are not really. The film closely mixes elements of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (the masks that the killer uses are similar to those of Leatherface), with some original "Wax House" and the telekinesis powers featured in "Carrie". The result is quite satisfactory. The telekinesis was a nice touch to the film, it made the murderer all the more threatening and unavoidable. The masks were terrifying and the plaster scene was really disturbing. <br /> <br /> The score of the film was really well done, even a bit overused in some scenes. The acting game may not be particularly comfortable, but it was not so bad. Chuck Connors was really good as Mr. Slauston's shadow, giving the character a suspicious and friendly feel. The young Tanya Roberts is also in the movie. She is best known for her role in "Charlie's Angels" and, more recently, in the sitcom "That '70s Show", playing the role of Donna's mother. Robert A. Burns is the Artistic Director. He did a phenomenal job on the original "Texas Chainsaw" and did a good job here, creating a cluttered atmosphere of mold in the ruined museum and the old house filled with mannequins. I find it a little strange that the original note of the film is PG. It sounds a little too scary to have such a docile note, but the movie is really not too violent. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Tourist Trap" is an extremely underestimated, extremely fast-paced and horrendous horror classic. Full Moon gave him a DVD worthy of his 20th birthday, the comment was interesting and the picture was clear and clear for the most part, better than the video versions. If you like the horror movies of the 70s, "Tourist Trap" is an underrated retro jewel. 8/10.
