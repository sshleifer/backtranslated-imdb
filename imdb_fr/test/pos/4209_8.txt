A beautiful film.The character of John Garfield is a distant relative of Jean Valjean of "Les Miserables", while the detective Rains remembers Javert of Victor Hugo, the ruthless arm of justice. <br /> <br /> incarnates the evil while the country and the nature represent a sanctuary, a redemption and a second chance for those whose life seems forever condemned.But even at the big day, a danger can appear suddenly, as shown by the excellent scene of the tank.John the actor who, as Leonard Maltin points out, should be rediscovered: none of his films disappointed me, with the exception of his role in "the gentleman agreement "but it was not his fault - gives a heartfelt performance from the heart and the public with him as soon as he is accused unfairly (the first footage shows a rather naughty hypocritical person, but all his ordeals are redeeming him and that we feel for him during the last scenes with Inspector Rains.Colorful characters (grandmother and children) a lot of joy of life that is necessary.Humor is also present in the game of strip poker as Dead kids End fleece a child nt rich. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
