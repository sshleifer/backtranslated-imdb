I think "Key West" could make a DVD. There are probably a lot of failed Star Treks that have never had a chance to succeed. We will never know if it could have been an excellent series. I would like to know if there is a way to see older series like this one or if it's just another Hollywood footnote. Is it possible to find copies of these programs so that we can enjoy them again? The series had a great talent for writing and some episodes, if not all, left you with an idea of ​​the characters that are often lacking in today's hit series. very unique characters. Thank you.
