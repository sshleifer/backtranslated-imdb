Having seen only once and at dawn, I can not forget this haunting film. A mixture of mystery, suspense and heartbreaking romance reminds me of Vertigo.The actors, although little known, are good, especially Joan Hackett in one of his best performances.You believe in her, in her love, freedom brought by his love, and in the end in his overwhelming grief. The plot is ingenious and convincing and does not tarnish credibility. Management and technical aspects could certainly be better, but they do not compromise the overall effect. And he has a message: do not let vengeance blind you, you can become the last victim. Too bad it has not been redone, but it may be a vintage piece that is better left alone.
