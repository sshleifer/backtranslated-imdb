The Black Castle is one of those films that has found its place in a collection by Boris Karloff and which, wrongly, is supposed to be a horror film. Although Nathan Juran's film contains elements of horror, it is actually a multi-genre play produced in a rigorous and effectively represented way. Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr, Rita Corday, John Hoyt and Michael Pate join Karloff. It is produced, unsurprisingly, from Universal International Pictures. The intrigue sees Greene's English gentleman going to the castle of the sinister Count von Bruno (McNally). He is following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends, a survey full of danger and surprise at every turn. <br /> <br /> It contains everything fans of the old sub-genre house / dark castle might wish for. . Real good and bad, a fair girl, dark recesses to perform dark acts, evil traps, a final end of the ticking and we even get a good old draft. The actors all perform well, especially Greene and McNally. While Jerry Sackheim's writing is thin and devoid of the unnecessary filler material that has so often bogged down in similar films of this ilk. A highly recommended film on the condition that Karloff fans understand that it's not really a Karloff film, and perhaps more importantly, that horror fans do not expect that the loss of blood is the order of the day. A beautiful atmospheric story with an impression of fear, The Black Castle is an exceptional visual experience. 7/10
