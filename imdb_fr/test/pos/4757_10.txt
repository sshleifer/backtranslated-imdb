"The Seven-Ups" seems to be a cover of "The French Connection", released two years earlier. The late Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco both make their appearance, as well as stuntman Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> But we are not dealing with French drug addicts; rather, we are dealing with a war against hoods and criminals after a cop was brutally killed by a thug. We see some annoyances and a New York City from before the 90's. <br /> <br /> I love to watch this movie because it's exciting to see the action and it reminds of cooler weather . That said, when comparing car chases, Mr. Hickman is involved in the three most compared: This movie, Bullitt and The French Connection. Each hunting scene has its own qualities, and this one is simply superb. <br /> <br /> And I'm glad this title was released on DVD.
