I saw this film for the first time a year and a half ago and I loved it. The DVD was bought last year for my birthday. It contains enough suspense, action and theater. This film is about a preparatory school, called The Regis School and its many rebellious children, in which a child, William Tepper (Sean Astin), struggles to adjust because of previous refusals from other schools because they could not control his rebellious act. terrorists take control of a school following a rebellion and the real reason is that the father of the leader of Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff) was sent to prison and that he will do everything, including killing students, put bombs and so on to recover his father. <br /> <br /> Alongside William Tepper, are his rebellious friends at the Regis School, including Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) in which this guy has a troubled past living in a mafia family and to be sent o Regis School because she hates her father for what he is and now has to deal with terrorists taking over terrorists, so William, Joey and their friends have to to unite these terrorists against acts of violence and dangerous tactics. <br /> <br /> This movie was really great and I think people should notice it more because when people think of a good movie as a hostage, they would say "Die Hard" and even if I should be agreement with them, they must recognize Toy Soldiers was a good thriller, it made me sick because the students are my age and I would be afraid to face terrorists like those if they took our school in hand. .. But overall, this movie is really worth 112 minutes of your time and if I had a decision to rent or buy it ... I WOULD LIKE TO BUY! I recommend it with a lot of hype! 8/10
