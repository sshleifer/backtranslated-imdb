An atypical Western, revisionist, which deserves to be watched. Despite a slow start, the film built ?? with almost no dialogue and no subtitles ?? an increasingly intense and almost existential portrait of life in the harsh environment of the Western Desert. The growth of the main characters is worth the wait, and the strong central distribution brings a real sense of desperation in the struggle for so important horse ownership. How interesting it was made by a British director. I hope he smiles now: I have the impression that the film was largely ignored by contemporaries; but time is working its usual alchemy, and the hidden gold shines as it should inevitably. A note shocked me: revisionism is pushed only so far. Sam Waterston in Indian? - Certainly, he plays his role with real emotion and intensity, but could not we find a single Native American actor to do the work? But her scenes with Caroline Langrishe have an intimacy that contrasts nicely with the immense landscape that surrounds them. <br /> <br /> Forget the big failing Hollywood versions of the past, men with big chins and swirling music; it is a primitive struggle between protagonists who, stripped of all the pitfalls of "ordinary" life, come to understand what is worth fighting. Impressive.
