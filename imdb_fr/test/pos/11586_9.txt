This film tells the real story of Ramon Sampedro, who has lived 27 years in bed after breaking his neck, and is fighting for legal permission to help someone who can help his death. > Javier Bardem is one of the best actors of his generation. Consider this: he has to wear this movie with only his face! Amazing that he did not even get an Oscar nomination. Now we can all see that the Academy is a joke! The support cast was great! The optimist Rosa, his lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Everyone has his opinion on the fact that Ramon wants to die. <br /> <br /> Whether you are for or against euthanasia, put your opinions aside, because this film deserves to be seen by people from all over the world! Halfway through the movie, I started crying and it did not stop until the credits. This film is so heartbreaking but also wonderful to watch and I can not wait to see it again. I give it a 9/10, and in my opinion it's by far the best movie of the year so far.
