"Rififi" is a great movie for the robbery, and it was shot afterwards. Jules Dassin had an idea of ​​the underground world in which these thieves live - you will not find here the Hollywood mirage of "Ocean's Eleven". The thieves of "Rififi" do not fly for the thrill, and they do not play a game. They steal to survive, to pay for the education of their children, to prove themselves and to prove to others that they still have something to to offer to the world. The highly praised praise scene is a biting nail, filmed in a virtual silence. I had the feeling that the plot lasted a little longer than necessary, but the high-speed race to deliver the child to his mother who finishes the film is classic. <br /> <br /> Be warned - This film is very dark. But it's also very good. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
