I can not deny, with other comments, that the plot is more about the romance between the characters of Mary Martin and Allan Jones, in the manner of "Showboat", than on the life of Victor Herbert. But in the 1930s, would that have been a draw? Instead of VH's life, it might have been VH's music. There is an abundance. <br /> <br /> For me, the thrill of the film touched the end of the film when Susanna Foster sang "Land of Romance". It's been more than 10 years since I just caught this movie in a local "old cinema". At first, the audience was stunned; then he burst into spontaneous applause. I remember the shivers that ran through my spine. My memory recalled the information provided to a curious audience by a local journalist when the film first aired in the late '30s. "This note struck by Miss Foster was well above the top C". <br /> <br /> She might not have four octaves at the Yma Sumac, but the teenager of the day certainly had a range!
