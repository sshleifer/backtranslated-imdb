I come from Texas and I live very close to Plano where the dead took place. So maybe I'm a bit of a fan of saying that "Wasted" is a movie you just can not forget. Stahl, Phoenix and Paul play all their characters with great realism. You really believe that it's everyday high school students who happen to be heroin addicts. The content of the drug is also treated very graphically - although everything that happens in the film is used for something, and that every moment, the spiral that follows more and more in the characters is heartbreaking. I recommend this movie to everyone. Once you look at him, he stays with you!
