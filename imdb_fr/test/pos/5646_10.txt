My first Ichikawa for many years, and the first of his war movies I saw, was startling and brutal from the start. In the very first scene, Tamura, the nominal hero, is told that he can not continue with his unit, to which he returned from the hospital. He apparently has TB? but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take, given the number of war wounded they have. But his old unit will not take him back either; his commander gives him a grenade and tells him that if he really feels hopeless about blowing himself up, it's an honorable thing to do. <br /> <br /> The Phillipines, 1945, and the situation seems really hopeless, for PFC Tamura and all the others. Nobi is an odyssey of hell or rather hell? barren forests, dead rock plains and dead and dying Japanese soldiers in the hope of an end, by peace or death. Ichikawa's film is shot in a breathtaking B & W setting that highlights both the desolation Tamura feels and the ones he encounters on his journey to his destiny, and shows how much they are all naked in the vastness of mountains and forests? ? This small business of humans will soon end, seems to say the Earth, but I will survive and I barely notice it. <br /> <br /> Tamura returns to the hospital, but is (unsurprisingly) rejected. and spend the rest of the movie staying alive, staying human and out of danger. He can not cope very well for any reason, starving and finally doing rather repulsive things. He ends up meeting two other desperate men who have lost or survived their units and resorted to cannibalism - and who, weakened by the other armed men, discovers that the only way to live is to break with everything 'he believes. Ichikawa's film is as brutal, uncompromising and intense as any war movie I've seen. There are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are ephemeral and do not remain etched in the memory, like the scene with the man at the top of the mountain who practically begs Tamura to eat his flesh - the recurring part of the black comic book with Tamura who exchange tattered shoes for the best leathers of a comrade fallen in battle - the degradations that a man will undergo to survive - the truth that it is about any war, all wars, of all humanity as long as we continue in this way. A masterpiece that I will probably not look at much longer. Watched through the beautiful DVD of the Criterion collection.
