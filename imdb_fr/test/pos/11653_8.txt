It's the most human and human film I've seen in a long time. Ironies abound, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a film that does not preach but does not condemn either. It's the best of cinema and yet the story is fictional from several real events. <br /> <br /> Which of the two is the most amazing, Sarandon or Penn? It is easy to say who is more friendly, but it is hard to say who is more convincing. they are simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> You may think that all killers should be killed or you can pretend that life without parole is not a life and that death is more lenient. whatever your personal feeling, this movie gives you a chance to pause and reflect on your thoughts. <br /> <br /> In the end, you just want to sit in silence and think. This is what a great drama does, it gives a catharsis, it creates a moment, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
