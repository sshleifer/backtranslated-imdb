Every show is excellent. Finally, a show about something other than why it is bad to be married or that beautiful people talk about why they are like normal people. Too bad it has been canceled. <br /> <br /> Mike Scully and Julie Thacker, formerly of The Simpsons, have written or produced some of the funniest episodes of this series and a lot of comedic humor. Take officer Steve Cox and think about Troy McClure. However, he has his own mark of humor and let's face it, a teenager will love that only by the faces. <br /> <br /> What is it with the television that cancels most good shows and we are spoon-fed with abominations such as Who did my mother almost sleep or whatever the name of the show? Please learn a lesson. Everything is not necessarily linked to kindness, romantic efforts or, in particular, reality TV to demystify all aspects of life. Some people like to laugh and not have to think afterwards. Well, my catch is over for the day. Now back to the Simpson. When is it? Oh yes! All the time.
