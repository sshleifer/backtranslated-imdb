It was such a beautiful movie. Such an incredible performance of Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and executed. A must see !! I cried almost all through the movie. It's a movie that every family should watch with their children. It teaches us all a very important lesson in life and tells us how we should approach the difficult subject of AIDS and teach our children to deal with it. and the people around them. Not only with AIDS, but with any terminal illness. I had not even heard of this movie until I scrolled through t.v. someday and managed to cross it. I recommend everyone to watch this, but do not forget your box of tissues. More movies should be made like this. Extremely comforting.
