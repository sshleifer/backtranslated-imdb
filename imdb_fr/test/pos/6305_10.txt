Maybe my note should have been a 9, but the movie absolutely stunned me during its first viewing and my last reading confirmed my initial conviction. Yes, each scene has been shaped with panoramic views, fantastic angles and perfect sound. <br /> <br /> Put yourself at the top of the role played by Toni Servillo, one of the most beautiful and charming women in the world. Olivia Magnani and a beautiful plot and you will end up reviewing this little masterpiece several times. <br /> <br /> The next Paulo Sorrentinos film "L'Amico De Famiglia", in competition this year at the Cannes Film Festival, will be eagerly awaited.
