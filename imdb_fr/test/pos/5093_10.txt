Peter O'Toole gives a brilliant performance in this film. I saw the original version with Robert Donat and I much prefer the performance of Peter O'Toole and the movie in general, even if it is a musical. I have never really seen anything from Mr. O'Toole that I do not like. It is a brilliant actor, with multiple talents, which gives performances full of passion and depth. Petula Clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the role. It's a comforting movie, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. I will always remember (with a phrase) the line where Mr. Chips regrets not having given his children and she says, "Of course, you have hundreds, all boys." Thank you for giving me the opportunity to vote for this film and give my opinion.
