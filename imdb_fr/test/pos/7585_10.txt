Horses on Mars is a wonderful journey undertaken by tiny creatures. You do not have to work hard to hold your attention and the characters are really memorable. Most of the credit goes to Eric Anderson for his choice of visual style and for writing an interesting story, but Anuj Majumdar also deserves credit for the narrative and the magnificent score. These choices were obviously not a coincidence. If you can, see it in 35mm for maximum impact. It's a very beautiful movie!
