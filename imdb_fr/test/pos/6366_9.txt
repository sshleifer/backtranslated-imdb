I agree with the comments already published on this site by the previous evaluator. <br /> <br /> I first came across this film in the 80s while working in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, many beards targeting the psychiatric profession hit hard. I particularly enjoyed the end, where the psychiatrist was talking through Grodin's door, hospitalized. Trust me, it's pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> Of course, the doors of most psychiatric hospitals are not locked, neither are straitjackets being used today, and any hospital MUST be allowed to have a "room" padded ". <br /> <br /> But a wonderfully underrated and certainly quite funny movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff
