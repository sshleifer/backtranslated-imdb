When Accepted's trailer arrived for the first time, many people started to be excited to see it ... really excited. Who could blame them, it seemed funny. But that's exactly the thing. People have gone into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted is not the type of movie meant to be a good movie. It's supposed to be a movie that will please the crowd without much effort. That being said, for those of you who were waiting for a great movie, you have to think about what you could do with a comedy like this one. Think about it and you'll really enjoy the movie (because you'll get rid of your idea that the movie will be fantastic.) SUMMARY: Watch the movie and have fun, but look for nothing revolutionary.
