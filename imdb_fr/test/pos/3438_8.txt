-It has Carla Gugino * yay * and an end of shit * boo * <br /> <br /> - "Jaded" is a very erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a city trying to escape from her past . She then finds two lesbians and after a few drinks, they decide to have fun. But one of the girls goes a little too far and rapes her while the second holds her back. She is discovered on the beach where the incident occurs the next day and is taken to the hospital. After that, we spend the rest of the movie watching her trying to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn new information about who she is and where she comes from and a little about her past. <br /> <br /> - Director and co-writer Caryn Krooth does a great job with this film, given her extremely low budget. It fits in the hand and sometimes looks like 16mm, but it fits the film since the story requires a stern look. The actors all do a good job with what they are given and there is really nothing to say about it. Carla Gugino is the star of the movie. In fact, she is naked in this film than she is in "Sin City". Christopher McDonald is also in the movie, but his character is really useless, but he's fun to watch. I have not really paid much attention to music because it does not really draw attention to itself, but it does the work with what it has. The film is rated R and it's for a very good reason. it's very sexual and very graphic sometimes. Sometimes it's mostly soft core, but the sex scenes are essential to the movie, so it does not seem like it's just for the sake of being there. Although there is a useless scene where we see Chris McDonald talking about it, this scene was a bit useless, but it's not really a problem, I suppose. The only flaw in the film is that we can not attend the lawsuit after all that we have experienced in the film. It's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something like that. <br /> <br /> - It's a shame that the talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature since that day. This is a very talented woman can do great things with a very small budget. I really hope she will be back in the game soon because she is an extraordinary director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema, but rather a nice film that shows a great director in the making. <br /> <br /> - Hide the children and close the curtains, you do not want people to do it I think you watch porn watching this movie.
