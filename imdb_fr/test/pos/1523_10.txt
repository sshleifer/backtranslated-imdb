It's the most difficult film I've ever seen ... the emotional content is horrible, but unforgettable. A woman accused of being a political activist is summoned for interrogation. The whole film revolves around his interrogation. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve Oscars for their performances.
