I described Woody Allen's Manhattan as perfect for someone the other day, and she thought it was a strange way to describe a movie ... <br /> <br /> I only saw one handle of movies that I would call perfect. Manhattan is one, Robert Altman's McCabe & Ms. Miller are another, and Once Upon a Time in the West, Sergio Leone is another film that, in my opinion, has reached perfection. There are a few others, but apart from the fact that I do not find any fault in the three that I mentioned, I must also admit that the three directors have acquired tastes. <br /> <br /> If there is a film that I could stay behind and bet that the house that I would show to anyone who would find it would find it flawlessly, it's shoulder-arm. <br /> <br /> City Lights, the dictator, The Gold Rush and even Pawnshop are 10 years old, but not just Chaplin all he has done is hilarious and touching beyond explanations.
