My main criticism is simply that it is not long enough or detailed. I would have liked to see more of everything: ship building, engineering, training, the first elevator in orbit, preparations for departure, Venus Orbital Injection, everything. I would have liked to see more of the first step, Venus to the Earth, instead of zipping it like a company bus # 10. In fact, I would have liked to see a series at the scale of Earth Story, with a full hour dedicated to each planet and perhaps another to the loop around the Sun. As it was, I was hungry. However, I understand the budgets and the attention span of viewers. <br /> <br /> Scientific analysis: Let's be fair with regard to the temporal shift of the speed of light: they mentioned at the beginning was a delay in the conversations, but they let that evaporate a once they have reached the outer planets. Some sort of conversation was to be presented to the viewers, and we must assume that the offset was removed for flavor reasons; so no complaints there. But zero for noisy spacecraft. The only movie in which space ships make no noise is the 2001 Kubrick movie. Even then, he used the sound of the breathing equipment in his helmets - which * was * quite effective. I wish the Space Odyssey designers realized how strange the sight of large rocket engines exploding in absolute silence could be, but alas, Pegasus is making the same noise as any other cardboard spaceship of any other SciFi film cardboard-based. > <br /> But the rest of the science was excellent. No complaints there, in fact, praise for bringing out radiation issues as well as they did. I just hope that having made this movie will not discourage the BBC from doing a really detailed version, but I guess it's not for next week or next year ...
