Having recently bought Universal's Marlene Dietrich DVD collection, I was somewhat reluctant to watch "Golden Earrings". The idea of ​​a 40-year-old Marlene Dietrich as a gypsy in a war romance seemed unusual and improbable. I should not have worried. With all the professional talent of these old movies, it's hard to miss this, really. The film was a joy to watch; it's a classic. <br /> <br /> Dietrich, who perfectly assumes the role of gypsy, is what is more interesting in the film. Makeup, lighting, photography and performance help create a truly memorable and memorable character. I had never seen Dietrich play a "good" woman convincingly before - but she does it here! She played a lot of heartless vampires in these great Sternberg movies. It is therefore refreshing to see her in a more down-to-earth, casual role, playing an exotic but very human character. beautiful romance. The love story is credible, optimistic and the happy ending is extremely satisfying.
