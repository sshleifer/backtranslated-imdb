I first saw it on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic movie that left a big impression on me. However, I saw him recently on Irish television and Roy Scheider added a narration ("we are going to need a bigger boat!"). It ruined the film for me. His resounding monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film and, if nothing comes from the brilliance of the film. I wonder if the new DVD version that does not have Roy (for legal reasons?) Would prevent people from buying it. Well, believe me, the movie is better for that! <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Damian
