William Wellmann, who directed one of the most exciting silent films of all time, "Wings" (1927), returns here to heaven with a heartbreaking new story of daring parades. Wellmann had been an ace in the First World War and no one knew biplanes like him. They are here, stuntmen, crashing, exploding in the air, with everything you can think of, as well as a fascinating glimpse of the 1932 commercial flight operations as well. And there's a good, strong story, excellently portrayed by the dark Richard Barthelmess (the silent star who made several movies with D. W. Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eilers is a real sizzler. What a relief to see a real woman with fire and character instead of one of those botox-based photofit models that play in today's Hollywood movies and all look identical. The story is sad, played with a real pathos and well directed. Towards the end of the film, there are extraordinarily thrilling danger and rescue scenes, and it must be the most ingenious blind landing in a thick fog that has been thought of. I do not dare to reveal the ingenious aspects of this episode. The character portrayed by Barthelmess is very much like Wellmann himself, a real fiery in the air. All fans of early aviation will love this movie. It's very gratifying for those who love good solid entertainment, love, tears in their eyes, and non-stop action, all combined with some kind of delicious Wellmann omelette.
