I remember watching this movie in 1981, when I was 7 years old. It was absolutely great! I found the DVD a few months ago. I was about to jump for joy! I bought it and showed it to my children. They loved him too. They asked what words the hippocampus was singing (I did not tell them, though, because I do not think that saying 'gay' and 'ecstasy' to 6 year olds is very good parent) The songs are brilliant. I still remember all. I will remember it again when I turn 60! Over there or so. Tommy Pender is (was) such a brilliant actor. Too bad he abandoned it. <br /> <br /> If you find the movie, buy it! You'll love it!
