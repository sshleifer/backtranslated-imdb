It must be my favorite movie. The scenario is precise and played to the limit by an excellent Miller and the fantastic Carlisle! Bright spirit, excellent story and without polish Hollywood; a totally immersible film that makes the bad guys dream! Stott excels again as a detestable Chance, while Liv Tyler really beats his other performances lighter than Rebecca, his thirst for thrills! The soundtrack may not be known by name, but anyone who has ever seen Top Gear, watched football, or watched a TV action sequence probably knows it, especially because of Craig's "Escape". Armstrong, who must allow him to never work again! The soundtrack of the first piece may seem out of place in a drama, action or costume comedy, but we can watch the show again, and it's perfectly comfortable to give the script its drama. <br /> <br /> My only complaint this film is that it is not shown enough on TV! Where is it? Really excellent, clean and stylish - you will not regret watching it - again and again! (come out to turn on the DVD player!)
