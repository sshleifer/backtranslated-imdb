ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-like rendition of the story based on how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg used his charming boy charm and played with admirable credibility, which he has done since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS. <br /> <br /> Stephen Herek, accustomed to musical-themed films, takes the audience through the wonders of the frantic lifestyle of an extinct species, the rock god in metal hair. "Izzy" by Wahlberg plays the role of the animator of the film that embodies the everyday man who sees his dream come true. His friendly character seduces quickly the heart of the spectator, who wants to see him succeed and has the chance to give him the sign of the hand "horn goat" metal several times. <br /> <br /> The only real complaint The story tells that the actors, namely the other members of the group, have not been fleshed out, nor even introduced correctly. More interaction with these long-time rock musicians would have amplified and solidified Izzy's new environment. <br /> <br /> Naturally, ROCK STAR is filled with good music. The score of Rabin, the original work of the Steel Dragon and many metal hits of the 80s make this soundtrack a must! Let's all hope that films like ROCK STAR not only give credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation, but also spark a much-needed renewal.
