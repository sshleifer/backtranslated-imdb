I live here in Croco territory and I remember the real events that inspired this film. Our guts fall every time we hear about a fang attack. BLACK WATER is simply the best movie on the hook I've ever seen. Although I loved ROGUE last year for all its effects and vivid scenes, it was the local scenes that captivated our audience. We laughed in ROGUE more than anything. BLACK WATER, however, has really resonated with the feeling of fear and fear that you can feel when you are alone in the mangroves (you call them marshes or bayous - but they are mangroves). All tourists should see this film before traveling to the Northern Territory. The end was a little disappointing after the rest of the movie, but I'll add it to my DVD collection as soon as it's available.
