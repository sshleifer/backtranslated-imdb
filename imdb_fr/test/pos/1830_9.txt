This movie is sweet - not disgusting, just warm and kind. I found it only slightly funny, and the premise * is * incredibly improbable, but the characters are so charming (especially that of Minnie Driver) that they caught my full attention from the beginning and quickly got my affection too . <br /> <Bonnie Hunt did a great job in her debut as a director, as well as a good job with writing. I highly recommend this movie and I will see it again, I'm sure.
