I'm a fan of Amanda since All That and she's still funny. Me too, it's as simple as that. If you like Bynes, you'll love this movie. It's harmless fun and quite funny in some parts. Sebastian's Vi's accent and silly manners are totally unrealistic but made me laugh so loud at times that I almost choked on my popcorn. <br /> <br /> And anything that can get teenagers to read Shakespeare (maybe) is a good thing for me. <br /> <br /> On a shallow note, Tatum Channing is pretty * ahem * extremely hot. He's also doing a good job with some of the film's most difficult scenes. <br /> <br /> Some side characters are VERY wide, but they are wide in "Twelfth Night", so it's cool.
