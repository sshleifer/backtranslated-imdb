When you think of "Oliver Stone", the movies that come to my mind would be his biggest and most controversial films like Platoon, JFK, Born On The Fourth Of July or Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio does not usually do it. It's a nice little movie, actually. Barry Champlain on his radio speaks in his microphone more than half of the film. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone's best movies and should NOT be missed. <br /> <br /> This is primarily a character study. Barry Champlain is a rude, self-destructive and risky talk show host. He says too much and starts having trouble with his boss, his lovers, his fans and even some Nazis. He does not like his audience and his interlocutors, and many do not like him (neither do they like him nor love him, but do not know why). But, in the end, he says on his show: "I guess we're stuck with each other." <br /> <br /> Watch Talk Radio, even if you do not like Oliver Stone's movies. You might be surprised. I was sure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
