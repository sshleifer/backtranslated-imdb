(r # 88) Brilliant, very entertaining show with spectacular effects. Any fan of these prehistoric reptiles must see it. The CGI integrates seamlessly with the environment and it's just fun to watch these giants wander in their daily affairs casually, like on the Discovery Channel. This show was a stroke of genius and he comes out of the water his followers "Walking with animals" and "The future is wild". <br /> <br /> The biggest episode is without a doubt the last one where we had the chance to watch the last days of the Tyrannosaur Rex and the meteor strike that sentenced them. This thing is almost too great for television. How about a theatrical release? I would pay anything to see these dinos at the movies. <br /> <br /> If you want a spectacular, engaging and informative show, this is for you. Dinosaurs have never been so cold.
