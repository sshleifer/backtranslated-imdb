I really liked North and South. I think it's one of the most lavish television series I've ever seen. The caliber of the cast is amazing, you have actors from the "golden age of cinema", personalities like James Stewart, Gene Kelly, Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons, as well as other actors who have been the new faces of the 80s, like Patrick Swayze. , James Read, Jonathan Frakes, Genius Francis, Philip Casnoff and Lesley-Anne Down. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the story is the friendship of two completely different men, there is Orry Main (Patrick Swayze) who is from the south and George Hazard (James Read) who comes from the north. Throughout the series, their friendship is continually threatened by differences in their origins, especially with regard to the treatment of slaves in the South (especially in the Orry plantation), but when everyone needs the other, they forget the arguments and help their friend. I really liked the chemistry between the two men and I was really interested to see if their friendship could survive the war. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the show showed what life was like before the war so that the public could see what were the factors that led to the war, what happened to the then the devastation of a torn nation and the rebuilding of the country. The war scenes were very well choreographed and very realistic for me. <br /> <br /> I think what's great is that it has so many elements that go through it, romance, history, battles that would interest most audiences, there's something for everyone tastes. I especially enjoyed the romance between Brett (Genie Francis) and Billy (Parker Stevenson / John Stockwell), especially when she faced her sister Ashton for the first time. The other novels were interesting because they were not all identical, everyone had something different from the others, which allowed me to look in particular at the stories of Madeline and Orry to see if they would be together at the end. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best American mini-series I've watched. The story contained the right balance between romance and the more serious story that was happening in the country at the time, but it is punctuated to perfection. The characters are very easy to look at and the places are beautiful and the music, especially at the beginning and end of the episode, is so good and fits the mood of the story.
