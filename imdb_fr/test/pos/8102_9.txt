With the Nazis coming to power in Eastern Europe in the late 1930s, Charles Chaplin focused on his reaction. The catalyst might well be a propaganda publication making Chaplin a Jewish sympathizer. In The Great Dictator, Chaplin created a merciless parody of Hitler, both funny and frightening. The film traces Hitler's experiences in the German army from the First World War to the present day. Simultaneously, Chaplin plays a Jewish barber who dresses like a tramp who leaves a hospital after a long time to discover how different the world is from the Nazi regime. <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's wife at Le temps, plays a Jewish girl whose family is oppressed in a Jewish ghetto. Jack Oakie plays a leading role, as an Oscar-nominated Mussolini (Benzini Napaloni) look-alike, which gives Chaplin adenoid Adenoid Hynkel plenty of choice. Henry Daniell is his regular as Garbitsch, Adenoid Hynkel's senior advisor. Chaplin wrote and directed the film and was nominated for an Oscar for his screenplay and acting. The film was also nominated for the best image. <br /> <br /> Chaplin put tremendous pressure on the film for obvious and less well-known reasons. He financed the film himself as a whole, because of the topics covered, and no other major film was made on Nazi Germany until then. The film spent about twenty-one months in production with Chaplin even to reconstruct a set and re-shoot a scene to get it right. At the time of the film's release in October 1940, the war in Europe was well advanced, Hitler conquering one country after another. The film became much more relevant when it was released than at the beginning of production. <br /> <br /> There is not much intrigue in watching the movie in retrospect; the film is more like a series of comedy sketches and / or mishaps combined to achieve a purpose independent of the film itself. Several examples of this are found in the last third of the film with the meeting between Hynkel and Napaloni. The scene is very very funny, but it leads nowhere in terms of intrigue. Likewise, the hairdresser and Schultz escape simply leads to the hairdresser's mistaken identity for Hynkel in order to give Chaplin (through the character of the hairdresser) the opportunity to pontificate to the public at the end of the film. On the other hand, what better way to assert the misplaced Narcissism of Aryan superiority than to confuse a Jewish Barber with Hynkel? <br /> <br /> However, the film contains many comic moments, such as the speech of the gathering, the new developments of the war (uniforms bulletproof, etc.), the scene of the dancing globe, the play of coin in the pudding scene and the movie. entire scenario between Hynkel and Napaloni (including the barber chair scene) to highly recommend the film. We can not forget the risks incurred by Chaplin by making his first talking film, an anti-Nazi film, and financing the film itself. *** 1/2 out of 4 stars.
