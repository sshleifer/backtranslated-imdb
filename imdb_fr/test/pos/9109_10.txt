Call all D-sciples! Catch your friends, go to the theater and discover this movie. From the opening sequence until the end of the credits, you will be out of breath. <br /> <br /> This film is a frantic race through the history of the D, and not just an exhaustive list of what they did, but a chronicle of their rise to power. I'm a big fan of Rage Kage (Kyle Gass) and Jables (Jack Black), so naturally, I loved the movie. <br /> <br /> It's useful to know the show they had and their first CD, but it's just as funny if you do not do it. From hilarious and vulgar lyrics to rock rhythms, massive pot consumption, cameos, to the absolute madness of the screenplay, it's a film for D-scules and beginners. <br /> <br /> Many of their songs are referenced, such as Two Kings, Tribute and Kielbasa in their many audio tracks such as Cock Push-ups, all fans of the audience will say coming in saying "That's F'ing hilarious! " I highly recommend this movie to all bodies that have been shaken. This film is certainly in competition for the next "This is Spinal Tap". One of the best ever.
