<br /> <br /> When I heard about it for the first time in 1997, over coffee with friends, I decided to check it. The only problem was that it was on a small screen in one of the cinemas in my area. <br /> <br /> That did not stop to see a movie just great, with a leading cast in Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie kept me stuck to my seat. <br /> <br /> I simply did not find any flaws in this great movie, I highly recommend it to those who love thrillers. I am very proud to have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I do not give it lightly).
