The film is excellent. The game, cinematography, direction and music are mesmerizing. It seems to me that the reason so many people attribute the film to such a low score is the dedication they have for the original 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. This movie - for a good reason! - generated an incredible level of commitment. In talking with people who saw the original on their first release, I think the impact resembled the first "Starwars" movie of modern times. I saw it. It was and it's wonderful. But that does not mean that this version is not as valid. From the first scene, the 1973 version catches you. The noise and turmoil are fantastic, especially because they prepare you for the calm of Shangri La. And the music of Burt Bacharach is magnificent. So, enjoy the 1937 version. But do not let it hurt your enjoyment of this 1973 version, any more than you would let King Kong of 1935 destroy Peter Jackson this year.
