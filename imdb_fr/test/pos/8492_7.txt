The year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four images addressing real events, real people, with more or less critical praise. Of the four photos that were the subject of the Oscars in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA and RAY), RAY became the big winner of the evening, the interim prize being awarded to Jamie Foxx for his interpretation of Ray Charles, a genius of R & B. <br /> <br /> And he was deserved despite the rapprochement of Leonardo DiCaprio and the non-appointment of Liam Neeson. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two played relatively obscure eccentrics. Ray Charles still played music until his death in 2004 and at that time no one knew at least one song that Charles had written. Jamie Foxx was much better than the film, which helped him overall, a little weak and often giving the impression that he would not be moved as a biopic on television, and his portrait is detailed because it is fierce. He has the delicate task of embodying a person in shades, and once Ray's addiction crisis with heroin has hit the head, Foxx is doing everything possible and it is not difficult to imagine the real Ray going through such a situation. painful test. <br /> <br /> The weak point of the film is how it spends a little too much time detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wants to establish that Ray had this hectic life, a product of his own demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a huge amount of luggage. Among the women, only Sharen Warren, Ray's mother, has managed to bring real life to life. Her role is difficult because she is alone on the screen with the child actor playing young Ray, but her facial and body language is heartbreaking, especially when she has to give up her motherhood for Ray to find his way. in the House. Such intensity of emotion, stay there and watch your blind son crawl into a room and force him to have this brutal awakening in independence. A great performance, and that should have been recognized. <br /> <br /> The music presented is a fantastic counterpoint to RAY. Those familiar with R & B will appreciate Ray's early recordings of radio hits as well as the following, which would put him at the forefront of popular music. Jamie Foxx virtually steals the series as he plays the songs as Ray. That alone will live even when the film itself is just a stiff biopic. I would have loved using their latest Adult Contemporary hit of 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in the ending credits. After all, it's Ray Charles, an artist who has devoted himself with fervor for his art.
