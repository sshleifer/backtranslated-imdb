It's unfortunate that this film is rated PG 13 - it really suits everyone - although young children may not follow it very well. <br /> <br /> It's part of this wonderful kind of serio-comic ghost / angel stories that should include everything from "It's a Wonderful Life" from Capra to Wenders' "Wings of Desire". <br /> <br /> The photography is superb, the acting of the first order, and - marvel of wonders - the tone is edifying. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. The two interlaced stories seem strangely mysterious at first; but they are resolving a little too well for my taste. As the director points out in his commentary on the DVD, all the ingredients of Irwin's story are on his bedside table. Symbolism is just a little too much for me. <br /> <br /> But what a lark! My favorite scene should be when the relocation team tries to have breakfast at a dinner party. It's practically theatrical in its magic - a subtle, playful and positively rhythmic play of spirit - combined with a striking cinematography and a sharp eye for the grotesque. <br /> "Northfork" is funny, touching, beautiful to watch, magical (with the above reservations) and does not have a single pursuit by car. <br /> <br /> A nine-star easy.
