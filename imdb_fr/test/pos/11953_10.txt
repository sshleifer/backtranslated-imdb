I really like everything that Savage Steve Holland, the writer / director of this great movie, does. See also "Better Off Dead" and "How I entered college". Wonderful! Anyway, this movie is really humorous and delivers unexpected things. In this movie, can you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwait as a twin? I recommend it to anyone looking for a great old comedy (George with the raft of turtles), not to mention a very well written sarcasm (the Christmas tree on the roof of the car). This film constantly throws you unexpected things even after seeing it 100 times like I did! Enjoy!
