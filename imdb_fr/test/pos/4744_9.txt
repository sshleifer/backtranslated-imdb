Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the hunting scene, but does not correspond to Bullitt's at all. Bullitt has a beginning that builds constructions. When McQueen leaves the shabby hotel, gets into his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now demolished) and notices the Charger sitting nearby, you know you're about to see something spectacular. From that moment, when McQueen starts this car, starts the best car chase sequence ever filmed. Lalo Schriffin is, if I remember correctly, a good sound track. It lasts a long time before hearing the first cries of the tires. This photo of McQueen's Mustang suddenly appearing in Bill Hickman's rear-view mirror is unparalleled for its visual impact. The look of surprise and double grip of Hickman really adds to the effect. Then, of course, San Francisco is unmatched when it comes to cars running in the hills and bends. In addition, Bullitt filmed in the '60s while the cars were still "hot" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) allowed a better wheelset than two boring Pontiacs loaded with smog devices in the 1970's Seven Ups. Bill Hickman was the driver of the nasty car in both movies. I saw him sitting at a glimpse of an insider movie once on the Univeral lot when I was doing movie reviews for a newspaper. However, they did try Seven Ups with the hunting scene. Seven players had some "jumps" over small hills (Yawn), but of course, they were not San Francisco hills. The pursuit of Seven Ups, where they go really fast, is longer than the quick sequence of Bullitt. But the one shot shotgun scene that totally blows Roy Schieders Pontiac's hood is up to the nonsense. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except that the film was shot in New York.
