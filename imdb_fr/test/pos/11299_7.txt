(The examination concerns the original version of the 1950s and not that of the 1980s restored) In a country where the king does not like anyone and no one likes the king, a shepherdess and a chimney sweep of two neighboring paintings come alive and escape. A portrait of the king, who loves the shepherdess, kills the true king and takes his place. A huge bird, the title wonderbird, acts like a hero and helps our two lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a strange and strange film ... not surrealistic, very very very surrealistic. <Br /> <br /> The style of the background is very European while the characters are Fliescher and Warner, but at the beginning arty Warner non-major characters. They act in a realistic and caricatural way. <br /> <br /> It's a strange film and it takes a bit to get in but Peter Ustinov, the bird is a riot, his children and his puppy are wonderful. There are cops in rubber ducks and a bear drawing that makes you smile. <br /> <br /> And there is a profound philosophy in the film about the existence of a world over there ... beyond an underground city of Metropolis. <br /> <br /> This is a really neat movie. There is something really strange and unique that rewards you if you stay with you all the way. It's not perfect, but God. <br /> <br /> It's a movie to discover. If your local business DVD has the capcom version (paired with Alice in Paris), buy it. It should cost you less than ten dollars, probably around five dollars, and the price is well worth it, especially if you realize that two comics, two short comics and several attractive commercials are on offer.
