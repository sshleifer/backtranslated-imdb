The film is not for everyone. Some might think that playing is bad when it's underrated and natural. There is no evil act and no moment of breathtaking beauty. There is a lot of indecision, a lot of conflicting feelings. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject, sex with minors. It's complex because the characters are trying to cope with love and sex as their bodies and hormones are developing and their spirit and personality are still developing. Complex also because society has a very simplistic view of sex with minors and complex, because the characters do not know if society is right or if their instinct is right. <br /> <br /> Some people will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. The question was, who was really in charge of the relationship, which was damaged, came out of it, was it art, which was even more damaged, some of the problems of their relationship stemmed from its prohibition by society, problems come from their own immaturity, and probably the most important, was it really a crime? <br /> <br /> The film is resolutely neutral on all this, and it is this neutrality that is its strength. This is the reason for the discreet play, the simple decorations, the lack of background music, subdued lighting and the general presentation "flat". The message is clear We do not really understand this type of relationship today, and quick judgments are necessarily superficial.
