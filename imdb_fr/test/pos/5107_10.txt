When it opened in London during the 1969 Christmas season, this musical version of the famous James Hilton story was crushed by critics. The same reception greeted him when he opened in the United States, prompting MGM to withdraw its Roadshow status and cut off almost all of its songs. What a mistake !!! <br /> <br /> Looked for years later, when the hip world of the '60s and' 70s folded in on itself, this version of GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS is pure delight. First, Peter O'Toole, as "Chipping", gives one of his greatest performances. Watch him go from the hated, cold and unemotional Latin teacher of a boarding school for boys to a man who can finally see the colors of the world (after getting married and marrying music star Catherine Briskit), is seeing a genius at work. (If you can, look at LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, THE WINTER LION, MY FAVORITE YEAR and the CHIPS back to back for days or weeks, then you'll see what a great actor is O'Toole and how beautiful he is in CHIPS .) <br /> <br /> Catherine, interpreted by the brilliant Petula Clark, at the height of her popularity, is the dream of man; beautiful, loving, understanding, with a beautiful voice to start. Most of the songs are beautiful and fit in perfectly with the story, while the staged by the late Herbert Ross brings the scene to life. <br /> <br /> This film may be a bit too romantic for some people, but for those looking for a beautifully performed, sung and directed love story, look no further. (If you can get the large-screen laser disc version, better yet, I'm looking forward to the debut of CHIPS on DVD.)
