Shtrafbat is the story that only Russians could tell about the Second World War. Ironically, the biggest front of the entire conflict was the least-seen subject on the big screen after the war. While the war effort of the Western Allies was described in almost every detail and every possible way, the East was left out or the work was left behind only by some old propaganda films hardly more valuable than historical images. <br /> <br /> There is no chance that Shtrafbat can compete with Band of Brothers in every detail, but you also do not want to watch the screen by looking at petty visual effects. That the soldiers are Russians is reason enough to forgive the less captivating battle scenes and you can concentrate on the most interesting story. The war on the Eastern Front and the nature of the Russian Army were so different that you could wish that people produce more theatrical performances from other fronts and armies. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat is by no means perfect. but he has some rare specialties that increase the overall rating. This tends to crush myths about the Second World War. The true heroes were the Russian people and not their leaders who had sent them on missions where they could only perish. Another great myth is that it presents the enemy, who does not take his weapon, as an equal human being, an advance difficult to try in many successful films. Shtrafbat shows how war on the Eastern Front was a war of survival and how the shock of -isms crushes people to dust.
