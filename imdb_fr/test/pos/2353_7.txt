What makes this one better than most "movie films" is that it does not feel phony. The film tells the story of the hard-headed director and his highs and lows, using real names and recognizable events during the silent and ancient sound eras. Instead of the generic business "the sound will bankrupt us", they actually show Jolson and "The Jazz Singer". The acting is really good, with credible performances by Don Ameche, Alice Faye and J. Edward Bromberg in particular.
