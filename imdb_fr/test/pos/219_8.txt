The creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker have their roots in improvisational theater in Madison, Wisconsin, I believe. They had a band called "Kentucky Fried Theater" (or something similar.) They put a series of their tracks on celluloid like "KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE" (1977), which was long, irreverent, sophomoric and really funny. <BR /> <br /> They followed with the very popular, PLANE! (1980), who really put them on the map. In this film, they played some well-known veteran actors of Robert Stack and (particularly) Leslie Nielsen, and put them in prominent roles, before parodying all the clichés of all aviation movies since John's time Wayne (Batjac) Production of THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (1954). * The pockets filled with cash and having been noticed, the trio reached an agreement with Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company TV Network for a half-hour comedy in front of the quasi-innumerable police show Drama came and are have been on our TV screens over the years. Recalling the excellent work that Mr. Leslie Nielsen had entrusted to AIRPLANE !, he was chosen to lead. <br /> <br /> As a sergeant / lieutenant / captain Frank Drebbin (the grade designation switch), he chaired a large series of word games, gags in sight, non-sequencers and clichés police / thorny criminals.All these are connected by seemingly standard scripts. Added to this is an overly dramatic opening narrative, expressed by information contradicting the visual printed information. They have always used this to give the titles of the episodes, where voices and printed titles never matched. <br /> <br /> They had an excellent musical score which, even if it was a little exaggerated, would be passed as a theme and accessory. The music, the first titles and the format in which the episodes were divided into Act I, Act II, Epilogue, etc., were all part of the obvious but loving logic of QM (Quinn Martin) Productions. (They even had the same advertiser as the real MM.) <br /> <br /> One thing that was not as short of a show was a technically enhanced laughter from the audience. And, boy, they certainly did not need false leaflets. The nature of the parody was such that it demanded close attention from the viewer, and this was the ultimate reason for the fall of POLICE SQUAD. <br /> <br /> Regarding the cancellation of the series, an ABC official explained that the episodes "... called too much attention from the viewer". So, is not that what we would like? <br /> <br /> Thus, after only 6 wonderfully wacky and hilarious episodes, POLICE SQUAD left for life after the end of the series, to be reborn in THE NAKED GUN trilogy, made for the big screen in theaters. cinema. Once again, they did very well at the box office. Well, the loss of television is a gain for the cinema, thanks to you, Mr. Director of TV Idiot! <br /> <br /> * THE HIGH AND MIGHTY was produced by the duke's producer, Batjac Productions, and published by Warner Brothers. He was unavailable for a number of years and, ultimately, Mr. Wayne's family made arrangements to broadcast it on television and video.
