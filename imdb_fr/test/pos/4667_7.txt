Italian work requires hours of clarity and no experience is required. It's a great morning and a good afternoon at the movies. The plot is good, but its progress is very simple and requires no thought process. These are car chases, explosions and all for the sole purpose of defeating "the villain" played by Edward Norton. For Norton, it seems that he is content to describe exactly the same characters as in his previous films such as "The Score". Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Warning: If you saw the trailer, then you saw the movie. If you are looking for entertainment at great prices, you need The Italian Job.
