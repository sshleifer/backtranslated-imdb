I really enjoyed this epic of Minghella, not as much as "The English Patient" (a modern classic). The first 20 minutes are not easy, but as Inman (Jude Law) embarks on the journey to regain his love, Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film is a giant step forward and becomes a thoughtful and memorable romantic drama. Apparently, it's fashionable to hate Kidman for the moment, but I do not agree with her at all, and she's doing well here. I actually think that the romance between Inman and Ada is poorly developed in the script (they do not spend a lot of time on the screen together to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman do everything they can to convince. Ada's journey is the crux of the film: she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything. At first, Zellweger seems to be wrong as Ruby, but after all, she grows up and shines in many of her later scenes. The film has a beautiful photography and scenography, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. Jack White, in particular, has the long, spiky hair and pale complexion of a rocker who looks completely out of place with the decor. Cillian Murphy fans will enjoy seeing the talented Irish actor very early, and Natalie Portman proves she can play in the most memorable sequence of the film. Too bad that in "The Other Boleyn Girl", it is so inadequate.
