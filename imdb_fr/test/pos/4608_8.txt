Universal Studios. The name evokes so many memories for horror lovers of beautiful matte paintings ... uh ... landscapes, foggy countryside, full moons, screaming wolves, taverns and crowds brandishing a torch. Yet, it is odd to see how long the era that produced the real classics has been. The 1930s had their masterpieces, but most came from the same directors, and many of their films are of historical interest today. The 40s produced more fun mornings than high-quality works of art, and most fans agree that the classic era of Gothic horror movies ended in 1945 with "House of Dracula Which was jostled with comedies Abbott & Costello and officially died by the 50s and the coming of the atomic age. <br /> <br /> It is strange that one of the most beautiful Gothic Universal was made in the 50s! That alone makes the film a quirk, since the costume costumes were about to be released EVERYWHERE. It may not be comparable to all-time classics such as James Whale's and The Wolfman's, but he's making all the fun stuff in these movies a delicious feast! Get ready for nothing but pure entertainment! Since various social mores have changed, the film is also engaging in violence that would not have been allowed before. there is no blood, but we see people being shot and stabbed directly, and there is even a burning torch in the face! <br /> <br /> The movie may not really be a horror movie, but it certainly has an atmosphere, a look and feel of one! It begins in the night with howling winds (and wolves) as two men seal the graves of two young lovers apparently dead, but wait! One of them is not dead, but he can not move! He is trapped, but speaks silently in his mind, unable to communicate! What is his story? This is how you start a horror movie .... <br /> <br /> The English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene, one of his best performances) leaves under the pseudonym Richard Beckett to investigate the disappearance of two of his friends who disappeared at the castle of the Austrian Count at an eye Von Bruno (Sacha Baron Cohen he saw that?). It seems that many years ago, Von Bruno introduced himself as a god to the natives of Africa to steal ivory. He was exposed by Burton's men and the natives disfigured him. Now he is thirsting for revenge. <br /> <br /> The film takes all the clichés: a walk in the manner of Jonathan Harker to the castle, an inn full of suspicious villagers, deadly traps and an imposing servant (Lon Chaney Jr.) The scenes Torture chamber are really full of suspense, including a panel in the ground that activates a dungeon door (making it an ingenious scene for a later getaway), a hunting expedition involving an imported panther (!!! ??) and even an alligator pit. ! And then there is the false death at the Romeo & Juliet that leads to the prologue of the film .... <br /> <br /> The plot is a cliché and the view of the world is in black and white. But it's still incredibly entertaining, director Nathan Juran making every scene look atmospheric and fresh and new. there are also many intrigues. Why is Ronald trying to leave the castle so early? And he never solves the mystery of what happened to his friends, although it's obvious, but he does not know it when he gives up and he seemed so sure of himself earlier. Bizarre. <br /> <br /> All actors are great. Despite his rudeness, Richard Greene makes Burton one of the friendliest protagonists I have ever seen in a horror movie. Rita Corday is excellent as a "peasant" of the count who becomes Burton's love interest. She may have the stereotypical problem "falling in love with a single look" of all the heroines of the film of that time, but her portrait of a woman who has been suffering for a long time. a loveless marriage with a sadistic monster is very convincing, it also shows a suspicion and few film heroines of that time do it, even seeing a forced attempt by Burton to calm her down (and sting her necklace, though as he has an important clue) as an attempt to rape, yet she never seems mean in her paranoia, the public sympathizes with her. Even if he fails to give Von Bruno a truly alien and supernatural appearance (he is after all a villain in a horror movie), Stephen McNally gives a truly frightening performance as a sadistic nobleman. When he reveals his burned eye and laughs madly, it's really scary. Lon Chaney Jr. is also excellent as his mute hand man Gargon. <br /> <br /> But the best performance is undeniably that of Boris Karloff as a mysterious doctor, Dr. Meissen. At first, he spends a little time on the screen, but he steals every scene in which he is. It's a terrifying, sad, mysterious and ultimately heroic performance. While grimacing badly as he applies leeches to one of Bruno's henchmen, he spies on our hero and speaks in the famous voice "You know I'm not doing well" that only Karloff could do , you wonder if he is a hero or a bad guy, always wading. And although he functions as the main agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human weaknesses such as greed and fear for his own life, even poisoning a man in cold blood for the benefit of Burton even before getting Burton's approval. His plan to help our heroes and our heroine to escape also places them directly in the clutches of Von Bruno as he organizes for them an incredibly sadistic death (so incredibly imperfect) that must have inspired similar scenes in the Poe series of Corman. It may not have much time on the screen, but it's easily one of the best performances of Boris. <br /> <br /> The end may seem abrupt and anti-climatic for some, but half the fun is there, and there is a lot of excitement to be had. Relax and relive the days when heroes were heroes and the bad guys were bad guys. It's not a masterpiece, but it's the pleasure of escape.
