Miyazaki has been making his mojo since the '70s, and it's only recently that his films have made their mark in the United States via Disney and fans love his great talent. Ponyo is no exception. Although some of his other films have been a little more accessible to the American public, some might find that this one a bit on the fence is somehow "Japanese" in his presentation. For the same reason, Pom Poko is VERY "Japanese" and does not make much sense to the American public, as well as * some * elements of Ponyo. This should not stop you from watching this fun film of growth, hope and friendship. <br /> <br /> What we notice is the very elaborate and magical animation of Miyazaki and his story that contains elements of wonder and fantasy. This is in addition to its characteristic use of character development and the often use of girls and women as main characters. He comes out a bit from his area with Ponyo because the main character is a little boy who lives in a small seaside village with his mother while his father is at work on the high seas. Although not alone, Sosuke is like any other curious boy who loves adventure and the lure of the sea. Similar to Spirited Away, we see the different worlds of humans and sea creatures and I feel that Miyazaki may be trying to attract the viewers' attention to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live under the sea and our acceptance of those things that are different. <br /> <br /> I managed to watch the subtitled version of this year and was delighted with the story and the script. Miyazaki claimed that "this is my last film" for many years, but shortly after Spirited Away, he gave us Howl's mobile castle. Ponyo is certainly proof that Miyazaki has not hung up and continues to delight, innovate and create the most creative animated films of all time. Look at Ponyo with an open mind and a hat tip to the fantasy and imagination of your childhood, and you'll be transported to catching fireflies and secret hiding places was more important than boring adult stuff and eating your vegetables.
