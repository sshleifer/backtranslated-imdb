Mysterious 1930s comedy about "The Crooked Circle", a group of hooded crooks who are preparing to plot the assassination of someone who vows to oppose it. A nice but really insignificant little film, the film works simply because the casting directed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (who will appear later in a couple of Hildegarde Withers movies after Edna Mae Oliver has retired from this series) and supported by a movie. great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I do not understand the lack of name). After an hour of breezes, the film does not make much sense with a mistaken identity, secret passages, ghostly music and people who are not what they seem. It's the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a late night when you're nostalgic of the late show.
