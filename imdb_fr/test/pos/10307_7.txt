The subject of the film is poignant and very real. It happened. One can debate some artistic freedoms taken by the director and the scriptwriter. The subject is what makes the film vibrate - nothing else. I saw the film for the first time after the real Phoolan, it was shot in New Delhi and served for several years as an elected MP in India. By the way, she was not the first untouchable woman elected to Parliament, as some reviewers have indicated. The so-called "untouchables" have been elected to the Indian Parliament for decades in reserved constituencies. <br /> <br /> While Shekhar Kapur, as a director, is a hero for many Indians because he has made commercially accepted international films - - "Bandit Queen" and "Elizabeth" (and a film for tolerable children called "Mister India", which was accepted by the average Indian public) --- and even got Oscar nominations for Elizabeth, I do not place him among the best Indian director. As director, he fails in all departments, except perhaps he achieves above-average performance of his actors. Subtlety, finesse, charm are not easy to find in his films - melodrama is in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> He had the idea to use the vocal rendering of the song by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan in the first parts of the film. perhaps its only major achievement on the undisputed soundtrack of "Bandit Queen". And then maybe the doors that crack during the sequence of gang rapes. Otherwise, the film looked like a spaghetti western mixing sex and violence, without the great music associated with them. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a living Indian filmmaker who makes a realistic film of international quality, it is not the films of Shekhar Kapur that you should see; these are the more recent works of three Indian filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Mrinal Sen and Girish Karnad, as well as "Umrao Jaan" by Muzaffar Ali. It is unfortunate that none of these directors benefited from the financial support that Kapur had to offer them and their films for an international audience. For example, Sen's "Oka oorie katha" made in Telugu or "Sadgati" by Satyajit Ray based on "Kafan" by Munshi Prem Chand are more comprehensive than films intended for a clever viewer dealing with the state of the untouchables in India. Sen did not have to resort to graphic sex and violence but simply suggested them. Of course, Sen's nugget did not make the headlines, while Kapur's efforts overwhelmed them. <br /> <br /> To the credit of Kapur, he speaks clearly and uses his limited talent and modest resources in the Mumbai film industry to take his products beyond the home. public. For this effort, I salute Kapur. But "Bandit Queen" will remain an exciting subject while waiting for an accomplished director.
