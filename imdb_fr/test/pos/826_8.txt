Like Steven Seagal, I am also a big fan of Van Damme and have followed most of his films since the beginning of his acting career. <br /> <br /> In this film, Van Damme assumes the role of Jack Robideaux, a cop who has just moved from New Orleans to New Mexico to work as part of the Border Patrol. Haunted by memories of his past, it is up to Jack to stop the activities of a group of former seals from the Navy who brought illegal drugs into the United States and killed his daughter. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this film to be very good, Van Damme is in very good shape for 48 years and can really move. The action scenes are very intense and the film even adds some twists to let you guess. Unfortunately, Van Damme does not have the same intensity as he had said 10 years ago, though The Shepherd: Border Control is the third solid film Van Damme has made by opening the door to a larger project. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to a fan of Van Damme or a fan of action movies in general; The Shepherd: Border Control is a fantastic movie, which is not as good as Death, but better than the Hard Corps. Make sure to try this one, you will not be disappointed.
