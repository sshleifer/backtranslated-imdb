It may be hard to say that as an unconditional Carlin fan, but the material, written and performed, in It's Bad for Ya is one of the best documents of the late era. At age 70, Carlin bounced back from Life's Worth Losing's desperation (and some of the stunts of the act itself) to become a special event that is firmly structured but loose and playful, or as much as the "old f * ** "can get and is continually, constantly, funny. And funny as to recall what some of us had been watching Back in Town or "Sick" the first time. The material, even if it seems to resonate sometimes in a shade of what has been done previously (that is to say everything about children in school and in the camps, as in the segment Children in sick ), is always fresh and with such a sting of truth that everyone ignites then (here) tickling the funny bone. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to the subject of death (how long to wait to wipe out a book name - six weeks, unless it's on a computer planner), the facets of communication, look from heaven, God's stains (of course), children and awkward gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have "rights" make up the bulk of the special, centered on the premise that which is bad for you, purely and simply, it's BS. Total, full BS, which, as we also know (or if you really learned it, you are like the kid waiting around the corner for a week after being dropped off at random by the parent) holds the country together. However, Carlin is not necessarily angry, even though disdain seems to show up in most rounds, if only to see how horrible the children's teeth are coming in. It is a skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is not going to be "well". <br /> <br /> The problem is this: Carlin is a disgusting, spiritual and uplifting humorous comedy, what Yoda is for Jedis everywhere, which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it is damn hard to find. At the very least, we hear the classic GC - outrageous lines and excerpts from this man's special comedy (or is he 14th), including the eyebrow-watching of those who play Mozart's music during a birth!
