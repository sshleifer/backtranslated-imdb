I totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who criticized the film. Having read the book, being impressed that it is a kind of literature that you can not really love (similar to Hubert Selby's writing), I expected to be shocked but the effect is more subtle than the one -this. Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to transmit a character on several levels. There are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and I can imagine few actresses who would do so well, with such contempt for their own reputation or image. There is this coldness, this distance, this cruelty and at the same time this impotence, this pain and this suffering. There is a person who controls and is controlled at the same time. This may not be realistic - even if, when you read the newspaper, you learn much less than that - it is, however, very difficult to bear. I think it's a great movie but I did not like watching. It's not boring but there are times when I wish it ended. BTW, his male counterpart is also very well played (and I think well chosen too).
