A visually graceful but interesting film is mainly the plot. The film depicts a zigzag progress in exploring the deepest feelings of the main actor. Max, who lives in New York for two years and intends to marry a girl he met, returns to Paris and makes an unexpected encounter with his ex-girlfriend, whom he still loves very much, but finally discovers the one he likes the most. is his best friend. Nonlinear narration therefore generates many flashbacks and each part is pretty well articulated. The three women Max has met symbolize something we need to continue, although we may not have a clear idea of ​​the underlying motivations. His fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he loves and, therefore, no loyalty we can see. It does not give him either love but only stability. True love can not be found in his relationship with the ex-girlfriend either. Just a fantasy for him to escape - a lot of very romantic things he did for her, but almost nothing seems appropriate. The one who really drives Max's life is actually his best friend. The balance reached at the end is not identical to the initial balance because Max understands much more about his deepest feeling. The nonlinear structure makes the progression of the search more complex. Not as ingenious as "Pulp Fiction" but things seem much more natural in "The Apartment". Max is not the only character who is undergoing a transformation and, in fact, Romane Bohringer's description is also interesting. Good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci very beautiful. A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a movie to see. <br /> <br />
