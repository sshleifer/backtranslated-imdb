The plot is a bit original, and all the actors did their job very well. There is a lot of comic relief, too. Some things do not make much sense (for example, the first scene of "pursuit", why would not the heroine hide somewhere and not wait for the bad guys to go away?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models covering about 50 years, and so the place seems strangely out of time. All in all, if you like thrillers, you'll probably like this one as well.
