I could not disagree more with those who say it's an ugly movie. My friend and I went to see him during the Stockholm Film Festival and it was actually one of my favorite movies during the festival. The dolls used in horror movies are not new, but I have not seen as many films where they were made as well as in this film. The atmosphere, the setting, the actors, the camera, everything is beautiful. And they work really well with each other. Now, if you expect this movie to be another Grudge or Ring, you probably will not like it. But if your outing for a good stylized fright, then it's perfect. Although it's quite predictable and sometimes laughable, I always recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies. Go see him. Now.
