I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the poor quality and the script. Ramgopal Verma films are an exception. It's a beautiful film with excellent performances from the actors. It's a must see movie for those who are tired of watching stupid stories of dance and love. The adaptation of the story and the customization were exceptional. You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. Based on the life of the Mumbai cop Daya Naik, this film deals more realistically. The film plunges into the life of the man of the people, that he has in addition to being a specialist of the meeting. I consider this one of the best movies of the year
