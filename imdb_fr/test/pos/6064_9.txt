This is one of the best non-English series I've seen. It combines interesting single and double episodes of crime solving with a personal aspect that you do not find in CSI. Individual characters all have a personal life that combines well with their daily work and sometimes interferes. In addition, all characters evolve naturally over the episodes. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb and has been recorded all over Denmark, giving a good example of the strengths that this majestic country has to offer. Unfortunately, only 32 episodes have been made, but they are a first rate television. Hoping they plan to do more episodes of the same caliber.
