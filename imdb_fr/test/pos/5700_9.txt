What a wonderful documentary - I sat down thinking it would sum up the bitch stories told in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, but it's actually a clear-eyed, glorious celebration of a strange and twisted era that spawned good movies . What struck me was the lack of bitterness that emerges from the director's interviews, since today the film industry is completely naze, while people like Friedkin and Coppola seem to have eyes that shine so positive, thus recalling their glory. The images of a public coming out of a projection of the exorcist during the day were invaluable. "It was traumatic," says one guy. A brilliant epitaph for the late Ted Demme, an exciting movie, I just wish it was longer - I could have seen a three-hour break from this movie.
