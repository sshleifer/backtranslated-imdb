I was happy that this film goes on all the supposed depth of too much pseudo-serious interracial movies. The race was a problem, yes, but class ... loyalty ... and honesty, etc. <br /> <br /> 'aspects of the appearance of one or the other character. Our divorces courts (on both sides of the Atlantic, are not they?) Are now filled with enough couples who have thought to "look good." together.' is all you need to make a solid marriage? in any case, the tenderness and sensuality of the two characters were thick enough to cut into scenes of love that would have brought a rainbow to any gloomy day! in other words, a lightweight film that is by no means a light film!
