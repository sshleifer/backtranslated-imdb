I have just seen this charming classic after many years, the last penultimate film of Henry Cornelius, who died three years later at the age of 45 (the age at which the star of the movie, Larry Harvey, also died 1973). Three future directors were part of the team: Jack Clayton (Associate Producer), Guy Green (Director of Photography) and Clive Donner (Editor). This film is based on the autobiographical story of British photographer Christopher Isherwood, "Goodbye to Berlin", which was first transformed into a play by John van Druten, then turned into a musical called "Cabaret". , and finally filmed as 'Cabaret', which caught the attention of the wonderful Liza Minelli, with her voice that can break a glass at a distance of one mile. Isherwood appears as a character in the film under his own name. He was gay, but at that time he was illegal and could drive him to jail. He thus conceals his inclinations by describing what he calls a "confirmed single". This is the key to his Platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric, wacky, seductive, always cheerful and unique character he calls Sally Bowles. The portrait of Sally Bowles in this film is a tour de force by the young Julie Harris, who sweeps each scene in a magical and captivating canvas with sparkling personal charm. What vehicle for an actress with a lot of charm! This is one of the great cinematographic performances of the 1950s. The young Lawrence Harvey plays Isherwood to perfection, in a well-judged performance that never allows the comedy to exceed the limits, and even the moments of pranking grazing the slapstick remain somehow "almost credible". Larry is so funny to portray a chimerical hypochondriac. How ironic, given the total lack of hypochondria demonstrated by his courage and stoicism in the last year of his life when he had died of end-stage stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and without complaining. I knew him well for the past three years or so, and he was a generous, warm and modest person. He adored his little daughter Domino, who unfortunately died so tragically. This film was his best start performance. He will be followed by his spectacular work in Room in the Top (1959), "Summer and Smoke" (1961) and "The Manchu Candidate" (1962). Larry was often underestimated during his life because he was too handsome, he often played the role of a cadet and glamorous boys were not always accepted as good actors, but many the best actresses were playing in front of him and they did not doubt his abilities. , and he played a leading role in several of the most important films of his time. Had he lived beyond middle age, he would have become more powerful and become a "big old man" on the screen. One day, sitting in his house at Hampstead, he offered me a glass of his usual white wine, drawn from a huge barrel he had brought from a foreign cellar. I said he always gave me such a delicious wine, what was it? He answered with pride that it was a Sancerre he had chosen himself at the vineyard in France and that he had sent specially. He added with extreme nostalgia: "You know, it's been four years since I waited for someone to tell me and ask me what it is, and you're the first person to do it." What mattered to him was to be recognized for tasting wine, and his more prestigious friends had refused him this satisfaction. In this film, Anton Diffring gives a moving first performance as a serious young man (he was later to play a much too important role in the hierarchy of Nazi officers), while the young Shelley Winters plays the role of a rich Jewish German but effective, but it was not too difficult, because it was still a noisy Jewish girl. This film has such an air of joie de vivre that it is pure delight.
