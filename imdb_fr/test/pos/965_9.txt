ALERT SPOIL !!!! It was my son's criticism of the film he wanted me to post. business. They team up with actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar and made it a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) must go to L.A. to pick him up. Jason's father does not believe he wrote this essay. So every time they see each other, Jason asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to call Jason's father because he wants his essay to be BACK !!!! Wolf does not make the film but the company president does it. In the end, the family and Kaylee see the film, directed by Wolf Pictures and based on a true story written by Jason Shepherd.
