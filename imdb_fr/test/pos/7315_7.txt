I found this one more chaotic than the average Stooges short film (as strange as it sounds). There were several fun pieces, especially the gags that were running ("Call Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!" Know), but also a little of that was taken with things that simply did not happen. no sense for me. I have to assume that these are usually excerpts from scenes from the movie "Men In White", but since I do not know much about this movie, I can not say for sure. Maybe if anyone could explain that, I would appreciate this short film more.
