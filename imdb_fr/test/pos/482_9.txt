Sometimes I'm convinced that the Mikado is Sullivan & Gilbert's best opera, but it's only as long as I do not listen to Iolanthe. Anyway, the Mikado is probably the most frequently performed opera. (Yes, I give priority to the composer Nobody says Hammerstein and Rodgers, nor Hart and Rodgers, nor Boito and Verdi, nor What's-His-Face and Strauss.You do not even hear the name of librettist for Offenbach, Suppe or Balfe, Gilbert was just the most important name (and the biggest ego) at that time, so they put his name first, and it's time for this silly practice to be abandoned. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Mikado is a compliment S & G Operetta It contains some of Sullivan's most catchy numbers, combined with some of Gilbert's most intelligent lyrics, an interesting book and a cheerful dialogue, a extraordinary degree of madness and leaves the door wide open to elaborate and whimsical costumes This particular production, shot in 1990 in a live performance, directs its imagination to a striking simplicity. at the end from the Art Nouveau period, it throws entirely on the japanerie of the original The result is costumed and put in a medley caressing the eyes the whites, the grays and the blacks, accented by occasional bursts of red (and less frequent uses yellow and green). It takes a while to get used to it, but it's really amazing. Of course, when the chorus tells you that they are gentlemen of Japan, you would be right to exclaim: "Oh, oh yes, Bah!" (Did I just say that?) It is very gratifying that this beautiful production is now on DVD. However, one caveat: the print seems to be photographed through a lens of imperfect sharpness, so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and even slightly fuzzy. The tendency to superimpose images is, unfortunately, annoying. Why do people who make a truly breathtaking production want to do away with some pretty crazy stuff? But it's the performance that counts the most. We can skip the opening because, although one is done, Sullivan has never written it. (It's true that he may have written nothing for any of the Savoys, but Mikado's openness does not even date from Sullivan's life and has been compiled by observing the techniques used in others.) Regarding the rest of the operetta, it's first rate and extremely funny. <br /> <br /> The Ko-Ko here is the estimable Eric Idle, who argues. It is traditional to call on a great name. It was an American television production a few years ago in which Ko-Ko was interpreted by Groucho Marx with mixed results. Idle's performance is deliciously strange ... it's "From a county jail" with a tennis racket. His "I have a small list" is written as speech in a microphone - of course, it contains the usual updated lyrics, which are much more funny than the usual series, and its rendering is positively hysterical. It continues everywhere. <br /> <br /> In this operetta, it is important to have a good Katisha; it's just not fun if you're not bored with style. This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer, in her almost as big a name as at rest. She blows with the best of them in a beautiful rich contralto ... wonderful, especially for a soprano. And his costume ... !!! (Not to mention his recital with Franz Liszt, apparently, accompanying him.) Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I have trouble moving, it's a little succulent, but my voice is undeniably a solid and rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a nice touch during "A Wand'ring Minstrel", where the chorus reacts with disgust at the mention of "his nancy on his knee" - keep in mind the Mikado's decree on flirtation. Anyway, Bottone is an excellent actor singing and if his appearance does not put the best face of Nanki-Poo, his performance will be as well. <br /> <br /> Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are suitably pretty and stupid. She and Bottone make beautiful duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his character like a bloke and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of the water ... a role played later in American sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers forced to take care of stupid children, this kind thing). The Mikado (Richard Angas) is a bloody wonder, with an imperious voice, in absolute contradiction with his ridiculous words. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend you get it as your only Mikado. Also get a good traditional production so you can see what Gilbert wanted (more or less) in terms of staging. That being said, I will look at this one twice while watching any traditional song once. All in all, it's a great offer, a vocal and visual delight, with delicious over-actors. It's a DVD to cherish, with dervish maids, tap fighters, etc. Watch the hunters with signs.
