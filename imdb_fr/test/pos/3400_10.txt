I had always heard about this wonderful mini-series, but I watched it for the first time this week, in July 2007. I understand why it started the career of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful perspectives on the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and the evolution of their lives during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me understand how people thought in the 19th century. Many historical facts have been incorporated into history and it was interesting to see history books come to life. The costumes and sets were beautiful! I really enjoyed watching both parts I and II. The third part is a disappointment.
