I love this show !!!!!!!, essentially the improved version of the simpsons Fox (cau'se, the simpsons are very dry if you are over 9. It's political, irrational and irresistible. who say they do not like it lie, there is a character for everyone Peter, Stewie and Quagmire are my favorites Peter because he is rude, heinous and fearless Stewie because of his incredible intelligence and the way it strikes you with something an adult would say when you least expect it, and the quagmire because one of the guilty pleasures is a dirty joke.There is also an episode for everyone too. If you are a politician, there is Mr. Griffin going to Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3) If you like sex and body humor, it's impossible to broadcast it (VOL.2 SEASON 3.) Or, if you like any other kind of humor, there's damn Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2). Basically, what I mean is that when we watch this show, there is humor that doubles up for everyone. GOOOOO GIGGITY!
