I loved this film. To be very fair, the film starts very slowly, none of the characters being terribly friendly. This continues for a good half of the film. <br /> <br /> But if you are patient, you will be greatly rewarded. What is missing in the first half of the film in terms of character development and / or sympathy is adequately compensated in the second half. It's like climbing a roller coaster: a slow and difficult climb, then a speed, twists and surprises. <br /> <br /> As usual, Meryl Streep is beautiful. She is the best actress of our time. William Hurt is good, even if he is a bit woody in places. Renee Zellweger does a very good job, showing that her performance in Jerry McGuire was not a coincidence.
