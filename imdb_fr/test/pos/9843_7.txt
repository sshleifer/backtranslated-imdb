James Cagney (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) had just started his career and was able to perform as a gangster and social worker in a Boys Reform School run by corrupt politicians. Inmates in Reform schools are underprivileged miners on New York streets, like the "East Side Kids" who were poor and neglected during the Great Depression. In the final scenes, the Reform School students hold a trial with torches and a burned barn and a big jump by the corrupt guardian. I noticed that they first let the horses out of the barn. This movie is not shown very often and I can really understand WHY!
