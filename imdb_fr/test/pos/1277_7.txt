Here is a little known British film from 1998, made with a budget of Â£ 8,000 and a duration of 70 minutes. When you look at him, you never expect his director to go on to Hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the 21st century. Well, everyone has to start somewhere, I guess. <br /> <br /> The director of Follow, as you probably already know, is Englishman Christopher Nolan, who immediately afterwards directed the critically acclaimed independent film Memento; A few years later, he would be hired by Warner Bros. to lead the new Batman series, which has earned him many accolades, and so on. My point is, everyone has to start somewhere ?? even if it's not in the most amazing beginnings ?? and Christopher Nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with Follow. <br /> <br /> When I look at it, I can not help but look like another first film, Eraserhead from the forefront of author David Lynch. What follows is not a surreal psychological horror film, but the similarities are noticeable. Most notably, it is shot in grainy black and white and exudes an atmosphere that makes it unique. It's hard to describe with words, but it looks vaguely like the smoky atmosphere found in the dark movies of the past. Therefore, we can say that Follow is a contemporary black film or a neo-black. All in all, it's a fusion of that and a psychological thriller, and the story is the one that best suits these two genres. <br /> <br /> The main character has no name and the title of the film stems from an old obsessive-compulsive trait. he had ?? randomly choose people on the street and follow them, sometimes even for hours. During one of these "stalking expeditions", the main character is noticed by one of the people he follows and faces. It turns out that the "confrontator" is a man who is ready to befriend our narrator and he introduces himself; his name is Cobb, and it is a little burglar who invites the narrator to follow him in his burglaries. <br /> <br /> From here, the main character is swept away by the world of Cobb and he is immersed in crime, passion. and violence as he becomes more and more intimate with Cobb. What follows is not really a character study, but rather a film that follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator. Nolan manages to make the film look like a black film and to emulate the respective atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As a thriller, the rest is tense and atmospheric; However, as a movie in general, it's a bit of a disappointment. If that's not it, then we could certainly call it disappointing. The entire film is shot in a non-chronological and non-linear way, and makes the story and the film experience unique, to some extent ?? this style has been done so many times now that it is almost banal? and history itself is unique to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> However, the result is ultimately disappointing for the whole film and it is unfortunately not spectacular. The story calls for more ?? more action, more suspense and more thrills ?? but he is too involved in his own scenario and focuses instead on creating a complex story. After that succeeds, but without other elements, it is a film noir that does not quite work. there is a sensation of emptiness which is not enormous, but which nevertheless remains perceptible. In addition, the shocking revelation of the film in the end ?? almost a mandatory convention in black movies ?? is the one who makes us feel deceived; it's unpredictable and it comes out of nowhere, but in relation to the story, it's disappointing, because it essentially gives the previous scenes, and the film as a whole, a huge loss of time. <br /> <br /> But the good things are far away. outweighs the disadvantages, and in the end, the next film is an imperfect yet satisfying film. Yes, everyone has to start somewhere. Christopher Nolan does it with Follow, and he does it well. A calm, gentle but fine way. This is not the most breathtaking film, and it does not deserve the praise that the director will receive afterwards, but it's still a good movie. By selecting, you find a thriller well done, tense and atmospheric, lacking significant nuance or innovative style, but still manages to capture the public.
