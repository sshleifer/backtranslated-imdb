It is a risky business to shoot such a lavish production of "The Venice Merchant". It could be a wooden piece, period, or laughable for its excesses. This version is neither. Although I am not completely sold by Al Pancino's highly successful Shylock, he gives a competent and honorable performance. Jeremy Iron, Antonio, is as always with his tortured, fascinating roles. Some of the minor roles seemed to be a bit to the most in the spirit of tumultuous entertainment, "a boy's own Venetian adventure story," but the central plot is effectively and sympathetically advanced in the film. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the shots, the costumes and the interiors were breathtaking, almost to the point of distracting. <br /> <br /> One thing I do not want to comment on is anti-emetic. content of the room. The film is as sympathetic as possible to the plight of the Jews, while still describing Shylock as an instrument of its own destruction. It is a sad comment that four centuries later, the director of this film deemed it necessary to comment on his nuanced vision before the first screening at the Toronto Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful film, and I look forward to several views.
