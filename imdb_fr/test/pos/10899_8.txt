"Lonely among us" is certainly one of the best episodes of the first season. The scenario, although somewhat confusing, creates a lot of suspense, supported by the scary soundtrack driven by a synthesizer. This is a typical scenario of "extraterrestrial invasion by a foreign body", but which ultimately gives no perverse purpose (the death of Assistant Chief Engineer Singh was an accident for me). The two delegated species offer an entertaining setting (best makeup so far), finally adding a bit of dark humor to the series (the final scene). Patrick Stewart obviously likes to go out a bit of his Picard character and explore new terrains, just like Data pretending to be Sherlock Holmes (another classic of all time). The special effects are also convincing and director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first to try to compensate for the lack of actress ability of Three by improving his appearance. She is very beautiful in some scenes and the collar of her dress improves her appearance a lot. Picard's "flash scene" on the bridge gives him a slight air of Emperor Star Wars "The Return of the Jedi" (which is a personal impression but that made me smile). <br /> <br /> There are also games with the lighting of the corridors (simulating the night on board) and the first moving camera, which was withdrawn from Picard when he entered the teleport room to to project in the cloud ... Nice work. The intelligent cutting, creating a continuous dialogue through different scenes (Troi hypnosis report), gives the impression of a really well-designed TNG episode. The first, where even Wesley Crusher seemed almost tolerable ... <br /> <br /> The end is a bit confusing, however, as if the producers were running out of time. "P for Picard" is a little exaggerated and his return much too easy, but we can leave aside the many strong moments that this episode has to offer ...
