I am so happy not to live in a small American city. Because every time I'm shown a small town in the United States, it's populated by all sorts of monsters, including hungry zombies, devilish extraterrestrials, and sinister ghosts that are harmless. In this film, a former doctor, who has just committed the accidental murder of his wife in a car accident, directs his steps towards the nearest small town - he has never seen a film shoot in a small town - what happens to be the apartments in Purgatory. And of course, as soon as he gets there, all hell is unleashed. He meets a blonde chick who, among all the creatures, looks more like a cow by facial expressions than by the functioning of her brain and immediately falls in love with her. But there is a small handicap, she is already married to a tiny drug dealer who, in one minute, is shot a pitiful bullet, not dead. To find out what came out of all this, you should watch the movie for yourself. I'm just going to tell you that this is a bit reminiscent of Oliver Stone's U Turn, but it's a way to fall into all the artistic properties.
