I saw this documentary for the first time in the UK in the 1980s, and I found myself puzzled and astonished at how such good intentions could go wrong. Previous commentators (who are Australian) have explained the detail of the developing conspiracy better than I could have done before, but I would like to make an observation about what may be behind the British sovereign power of the governor general. All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist and become law. This being the case, and if Conner's / Khemlani's mess had eventually been put in place (how many businessmen / million people had been served by Khemlani, presumably without a complaint), the Labor government could have been the victim of a "trap", which surely should have been investigated by the Governor General, until he could see that the budget impasse was a real result of Whitlam's immodesty and NOT a complex trap, sponsored by "the unknown person or person"! If this is the case that Kerr really does not have to refer to the law because tax circumstances prevail over everything, then "royal power" borders on unreason; the implications in all Commonwealth countries are that the "tax rules" in the literal sense, and that any person or organization has the White Card to violate any other rule, physical or mental, as long as it ultimately controls the cords of the stock market!
