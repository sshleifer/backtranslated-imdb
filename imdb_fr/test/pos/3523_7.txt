Mountainous woods, happy young campers, a park warden's warning and a hidden figure. The ingredients are there for a horror pleasure, and director / co-writer Jeff Lieberman is doing an adequate job to achieve this. It is a typical forest horror, but in most cases the execution is at the top of the game and the story (which is quite basic in a cut sense) is told with a certain realism. A little more exposure may not have gone astray, but Lieberman's know-how compensates for the flaws of the material, the typical details, the rising tension, the moody images and the stifling atmosphere created by the very disturbing score of Brad Fiedel. Whenever this very terrifying whistle was announced, it gave a really disconcerting impression that settled in the beautiful background. Directors of Photography Dean M. and Joel King are also doing a great job. There is a lot of style, even with its minimal range and slow structure. Sometimes, the pace can become a stop case. This is not particularly violent, but there is always an obvious middle line even though it sometimes happens on the screen. These last scenes of pursuit and escalation of fear are welcome, as darkness comes alive more and more and actor George Kennedy rides his white horse in a light but wonderful twist. There is a lot of nice performances; Deborah Benson is a strong and dynamic heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon, Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin and Katie Powell complete a modest distribution of credible deliveries. The final climax is rather crooked, but the end is one of those types that make you think ?? "Is that right?" <br /> <br /> A well torn object in the undergrowth, which probably plays it a bit too safe to really distinguish it from the norm.
