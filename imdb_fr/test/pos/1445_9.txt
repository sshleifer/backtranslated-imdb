Otto Preminger was one of the great non-conformist directors. Like John Huston, he was a character from one of his own movies. Like Mr. Huston, he was a wonderful ham that crept into random performance, but the end result of his work was: unquestionably his. With a few exceptions, films are now produced by companies, not by individuals, and are therefore generally highly polished "wrappings", a product that looks a lot like a golf ball, a box of dog food or a car. The involvement of the human being in the process is almost incidental. The appetite for the product is such that there is no end to the range of well finished, brilliant, superficially entertaining but ultimately empty films that flood countless TV channels and movies. There is no time for a man like Mr. Preminger to get away from the torrent of "product" and create a personal work of art. Of course, there has always been the ethic of "art for art - money for the sake of Christ" in making movies, but now, "Ars Gratia Artis" has been, in all cases except his name, referred to the floor of history. Today, Otto Preminger would be lucky to find a job in providing pizzas in Hollywood. Half a century ago, after having made very influential "Laura", "Where the sidewalk ends" and "The moon is blue", he began to film the controversial novel by Nelson Algren, "The man with the arm "in his eccentric and individualistic style. Rather than taking his camera out on the streets, he stays in the studio and uses stylistic, almost expressionist scenes, an eccentric cast (Frank Sinatra - very emotional about his success in "From Here to Eternity", the young inexperienced but breathtaking lady Kim Novak and Mr. Arnold Stang, a man whose quirks are in his heart) and a remarkable era - Elmer Bernstein's defining score featuring the cream of West Coast jazzmen. A film by Otto Preminger was always a complete experience, to be considered as a whole rather than to break it down into an actor, director, photographer. What appeared on the screen was Preminger's vision, his creation and interpretation of Algren's novel, and not Algren's novel film, one of twenty competent Hollywood experts could have produced it. From the first Charleston cymbal sound that accompanies Saul Bass's iconic title sequence, we find ourselves in Preminger's interpretation of what is now called "The Life", actually a dark area occupied by prostitutes. , drug addicts, gendarmes, drug traffickers, stone players, jazz musicians, their wives and their hangers. The lines are blurry in "The Life", and his dog is eating a dog there. The inhabitants surround themselves as sharks, looking for a sign of weakness to exploit. Frankie Machine (Mr. Sinatra), professional dealer of cards, ex-junkie and aspiring jazz drummer is a victim born. When things get complicated, he goes back to the house. Although he's used to getting into the habit of avoiding cold turkey, there is no guarantee that he will not come back later. Mr. Sinatra's description of an abandoned addict has divided critics, but the fact is that even fifty years later, most of us had probably never seen such a thing in real life . So we do not know how much it was. When I first saw the movie in the late '50s, I was very impressed. I saw it recently on video, it seems, to say it maliciously, hammy. Perhaps he is a victim of his own success, because many actors "do" thereafter the cold turkey have, over the years, resumed and perfected his performance. Arnold Stang is remarkable as a friend of Machine Sparrow, a performance he only surpassed in "It's a mad world, crazy, crazy, crazy". Try to watch it on the big screen and see it as the cinematic vision of a real author, a giant among the pygmies of today - Otto Preminger.
