This film is basically a parody about Hitchcock's Strangers on a train, which, in my opinion, was overestimated anyway. In the plot, Danny Devito goes to see Strangers, then thinks that Billy Crystal wants them to exchange murders, For Crystal murders his mother and Devito murders his wife. Devito and Crystal are great, as is Devito's mother. It's Devito's first film and it's better than the Pink War.
