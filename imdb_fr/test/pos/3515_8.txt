I did not have high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I do not know why I continue to buy these slasher movies when I know it's always the same every time. Maybe I'm a little masochist? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it's nothing original. Yes, this is a small group of teenagers going camping, drinking and having sex in the woods. Yes, they are killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic! This is one of the best experiences I have had watching a slasher movie. The places where he is shot are really wonderful. You see mountains, waterfalls, rocks. It's just amazing. It takes a very long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but I did not care! It was nice to watch enough not to worry about it. What I mean is that you will not sit there waiting for the killings to begin, because everything that happens is nice because of the beauty of the movie itself. The end is a little weird, but I will not tell you more. You will know what I mean. Another thing that I liked: the characters interest you. They are not just a bunch of jerks who spend their time bickering. Of course, these are pure stereotypes of the usual slasher characters, but they have something special. Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you'll have a great time watching it because I really did!
