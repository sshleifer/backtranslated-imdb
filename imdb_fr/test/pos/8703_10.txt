I watched this movie for the first time years ago with my daughter, who is now 13 years old and has fallen in love with the vampire. we both thought it was a high-end film, then looked under 11 then under 111, I find that there is a submarine on which I can not wait to get my fangs, and that there is also a fifth in the pipeline. if no one has seen the movies. They are the best of the best. I think he deserves thousands of Oscars. I could watch them from morning to night. I'd love to have nails like him, watch out for girls. I love it because all the stories continue from one film to another. these typical vampire movies are better. I would like to live in the life that projects in the movies. all my dreams would become reality
