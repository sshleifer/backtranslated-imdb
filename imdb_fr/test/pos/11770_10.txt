It's a great movie, and if you have not seen it, you should go to the video store right away and rent it. First of all, the casting is superb. Not only does he have current stars, like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but he also has your old stars like Judge Reinhold. It also features many cameos such as Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second, the story was pretty good too. It was interesting to see how they took a plot for a stoner movie and made it almost dramatic. He takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving him a comic face as in "Half Baked", he has a real life lesson image like "Traffic." So watch this movie, if you are a stoner, it will give you a glimpse of something you like, if you do not use drugs, it will give you a more realistic view of the drug than either side do not want you to see.
