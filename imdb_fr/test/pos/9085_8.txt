Nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to put him to death and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is life after death. That's what they did and soon enough, all medical students want to know if there is life after death. The afterlife is not about doors and pearl lights at the end of the tunnel, but something more sinister. <br /> <br /> The ghosts of the past come back to haunt them and this movie will surely haunt everyone. There are some pretty scary moments that could translate into real life and it makes people wonder a little about what happens when you die. It's a good movie to watch when it rains and you feel depressed. It's also a little weird. <br /> <br /> See it with a haunted past.
