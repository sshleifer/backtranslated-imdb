Knute Rockne has led an extraordinary life and his story is pretty well told in Knute Rockne All American. We follow the incredible journey of Rockne, the young Norwegian to the legend of American football. Produced in 1940, the film can sometimes seem a bit dated and sometimes downright hokey. And the filmmakers sometimes support it a little thick while Rockne is described with brilliance and love. You may think that Rockne should have been named for holiness when he was actually just a football coach. But it is undeniable that he has had a huge impact on football as well as a huge impact on the lives of so many young men he has coached. This film shows the tremendous impact he has had and gives you an idea of ​​why he is so revered so far. <br /> <br /> In the role of Rockne, Pat O'Brien gives an impressive performance. It is unquestionably O'Brien's film to wear and he appropriates the film and the character. Rockne's real life was known to be a great source of inspiration and O'Brien's performance will make you understand why. The only slight criticism comes at the beginning of the film when O'Brien, in his forties, plays the role of the Rockne university student in his twenties. The whole composition of the world was not going to make that credible and the effect is rather shocking. However, as Rockne's character gets older and begins his legendary coaching career, O'Brien fits the room perfectly. charismatic, but ultimately sentenced football star George Gipp. In the grand scheme of the film, it's not really important, Reagan not appearing more than 10 to 15 minutes. But the show became legendary thanks to Reagan's famous "Earn One for the Gipper" speech. It's a brilliantly played scene, full of emotion. Reagan may not have spent a lot of time on the screen in this film, but he certainly had an extremely positive impact on a winning performance. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film balances football and life in general with Rockne having good lessons for his young men in both regions. For football fans (and history buffs), there is a rare treat as archival footage from Notre Dame games from the Rockne era is scattered throughout the film. This is a rare opportunity to see how the game has evolved over the past six decades and to see Rockne's legendary strategic innovations put into practice. If you are a fan of Notre Dame, you will probably appreciate the fact that the Victory March of Notre Dame offers a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film. If you're a hater of Notre Dame ... well, then you probably do not watch this movie anyway Knute Rockne All American is an inspirational, inspiring and emotional movie. Maybe a little too sentimental, but it's not such a bad thing. This is a very nice film, which deserves a visit.
