Did he have with him who raised you since your youth? Do you just want her to leave your life? This woman is your mother. You should respect it, you must honor it, whether it is sick or in good health. But this can sometimes be aggravating. Especially when she becomes very domineering. This is how Owen (Danny DeVito) had to face in "Throw Momma Fron The Train". Her mom (Anne Ramsey, 1929-1988) is one of the worst. He does his best to be a writer and is anything but thankful. The treat of "awkward poop", "larda $$", "fat" and "stupid". For his friend, Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), he has his own problems as a woman, his ex-wife. She was trying to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Push her to the sea. What is he doing? Help us to reciprocate, get rid of Ms. Lift In the kitchen scene, I liked where Owen called Larry, "Cousin Patty". And mom says, "You do not have cousin Patty!" and Owen yells "You lied to me!" and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then comes the fun part when they are in the train and try to kill Momma Lift. It is thwarted and she returns Larry from the train. Well, everything goes back to normal, the ex-wife lives, but Mom just spilled the bucket. She might have seen the mistakes of her domineering ways. It's a fun movie and the distribution is excellent. A classic! 5 stars!
