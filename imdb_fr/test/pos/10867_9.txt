This film gives Daniel Wu the chance to make a good action film, but I really find the character of Emil Chow really great, brave but determined to repair the wrongs. In addition to the main terrorist, it makes me wonder about his revolution, makes me wonder if he is doing it for better or for worse. <br /> <br /> A film that tells us about Todd, an amnesiac terrorist who is played in secret he learns who he really is. The consequences he makes of his terrorist family give him the choice of redemption. <br /> <br /> Purple Storm was one of the best I saw this year. The film really stands out when it is filled with huge action scenes prepared by Stephen Tung Wai, who won the best action sequences at the Hong Kong Awards. (9/10)
