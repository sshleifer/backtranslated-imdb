This film starts a little slowly and starts running towards the end. This is not bad, it is to illustrate the degradation of the character trait of the main character. Therefore, if you are not in tragedies, it's not your film. It is the philosophy of this film that inspires reflection that is worth it. If you liked Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment", you'd probably like this, if only for comparison. The intriguing question posed by the film is: "What makes a well-known writer completely ignorant of his publicly approved ideas for another series?" The new ideas are quite opposed to the status quo. If you are a conservative, you will not like this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to other philosophical questions, I must admit that the film was also very aesthetic. The green hills and beautiful scenery helped me overcome the slow start. In addition, color symbolism was used to represent the state of mind of the main characters. If this kind of thing does not impress you, skip it. 7.
