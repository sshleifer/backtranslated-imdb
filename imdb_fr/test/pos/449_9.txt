There have been many excellent comments on this film and I want to add my voice to the praise. Yul Brynner has never been so powerfully attractive. His major Surov was fascinating. Your eyes just can not leave the screen when on it. It's his film. Do not neglect the rest of the cast which was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. As they were mostly theater actors, they brought many nuances to their performances. For example, I saw this film at least 4 times, but this is the first time I notice the reaction of the young German when she found herself face to face with a Russian soldier. Even though he was not threatening, his absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must be in Germany after the Second World War and most likely have been raped by a gang by the Red Army. The possibility of discovering deeper layers of history that may be beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again. Please put it on DVD.
