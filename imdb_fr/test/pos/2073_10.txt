Although I love Shakespeare, I have never been interested in this piece and I have seen most of it and studied it enthusiastically at school. Something about this story and this whole story seemed to discourage me. I never bothered to try to see Hamlet until recently, deciding that I should at least try to watch him and I borrowed Olivier's version from the library. Well, I had trouble with that. Olivier seemed way too old, not only in his appearance but in his role play. The room had been cut a lot to fit a more conventional film duration and I think I had to miss too much because I found it difficult to focus on it, I was quickly bored and bored. I still think Henry V of Olivier is the best version I've seen of this catchy piece - although I admit that I have not seen the Beeb version yet and I can not remember it. original version. <br /> <br /> I heard about the full version of Hamlet's Branagh. Although I really appreciate his teen, I think Beeb's version is much better and his Henry V. did not impress me completely. But I was a little disturbed by Branagh after seeing his disappointing effort in a musical comedy from Love's Labor's Lost, a play. I love and have been so well done by the Beeb. <br /> <br /> Finally, after the complete acquisition of Beeb Shakespeare on DVD, I soon saw one of my favorite plays of Shakespeare, Richard II, and I was simply delighted by Jacobi in the role . . What a revelation this piece is now for me! Yes, it's splendid, but I have the feeling that you need an actor with whom you can press to play Hamlet, and this is for me Jacobi. Unbelievable. It is intriguing to note that even though he is older than the character of Hamlet, he does not appear while he was in Olivier. Now, I notice he's also in the Branagh version and he has a lot to do with Branagh's training. So I'll have to look at this to see what Jocobi does with Claudius! I am interested to discover that Jacobi trained Branagh because yes, you can see the influence. <br /> <br /> And now, I'm going to start all over again ....
