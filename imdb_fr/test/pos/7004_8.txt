I must say that I did not expect much to watch "Pitch Black", but I have a lot in return, in terms of excitement and pure pleasure. This is the type of movie where you can just relax, relax and have fun while having fun. This is not a deep film by any means. All it offers is either recycled or torn by other films such as "Alien", "Predator" or other. But when I watch a scam, I want it to be good, and this scam is great. <br /> <br /> It opens on a galaxy of stars. Some of the greatest movies of all time lead to this type of scene: "2001", "Star Wars", "Alien", "Predator". A ship navigates in space when the cryogenically frozen crew is awake. The ship was touched by something. They will crash on a wicked little planet with three suns. Everyone leaves the ship when he finds out that his transport of prisoners, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), has escaped imprisonment. They search the desert planet in search of him and eventually find him, but they have no way to fly their ship. They travel the planet in search of water and civilization, but it seems that everyone suddenly disappeared from the planet not so long ago. <br /> <br /> Then, they discover that every 22 years, the planets line up the planet becomes black. There are also alien reserves that thrive in the darkness of the planet - what are the chances? They happen to be on the planet as the eclipse happens - what are the chances? And Riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the chances? <br /> <br /> There seems to be a lot of coincidence in this film, but a film like this one did not come out to get Oscars for their originality or their credibility. He is there to entertain the audience - he does it easily. Vin Diesel is a great gorilla of a man without acting talent. But I must say that if there is someone who can take the role of a trash and homicide criminal, it's Diesel. Listen to him whisper, "He did not know who he was playing with." Excellent material. <br /> <br /> The extraterrestrials of this film are a mixture of hammerhead sharks, "Alien" and Predators. They have long horizontal heads like a hammerhead, the fast agility of aliens and the stealth of a predator. I guess David Twohy (film director and screenwriter) did not expect the public to believe that his creatures were really something never seen before. At least, I hope not. <br /> <br /> "Aliens Redux" is perhaps a better name for this movie, but it's better than the second and third "Alien" movies combined. At a time when the seemingly finished series are reborn - "Terminator 3", "Alien 5", "Predator 3", "Alien vs. Predator" - "Pitch Black" stands out as a new series. Two other suites are planned. Let's just hope they will not run away. I can just imagine it in twenty-five years: "Aliens vs. Predator vs. Pitch Black Aliens: * The Fight of the Year." <br /> <br /> * The title "Fight of the Year" can be shared with the next movie "Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leatherface vs. Norman Bates vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barny the Dinosaur" . <br /> <br /> 4/5.
