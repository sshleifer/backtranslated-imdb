One of the most famous of all movie serials! Still interesting today although there is an "old movie" to watch. The second series looks better but just does not fit this one. The actors have a good time, especially Middleton and Lipson. Excellent edition by the team of experts Universal. The score was recorded in "Unknown Destination", "The Invisible Man", "The Black Cat" and "Werewolf of London" of Universal. And what a beautiful action music it was! If there was a choice for the best run of all time, this (probably) should be # 1.
