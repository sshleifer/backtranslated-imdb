I saw this film in 1997 because I'm a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and his father, the late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo was at his best in this movie, mainly because of his preppy hairstyle and wardrobe that flattered him. <br /> <br /> As the plot progressed, I realized that the film was more than an entertainment a reason to see a favorite actor. The story concerned a group of serial killers and law enforcement attempts to investigate this group and bring its members to justice. There was enough suspense and I think violence was needed to tell the story to the viewer. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was shocked to learn that the film is a true account of the horrific murders committed in Utah. In addition, Lorenzo and his main wife described real FBI agents who solved the disappearances of many young women and helped to apprehend the ring. I think the film is worth it because it informs the public of the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element.
