Did you like "Dead Man does not wear Plaid"? What about "Top Secret" and "A Chorus Line"? Well, Müllers Büro is a fantastic mix of the three, as unlikely as it sounds. Very Funny "Language in Cheek" Black Movie tribute with great songs and a great dance. You have to have a little humor for this movie, but it's really worth it to see. I voted it new, if the end was a little more logical, he would have got a ten. Thats how good this movie is.
