Most of these criticisms have no follow-up, so I will take another path and answer some of the questions I have already seen here. <br /> <br /> While the characters look and look young (hence the controversy), the actor / actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and therefore obviously over the fence . Here in the United States, it's still a little controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film do a lot to compensate. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I did not see more of Sean's things; in this film at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character feels if he is angry, frightened or confused. Anicee had a healthy career, whose life was unfortunately interrupted by cancer at the end of 2006. She was a beautiful and talented actress. <br /> <br /> VHS cassettes from FRIENDS are sometimes available on Amazon.com, but usually a significant price; I saw it as low as $ 60 and as high as $ 152 (as of this comment, there were two for this price). The video suite PAUL & MICHELLE is not so expensive and can be obtained (if available) on Amazon at a price between 16 and 70 dollars on average.
