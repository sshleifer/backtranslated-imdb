I can not say that this film deserves a ten, because I would lie. I loved this movie when I saw it, though! It bears the unique link of a friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. Although this does not display the sweetness that Jesse and Willy had in Free Willy, it offers an exciting movie that will please the whole family! If you love sea life or if you only like a perfect family movie, this movie is for you! Pinball shows us how adorable dolphins are. They are fun and could easily become pets if everyone had a big enough pool! I love whales and dolphins, so obviously this movie works for me. I do think that the producers should have chosen another shark instead of the hammerhead shark to reinforce the antagonistic role of history. Maybe a big white? FLIPPER IS BEAUTIFUL! So check it!
