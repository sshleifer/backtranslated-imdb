I've seen this movie about four or five times, and it improves with each view. Just say: This is the best movie I have ever seen. And I think I have seen a lot. <br /> <br /> But I have always wondered why this film was so avoided in some critics or evaluations. For example, let's take the IMDb Top 250. Why is it only at 216 (so far)? True, the answer is not in the film itself (because it's only perfect), but in its reception. The film provoked controversy in his portrayal of compassion towards a convicted murderer and his anti-death sentence. And so, obviously, the more conservative user probably did not like the movie (as you can see in some comments). Thus, DEAD MAN WALKING obtains a classification which is only ridiculous compared to its quality. These people did not understand what the film meant, and perhaps did not want to understand, being pro-death penalty. So now I understand: everything is political. You are pro death penalty - you do not like (and do not want to hear) what the film has to say. <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry, there are still so many people simply logging out when a new perspective challenges their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Mr. Robbins, the problem of your film divides people's opinions. Some have reconsidered their point of view, others have simply not listened, but you have raised a very important point. Your movie will probably never appear in the "100 best movies of all time" list, but it will be remembered long after movies like Braveheart, Babe or Apollo 13 (which were unfairly preferred over your 1996 Oscar film). ) are forgotten. Congratulations, Mr. Robbins, and thank you for this important film.
