Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as a Betty nurse, arguably one of the most charming, offbeat and light comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> When the opera-opera obsessed with waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses the murder of her insensitive husband by two murderers (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she takes pictures and thinks the members of the cast from A Reason to Love are real. She decides to go to Los Angeles in search of the famous cardiologist, Dr. David Ravell (a character in the series). <br /> <br /> The two oddly matched Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificant Freeman are very funny. chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also plays with his offending and discreet acting character. Renee Zellweger performs an innocent, candy-laden and sometimes terribly sweet performance as a Betty Nurse. She exudes kindness, warmth and is irresistible. While the script sometimes looks like a sit-com, is filled with sometimes incredible characters and artificial situations, Zellweger is so friendly and so disarming that everything is set up. <br /> <br /> With just a few touches of black comedy to keep things interesting, a Zellweger winning performance, an excellent cast and a competent script, nurse Betty is absolutely delightful. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
