I first looked at this in black and white, around Christmas in the early 60s, when it was broadcast on British television. I was absolutely addicted and I watched it every time it was repeated on TV (maybe only two or three times, as it happens - if only we had a video recorder!). <br /> <br /> by other contributors, the plot describes the return of Hoppity the Grasshopper, after a period gone by, in a US city of the forties. He discovers that everything is not what he left and his good insects friends (who live in the "plains" right next to the garden that belongs to a songwriter and his wife) are now threatened by the " humans, "stomping through the dilapidated fence that prefigures the property, using it as a shortcut. <br /> <br /> Insect houses are flattened by the feet and are also often burned by butts and matches. Old Mr. Bumble and his beautiful daughter Honey (Hoppity's girlfriend) are about to lose their honey shop because of this threat. <br /> <br /> To exacerbate their problems, the sneaky property mogul C. Bagley Beetle has Honey Bee himself designs romantic designs and hopes, with the help of his henchmen Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito, force Bumble to give him the hand of his marriage. <br /> <br /> Will the heroic and brave Hoppity win? and do you manage to save the insect community from their despicable destiny, and more particularly from its precious honey, from mine? Enjoy classic songs ("Katy Did, Katy Did not" is a superb example, swinging, optimistic), and colorful visuals, as the tale unfolds. <br /> <br /> Time did not lessen my fascination with this masterpiece of animation and storytelling, and I was delighted to see that the film had been released on video, even if I later discovered that it was in PAL NTSC format. Never mind, I immediately sent the video and bought only a combination TV / portable video (with NTSC playback). <br /> <br /> Since then, I've had many nostalgic views and I even discovered that television rights have changed from the BBC (which informed me that it was unlikely that the film was never broadcast on one of their channels) to FilmFour, which has (finally!) broadcast on their digital channels in early 2007. <br /> <br /> <br /> My granddaughter (aged three years) was absolutely fascinated by our shared vision. It is a child who has been influenced by the digital age and the resulting computer generated productions! <br /> <br /> I would like I highly recommend this movie at any age, and especially to the youngest viewers. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fleischer an Oscar posthumously!
