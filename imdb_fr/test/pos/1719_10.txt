I have some of the oldest videos and dvds from Dr. Who. I played them again and again. I love each of the "doctors" for different reasons. But because of a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was canceled, although it was still one of the pillars of BBC programming. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor stayed alive thanks to the fans. The BBC graciously allowed fans to write books and cartoons. Dr. Who maintained his momentum even after 1989. They then tried their luck with Paul McGann. The film was flawed, but it gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, "the man" was gone and the beginners of the BBC felt it was time to bring back the Doctor. It was a complete success. Here in America, the science fiction channel took a chance and it became a complete success too, although the writers had to start over and explain Dr. Who's mythology to new viewers. It's amazing to me that they did it. In season 1, with Christopher Eccleston with Russell T. Davis as lead writer and Phil Collinson as producer, The Doctor came back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is. The universe of Doctor Who has always been focused on "Choice", "Love" and "Sacrifice". That's what they provided. It gives me even more desire and it saddens me that Mr. Eccleston chose to leave the series. My first doctor was doctor no. 3, Jon Pertwee's doctor. Mr. Eccleston does not have to worry about his position in the Dr. Who universe. It's as solid as the rest. He is the 9th doctor. I did not know Mr. Eccleston before his performance in Dr. Who, but I know it now. I wish there was a way, he might know, that the Dr. Who fan community is striving to find his other work and enjoy it. We have already seen that he is a great actor.
