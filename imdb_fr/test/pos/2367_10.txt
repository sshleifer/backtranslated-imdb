Most "alternative" comedies in Britain in the 1980s were insular, misguided, overly political and insignificant, and the worst comic book giveaway ... was in this category. <br /> <br /> But it's at the other end - a remarkable movie that works at different intellectual levels. <br /> <br /> Is Dennis a criminal brain or is he lying? <br /> <br /> Does he say the truth by bluffing? , double-bluffing, counter-doubling-bluffing-anything? <br /> <br /> I have probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times and still can not decide 100%. This is the wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> In addition to Ade Edmonson, the first pillars of comics have an important role to play: French & Saunders, Peter Richardson, Alexei Sayle, Keith Allen, Nigel Planer and Robbie Coltrane. Oddly enough, not quite Rik Mayall. <br /> <br /> All comic book actors - whatever my preference for the hidden agenda of some of their members - are compelling actors and perform great on this big-screen release, so that the work of Richardson-Richens' editorial team is so often pure genius, with little touches of nicely detailed detail. <br /> <br /> This is ultimately a study of crime, criminology and human nature in all its complexity. And very funny with that. You will not be disappointed.
