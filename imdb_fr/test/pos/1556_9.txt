I gave this 9 out of 10 possible. If he had just had a little more intrigue, I would have given it 10. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it's an extremely interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey, who plays a nice old man, should have been rewarded with an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace (Alice's rep), whom I've never seen before, also does a great job and has the sexiest body I think I've ever seen on film. <br /> <br /> In a devilish old car beat, Alice went to Florida where she has a friend (or maybe her sister, I'm not sure, and it's my fault, not that of the film), and high hopes of going to university, which she and her family can not really afford. She seems pretty vulnerable on the road alone and, of course, she meets slightly rough characters. Shortly after, we discover that one of his tires is punctured. <br /> <br /> At this point, she is on a break and is assisted by a woman, Sandra, and her husband, Bill, a senior couple traveling in a camper. <br /> <br /> They are heading south, Florida, and take it under their wing, but does everyone come as he or she does? Flashbacks and paranoia go down in history as our young heroine learns new lessons about life.
