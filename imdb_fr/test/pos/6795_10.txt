After my 6 year old daughter started taking riding lessons, I started looking for horses movies for her. I had always heard about National Velvet but I had never seen it before. Boy, I'm glad I bought it! It has become one of my favorites, my 6 years and my 2 years. It's a shame that movies like this one are no longer made.
