I just had a look at Northanger Abbey at the local library and did not expect much. Imagine my surprise at this Gothic treatment! Northanger Abbey is one of the strangest places you've ever seen, with its empty passageways and ornate halls full of hidden secrets. The glory of this film is that it never reveals everything: your imagination is free, with that of the main character, Kathrine M. It is a girl full of imagination overflowing, a gothic fantasy reader that brings him our) real world. <br /> <br /> If I had to use a word to describe this great movie, it would be surreal. Dreams are woven throughout the film, enhancing the mood. Sometimes it is difficult to say what is real and what is not; it's intentional, I believe. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere reigns supreme. The music is not what you expect from a Jane Austen film: it's strange, it's based on the flute and the drum, it's high and haunting with an undercurrent of fear. If a sweet and pleasant melody played in Northanger Abbey, it would be really inviting. Now it's a dark and sinister palace of fools. (But! The characters! You'll have to see them for yourself!) <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a most enjoyable evening, look no further than Northanger Abbey.
