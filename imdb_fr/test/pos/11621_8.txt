The film "... And the earth did not swallow it", based on the book by Tomas Rivera, is a revealing film for most people. He talks about the exploitation of migrant agricultural workers to survive. <br /> <br /> Sergio Perez uses impressionist techniques to illustrate Rivera's story. He uses his and grayscale effects to represent certain scenes, as well as specific photographic techniques to give the impression that they took place in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Perez also gives film life to use time-appropriate music, including balladeering and guitar playing. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie to watch as it shows in detail how migrant farm workers live, what they do for entertainment and their beliefs.
