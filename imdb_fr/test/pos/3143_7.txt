Perry Mason: The Fatal Fashion affair reveals that Perry and Della Street, in New York, receive an award from the American Bar Association. An undefeated court record should be recognized, in my opinion. Anyway, a friend of Della, fashion editor Diana Muldaur, is arrested for the murder of a rival, Valerie Harper. In fact, Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale witness a clash between the two men in a fancy restaurant. <br /> <br /> Hedda and Louella look like schoolgirls. Of course, Harper has other people who love him as much. <br /> <br /> The same author also crushed a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual. This throws Perry with his investigative lawyer, William Moses, in an alliance with gangsters. It looks like the designer was the cousin of a mafia boss who also wants to do justice in his usual way. <br /> <br /> One thing I could not understand is when Moses and the gangster Robert Clohessy in search of the perpetrator of the crime, I can not believe that the police do not have no more pursued the case with vigor. Of course, Clohessy has access to sources that the cops just do not have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of Mason's entry is Scott Baio, the rather self-serving young man, district attorney who introduces himself to Raymond Burr explained how he had studied all his records and could not wait to beat him. Foolish Boy. <br /> <br /> In fact, my favorite scene is Burr and Baio at a helm station with the judge. Baio wanted to reopen his file and add a witness. He was ready and prepared with precedents. Burr takes him by surprise and declares that he has no objection to the appearance of the new witness, and proceeds to demolish the witness during the cross-examination. Absolutely priceless. <br /> <br /> Scott Baio is the best thing in this Perry Mason movie and this should be seen for him alone if nothing else.
