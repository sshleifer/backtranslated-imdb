Easily one of my three or four favorite movies. Certainly one for the desert island. This film is not "brilliant". On the contrary, it shines warm and welcoming. The public is invited to a party and, like any good party, the joy comes from the interaction of guests and what you learn as you progress. With Joyce's apology, the title of the film evokes a number of ideas that drive the audience away. The movie is not horrible. It's not depressing. It is a beautiful look at a bygone era, in which people grow up and where others are exhausted. Some are frustrated and others are serene. And all around, always present throughout the evening, are people and parts of people who have been put to rest. The words that these exquisite actors have the words to pronounce are perfect and, set to music by the Irish brogue, are an auditory feast, especially for us, flat-toned Americans. About the lack of brilliance I mentioned above, I repeat it. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann. He talks about quiet volumes on ?? well everything. On a beautiful snowy night, rent this movie and let it unfold in front of you. No shootings, no car chases, no dinosaurs? just film at its most sublime.
