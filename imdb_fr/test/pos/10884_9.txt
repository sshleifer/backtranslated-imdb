What can be said about one of the biggest N64 games of all time? That the action is fast enough to allow a veteran of the FPS, even seasoned, to sweat literally? That the graphics are great, until the explosions that everyone likes to see? That nothing is as fun as playing in multiplayer mode and shooting in the back with machine guns on the backs of your friends and siblings? more intelligence among enemy soldiers. If you have an N64 and you like to photograph people and spy objects, get a copy.
