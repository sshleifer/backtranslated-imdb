Yes, I'm watching this show. Because my girlfriend looks at it, of course. At least that's what I tell my friends. But since no one has ever known me here, I can say it; I like that! It is an excellent trash TV. <br /> <br /> First, there is the panel; Tyra herself, who does not miss an opportunity to speak for herself, must nevertheless be taken seriously because she is a businesswoman. Then there is Jay Manuel, a sober, very serious and incredibly professional gay guy, and Miss Jay, an extrovert, "queen" of the parade and a damn funny guy, and Nigel, supposedly the only man on the panel. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the show is an in-depth look at a shallow industry, and we need to thank the producers for their insight, which can be informative and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Finally, the edition is excellent; there is just the right mix of everything; The girls living together in the house of the ego, their impressions of the trays, the competitions themselves and the judgment. All this slides smoothly with the right rhythm. There is no length. <br /> <br /> Of course, there must be other factors that have led to eliminations that we do not see in television series; The panel is composed of capricious divices, extroverted and quick to the bitch; woe to those who offend them! But that being said, as long as a competitor does not step on his feet, his judgment is usually right - I think. <br /> <br /> So give your brain a break; If you can not beat them, join them and have a good time watching this reality show with your loved ones. That will make us want more, one way or another.
