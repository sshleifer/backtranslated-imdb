I love this show. It's really unique. I felt like there would be more seasons. In anticipation of Series 2, I recently purchased Series 1 to watch it again to be refreshed when Part 2 started. Now, after watching it, I was excited and wanted more, so I came to the site to see the schedule of the sequel. I am really disappointed to see that there are no more projects for a second series because I was eager to look more at this story. I think they really dropped the ball on this one. There remained many stories to build on and many unanswered questions. I am now very unhappy and I hope that they will reconsider their decision and resume the story to which she has stopped.
