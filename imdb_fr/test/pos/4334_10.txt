The film is amazing, it has a soundtrack that sets the tone for the movie. The replicas of the movie are great, such as "Nothing to do for friends" and "Its collection time, Charlie's collection time." I can watch this movie again and again and again because laughter lines and action are unique. I feel that when I watch this film, I want to come down and shoot down the bad guys. If there is a movie you do not want to miss, this is it. "They killed the giggler man, they killed the giggler" "They did not have the right to do it, he is on our land and takes care of it." The lines continue to arrive in the film. Deff. go out and do not rent but buy this movie, it's worth the money, believe me.
