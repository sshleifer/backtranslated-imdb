As an independent diver, I can appreciate the incredible physical effort cameramen had to undergo to get the photos under the water. This series is MUCH more than that, though. The narration is perfect, the scenes are almost implausible and the subject captivating. The daily struggle for life that takes place out of sight of us, the inhabitants of the Earth, is staggering. This DVD game opened my eyes to another planet, here on Earth. I urge everyone to watch this series.
