I saw this film for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a group of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He preceded her the way he thought he was great and the way it was funny and in the context of his explanation, it was HILARIOUS. I can see how this could be detrimental to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that made me laugh so much that I thought I would pee. They do not arrive until after midway, but when they arrive, oh my God ... you'll die. Oh and Jim Brown is brilliant. It's not part of the movie, but when it's there, you know who owns the movie. Of course, the best line of the movie (and the funniest) is his; you will know it when you hear it.
