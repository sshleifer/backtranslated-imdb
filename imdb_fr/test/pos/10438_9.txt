I totally loved this movie, I tried to buy it and I can not find it. to see absolutely, a film that you can watch again and again, funny but also a tearful. really good album for the movie. it's a very good film of the 80s, I would like to find a copy to buy this film, because the actors have acted very well. There are many people who could probably identify with this film. is what explains this film. so good movie. So go out and try to rent this one, you will not regret it. it's an old movie but it's worth watching, I would not be surprised if they make a remake of this movie soon, but I'm sure it would not be the same. whoever has not seen it, will praise it.
