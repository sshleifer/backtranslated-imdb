Funny stuff. Charlie was still working at his peak when he made it quite daring about the soldiers in the trenches of the First World War. Audacious, because after all, the war was still going on and it was a comedy about a serious business. <br /> <br /> The gags are fun without being hilarious or jerky. A successful scene succeeds, as Chaplin and his comrades attempt to sleep in a bunker plunged into the depths of the water up to their knees. (This is where the term "trench foot" comes from.) Probably the most ridiculous episode of Chaplin disguised as a tree and foiling a number of German soldiers as they tried to execute an allied soldier taken behind the lines. Edna Purviance, Chaplin's main pressure at the time, is a woman who cooperates with the Americans and who is also spared executions. <br /> <br /> Chaplin would continue to do more funny and ambitious things, but it's better than most of his shorts during that first period.
