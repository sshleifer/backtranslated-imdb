I first played the second game Monkey Island, and I liked it despite the graphics and sound of low quality. A few months later, I discovered that a new game had been created. I tried it and liked it a lot. The first thing you notice is the beautiful graphics. The areas are huge, colorful and detailed, with plenty to explore. The game requires you to use your brain, a lot, as always. The game is difficult, with all the games of point and click, frustrating. The jokes have not aged a third time. The animated cut scenes are also a great addition to the game. It's the best MI game, maybe the best P & C game too! If you like cartoony games that play like a movie, get this game!
