How many of us read a book or saw a play and when the film version came out, we were terribly disappointed? Well, maybe it would be one of those movies for those who saw the play too, but as someone who never had the opportunity to see her on stage, I was extremely entertained by this movie. The characters were funny, the music was great and the story was interesting and made you feel real empathy for the characters, their faults and everything else. Jonathan Silverman has a very good timing for comedy, and his lines are particularly hilarious. I'm not going to give spoilers, it's just a fun, well done movie, showing the inner workings of a middle-class family during the Second World War. So, if you've never seen the play and liked Neil Simon's other movies, do not be slowed by the few negative reviews here. Brighton Beach Memoirs is in itself a great movie. I guarantee it (no refund, though).
