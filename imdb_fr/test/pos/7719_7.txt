My comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the supplement on the film) and his unfortunate evaluation of the film. I think his perspective indicates why an extra is an extra and a director is a director. The film was sweet, the actor's play enough, the experience of watching him pleasantly turned away from a busy work week. It was not "The Hours" (acting), or "The Matrix" (special effects), or even "The Color Purple" (Direction). Most movies will not be. But it's also not the feast of shit that "vinny ..." would lead you to believe. Sorry dude, only my 2 cents. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it was finally very gay saying (+ 1). It showed a world full of diverse and not perfect people - you know, just like ours (+ 2)! This opened the door to a culture without excluding other cultures (+3). And I liked the music (+ 4).
