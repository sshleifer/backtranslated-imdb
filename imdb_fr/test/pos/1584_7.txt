I heard about Commander's Log for the first time when I was attending the local science fiction convention. Craig Bowlsby, Banks Linden Banks, Sophie Banks and Brian Oberquell came to show the video and give some testimonials on television on a limited budget. I must say that I was very happy when I finally had the chance to see the show. Comparisons with Red Dwarf are inevitable, as Red Dwarf's early seasons have also been achieved on a reduced budget (although the commander's log must set a record for the least money spent per minute of airtime), make up for the lack of "eye candy" with good writing and play. Linden Banks, who plays the first master Blather, does a particularly good job of presenting a serious character but lacking good faith. <br /> <br /> Bowlsby's original idea was to tell the story in two minutes between two shows during a party, though, for some reason, Space did not have such an idea great that it could have been, and the interstitials were thus grouped into a one-hour show, which Space normally showed in two half-hour episodes. The existing DVD does not include episode 3 (premiered at Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (previewed at VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you're in contact with your community can catch news from a projection somewhere near you.
