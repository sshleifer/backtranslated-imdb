What do you mean son of actor, not actor? You do not become an actor simply because your dad is a superstar - it does not work that way, not in the UK anyway. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (this version) is a Scottish low-budget movie. You can not compare that to the Polanski version because Polanski has all the budgets of the world. <br /> <br /> Jason played in the school, but his big win came in 1985 when he landed the role of Robin Hood in the British television series Robin of Sherwood. He has appeared in many movies since, including "Shanghai Noon" and "The Lord of the Rings 2". Since then, Jason has gone behind the camera to found the production company Unconditional Entertainment. He recently completed the filming of his latest film Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. <br /> <br /> And all this has nothing to do with Sean Connery's son. If you think Jason said to Sean, "Dad, I want to be in the Macbeth movie that they're going to film," and Sean said, "Of course, my son, whatever you say," and made a phone call and got the role of his son, you are mistaken. In fact, Jason Connery is cut off from his father's will Seeing that his father's name is Sean Connery is a big chunk of change that Jason will lose. The reasoning behind this decision is apparently Sean's deep conviction that his only son should learn to support himself. The relationship has become quite tense. Jason even threatening to change his name. <br /> <br /> --------------------- --------------- To be the son of Sean Connery, <br /> <br /> "I realize I'm still going to be compared to my father, there's innuendo all the time, should I spend my whole life justifying myself?" ----- ------------------------------- <br /> <br /> So stop being a fool and blame him to not be able to act simply because he is son of Sean Connery (good deal!). <br /> <br /> Watch Jason in Bullet to Beijing and form a different opinion about his ability to act.
