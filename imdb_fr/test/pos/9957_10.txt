There were at least half a dozen silent movie versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" and several television productions. But no one has ever managed to make a big-budget theatrical feature film. . . until now. Given the nature of the most memorable character in the play, Shylock the Nasty Jew, it can be assumed that the small inconvenience that occurred in Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s may have enthusiasm of the directors. Of course, the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to give Al Pacino the opportunity to shout, brave, brood, mumble and be tormented - all areas in which he is very good. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is a dream of scenery. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite since he has never met a Jew. Jews were banished from England from 300 years before his time to a few decades after his death; and it is unlikely that he has ever traveled abroad. At one level, the Jews might just as well have been a mythological race. But although Shakespeare may not have been anti-Semitic, his game certainly is. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that probably suggests the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th century lender with the diction and undeniable cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version starts with an analysis of the miserable terror of the Jews, then points out Antonio (Jeremy Irons) who spits free of charge on Shylock (Pacino), who is really standing beside his belongings. Go buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge Booker
