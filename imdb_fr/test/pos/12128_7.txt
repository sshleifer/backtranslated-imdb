A very accurate portrayal of the little cursed mob life filmed in New Jersey. The story, the characters and the script are credible, but the actor drops the ball. It is nevertheless worth looking at, especially for strong images, some always with me even if I had seen it for the first time 25 years ago. <br /> <br /> things continue to spoil, suggesting to the local chef that his end is being crushed, this is not a good place if you love your health, your life at Martin Scorsese . Also present is Frank Vincent, a guy who has been living on screen forever. Strong on characterizations and visuals. The sound is confusing and most of the actors are amateurs, but it's a beautiful story.
