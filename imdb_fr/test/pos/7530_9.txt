I just watched this movie and I must say that it surprised me. It was very well done, with a good acting and a deep look at high school students in Japan, in the love of teenagers. <br /> <br /> The look and feel are very different from those of many movies, and you can easily get into the movie. Much of the focus seems to be in the story itself, which is extremely subtle. The main theme and relationships with other characters are a bit complex. But the general sense of realism and dimensions always attracts you. <br /> <br /> A main disadvantage is of course those who like something simple. Which is not here. You have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get into the movie. <br /> <br /> I still enjoyed this movie. It's worth watching.
