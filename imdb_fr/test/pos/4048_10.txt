I have probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times. Each time, I am more and more impressed by the scope of the wish of a young heart and the strength of Kai and Gertha to fight for what they believe. <br /> <br /> And the whole story is Thus presented, you've just been transferred into the plot and, before you realize it, you're there. you can see ... yes, there is Kai ... who works hard on the mirror ... a little jump ... there is Gertha, who is fighting for his love ..... and there is The Snow Queen ... <br /> <br /> it's a wonderful mix of love, adventure and tension. <br /> <br /> it's great 10 out of 10
