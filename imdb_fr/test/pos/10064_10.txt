I had already seen this movie before, but I did not remember it was so fantastic: it's a funny plot, Madonna searches the city with pumas, etc. And the music is just perfect! And happy ending! Who is this girl is a great choice for a romantic like me. In my opinion, this could even be the best Madonna movie I have ever seen! 10/10
