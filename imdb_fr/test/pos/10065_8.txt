If this film had been shot in the 50's or 60's, critics and fans would have praised it. I myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end. It's not a timeless piece and it has not aged well over the years, but it's still nice to watch it. As for Mrs. Ritchie who plays in the movie? It's not the best on the planet - but it adds to the film's unique comic aspirations and highlights the timing of Madonna's (often underestimated) comedy. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former convict who was charged with committing a crime she did not commit. Griffin Dunne plays the unfortunate future groom / puppet who is sent to escort him from jail to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot. (And there is one!) Give the film a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it is.
