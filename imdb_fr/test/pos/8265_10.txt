I am lucky to have a good quality copy of my VHS on DVD so that I can now watch it again and again. The characters are so well played that I find no flaws in any aspect of the cast. OK, so there are some differences from the book, but the old clich√© of the vanquishing love is described with such force that it makes no difference. The reality of country life in the early nineteenth century in England is contrasted by the seasons, the rigors of winter to glorious summer days, as evidenced by the different characters, from the harassing father of Prue to love from Kester. A story that changed my life.
