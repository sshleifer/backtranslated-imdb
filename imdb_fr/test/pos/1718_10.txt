As a fan of the old Doctor Who and after the mediocre film of Fox, I doubted this new series of Doctor Who. I gave him a chance though and I'm so glad I did. <br /> <br /> Yes, some episodes are not as brilliant as others, but they are all nice, and yes, the doctor from Eccleston is far from us I had before but ... Dr. Eccleston is about the best. His performance is sometimes comical, sometimes dramatic, sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic. <br /> <br /> This, and Ball Piper in the role of Rose, make this series an unmatched game (Camille Coduri is as fantastic as her mother, Rose), and there is depth to this series not present previously. This series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its science fiction. I mean who would have thought you might have felt sorry or even cried before a Dalek, how many times in the history of this series have we had moments like those with Rose's father, the emergency doctor and the 'You were Fantastic ... so was I' final speech? I advise anyone, Doctor Who fan or even soap opera, to buy this set on DVD, it's really "fantastic!". <br /> <br /> From now on, only 4 episodes of the last series (and (the new Cybermen) I must say that David Tennant's doctor is just not so good, you can of course not be d okay, but I do not think his doctor is capable of these moments of emotion felt in the previous series.I must also say that, in my opinion, this series was not as good as the previous one, but the return of Sarah Jane & K9 was a fantastic episode, a real gem Not to say that this series is not good, it is not so good. <br /> <br /> That you like it or not, and whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, The Doctor is back and he's here to stay. "Fantastic!" - Almost as many "Fantastics!" as the Doctor! -
