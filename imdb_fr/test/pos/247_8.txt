It's a glamorous and glamorous musical comedy of the 40s. Cover Girl has made Rita Hayworth (formerly the black-haired Latin senorita, Margarita Cansino) a true all-American star. This confirmed Gene Kelly's incredible talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It embodies the exuberance and the color of the musical genre. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth is great because Rusty Parker is her picture and her presence is always in the foreground. Her singing is doubled, but her dance is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly. I think Rita was very underrated as an actress - she plays every scene superbly here. Gene choreographed the dance sequences (freedom of creation was given almost entirely here), and his dance number "Alter Ego" is incredible. Such an art. The songs that stand out are "Prepare Your Future for Tomorrow", "Test Me" and, of course, "Long Ago and Far Away". The plot is rather thin, but it has a moral. These are the dangers of fast celebrity and fast money, and how all happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed to failure. It will cheer you up, make you laugh and make you laugh. <br /> <br /> That being said, "Cover Girl" is not the greatest musical comedy ever produced. It has a number of flaws that need to be addressed. . We can say that a little Phil Silvers goes a long way. His character quickly becomes tedious. However, I was impressed by his dancing abilities and his ability to follow Gene and Rita. Another major problem is that too many songs are just not great. The cover girl's issue looks fantastic, but I'm not a fan of lyrics or singing. "Poor Tom" is a huge depressing. I think it's one of the worst numbers I've ever heard in a 40-50s musical. It stinks. Grandma's subplot is ridiculous. But that's just my opinion. Others may like these things. <br /> <br /> Yet, aside from its flaws, this is a very, very good movie, far better than most products made today. The dancing and singing are sublime, the production values ​​are excellent and the atmosphere is contagious. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
