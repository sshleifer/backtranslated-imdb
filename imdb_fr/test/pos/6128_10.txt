Of course, my 10/10 rating only applies if you are ready to be completely disgusted *. Because you know that only John Waters can do it. In "Pink Flamingos" (his directorial debut), he describes two families stranded to see who can be the dirtiest person. What Divine does in the end responds quite well to the question. But even apart from that, the film is essentially an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone could imagine. You should have a very strong belly to watch this movie. Even some of the lines are breathtaking. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise, avoid this movie like the Ebola virus!
