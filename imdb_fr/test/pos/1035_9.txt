I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved to be a great actor. In fact, when he started Law and Order, I was disappointed with him because that role was not so powerful. Unfortunately, good roles do not pay bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it. It's both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to find out what really happened. I was so moved that I bought and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds". And I saw how this man has become an unlikely hero who has never been rewarded for his insight. If you have the opportunity, be sure to watch this movie and see what performance Mr. Waterston can really offer to an audience. Enjoy movies!
