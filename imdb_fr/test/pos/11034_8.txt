I saw this film alone when I was a young teenager in my hometown in India, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me, other than the girls, was the Tigers. I went home after looking at him, with a glassy look in his eyes, wanting to be that guy in the film who befriended the Tigers. What movie and what moment it was! The theater in which I saw it does not exist and has given way to a shopping center. I do not know what I would think of this now after so many years and I do not want to spoil a childhood memory by finding this film on DVD or something similar and not finding it more interesting. Previous experiences have taught me that a childhood memory is often tarnished when you travel through the tired highways of life, trying to rediscover their unconditional past through movies, to find only their own. blazing innocence completely and no longer welcome. And I do not want to throw the experiences of a memory of this film in the wind. I do not have children, so I'm probably selfish leaving this movie in a sepia area of ​​my brain, unwittingly on DVD. But if you have an early age and want to remember memories of an endearing childhood in recent years, try watching this movie (if you can). It will be worth it.
