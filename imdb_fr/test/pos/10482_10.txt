The dead spots and the superficiality of "Out of Africa" ​​postcards have barely buried all the interests I have had to read Isak Dinesen. So when my brother bought me "Babette's Day" and it was based on a Dinesen story, I did not really run to the VCR. But over the titles, it became obvious that it was not an ordinary movie. Jutland (where it is located) is not Africa; the cold fog that is deposited on the photos of the camera does not invite. The cold, forbidden sea; heavy gray clouds; the pale green and icy cliffs - reflect the events that appear on the faces on which the director Gabriel Axel draws the curtain. The most difficult is Bodil Kjer as Philippa; Among the myriad of merits of this film, the most memorable is this face. It looks like a map that shows us the cherished wonder of his minister's apostolate; like a labyrinth of long-forgotten fjords where the complications of perseverance and the commitment of his congregation weigh like shining shields. <br /> <br /> I understand that Dinesen emphasizes that the world is inexplicably attracted by Christian dedication, when Philippa is rejected by his only serious suitor (because he fears never to be up to the rules and rigors of his little religious clique), and he returns to seek his mistress whom he considers as the greatest leader of the continent. I suppose it is also his point of view that Christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who abandon world success (Martina, the sister of Philippa, refutes the efforts of a visiting baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont, whose the joke creates an inspiring counterpoint to the narrow-minded spirit that surrounds his discovery.) to make him an opera star, the main character leaves France and has an enviable reputation and seeks refuge as a servant of two single sisters) to pursue artistic triumphs only for the testimony of God and his loved ones. But it is Axel who weaves the roughness of the lives of these people with the richness of the voice of Martina and the table of Babette Hersant and achieves an unexpected sumptuousness in a film about sacrifice, faith and religious conviction. <br /> <br /> What sets this film apart from other religious films is its sly humor. "Babette's Feast" - the banquet itself - a posthumous commemoration of the minister's 100th birthday - is a superbly orchestrated shock of sensibility that offers comedic moments to an unparalleled set of actors in their subtlety. It's just this clever comedy that enriches the solemn closing feelings. Together, they do something pious that movies rarely do. They leave a believer extremely optimistic and resolute in an unexpected and humiliated way.
