I am an opera lover and the operas are full of sex, blood and death. It may be useful to know the booklets of the operas whose tunes come from to really appreciate this film - my journey is very different from that of Tug-3. I am a lover of classical music and I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved Ken Russell's "Nessun Dorma" segment, and I really want to see him produce Turandot, because the opera is supposed to be overwhelming, really multimedia experience, but then I have loved Lisztomania. I like * Turandot * and know the booklet so well maybe I do not find in this segment the parody that Tug-3 did. <br /> <br /> The Buck Henry / Rigoletto segment is probably the most accessible for the average viewer - they are likely to recognize the tunes, and it's a classic chamber farce. I like bedroom pranks, so foolishness did not bother me. <br /> <br /> The segment "Liebestod" is so remarkable that I recommend people to watch this only for this piece. "Since the Day" was for me beautifully spiritual. And Caruso's recording of "Vesti la Giubba" (aka I Pagliacci) with John Hurt as the clown was wonderful. But people who just want naked women may feel that there is too much music and not enough bare flesh and sex.
