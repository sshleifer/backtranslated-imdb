Master Kieslowsky came up with an idea in 1993, the idea was to describe human relations in today's world, from Blue (an artistic masterpiece about a woman's life) to White (a visual comedy film about marriage) and Red (A masterpiece dealing with human interactions). <br /> <br /> Although I do not spoil the movement, I can easily say that Red is the best film of the 90s, because it contains one of the strongest messages in the world. a scenario that I have never seen. <br /> <br /> The film begins a little slowly but finds its rhythm soon enough to keep you hooked throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The performances are perfect, sublime. since the characters are quite realistic and they are not clichÃ©s and that we can not expect as many actors and we are not disappointed ... seriously, I believe that Jean Louis Tringtignat deserved at least a nod to Oscar. > <br /> The music of Zbiegnew Preisner is amazing, it's one of the best sheet music ever written. The cinematography of Piotr Sobocinsk is also remarkable. He was awarded an Oscar (and deserved to win). <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a perfect 10 and will be loved by foreign film lovers and enthusiasts. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> How the impressive Pulp Fiction beat this masterpiece in Cannes exceeds my understanding
