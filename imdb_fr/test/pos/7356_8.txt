We talked to Fangoria about it. It was interesting for me because it was live-on-video and I recognized two of the stars on the cover, James Marsden of Disturbing Behavior and Christine Taylor of The Craft. And to my surprise on Valentine's Day, while I was looking in the alley of horror! I immediately had to catch it. My brother and my girlfriends and I watched the video. To my surprise, she was pretty good, the tales were interesting and for once, they were really SCARY, unlike many other horror movies made recently. Part of the plot I do not understand but once I see it again, I bet I'll get it. And to my surprise, there were other stars that I recognized, including one of the girls on My Real Called Life and Jacinda from The Real World. I do not know why this film was only made in video, with some advertising, this film could have at least compensated the money spent to make it. The only problem I have is that since it was not released in theaters, I guess I will never be able to see it on the big screen. You must absolutely try your luck and rent this one. <br /> <br />
