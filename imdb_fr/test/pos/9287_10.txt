For TV comedy regulars, be it sketch, sitcom or animation, it's nice to watch something really refreshing. <br /> <br /> The Chaser must be the best comedy of this decade, Seinfeld being the last triumph. He follows the urban crusades of the host countries to correct the situations, to make "road tests" and to try to make understand the facts by our old-fashioned politicians. <br /> <br /> Although very controversial at times, the quality of the shows is excellent, from the opening credits well done and really fun to surveys on the style of sketching (style of sketching only in time, they are not written, at least not those at the other end of the joke) certainly deserves to be watched. Even the most cynical and intellectual spectators will not be disappointed and the show deserves ten stars. <br /> <br /> In the end, congratulations to ABC for showing it and I highly recommend it.
