Imaginative, fast, satirical! Americans do "zany", but the British do "spiritual" - and they like to make fun of themselves (ahem: unattractive teeth, big lips / nose, common "veddy" or "veddy" snob, obsession of the "gahden"). Jokes inside for the elderly in the audience, a lot of action for kids. Subtle use of devices from other classic films (such as "Back to the Future", "Indiana Jones", "Harvey", "Tremors", etc.). In addition, a clever film "buddy" (Gromit is a discreet sidekick, but full of resources). Add a brilliant voice work by Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (is it true?) The best acting is nowadays in animation? - enjoy! I saw him with the grandchildren. moment of pleasure for all. - Canuckteach
