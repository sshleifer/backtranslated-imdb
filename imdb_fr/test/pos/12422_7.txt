The film borrows enormously from "Duel", "The Blair Witch Project", "Jeepers Creepers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" "The story is pretty idiotic, but there is enough gore and violence to delight the freaks, I particularly enjoyed the performance of Justin Urich, who gives the film its comic relief.It is difficult to forgive the total lack of suspense. you have time to waste 7 out of 10. Did I mention that Aimee Brooks is sexy?
