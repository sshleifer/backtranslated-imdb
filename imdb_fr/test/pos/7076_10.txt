After renting One True Thing the other night, I learned to respect my family and not take their health for granted. I have never seen such a real portrait of a cancer victim in the manner of Meryl. She deserves the Oscar nomination, but she has some tough competitors in the race. All I can say is a beautiful film, an excellent interpretation of Streep and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep has revealed his true capacity in this excellent film!
