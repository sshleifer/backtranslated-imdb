This film has a brilliant soundtrack and a superb rendition of some unknown faces. I particularly like the bad boy characters from the Welsh Docklands who strut like American rappers who act hard. The joke between Jip and Koop is brilliant, they appear as best friends almost as if it were true in real life. I have experimented with some of the things in this film and I want to tell you from the outset that these people do not play (especially those we see with Jip and Koop talking and sniffing coke). Danny Dyer is priceless as Moff, the dealer of "Prescribed Products" and possesses the funniest lines of the film ... .... yeaahhh! I knew you would not let me down, I knew it !!! "
