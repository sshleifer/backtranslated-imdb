forget about the overrated "Batman Begins, THIS is the ultimate Batman movie you will not want to miss, this movie has it all, and it totally surpasses the first mega hit of 1989. It may not have done as well first at box office, but it's certainly a much better movie, the visuals are incredible, Burton works like he always does in his movies, and Gotham City, the Batmans hunting territory, is an incredible sight to behold. in itself is pretty good and the two villains in this story are VERY interesting, much more interesting than their comic book counterparts: Tim Burton and screenwriter Daniel Walters go even further to get you closer to these characters. to perfection by Danny Devito, is a type of tragic character who was abandoned by his parents at birth and later in life seeks revenge for the world who refused him. sometimes, but it has some of the most classic lines that a villain could ever utter in a single movie. The other villain is Catwoman, played so brilliantly by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and who plays WOW, and steals the entire show with regard to batman villain's live action. it also has a tragic background. her name is Selina Kyle, and she is a very cute secretary to a clever businessman called Max Shreck, who later kills her by pushing her out the window. In a way, she survives and is "woken up" by cats, and immediately decides to become the legendary Catwoman, not before, of course, the amazing sequence in which she unleashes herself completely and destroys all her apartment in the One of the most A performance worthy of the rage and anger I have ever seen in an actress. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is wearing the cape and hood again as Batman and also as Bruce Wayne and THIS time are much darker. There is not much else to say here, except that Keaton is simply the best actor to ever play Batman. he just oozes cool, and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and he's very dark. he does not speak much, and when he does, he looks very cool and he does not sound his voice quite clumsy and the voice of "batman" in Batman begins. he struts around Gotham like a man possessed by his own inner demons. he is psychologically disturbed and you know it. during this release, he faces two of the most famous villains in the world of Batman comics. <br /> <br /> I must say however that despite the vastness of action scenes, like the scenes with the coolest Batmobile ALWAYS on the street with thugs on the ground and Batman hovering through Gotham, it's is the romantic angle between Pfieffer and Keaton that makes this movie a classic for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action, I evaluate this 10, give it more if I could.
