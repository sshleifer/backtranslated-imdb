Recently, he traveled to Norway from Bergen, Norway, and stopped in the small town of Voss, Norway. There was a monument in honor of Knute Rockne, born in Voss a few years ago. People are all aware of Knute and the tour guides are proud to stop in front of his monument. This film is a great story of this great man and his great love for Our Lady. I never realized that Knute had such talent in chemistry and laboratory science and had been teaching chemistry for years while coaching the football team. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Gipp (The Gipper), who was an outstanding football player; Reagan had a short role, but played an important supporting role in this film. Donald Crisp (Father John Callahan) has been outstanding as a priest who has always had great faith in Knute throughout his life at Notre Dame. It's a great classic movie that will be seen by many generations. Enjoy.
