I saw this film early one morning in the early 90's, at about 12 years old. I was trying to find out what it was and finally, today, I did it! I remember enjoying it and being a little panicky at the end when it was shown. Headstone of the boy and his ghostly face! Please, can you let me refuse if I can get a copy of this document, because I would like to see it again.I remember the kid who got stuck in a cornish mine and then got befriended a boy. I do not remember that children were stuck there with minors but had to be. The boy helps them get out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a dead boy while he was working there, I think.
