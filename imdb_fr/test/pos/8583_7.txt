The English are a little too perverse, the Scots are a bit too heroic. The dialogue is sometimes too dramatic, and the <br /> <br /> transitions between scenes could be more fluid. <br /> <br /> Yet, "The Bruce" looks like an authentic, if not polite, <br /> <br /> story ... even if she does not play freely with some important facts <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Sandy Welch is not a Gibson nor a Branagh, but he is a pillar <br /> <br /> Bruce. And Brian Blessed juggles with decor in an ugly bad guy like Edward I. <br /> <br /> He misses the budget necessary to make the final battle really impressive <br /> <br />, they always gathered an impressive crowd to the <br /> <br /> armies English and Scottish. According to filmmakers, <br /> <br /> "The greatest filmed reconstruction of the medieval battle ever organized in <br /> <br /> British Isles." <br /> <br /> Allowing for a few flaws and flaws, the film <br /> <br /> always makes a convincing portrait.
