I was not even born when this series was released in the United States. It took ten years before the British TV channels took it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was lucky to see the very first episode, in which The Lone Ranger was part of a group ambush and get slaughtered. TLR was the only survivor. Although seriously injured, he was saved by a visiting Indian called Tonto. I think he started wearing a mask to hide his true identity for fear of reprisals. But instead, he made himself all the more recognizable. I do not know if he was wearing it while he was sleeping. <br /> <br /> It was Saturday, a basic drink for tea time. The clarion fanfare of William Tell's opening announced a race on TV, food still in hand. Although it soon became a repetitive and predictable hokum. Nobody ever unmasked him. No one has ever managed a punch, no one has ever anticipated it. He was a little too good and just a little too much in his dress for most kids. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, became his aunt Sally. He has always been beaten, tied up, kidnapped and everything else. <br /> <br /> And how did he keep calling The Lone Ranger? "King Savvy" was the general consensus where I lived. It seemed to imply "the big know-all" in Indian. But that sounds like something else, as if Mr. Silverheels had a slurred speech. "Kemosabe"; what is that? <br /> <br /> A later duo, less known as "The Range Rider" and "Dick West", finally won my vote. Jock Mahoney, face-down, hurt each episode and was less camped, less beautiful and more credible. <br /> <br /> Still; even today, I can not hear the opening of William Tell without waiting for galloping hooves and a hearty Hi-Oh Silver. <br /> <br /> A stupid madness.
