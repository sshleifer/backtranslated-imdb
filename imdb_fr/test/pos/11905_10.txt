I love this movie and I recommend it to everyone. Adam Chapa and Jennifer Tilly have perfectly interpreted their roles. stuck on the screen throughout the film, not a scene was slow. The film also has many action-packed scenes, exploding cars, and so on. If you like real entertaining movies, watch it because you will be sitting on the edge of your seat all the time. my type of movie.2 Bravo, all the way !!!!!!!!!
