I do not want to write too much about the film, but basically it's an action comedy with a bit of romance around two men who meet in unlikely circumstances and become passers-by together. Fantastic performance of Robert Carlysle and all the other participants. A brilliant 'bad guy' who really makes you hate him. Some great comic lines - in fact, bursts of laughter, an incredible action and a great plot. Choice of fantastic music and atmosphere, brilliantly directed and brilliant. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good British movie or a bit of action, I do not know why the film never took off, I thought it was not as well known as it deserved. If it's nothing else, watch this movie for one of the greatest finals of all time. Do not give in, but it makes your heart beat!
