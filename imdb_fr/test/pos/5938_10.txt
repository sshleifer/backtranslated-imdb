If you liked the Murder Diagnostic TV series, you'll love Murder 101. It's a pleasure to see Dick Van Dyke again in a mystery murder. If we're lucky, this one will be the beginning of a television series or at least a series of movies. <br /> <br /> This film has certainly had some great and remarkable actors filling the roles. But it did not look like a movie "face". It's really a story that has made you forget the celebrity of those on the screen. <br /> <br /> I made a guess about the end and I was so pleasantly surprised at the end that I had to watch it again! It's a must for any mystery lover or any Dick Van Dyke lover!
