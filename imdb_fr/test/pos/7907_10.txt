My cousins ​​and I watched this movie since we were young. I do not know exactly what it is about in this film, but we have attached ourselves to this endearing film and it has become a special part of the memories of our family. <br /> <br /> I absolutely and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who loves good, healthy family movies because it's exactly that. The things the four kids get into are absolutely hilarious to watch. It's an old movie, but do not be fooled. It's one of the best films that shows such a strong connection between brothers and sisters.
