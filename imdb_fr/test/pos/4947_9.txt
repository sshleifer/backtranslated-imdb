Iron Eagle has always been one of my favorite movies for a long time. It looks like Topgun but with a different plot and (a lot of people will not agree here with me) it's in my opinion better than Topgun. <br /> <br /> This film features scenes of incredible dogfights as jet fighters zoom through the air. There is also the song Queen "One Vision" that strikes in the background, which in my opinion is a fantastic song. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Iron Eagle was very good but its aftermath was nil. <Br /> <br />
