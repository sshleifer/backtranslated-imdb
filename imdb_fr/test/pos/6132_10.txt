I watched this movie "miniseries" on television in 1989 and it was an amazing movie. I would love to find a copy just to watch it again and again. It's been 15 years since I look at it and it always trots in my head. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it attracts you. The characters and the plot hold you in your arms. The end was superb. The feeling and rage the son has shown in discovering the truth about his father is unforgettable. The suspense about his fate and how he will face his father is really intense. <br /> <br /> If you can get a copy of this movie, you will have a great time watching it. <br /> <br /> Then write to me and tell me where I can get a copy.
