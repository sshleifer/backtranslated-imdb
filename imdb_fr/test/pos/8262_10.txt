As you can see, I liked the book so much that I have been using it for over 15 years for my Internet alias. (Okay, so it had to be written phonetically so that the name of the BBS is limited at the time, but what can I do?) If anyone finds this movie every time, I would really like to see it ! Janet McTeer is excellent in everything I've seen of her. I think she would have made a good Prue. And there's even a beginning of Clive Owen - before Chancer (a big series herself). What is there to love? I hope the wise powers will make it available on DVD soon! With some of the real drag, they make fun, it's time that well-executed productions also arrive on the market.
