This movie was fun! Especially if you are between 8 and 15 years old. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes form a credible Grade 8 team that returns to an adult who truly deserves it. Paul Giamatti is a great adult that you really want to "have". My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: No really bad words or sex to worry about. Recommend it to the "good" crowd.
