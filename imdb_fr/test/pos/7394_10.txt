Some will say that this movie is a guilty pleasure. I loved this movie but I do not feel guilty. You can say that the entire casting and the team had fun doing this movie. But Jack Frost 2 is not doing well with some people. From the beginning, you can say that this film will be cheesy and that it definitely has an amateurish look. Well, if you have the privilege of watching this movie, remember that Jack Frost 2: The revenge of the mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now, because I can not fill ten lines, here are some beautiful scenes: <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The three women on the beach had a great death. The first one was Jack in a tree putting ice cubes on one of them. He continued to miss him so he dropped an anvil on her. The next woman fell on a bed of ice cubes. The last was stabbed in the eyes with pliers. <br /> <br /> The other big was the one where two stone surfers hang near a frozen pole. One of them has the tongue stuck on it (of course). Jack Frost pulls him back and snatches out his tongue, saying "COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!" Well, you have to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the children of the snowball did a good job. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> stars to infinity
