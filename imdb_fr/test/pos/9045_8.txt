It may not be a 10 out of 10 but for me the jokes have not failed. I think I saw him many times when I was younger and still on DVD, and I laughed every time. The humor is simple and fun, this movie was just one of the many small movies that Disney was throwing at the time. I found the parts where people out of the invisible loop saw the invisible people. Great movie, if the opportunity to see this, I recommend you to see him for a fashionable laugh. My favorite character in all of Dexter's series should certainly be Dean Higgins, I love his voice and hear him get angry, especially to see that his expression at the end was purely hysterical for me.
