It is particularly difficult for a director to make a film without being precious, consanguineous, too dramatic or all three. Breillat skilfully demonstrates the instinctive and playful methods of a woman author, which consists in extracting from a pair of "cattle" (as Hitchcock called the actors) a love scene of burning intimacy. His main battle is with his main man ("an actor is really a woman," she said), although it is naturally the main woman who steals the show. I do not agree that this is Breillat's first comedy. "Romance" was hilarious at times, but I accept that the sense of French humor may be elusive for foreigners; indeed, dozens of IMDb critics have not detected any comedy in Romance. On the other hand, Sex Is Comedy gives rise to a lot of laughter, mainly by using an actor accessory that dates back thousands of years to the ancient Plautus and Greeks. Leaving the theater, we wondered if Roxane's "beard" was a wig. Anne Parillaud interprets the role of Breillat in her own scenario, with ten years less than her age.
