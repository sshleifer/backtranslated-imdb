I remember seeing this film when I was very young and several times on television since. I always liked that. I noticed on the copy shown on local TV that a scene reversed the film. It's the one where they hide behind the rocky outcrop (look like Vasquez Rocks near Los Angeles) watching the Indians pass by. If you look closely, you will notice that suddenly all the soldiers are left-handed! It's only a short segment and I must admit that it took me years to notice. <br /> <br /> The story goes that there were often expeditions to save white captives from the Indians. The direct connection for the final battle scene is the Battle of Beecher Island. During this action, a group of volunteer scouts equipped with repeating rifles (Spencer rifles and non-Winchesters) was surprised by the Indians and retreated to an island, blocking several charges. In the last count, they killed Roman Nose, one of the most famous Indian chiefs. I do not know at all if the scenario writer had that in mind, but it fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> There are several films of Guy Madison that I hope to release on DVD one day and this is one of them.
