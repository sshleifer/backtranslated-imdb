I think this TV movie was aired for the first time the same week as Manchester Utd in the final of the Champions League (1999). That week, they broadcast a lot of football-related articles and this one was exceptional. <br /> <br /> He played on all the clich√©s that are produced every season during the FA Cup, that is brave outsiders, lucky clothes / mascots, a name on the cup, etc. and turned out to be very funny. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised, this has never been repeated before other major football events, even now that the World Cup is just starting. <br /> <br /> A few previous articles from non-football fans have said that they still love him, but a football fan will find him hilo to ho.
