A wonderful Christmas story on the moving theme of "Susie Homemaker finds her Inner Amazon". No, I'm serious! Geena Davis' amnesia begins to improve when she is hit in the head. From this familiar start, we go in an unexpected direction. Good rhythm, good action, funny story, lots of explosions and chaos.
