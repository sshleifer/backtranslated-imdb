People who thought that THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK were craving louder than the black hole engulfed by EVENT HORIZON, probably did not see the movie that spawned Vin Diesel's killer skin and probably have no intention of do it. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK really beats the big ass. <br /> <br /> Directed by the genre veterinarian David Twohy (WARLOCK and the excellent but underrated BELOW) and written by brothers Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with a prologue "ALIEN". When a freighter / passenger co-pilot is severely damaged by a meteorite shower (the captain is also killed), co-pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell of SILENT HILL) has an important decision to make: abandon the cargo or passengers? Near to picking up the ore over the occupants, the forced landing derails its ultimate action. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, the catastrophic landing took place on a threatening rock that once housed a mining colony. Among the survivors are two settlers, Shazza (Claudia Black from FARSCAPE) and Zeke (John Moore); an imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say "red shirts" boys and girls?); an antique dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a "young boy" named Jack (Rhianna Griffith), and the most controversial members of the group: a Marshall named Johns (the very thin Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous murderer named Riddick (Diesel). <br /> <br /> The unrest in the group dynamics is a major contributor to dramatic tension, particularly with respect to Riddick's concerns and the number of people he could slice and dice if ever he 'escaped. But no one here comes out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest rejects have less to do with their way of understanding than with how they will survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. Hungry, fast-paced things drag themselves where they are not seen, living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive. They want the newcomers flesh to satisfy their appetites, but they can not go out in the daylight to look for food. <br /> <br /> Does the phrase "total eclipse" make things a little more interesting? You betcha. Hence the title more than adequate. <br /> <br /> Wine, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on his most gloomy day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, spends a busy day with a character that really seems worth it. or two, and Hauser, a sweat of threats and bile, is just as good as his father, Wings, was on the screen. Surprisingly, Mitchell is doing well and manages to be strong and friendly in the manner of Fry. You would expect nothing less than a good performance from Black, the one that used to be "Aeryn Sun", and she does not disappoint. (Too bad his role was not bigger, but that's all I'll say about it.) And David gives his usual indelible impression of a holy man whose faith will be truly tested in the very well. from hell. <br /> <br /> The pace advances faster than Riddick slips behind his prey with a wand in his teeth, and once night falls, terror and tension never falter, much as in other science fiction movies / classic horror imitates. But if the imitation is really the most sincere form of flattery, Dave Twohy and the Wheats deserve to be remembered for having succeeded this one with revenge and for giving us an anti-Hollywood ending. <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil the surprises, so I will not say more, except that if you saw CHRONICLES first and you were not too happy, give us a chance at PITCH BLACK. And if you have not seen either, start with this one. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Wine has done so far, but it could certainly be worse than calling these guys again. I would love to see what they would dream next ...
