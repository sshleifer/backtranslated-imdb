In spite of myself, I really like this film. Pauley Shore is always funny to laugh, and here is no exception. It is simply excellent for playing weirdo with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> His performance in this area, although nothing extraordinary for him, is so good, it seems to improve the performance of other members of the cast. Maybe that's because he's the kind of guy that's easy to bounce back. <br /> <br /> The clich√©s about country life in this movie are hilarious and the way "boy from the city" of Shore is, Crawl is so much at odds with the way of life, is funny too but it is not only one who is a fish out of the water; The comedy also comes from the fact that, for anyone "ordinary", Crawl is a monstrous nightmare person. That's why this movie works so well: we love Crawl, it's a breath of fresh air, but we can also sympathize with the Warner. It is a culture shock. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is a Pauley Shore classic, there is no need for a lot of brain power to enjoy the movie, enjoy it, and even a "never judge a book by its cover "moral type here somewhere. Not bad, not bad at all.
