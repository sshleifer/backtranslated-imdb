Hi, Army Sgt I'm sorry dude, but being a SGT in the military and being part of the National Army Guard does not make you qualified to comment on a Marine movie. You are not a sailor and it is not because you wear a uniform that you can be assimilated to a sailor. We are simply the best, we have the toughest training, yes, we have big heads talking about ourselves, but hey, when you're the best, you like strutting. I was at the invasion of Iraq and Fallujah. I fought next to soldiers. You are not "qualified" to say anything about my navy. I hate to be the one who starts any "what branch is the best", but you do not have the right to say that you are qualified to judge a Marine film. Oh yes ...... we are drilling instructors ....... no SGT. This is the biggest clue that you have no idea what you are talking about. Yes, we do not "curse" recruits anymore. Tell me, how do you talk to someone about a better navy? How am I going to hit someone to make a marine a better sailor? Yes, it's a nicer training camp for what I've been through But we're dealing with different times and people. We are making people smarter than our generations. We want smarter recruits, not more nasty. And all those who sign up to become sailors, commit themselves to be the best of their country. We do not have to reinforce that in Bootcamp. The Marines come to Bootcamp to get killed. We do not need to teach them that by demoralizing them by insulting and beating them. At least that's what I feel. And yes, I am "qualified" to say it. I have been on the battlefield many times and trained navies and recruits who eventually found themselves on the battlefield. But again, what do I know? I was right there, I did that, I had the t-shirt. SGT of the army ....... have a clue!
