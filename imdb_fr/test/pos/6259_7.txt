Malcolm McDowell diagnosed Megan Gallagher's daughter's illness when she was persuaded to see "The Huldre", troll-like creatures living with "rocks and roots" (to quote the movie). <BR /> <br /> Basically, a family moves into an older house, which has a little dollhouse in the garden. The girl (well played by Sofia Vassiliova) begins to befriend creatures until they become vindictive. The family cat also disappears. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes with Megan Gallagher ("Millennium") and Malcolm McDowell as a psychiatrist. One of McDowell's patients is also concerned. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of story, you may also like "Bad Ronald", whose theme is similar, and the house is haunted by the bad Ronald (Scott Jacoby) only this movie is 70's. 7/10.
