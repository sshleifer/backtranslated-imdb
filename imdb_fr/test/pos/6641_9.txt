Apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live on a small farm on an isolated island to escape the civil war on the continent. They provide lenses to a couple of customers in order to collect money and buy supplies. They love each other and Eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby but Jan, who is reluctant, who is a weak and sensitive man, does not want to have children. When the rebels arrive on the island, their peaceful and calm life turns to hell and they find themselves in the middle of accusations on both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) sues Eva, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man. The love and affection they feel for each other turn into hatred and indifference. <br /> <br /> "Shame" is an anti-war A film by Ingmar Bergman, centered in the eyes of two apolitical artists who do not listen to the news, but when the war arrives on their land, their love, their friendship and affection are destroyed by insane soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have top performances as usual and I do not remember seeing Liv Ullmann's chest in another film. Jan Rosenberg's brutal and sensitive process of brutalizing the war is impressive and the dark and open conclusion is pessimistic and adapted to the dramatic narrative. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vergonha" ("Shame")
