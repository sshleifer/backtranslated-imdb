This film is one of those that can not be considered by its appearance. Indeed, at first glance, it seems that the story focuses simply on the desire to have more money. But ... let's look at the other side ... What do you see? You see that money is only a metaphor for the ambiguous feelings of the human being: should I do what is right or wrong? And ... what is the "good thing"? We'll do some deeper analysis ... -What does that mean a small town on the border? - That means we can sometimes get too close to the border to do something we thought we could not do ... - What does it mean, the arid soil shown in this picture? - It means the drought that sometimes seizes our wounded hearts ... - What does the character's sentence (KRISTEN) mean: "Now, I belong to him"? - It means the loss of our free will because of our unpremeditated acts. In MY REVIEW, it is the author of the story and the director tried to tell us. By the way ... do you remember what another character (JACK BARNES) said: "Nothing is so simple ..."
