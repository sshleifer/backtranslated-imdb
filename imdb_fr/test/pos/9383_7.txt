Honestly, I can say that "The bed of death: The bed that eats" was a much better movie than I expected. Let me clarify the plot in case the title of the movie is a little too vague - there is a bed that eats. An evil bed. He eats people. Several unsuspecting women making an "exit", fall on the sinister "bag" and eventually become the prey of hunger. The devouring process of the bed consists of a yellow foam that plunges people into its interior ... acid of the stomach; all complete with chewing sounds. This is a very strange cult film and the only film by George Barry who forgot to do so until word of mouth of his restored cult status came back and he decided to do it again. go out on DVD. Not a bad movie at all, if you can look beyond the unhealthy game and enjoy the effects of hokey - the most laughable is the guy whose hands are devoured and he only has skeletal fingers of plastic appearance .. ., also, looking very surreal and aberrant - mostly all about the artist behind the painting and the demonic story of the bed. If you like weird, budget-free, weird movies, then you're definitely looking for "Death Bed".
