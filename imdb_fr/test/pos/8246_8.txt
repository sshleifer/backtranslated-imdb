There is an interesting division in the vote for this film (at least for the moment). Those who expect a documentary are impressed, or at least are not disappointed. I think those who will award 1 out of 10 to the film are those who were waiting for a war movie or a re-imitation of the Gallipoli invasion. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to see actors, gunshots and fanfares, this movie will not suit you. If you want to see an independent documentary about Gallipoli, without bias for any of the parties (the only enemy in these events is the war itself), you will be impressed and disappointed. I found the film very moving and I even loved Captain Guy Nightingale at the end.
