Although this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it's better than most others. I mean it made a little laugh and just a good feeling. It's not very often that we see two old geezers having fun with their age and honestly have a good time with the jokes. Walter and Jack had such chemistry as friends / brothers-in-law. Just watching them interact with these women, it was fun and we rooted for them all the time, whether we have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had the game! : D I loved being able to move on and have fun, no matter what your age. I would recommend this movie to laugh if you want one. <br /> <br /> 7/10
