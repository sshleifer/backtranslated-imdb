Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done better to tackle a very difficult exercise: to keep political events dry as a human drama and to provide impartial representation of extremely controversial topics. <br /> <br /> his first-time success is brilliant, although Max Phipps' Gough Whitlam performance was less impressed than other commentators. John Stanton was Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter was Rex Connor. The latter must have been one of the easiest casting choices in history - Hunter could not have been more perfect for the role. On the second charge, the series avoids the trap of the "myth of objectivity" through a narrator who expresses the sympathies of the director (Phillip Noyce, who recently demonstrated his left-wing skills in Rabbit Proof Fence), while being cautiously impartial and sympathetic in its dramatic representation of all parties. Adherence to the Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth theme, popular among Labor supporters, may have been somewhat partial, but not ruinously. In particular, we must pay tribute to the sympathy shown to Kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position in which he was placed, no matter what his thoughts are about his actions. <br /> <br /> There is however a bitter note for which producers have perhaps not been entirely to blame - the portrait of the Jim Cairns / Juni Morosi affair. Those who will attend the series without having any experience of these events will have the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign led by a pensive trough. The producers may have been limited in this regard by the Australian defamation laws and by the recent willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who suggested that their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit one year before). his death). However, we could have said more about the bizarre way in which Morosi managed the Cairns office as treasurer. <br /> <br /> About defamation, there are some disorienting moments where dialogue is obscured due to injunctions by offended people. directors - by a beep once and by a loud phone ringing another time. Another curiosity: the DVD comes out of a cartoon line where a customs officer (played by Paul Chubb) serves Tirath Khemlani on his arrival at Sydney Airport. The next in the queue is a hippie with a disgusted look, who only gets a disapproving look from Chubb when he presents his papers. In the original version, Chubb was saying something like, "drug detox in Bali, huh?" Clearly, this line no longer sounds in the wake of the Schapelle Corby affair, which dramatically showed that people arrested for using drugs in Bali could expect much worse than deportation.
