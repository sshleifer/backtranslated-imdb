Good movie. At first, I thought it was a detective-type hi-fi movie, but the end totally surprised me. I suppose the whole movie covers too many subjects, each of which may be the main subject, for example. revenge, friendship and dream. But it all mixed them up without focusing on any of them. I think it would be a good movie if it is built around the end of the beginning. <br /> <br />
