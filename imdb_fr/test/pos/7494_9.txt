It's a damn good movie, with surprising twists, a good cast and a good script. Some silly stupid things, like the hit-man scene Rasta (This guy is a professional?), But that has already been commented. The fact of having heard only one type at work mentioning it before and having only many opinions or criticisms to make made the thing even more amusing. This gives a higher score than some people think they deserve, but I have to take into account the low budget and the good efforts of the cast. It makes me sick that some films with a budget equal to the GDP of a small country, with an enthusiastic release, good reviews, a director and / or Oscar-winning actors, turn out to be very disappointing, with actors somnambulists at Through their roles and an uninspired direction, with predictable intrigues and a story with holes, Sandra Bullock could drive a bus loaded with bomb. (Examples in my opinion are The Terminal, Castaway, Matrix: Revolutions) Extra points are awarded to the wardrobe department who chooses excellent clothes for casting, especially Paulina Porizcova, who wears a rubber dress in a scene and a jacket with "c * nt" on the back in big letters in another! A sex scene that shows her tight ass and a good soundtrack are bonuses! And please, enough with the comparisons Tarantino, it does not remind me at all a film of Tarantino ... and Tarantino borrows almost all the ideas that he had other films! Even if this is your opinion, do we say that once a given film or book is written or written in a way, no one can ever use the same ideas again? become real. This film has its own style.
