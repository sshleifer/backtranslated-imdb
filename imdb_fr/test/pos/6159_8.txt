Attractive European entry on Czech fighter pilots who flew for the RAF during the Second World War. It's always interesting, as an American, to see a new perspective on familiar events in history. There is nothing very original or revolutionary in the style in which this is shot or in the romantic love triangle that anchors the story. Yet he is convincing all the way through. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action and symbolism that is magnificently downplayed by the director and cast. It's a breath of fresh air after sitting down in such horrendous and boring Hollywood epics as "Pearl Harbor". Solid production all around. If you are a fan of foreign cinema, it is definitely worth it.
