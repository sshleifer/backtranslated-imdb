"The Beguiled" is a strange work among the works of Clint Eastwood. In 1971, he became the star of action movies, not only Westerns (the genre in which he first made a name for himself), but also war movies (such as "Where Eagles Dare") and crime novels (such as "Coogan's Bluff"). Yet, although "The Beguiled" is a wartime (American Civil War) event, created by Don Siegel, who previously led Eastwood in "Coogan's Bluff" and was to lead it later that year in "Dirty Harry" ", not an action film in the traditional sense. Eastwood had played an active role in most of his earlier films, but here his role is largely passive: his character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded fugitive who must rely on women's charity to survive. Even while serving with his unit, McBurney played no active role in the conflict; he is a Quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms and who served in the Union forces as a medical order. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in Louisiana towards the end of the war and begins with the discovery of McBurney, wounded, discovered by a girl, Amy, and brought back to his boarding school. The school is small, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are strong supporters of the confederate cause and wish to hand over to the authorities, the director, Martha Farnsworth, has decided to shelter and care for her, fearing that her injuries will be fatal. he was to be sent to prison. one of the notoriously severe prisoner camps of the Confederation. <br /> <br /> Although McBurney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion with regard to pacifism, he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following his teachings on the sin of fornication and, as he begins to to recover, he makes full use of it. He was fortunate enough to exercise his charms on staff and older girls, and he gained the affection of many of them, including Miss Farnsworth, his assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the most older. Even Amy, twelve, seems to have a kind of childish crush on him. In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school, her presence arouses jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, rejected in favor of Carol, the bourgeois, organizes a terrible revenge. (It's interesting to note that the only woman who resists McBurney's fetish is Miss Farnsworth's black slave, Hallie, even though he tries to win his share by pointing out that he's fighting to free people like her .). <br /> <br /> "The bad guy" has been described as an anti-war film, but that seems to me to be a misconception. The film does not really deal with the rights and disadvantages of civil war or war in general. The only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants, and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge and not by a zeal for the Confederate cause. It would be more accurate to view the film as a drama about the psychological tensions that may be caused by the particular circumstances of the war. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the school, located in a beautiful and old pre-war mansion, looks like an island of peace in the middle of the war. The building is classical in style, associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story that unfolds in its walls is one of disorder, passion and violence, qualities associated with the school. Gothic writing which, in the nineteenth century, was often considered the antithesis of classicism. The film can be considered as belonging to the "Southern Gothic" tradition in American literature and literature. <br /> <br /> The film did not have much box office success, perhaps because Eastwood was so much screened against the guy. It may not be his best film, but he has shown that he can expand his range and play something other than action heroes. (In "Play Misty for Me", his first film as director realized the following year, he had to play again a "passive" character threatened by a vindictive woman). There is very good performance by female members of the cast, particularly Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth, seemingly a respectable middle-aged girl but a woman of strong passions in herself. (There are hints that she may have had an affair with a man she said was her brother). There are also good contributions by Elizabeth Hartman in the role of timid and repressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of ​​revenge and the young Pamelyn Ferdin in the role of Amy. (Amy is an animal lover - a key moment in the film comes from the time McBurney kills her turtle - so it's worth noting that Ferdin became an animal rights activist later). The character I cared less about was Carol, Jo Ann Harris, who seemed too modern, like a chick of the seventies transported in the 1860s. The film is remarkable for the emotionally intense "greenhouse" atmosphere that Siegel gives him. It will not be a film that will please everyone. some will find it too tired and melodramatic, and some will find it misogynistic. (Judith Crist called this film "hateful and sadistic woman"). Others, however, may find this dramatic psychological. 7/10
