This film set the standard for African American film excellence when it was shot. Over time, I have heard repeatedly in the film that there was pressure for an Oscar nomination when it was released. This movie plays on different emotions, and you really feel for all the characters. Of course, some actors are a bit of wood, but fortunately, these roles are not essential. The music is sensational and if you do not think the end is a shredder, you do not have a heart in your chest. If you watch "Cooley High", you will see that many movies have copied various elements to reinforce their own movies. The biggest example of this is "Boyz N The Hood".
