A big fan of Hammer Studios and an enthusiastic observer of their Gothic Horror films, I wonder what took me so long to start watching their one-season 1980 series "Hammer House of Horror" Having seen the first four episodes of the series, I can say that this easily meets my expectations so far. Even if this first episode "Witching Time" is perhaps not the most imaginative horror story ever told, and does not deliver the wonderful Gothic atmosphere for which I love Hammer movies from the 50s to the 70s. , it probably allows to tell in a surprising way. Spooky tale and create real goosebumps within fifty minutes. Film score composer David Winter (Jon Finch) is tormented by the 17th century witch Lucinda (Patricia Quinn) ... Although its story is simple, its duration is less than an hour, but it is effective and offers many scary moments. . Northern Irish actress Patricia Quinn, probably best known for her role in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975), as well as for Monty Python's fantastic comedy "The Meaning of Life of Monty Python" (1983), is wonderfully malicious that suits him like a glove. Jon Finch is also very good as David, and although Prunella Gee, who plays his wife adulterous actress, may not be the best actress of all time, she is really nice to watch. The episode is accompanied by a beautiful score that plays well with the atmosphere. Overall, "Witching Time" is a very entertaining episode with several really scary moments and a decent opening of the series.
