A recent documentary on filmmaking presents a long list of actors and directors who talk about what it's like to make a movie. A common theme was that you can have a good screenplay, an excellent cast, the best director and a lot of money while creating a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Down Periscope is the proof of the corollary of this theory. This is not an original scenario or terribly well written. Some strong actors, but mostly unknown, and this film makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to simply say that Kelsey Grammar directed this film, but it is not really the case. Other actors, such as Rob Schneider and the hilarious Harland Williams, have contributed greatly to making the film enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The dynamic of the actors, or this mysterious "magic of the film" are really what happened here, during the creation of a movie. it flows afloat, has incredibly well executed transitions and line after line well-written and well-interpreted dialogues. <br /> <br /> An absurd place, lots of technical inaccuracies and just planning nonsense that could not happen in the real world, or the real marine, but you do not care. As a merchant marine, I found that the film's overall atmosphere was not plausible, but that it was not far from reality in terms of life at sea. <br /> <br /> This is a VERY funny movie. , a good family movie, and, especially if you're a fan, a lot of Kelsey Grammar wit, sarcasm and madness.
