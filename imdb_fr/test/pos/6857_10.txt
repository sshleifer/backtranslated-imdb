With "Anatomy", German film producers have tried to create something totally new. There are usually only dramatic or comic films - in the genre of horror is (or was) totally new at this time. <br /> <br /> The story is also new and shocking. Franka Potente plays brilliantly and I bet you will not know who the murderer is. It's possible, but difficult. A very good movie with a lot of talented actors.
