This film made me cry. I must say that if I did not have a handsome husband at home, I would ask this beautiful work of art to marry me. Aaron Carter gives a masterful performance as a confused young pop star, while Timothy Barton writes a quick and witty dialogue that only reinforces the genius of Carter's performance. Kyle is rather cheerful, but his performance is nothing short of spectacular. He is also very beautiful and cute. I'm thinking of asking him for an appointment and make him a very sweet goodnight gift.) <br /> <br /> If you would like to discuss this movie in the future, contact me. <br /> <br /> Nick Burrell Vassar Class of 2012 Malibu, California Malibu West 310 924 0126
