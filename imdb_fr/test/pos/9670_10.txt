This is the biggest show ever done next to South Park. I love this show! it's so funny and Peter's laugh is hilarious. You have to watch this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before. One of my favorite shows of all time. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to see some of the latest episodes, such as I dream of Jesus, or stories of a third degree, nothing. But there has never been an episode I did not like. All episodes are absolutely hilarious. There is also an excellent satire. You can find a lot of clips on your tube. If you are somewhere near a computer or television, see it immediately as you can.
