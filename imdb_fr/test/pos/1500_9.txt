The three short films included in this compilation published in 1959 are timeless classics of Chaplin, no complaints with them and nothing to criticize either. Chaplin's score for these films and the added frame as transition sections between the shorts are also well done. The problem with this compilation is minor but boring. The shorts were printed to fit the frame's 24 frames. the speed of contemporary movies while the shorts themselves were shot at 20 frames per second. The result is a jerky movement that does not look very attractive, and yet it was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time, it's just not excusable that the current DVD version is not restored, the movies look dirty as they were in 1959 and are still printed stretch. There are various restored versions of these classics available, even on DVD, and the restoration of the image would not be a problem, but alas, it was not done. <br /> <br /> A small concern took up a lot of space in my article, but I repeat a small minor complaint, it should not hurt too much the experience although it hurt a point of my note. Shorts are always '10'.
