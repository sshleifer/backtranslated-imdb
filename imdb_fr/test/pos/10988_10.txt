What a beautiful cast for this movie. The timing was excellent and there were so many smart lines that I laughed a few more times after they were delivered. I found that Manna From Heaven had some surprising moments and, although I thought that some things were going to happen, the way they came together was anything but predictable. This film talks about hope and reparation for wrongs. I left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing. Congratulations to the five sisters.
