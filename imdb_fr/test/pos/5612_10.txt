The entry of Hal Hartley into a series of European films is one of his two or three best efforts to date and, thankfully, one of the few available on DVD. At just 63 minutes of running, my only minor complaint would be with Hartley. I'm always going to want more, but never as much as this time. Martin Donovan is amazing as Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting like Magdelena, but the highlight for me was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Fool) in the role of Satan. Hartley gives him an excellent dialogue and a chance to fully utilize his resounding voice. Look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits, as if a devil of poetry was about to be won by the devil. I read other reviews on this movie and had to add mine because there is not enough praise. If you love Henry Fool, Martin Donovan in anything (in front of Sex), and / or in very intelligent comedies based on biblical ideas, get this as quickly as possible.
