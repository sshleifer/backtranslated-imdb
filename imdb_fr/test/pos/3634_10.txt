I rented this movie, but I did not know what to expect. I was very happy to see it as the best Brazilian film I have ever seen. The story is rather strange and simple, and above all extremely original. We have Antonio, a young man living in Nordestina, a city in the middle of nowhere in northeastern Brazil, who is deeply in love with Karina. The main conflict between the two is that while Antonio loves her small town and does not want to leave it, Karina wants to see the world and wants it. Proof of his love for her, he decides to go out and bring him the world. He will put Nordestina on the map, as he says. And the way he does it is amazing. It's a good movie; It may sound a bit slow for some people because of its different editing work, but I think it's also a better story. It's just fun, and it makes you feel good.
