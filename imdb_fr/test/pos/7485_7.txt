We are taken to a convenience store where Nick is looking at some coins in his hand to determine if he can get the special dish, a 69 cents 20 ounce cup of coffee, along with a free pastry. He decides to choose a bigger size, which is of course more expensive and does not allow him to win cake. He tries to argue with the Indian clerk in the register, who keeps it. With her, it's a matter of principle. Well, Nick gets upset not to follow his path and decides to kill her. <br /> <br /> The tone of the story is given from the beginning. The people we are going to meet are not nice. There is Nick, his girlfriend, Dallas and their partner Billy Hill. They are drug traffickers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and former criminal partner, in Houston. He wants to make one more transaction and then go to Paris with the profits from the sale of the medicines he brings. What he does not realize is that Casey left directly. He is an architect, married to Christine and wants to adopt a baby. <br /> <br /> Casey does not like his old friend bringing drugs home. He decides to get rid of them by throwing them in the kitchen. The untimely arrival of Ice, a pizza delivery man, surprises Casey. This man was sent to kill him, but before that, Casey shared a weed to share with Ice, who has a knack for typing. <br /> <br /> It's at this point that Dr. Jarvis, the man from the adoption agency, arrives. Casey's claim shows a gap of two years that he can not justify. Jarvis begins to doubt the future father. At this moment, Dallas makes an entry. It's a woman asking blank questions, like asking if Jarvis likes to watch porn. Jarvis, who is excited ends up leaving in a breath. Dallas decided to seduce Casey at all costs. There is a surprise in store when Billy Hill comes in and he does not like what he sees, he turns Dallas. Billy Hill has also come off Casey, but he's too powerful. <br /> <br /> Casey receives a visit from Kasarov who wants to get his money from Nick; in his absence, he will take it to Casey. Kasarov gives a deadline and Casey decides to thwart all these little lives. He sends all parties home at a fixed time and the different factions are doing their own thing. In the end, Casey has a better plan that includes taking Christine for a trip to Paris. <br /> <br /> Having never heard of "Thursday", we were attracted by this talent. Skip Woods directed his own material. It seems like a movie with good intentions. Sometimes, the film remembers others of the same kind, and not a sin, whatever its form, which seems to be the main objection of the negative comments left here on the IMDb website. For starters, "Thursday" shows a spiritual spirit, Skip Woods, who went on to write other films, including "Swordfish". The scenario is divided into chapters with evocative titles, related to the action. Denis Lenoir does wonders with mainly indoor photography. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane brings an excellent contribution to the film with his Casey. Although difficult to imagine, he beat all obstacles and created something in himself. This actor, recently seen in the television series "Hung", is one of the actors we never tire of watching. Aaron Eckhart with black hair is a welcome addition to any movie. He is a greasy criminal who shows no redemptive quality or remorse and who does not hesitate to involve his old friend in his ploy. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same goes for Paulina Porizkova, a beautiful creature that is just a distraction or an afterthought to add a sexy angle. We enjoyed Glenn Plummer, who appears as Ice. He does an average audition on the phone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke also appear.
