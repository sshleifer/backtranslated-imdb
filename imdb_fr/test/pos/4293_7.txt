Another popular showing for a British image at Century Theater in Coalville. A solid and well-crafted drama with a constantly developing plot and "twists and turns in history" ... as lies accumulate! A master class for an impeccable casting, well organized by the director for the first time, Julian Fellowes. Exceptional performance, as usual, of Tom Wilkinson, but good in turn from all concerned, including secondary actors, Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our film was captivated by our audience, which includes some shock incidents that really make you "jump". A good tight production of about 80 minutes, probably produced with a very limited budget, but a success that should allow Fellowes to shoot again for the big screen. Some publicity for the film seemed to suggest that it was in the 50s (according to Nigel Balchin's novel), but this is obviously not the case. Recommended visualization.
