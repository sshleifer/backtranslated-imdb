This film is amazing. It's funny, sexy, violent and sick, but everything comes together for a brilliant rendition of Romeo and Juliet in Troma. If you do not mind being disgusting (ok not bad, but it's funny disgusted), see this movie. Is it worth it! There is not a level on which it does not work. I've seen it three times now, and it's still amazing. I recommand it. Go! Find!
