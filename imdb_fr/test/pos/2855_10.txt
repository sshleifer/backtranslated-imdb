Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who loves a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear) and is married to Del, a stupid and stupid chauvinist trying to sell stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he is brutally murdered, while Betty secretly observes him. This leaves her helpless, believing that Kinnear is really her character, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his ex-fianc√©e nurse. She travels to Los Angeles to recover her lost love, not knowing that the stolen drugs are in her trunk. She sued Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock respectively), the murderers who killed Del inadvertently before discovering where the drugs were hidden. They pursue her across the country, while Charlie gradually falls in love with her image of her. <br /> <br /> And in Los Angeles, things get totally weird, no one realizing that Betty is delusional. Alternately funny and touching, this film is almost perfect. Stop reading the comments and go see it.
