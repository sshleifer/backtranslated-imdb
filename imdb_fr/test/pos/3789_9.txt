Considering all comedies with a military situation that were made in history, someone had to be first. Charlie Chaplin invented the genre in the movie "Shoulder Arms". <br /> <br /> Hard to believe that at the time it was a bold move. If you consider that some of the best movies involving people such as Bob Hope, Abbott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy involve military service and were made in wartime, it's simply something you accept and do not care about . <br /> During the First World War Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, Chaplin, went on tour. He was a great supporter of the Allied cause, unusual for someone on his left. It would seem quite natural that the tramp had been written and unfortunately was destroyed in every way. <br /> <br /> Many things that you will see in the WWII service comedies started in this country. Shoulder arm Chaplin had no more imitators because a few weeks after the release of the film, the war was over. <br /> <br /> But an art of comedy was created by one of the greatest geniuses of comedy.
