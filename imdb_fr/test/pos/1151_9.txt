Back from Morocco then, where my father was attached to the German embassy, ​​when the film was released in Europe; took all my friends to see him, show them the beauty of the country, where Jimi had played - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after leaving Ibiza and before joining Goa. Sean Combs has just celebrated this recently at a friend's restaurant in Marrakech. At the time, Djema el Fna was much wilder than now; the Stones went there earlier, recorded Brian in Tangiers; so it's family memories and entertainment and I'm glad my son gets to know North Africa by watching this movie. Candice Bergen is beautiful and oo7 / Connery is pretty funny. and Teddy Roosevelt, played by Brian Keith, is pretty impressive.
