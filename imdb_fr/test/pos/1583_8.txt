I recently saw episodes 1 to 4, and now I can not wait for the 5 and 6 to be available! (I heard they would come soon.) The commander's diary seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all the others with a taste for the original comedy. It was obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken in writing the script is quite obvious. In fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me to appreciate more the writing and the acting of the actors. Bowlsby is a master of belittling ... I only wish I could remember the best so I could use them later on unsuspecting colleagues! Let's just say that if you do not like the commander's diary, I will personally make sure your underwear gets a starch supplement!
