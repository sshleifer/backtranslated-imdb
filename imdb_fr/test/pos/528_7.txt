As a fan of Saint-Ã‰tienne and the city of London, I was very happy to see this film on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This film has great pictures, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting information about a London "not so well known". <br /> <br /> The film is presented in "dark" colors, which I personally do not like very much. In addition, the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes became a little flat. Apart from that, there are some good comments from Londoners and some great shots. FINISTERRE does not glorify London by showing all the great attractions of the city, but gives a deep insight into what it really is. On the east side is the lively center with its musical scene as well as the "small special retreats" for Londoners. <br /> <br /> In summary: <br /> <br /> + Great soundtrack + Good ideas + good ideas <br /> <br /> -Narration -Level to look at times -Very dark image < <br /> To watch! I give him a 7/10
