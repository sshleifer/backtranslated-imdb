Key West, for too short a time was "rendez-vous TV" for my family. I stopped at Red Lobster and took a party tray for the night. The irony of the situation was that I was working for a Fox affiliate at the time and that everyone at the station was furious with them for not renewing the show. Everyone in this cast was excellent. Fisher Stevens ... perfect. Who could not not identify with a "man of every day" who dreams of being a writer in Key West? Jennifer Tilly has always been outstanding (and she is a HECK of a Texas Hold'em player). You can still find the pilot episode on YouTube. Let's hope they publish the hurricane. This episode alone should have won an Emmy, as well as the rest of the cast.
