"The Dead" is really a work of art. Obviously, John Huston wanted to show that he was always "in the glory of certain passions" by making them, even as his body let him down. This film affects powerfully and persists long in the mind. The reading of Joyce's news certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially the inner turmoil of Gabriel, but the essence is at the center of this film. As the artist's statement of his love of life and his art, "The Dead" is the only one.
