It is unfortunate that iameracing wants to deny the reality of Faulkner and Clarence Brown's goal in creating the story and the film "Intruder In The Dust". I guess people in the South are struggling to bear the burden of a history of racism, and I can understand that. But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (to borrow the capital letters) iameracing, there are many places where blacks and whites of the South get along well. But to deny the way blacks were and still are forced to live, the conditions and injustices they suffered are not imaginary. Sometimes blacks and whites got along because of true affection and understanding. Sometimes it was only as long as blacks "knew their place". The purpose of making the character of Juano Hernandez (in the film and print) a rather spicy type, neither warm nor confused, was to emphasize the fact that bigotry is false in itself and that human rights are just for everyone, whether we like it or not. particular individual or not. <br /> <br /> It would be good to stop denying the existence of racism and the wrongs it has caused to Americans of all stripes. The fact is that blacks (among others) did not, as a general rule, benefit from the justice system in the same way as whites. Segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical facts. People like iameracing might claim that these things are not as prevalent as some people think and would probably like to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behaviors. It would be a wonderful thing that the ancestors of South iameracing (where applicable) have never participated in any of the horrific racist actions that have marked the history of this country and I hope they did not made. If so, congratulations, but this fact, if true, does not erase the fact that others have done so. And even if the horrors committed against blacks in the South (and in other regions, let us not forget the riots of the period of the Civil War) were only half as many, only a third, does it make them less horrible? Is the killing of ten children, the hanging of ten men, the sexual assault of ten women less horrible than the same events that occur for up to a hundred years? <br /> <br /> Iameracing asks us to remove the "Mississippi Burning" chip from our shoulders before we see "Intruder In The Dust", and I'm asking you, did the killings of civil rights activists take place place or not? Why should this be forgotten? Forgiven? May be. But to prevent them from happening again, they can not be forgotten or transformed into minor occurrences. The racism displayed in "Intruder In The Dust" is displayed deliberately. He is here to make a point. <br /> <br /> In historical cinematography, it is also ridiculous for an author to neglect the racial angle. All movie viewers shot before the 1960s know that black actors / characters / extras are usually chosen on purpose. Judging by our movie story; wars have always been waged by middle-aged white men; There was no black people in the old west; it was possible to go down a street in a big city and never meet a black man; there were no black caregivers, taxi drivers, employees, salespeople, etc. in black hospitals. Blacks were almost never incarcerated for a role unless race was a determining factor. If Falukner (and Brown) had wanted to tell a simple murder story, he probably would not have made Hernandez's character black. <br /> <br /> Racism exists. Probably for different reasons, I'm sure, we both want it not, but it's the case. Wanting things to be as we would like can probably not be helped, but that does not make them that way.
