This is one of those movies that get better with each view. I watched it three times and registered on IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. "Food" films have already been made, some of them are really good, such as a certain Japanese comedy that Asian movie lovers will know anyway. But this one is really in his own league. At the base, a Protestant Christian parable symbolizing the ideal of goodness, but far from being dogmatic, it also addresses the "good" in each of us, without distinction of our religious beliefs. Babette's feast is underestimated and refined, but it makes the movie's message stronger, if at all weaker. If you can not attend the extraordinary physical banquet offered by Babette, you are always welcome to this feast of the soul. Highly recommended !!
