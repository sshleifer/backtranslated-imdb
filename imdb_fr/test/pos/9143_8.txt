China White (1989) is Ronny Yu's first international film. This British / Dutch / Hong Kong production was shot in English and slightly modified for the Western audience. The American brothers Wong (Michael and Russell) were supposed to play together in the film but, because of previous engagements, they were not available, so another western actor, Steven Leigh, took his place. Several Hong Kong stars such as Tommy Wong (playing a mute) and the always scary William Ho appear as well as the director in an interesting cameo place. <br /> <br /> The Chow brothers are in Holland to run the family business. They want the family business to move forward, but the other Asian gangs do not want it and see it as a cost-saving gesture to please "foreigners" and want to continue earning old-fashioned money. Others want to take their business to an even lower level by smuggling drugs and so on. After the old Chow was shot in cold blood, the brothers moved against any family that was not with them. Can the Chow family prevent families from killing each other or while the streets of Holland flow with the blood of innocence and gangsters? <br /> <br /> A very underrated movie. I was surprised by its quality. I did not see the Hong Kong version. It would be a huge pleasure for me. It is longer and has many more Hong Kong movie stars involved in production. Too bad this movie is not available on D.V.D. The video I saw was washed out and the sound was not that bad. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to action fans. <br /> <br /> Factoid: This film takes place before the decriminalization of drugs <br /> <br /> in Holland.
