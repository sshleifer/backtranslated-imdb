General Information - The Octopussy and Never Say Never Again movies were both made the same year, in 1983, so people compare them naturally. Moore versus Connery. Bond vs Bond. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people claim that the "official movie" Octopussy is far superior. Well, I just watched Octopussy. Bond gets on a plane at 100 miles an hour (impossible - the wind would blow him), using his feet to force the plane to the ground, then jumping about 60 miles an hour (still impossible - try jumping of your car - you would end up with a broken body). How is this octopus scene supposed to be "good" in every sense of the word? Suddenly, Bond has superhuman strength and a titanium body. And he does all these stunts at the age of 56 ??? Shit full. Unbelievable. Farce. <br /> <br /> ---> We will now contrast the scene above with Connery's "unofficial" movie "Never Say Never Again": it does not have the same style because of his independent movie status (less money), but at least you can believe that Connery is a real spy in full danger. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Bond showing his age (he is 50 years old after all) and is sent to convalescence. Completely credible. But of course, there is no holiday for a world famous spy and Bond is quickly a target, even inside the hospital. From then on, the story sets off on a new adventure: Bond tries to locate his attempted murders and ends up thwarting an attempt to steal nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> incredible stunts. This film seems to be a natural successor to Connery's latest film, The Diamonds Are Forever from 1971 ... Bond's Old Style ... before the franchise became silly. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
