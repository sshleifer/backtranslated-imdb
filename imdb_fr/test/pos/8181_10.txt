This story documenting the rise of the first Chinese emperor and his efforts to unify the empire was the most expensive film production in Chinese history. <br /> <br /> It's worth it. A visually dazzling cinematography, a beautiful score and remarkable characters make it one of the most beautiful epics ever made on a film (foreign or otherwise.) Please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen.
