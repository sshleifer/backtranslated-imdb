Being a D.B. Fan of Sweeney, I am looking for this movie for quite some time. I recently rented the video and found it very nice. There were really hilarious scenes. The dysfunctional life of some characters was disturbing, but I think the film also shows that it's possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it's derailed.
