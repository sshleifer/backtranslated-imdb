Uzumaki is a visually stunning film, but I felt as if part of the story had been sacrificed. There is virtually no character development that leaves me personally detached from the film, which is ironic because this role-play is really appealing, with its many spiraling effects and breathtaking transitions of scenes. At first, cinematography in general has destabilized me, but as you get used to the overall look, you start to see the beauty of this twisted movie. This is a very good movie if you are looking for a viewer with too much substance or a deeper meaning. It's a big horror movie that's not really scary or suspensive, but somehow ... disturbing.
