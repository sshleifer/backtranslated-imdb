Since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the film (I lived here all my life), I was waiting for this film to come out. And I mean waited and waited for more than a year and a half for this film and for me, it was worth it. <br /> <br /> The film is different from the book but to me it's always a nice piece of work as it is the book. In both cases, I cried, there were moments that tore me apart. I laugh and I smile just as much. It's a good movie with a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> It's about never giving up on finding it, the one that will change you forever. The one who will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new vision of life. <br /> <br /> I must say that it is possible to meet someone and let them change your life forever, which is the character Gere does to Lane. I met the love of my life and immediately, I was completely captivated by the fact that I had never forgotten it or that I was crazy about success until I see it again a year later. For me, I could tell this film with all my heart. I think if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes, you'll see what I'm talking about. It's never too late to find your true love, great job Ms. Lane and Mr. Gere!
