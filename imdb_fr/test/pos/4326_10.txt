It was Libby who was talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how she found herself in the same hospital where Hurley was), then know that Libby, dead during of season 2, will explore the character more in season 3 and we will have answers to questions surrounding it. <br /> <br /> BTW, great episode. There was a great cliffhanger and some interesting questions ... like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four-toed statue? <br /> <br /> I can not wait for season 3, Lost Just Rules !!! I hope all unanswered questions will receive an answer. I loved the way they explained why the plane crashed. Desmond did it when he failed to type the numbers on time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
