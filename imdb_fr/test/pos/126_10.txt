CONTAINS "SPOILER" INFORMATION. Look at this director's other film, "Earth," at some point. It's a better movie, but this one is not only different. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist point of view from an Indian filmmaker. Tradition, rituals, duty, secrets and the representation of strict sex roles make it an engaging and culturally dynamic viewing experience. All married characters do not have the "fire" of the marriage bed with their respective spouses. A husband is single and commits a form of spiritual adultery by giving all his love, honor, time and respect to his religious swami (guru). His wife is alone and longs for the intimacy and tenderness she finally finds with her lesbian sister-in-law who has just moved home with her unfaithful husband. This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese mistress but was forced to marry a lesbian (without his knowledge). They only have sex once when his wife, a lesbian in the closet, loses her virginity. <br /> <br /> A servant lives in the house and he ends up revealing the secret that the two women are lovers. Another important character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke. However, she uses a bell that rings to communicate her needs and discontent with family members. She lets them know, through her bell or punch, that she knows exactly what is happening in the house and what she disapproves of. <br /> <br /> In the end, the truth about everyone and the two women lovers eventually run away together. But not until there is an emotional scene between the swami-addicted husband and his wife, who was once heterosexual. Her sari ignites and at first we think she will die. However, we see the two women united in the very last scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The author / director of this film questions the traditions of his culture, but it shows us human beings trapped in their culture. and the kind. We are really interested in the characters and do not think of them as stereotypes. Each of us is surprised by his humanity, his vulgarity, his tenderness, his anger and his spirit.
