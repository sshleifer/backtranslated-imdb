Werner Herzog again explores the psyche of a man. In "Little Dieter ..." we meet a brilliant and effervescent man who survived the war in Bavaria and who lives on famine and strange visions. He moved to the United States and realized his dream of flying. War, food, death, survival, hoarding, airplanes, heads stand out ... how an American was born. Herzog again sees the madness as a plan of existence and the surreal that mixes it with the poignant such as Herzog himself tells the story of a psychic journey of a German became an American who flies passenger planes in a war the end of the twentieth century, where the culmination of technology, pilgrimage and the garbage-free restoration of cans with spoons merge with constant optimism in a man redefined in American. As always with Herzog, we are confronted with a flourishing madness, a genius and what is man facing his own excesses, societal and personal. We laugh and we growl and are surprised at this man. Where else for this man than America?
