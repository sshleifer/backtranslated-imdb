After seeing the trailer, it was easy not to see this movie. I mean, I do not care stupid "stoner comedies". I'm sure it was also an easy choice for many people to get together, smoke a bowl and go see this movie with The Simpsons guy and a guy named "Billy Bob". It should have been a good time, but the movie is just not so funny - a pity that someone had to go after it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I discovered that the trailer was misleading after he left. the theaters, so I had to wait for the video. I really enjoyed that. Beautiful locations, quality production and excellent performances of all actors. In retrospect, the twists of the plot were not totally unexpected, but I did not find it tedious, because the premise was so engaging. So why has this captivating drama been sold as a comedy? Has anything happened to the producer, leaving the associated producers to do the marketing themselves?
