First, there is a police report: "self-defense" of the Belgian Stanislas André Steeman whose "the assassin lives on the 21st" had already been transferred to the screen in 1942, with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair .Steeman complained about Clouzot's adaptation for both films. The 1942 film was excellent, but the "policeman" side had been preserved, so why complain? As for "quai des orfèvres", Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career. After having directed "the raven" and having been blacklisted, he had much more to say than a simple whodunit. Worried about the poor detective end, which I will not reveal of course, but Clouzot focused on social vignettes, on psychology, and he did not care much about the puzzle of Agatha Christie. In doing so, he becomes the true predecessor of Claude Chabrol, who has always been closer to him than Alfred Hitchcock, whom he greatly admires. Suzy Delair is very present on the screen and you will love the song she really sings (she was also a singer) "with her tralala" .Bernard Blier gives, as always, an economy of gestures and words, and he succeeds really two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing: the first, Dora, the photographer: she takes pictures of female models, and Clouzot, with subtle touches, reveals that she is lesbian.Of course, the word is never pronounced (How to be in 1947?) The police chief (the fabulous Louis Jouvet) tells him: "You and I, we have no luck with women." The portrait of this cop is very detailed: we learn a lot about him, not necessarily connected with the plot Delair / Blier: he is widowed, with a son he loves and who faces academic difficulties, especially in geometry.Thus, we will know all the characters in depth.One of the most important manifestos of French cinema after the war.
