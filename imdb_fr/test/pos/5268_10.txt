"Hail The Woman" is one of the most moving films I have ever seen in my life. I watched it twice and I had tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of silent film deserves a much wider audience; unfortunately, the only engraving that remains is so scratched that most people will not look at it until the end, and the jewel that shines under the rough will miss them. This film could use a digital restoration, to help bring out its beauty, but I doubt that it will get it from anyone, because its main theme is the spiritual restoration before Christ of the family unit, and this is not politically correct these days. However, this remains a powerful theme for those who are heartbroken by the pain of broken family relationships. <br /> <br /> The cast is beautiful, especially Florence Vidor, who shines literally under the name of Judith, the girl; the ethereal Madge Bellamy in the role of Nan, the poor girl who gets pregnant and is put aside; Theodore Roberts as a meticulous old domineering father who destroys all his entourage by pride; and the handsome Lloyd Hughes, as David's son, is afraid of his father, but really of life itself. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie to watch at Christmas, in particular. You will not regret being patient and seeing it in its entirety despite its deterioration.
