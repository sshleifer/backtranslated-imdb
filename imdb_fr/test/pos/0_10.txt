I went to see this film last night after being persuaded by some friends. I'll admit I was reluctant to see him because from what I knew about Ashton Kutcher he could only do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher interpreted the character of Jake Fischer very well and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can play with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was surprised by the bursts of laughter during the first half of the film and was moved to tears during the second half. Leaving the theater, I not only saw many women in tears, but also many adult men, desperately trying to let no one see them cry. This movie was great and I suggest you go see it before judging.
