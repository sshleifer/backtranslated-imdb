As he drove dangerously zigzag on a lonely road at night, Cliff (Jay R. Ferguson) had a car accident with his friends Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Masterson) During the cold night, stuck in the woods around a campfire, they spend time telling ghost stories. In "The Honeymoon", the couple Rick (Ron Livingston) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) go in their car to Las Vegas, during their honeymoon. Rick takes a shortcut to visit the Clayton Caverns in the night, but stranger Cole (Hawthorne James) advises them to leave because dangerous creatures attack people in full moon. In "People Can Lick Too", on the eve of her twelfth birthday, Amanda (Alex McKenna) tells her Internet friend, Jessica, that she is alone at home. However, Jessica is actually a psychopath. In "The Locket", the biker Scott (Glenn Quinn) crosses the country on a motorcycle. When he has a problem with his bike, he finds an isolated house where the stupid idiot Heather Wallace (Jacinda Barrett) lives with her father. When the man returns from his flock, Scott will find the truth about Heather. <br /> <br /> "Campfire Tales" presents three good horror stories, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts, as well as a surprising tour. The weakest segment is "The Hook", with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories are excellent. The point of the plot is totally unexpected and gives a good conclusion to this horror movie above average. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Contos da Meia-Noite" ("Midnight Tales")
