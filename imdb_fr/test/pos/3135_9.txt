One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in almost everything he appears, and here he gets a rare role as a main character. Ward Bond fits him as a crumbling old Mormon leading his people to the west. The stock of John Ford's actors, including Harry Carey, Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provides considerable support, as does James Arness, strangely silent, member of the Clegg clan, an outlaw who joins the train. The Mormon Trail in Utah was one of the hardest and most demanding companies ever undertaken. We can not really realize it, but we are witnessing the trials that the pioneers had to overcome on their way to the west; river crossings, long stretches of arid, waterless desert, encounters with Indians, etc., all on the glorious song of the Pioneer Sons. The Mormons actually dug sections of the trail with picks and shovels, as the film shows. My main regret is that I did not do it in color, but I think there is a colorized version. By the way, these steep rocks represented in various scenes are called Fisher towers, located near Moab. Highly recommended viewing.
