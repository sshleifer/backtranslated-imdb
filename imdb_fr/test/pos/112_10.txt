"Water" (2005), the last part of the trilogy of Toronto-based Indian director Deepa Mehta, is finally over, almost ten years after the publication of the first controversial piece, "Fire" (1996), which followed with a slightly less controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998). Mehta made her debut as a director with a 24-minute Canadian short film entitled "At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch" (1975), but it's her Canadian feature film about the lives of Indians living in Canada. which made her famous in the east of the country. , his country of birth, 'Sam & Me' (1991). "Camilla" (1994) was internationally acclaimed, starring Bridget Fonda and the 1990 actress who won an Academy Award for best actress in the Best Leading Role category at the age of 80, opening so the way for middle aged actresses. to still have hope for his portrayal of an obstinate Jewish old woman in "Driving Miss Daisy" (1989), the late Jessica Tandy. <br /> <br /> "Camilla" was about a friendship between two women from two other ends of human life, a May / December friendship. "Camilla" was Tandy's last picture; she died the same year. <br /> <br /> The international fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the publication of the controversial "Fire", which spread with rage amid the false patriotic conscience existing in the Indian extremist. Having already explored the friendship between two women in "Camilla", in "Fire", Mehta went even further by describing a more intimate relationship between two neglected lonely women. Located in modern India, in the suburbs of the capital, New Delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the older brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) having joined a strange Hindu sect leading a life of celibacy faithful to his guru of existence without sex. . The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) has an extra-marital relationship with a Chinese girl (Alice Poon). Thus, the two wives, Shabana Azmi playing the older brothers' wife and Nandita Das the younger wife, find themselves neglected in their own way. One forced to live a single life, thanks to the eccentricities of her husband, and the other whose only interaction with her husband is sex, nothing more. Living in a world of in-laws and being the only two people outside the family, having no one to confide in, the two women fall into each other's arms. So comes the question of lesbianism. If there was an outside man's shoulder on which to cry, there would probably have been a chance they would fall into the arms of a man, but with no one else to confide in, their need Mutual support is obvious. This does not necessarily indicate that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism, it just turned out that it exists for both women in this context. Overall, the film is excellent and goes well beyond two women who roll in bed. The main objective is not lesbianism in the film, but the fate of neglected Indian women nowadays, even in the capital, the two female characters have a sexual relationship. <br /> <br /> Two years later, the second album of Deepa Mehta was the element of Mother Earth, released in India under the name '1947: Earth', another great film by a great director This time in Hindi language, unlike "Fire", which was made in English. <br /> <br /> Now, Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy, despite many problems, after publishing the last installment, "Water". No doubt it would be as good as the other two.
