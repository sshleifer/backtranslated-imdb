Uzak (2002), a Turkish film presented in the United States under the name "Distant", <br /> <br /> was directed, produced, written and shot by Nuri Bilge <br /> <br /> Ceylon. <Br/> <br /> This film is a serious and dark version of the confrontation between an "urban mouse", Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir, and a "rural mouse", Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. <br /> <br /> Both men are great actors and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting talent. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died as a result of a car accident shortly after the end of the film.) <br /> <br /> In most stories of country cousin / urban cousin, the contrast between styles of rural and urban life is portrayed with humor. In this film, there is little humor or even heat. The two men lost contact with human society. Mahmut's work as a photographer <br /> <br /> for a tiling company does not give him any satisfaction. He divorced a woman he clearly loves <br /> and still does not have satisfactory human relations. <br /> <br /> Mahmut lost his job due to the closure of a factory in his small town You have neither the skills nor the energy to find work in the city. His human interactions are mainly limited to the silent observation of other people who cross him. It is clear that he is warm and attentive, but that he can not express these qualities in an urban environment. <br /> <br /> Cousins ​​do not have a good relationship with the world, nor between them. Neither makes any effort to act in such a way as to create a connection or proximity. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this movie describes a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> It is conceivable that each cousin could have provided at least some of what was missing in the other's life. Instead, they attend unfortunate parallel classes. The two men are distant, which is a situation suggested by the title of the film. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine talked about how Ceylan brilliantly builds details on details. These details finally tell us more about the characters that we could not learn by simple exposure. <br /> <br /> Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. This is not a "working film" in the traditional sense of the genre. It is a film about work because it shows the harmful effects of unsatisfactory work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf). <br /> <br /> It's a dark film, absorbing and silent. Although that does not make me happy to watch, I left the theater <br /> <br />, realizing that I had seen a really creative and important film <br />. This film is worth looking for and seeing!
