I heard about this movie a long time ago and I finally found it on eBay for five dollars. I did not expect much but wow, have I ever been surprised? This is the story of a boy and a girl in love trying to escape an evil king who wants the girl for himself and takes place in a huge castle. It reminds me of ICO for PS2, because some shots gave you a feeling of vertigo. The standard sound this movie is crazy! It's hard to believe that such an original animated film was shot in 1952. Moreover, the king was probably one of the scariest characters I've seen in a long time, with a feminine gait, eyes strange (usually crossed) and scary voice. The only problem I had with the movie was that the boy and the girl had no personality and almost no replies other than to call. Wonderbird (a big talking green bird) to save them. The animation was fantastic in most areas, but some cells were missing in some scenes. It's incredibly original with flying policemen and giant mechs, and sometimes even laughing with laughter, it's a shame, it's such an obscure title because it's really a good movie. Check it sometimes.
