Are you looking for proof that real life is more entertaining than fiction? You have just found it. This superb documentary about an aspiring filmmaker (Mark Bortchart) who refuses to admit defeat is the funniest film I've ever seen - probably because it's also one of the most tragic. Curiously, the more I watch the film, the more I am inspired.
