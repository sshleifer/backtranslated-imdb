If there is a beautiful horror, this film is one of the best of its kind. It is a horror film that, without being devoid of bloody scenes, relies more on psychology and the mastery of tension to create strong emotions. And it's one of those films so beautifully filmed, where every scene is a world full of symbols and details, all serving the same magnitude and the kind that it can be called, but beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's not easy. story, with two sisters returning to their father's and mother-in-law's house after spending some time in a psychiatric facility. They hardly bear the death of their mother and try to protect their world, defending them against the adult world. So, the film seems to be at its outermost layer. In fact, the film slowly moves towards something very different, at a slow pace, but no frame is lost to convey the feeling of thrilling beauty, so I will not say much.
