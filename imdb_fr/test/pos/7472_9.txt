I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit that I love! It's like Tarantino in the beginning, but it's better. Really a must, but ... do not show this movie to people under 18 years old. He is full of blood and sex (the rape scene is awesome :)). Now, I'm just waiting for other films from this director and a DVD release.
