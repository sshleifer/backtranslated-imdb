Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly fused in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas carol in his sensibility. The success of the film depends on the cast of Sydney Greenstreet as a character of Alexander Yardley. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he controls his employees - until the Christmas spirit takes over. The role is a "walk in the park" for Greenstreet who had been one of the great Falstaff of the scene when he was part of the Lunts Company. Greenstreet only entered the cinema five years earlier. At 61, he was featured in what would become a film classic, the first and best film ever directed by John Huston: 'The Maltese Falcon'. 'Cuddles' Sakall has probably never been better in his traditional role of incarnating the gemutlicheit of Central Europe. The attractive set used in most of the film is a jewel that delights the eyes.
