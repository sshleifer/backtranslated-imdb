This is the best underrated role of Kellie Martin. Based on a true story, it tells the story of Fusia's attempt to save members of the Diamant family and other Jews she has met over time. One of my favorite movie scenes of all time involves a heroic act of Fusia's little sister. All children should see this scene, role models like this one are very rare. The film is well written and played. I am a movie lover and this movie, I rate 10 on the imbd rating system. It's one of my 25 best movies of all time and should be video. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
