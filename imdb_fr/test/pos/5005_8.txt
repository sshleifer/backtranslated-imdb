The talk show with Spike Feresten is one of those programs that will certainly polarize the audience. Either you like it or you do not like it. Personally, I find most things hilarious, but there is a "huh?" moments. <br /> <br /> Staples like "Idiot Paparazzi" are always good for laughs, but my favorite favorite must always be "Hollywood Douchebag". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only regular song that usually leaves me puzzled (which is part of the story!) Spike and his team of writers manage to produce tons of cool comedies every time so that the series is never out of date. Feresten's humor may not be for everyone, but it's worth a try. <br /> <br /> The masses have spoken! We love this show and want more. Please note that I am not a friend or affiliate in any way with Spike Feresten, the Talkshow with Spike Feresten staff or the Fox Network and its affiliates. It's just funny!
