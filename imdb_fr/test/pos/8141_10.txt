My friend took me to the screening of this movie in Hollywood and it was great! It's a film noir with incredible acting, a beautiful script, cool music, everything was very well done and entertaining. I do not know if it will be released in theaters, but it would be a good date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at Blockbuster. This is the kind of film I like, low budget, style and imagination. I hope that Alexandra Holden will have more important roles like in this one, she is fantastic.
