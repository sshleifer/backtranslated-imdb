Two unlucky but clever ladies decide to act like HAVANA WIDOWS on their way to Cuba to meet and sing rich men ... <br /> <br /> This is the kind of ephemeral cartoon that the studios produced effortlessly during the 1930s Well done and very enjoyable, the Depression audience does not seem to be able to get tired of these popular and fun photographic dramas. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell are perfectly represented as the frenzied women who speak fast who will go to great lengths to make some dishonest dough. Although Joan is both the star and the romantic scenes, both girls are as talented as they are beautiful to watch. <br /> <br /> The handsome Lyle Talbot plays Joan's persistent suitor, but he does not have much to do. Guy Kibbee, chubby and cherubic, appears as the target targeted by girls. Whether waking up to end up in the wrong bed or being chased on the roof of a Cuban hacienda in his long jeans, he's also hilarious. Behind him, a cast of character actors - Allen Jenkins, Frank McHugh, Ruth Donnelly, Hobart Cavanaugh, Maude Eburne and Dewey Robinson - all equally gifted to please the toughest crowd. James Murray as a suspected bank cashier with the fake check. This very talented actor was shot in King Vidor's THE CROWD (1928), one of the most prestigious films of the era of silence. The hopes were great for a great career, but his fame quickly faded with sound images. After a long series of small roles and pieces, broken and destitute, his life ended in the waters of a New York River in 1936. He was only 35 years old. <br /> <br /> He was never a star in the first Joan Blondell (1906-1979) and Glenda Farrell (1904-1971) animated many films at Warner Bros. during the 1930s, especially the eight in which they appeared together. Whether they play gold diggers, working women, reporters, or secretaries, these blond, copper-eyed women were almost always at the height of any leading man who had the chance to share the same fate with them. At a glance or a glance, their characters showed that they were ready to face the world - and all the men who compose it. Never as ruthlessly reckless as Paramount's Mae West, you've always felt that, no matter how difficult, Blondell and Farrell have used their strength to defend their vulnerable hearts ready to break the good guy. Although many representations of seven decades ago may appear camper or artificial today, these two charming ladies always have a lively and impertinent spirit.
