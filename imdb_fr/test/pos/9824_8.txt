I do not know how I would feel if I lived in the United States. I would look at preview scenes, commercials, I would know, Sidney Pollack was realizing it, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas playing the lead role. I would watch this movie as soon as possible without reading any reviews. Would I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> I read a lot of critics who say how bad this movie was: It's boring, long movie without passion emotions and it's not interesting. Harrison is wooden, cold. Sub-lots must be cut. Too serious, especially for Harrison Ford. The subject interests me and I like Harrison Ford in films that are not actions. I also like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. So, reading the reviews on the IMDB website, then on other sites, and then in February in Hungarian film magazines, I wondered what the film was. Anyway, there are movies, directors, stars that I want to see despite the critics. <br /> <br /> I can understand people who think that this film is boring and cold and that it has no passion, but I feel different. . It is true that I liked Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (it's a French film, I do not know what is its title in English or French). The basis of these films is the development of a love. <br /> <br /> I think Random Heart is an interesting and interesting film in its own way. <br /> <br /> It may be true that the sub-lots The election of the congress and the investigation of the police officer after a corrupt police officer are not well written, are not detailed, but add something to the main character. A man after the death of his wife and the emotion of betrayal, the anger of the Dutch surface work. He will be suspicious and will almost lose his best friend (the woman too). The film shows two ways to survive tragedy: the death and cheating of our wife / husband. One of them is the woman's: it's a tragedy, but life goes on. She does not want to cry forever. What she wants to know - what the lover of her husband - the policeman's wife - thought of her, she will never learn. She has to behave this way. The elections have come and everything about her husband can become a scandal. She wants her daughter not to be disappointed by her father. This man is a cop. He suffers from living in lies. He wants to know - maybe all men would want to know in this situation - when his wife started to cheat him. How long had she had love? He needs the help of the woman but she does not want to, but the guy is stubborn and stable / persistent. The woman can not bear because she always enters her life and she can not forget. At first, their relationship is tense, then slowly develops a kind of silent sympathy that consists of preferring an alliance against the outside world, tragedy. (I said it despite the fact that they made love to bed) However, the cop, can not stop investigating, can not stop and does not allow the woman to get close from him, but he begins the "love", and the woman wants their relationship to continue. But it can not. The woman realizes it. The end is a little sad, but logical and enjoyable at the same time. <br /> <br /> It was nice for me to see Peter Coyote again - I love that man's face - Sidney Pollack. I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt but she was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford did a good job. Her ear drop is unusual, but at first I finally thought that the woman liked being with her despite her temperament. It was a shame he did not have a joke. But Ford has a sense of humor. One critic noted (in Hungary): "Ford is charismatic about his haircut and his ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and we would like him to smile at us and make an ironic opinion." But Dr. Jones did not smiles not ".. But he smiles in the end and it's so good. I agree with the rest. I like it a lot in this role. He is good at this role a little rough, cool but somewhere in his smart cop. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a determined woman, confident, but closed inside. an ivory tower and she stands aloof from her emotions. But it's really a woman who becomes indecisive and finds support from the police. The two cool and reserved people meet. <br /> <br /> Maybe the scenario is not good. It's a banal and common phrase, but there are humorous phrases from the woman and the movements especially from the man. It's a good movie but not for everyone, not for the general public in general. I watched women under 18 and men over 45 preferred this film. About the latter, maybe Sidney Pollack made this movie for his age group that does not go to the multiplex. Anyway, I advise people who like energetic intrigues with action scenes, who only enjoy Ford's action movies.
