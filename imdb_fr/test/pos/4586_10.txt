This film is BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> I do not remember this film, even being in the movie theaters, so I thought it was a movie "on DVD" and I was expecting a lot of things, even though I am a big fan of Mike Judge. He has some sorts of the same kind of future comic satire as "Brazil" and "Man of Demolition", but taken to the next level. <br /> <br /> Then, I saw the casting; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who were all brilliant in their roles. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, this film convinced me in the first five minutes, showing above-average people with fewer children and the poorest, the most stupid, the stupid ones, having a lot of ignorant children, and how that leads to some kind of reverse evolution. It takes this concept and then shows where we are going with this pollution of the gene pool. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I do not think it will take 500 years as described, but probably only about 50. I already see the shocking rise of "moderate delay" in the population, the media and culture in general . People who love classical music and art are ridiculed instead of being respected. The lowest common denominator seems to prevail, especially in Hollywood and on TV (for example, "Jackass the Movie" and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate you for money). <br /> <br /> The political / social satire aside, this film is also just fun! And I do not say that lightly; In fact, few movies make me say "LOL", but this one did it. <br /> <br /> Many of the best jokes are gags of words and views in the background. So you have to be very careful to get some. I even had to pause and zoom in on some of them (like when Joe got his government ID card and for "hair" he said "yes" and for "eyes" he also said "yes"). In addition, the prison has engraved on the front "House for Individuals", because the cops of the film (much like the real cops) call everyone "individuals" instead of people, etc. Again, this has been displayed on the screen for a moment. moment ... it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again and dissect it to get you through the fun layers. <br /> <br /> In addition, I normally watch movies with captions turned on, and this indicated to me For example, the police constantly talk about people who "escape" instead of "escape" And there are many other pronunciation errors that only make me creak. But again, I might not have realized this simply by the dialogue mixed with music / sound effects; it's very subtle but always hilarious. <br /> <br /> Plus, the special effects were REALLY GOOD for a science fiction / social satire. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but all in all I think it's one of those movies that if you do not think it's funny, it's probably making fun of YOU ! I plan to recommend it to many, many people!
