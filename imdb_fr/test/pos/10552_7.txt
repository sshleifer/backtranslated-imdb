This is another case of Hollywood Arrogance presuming to eclipse the French style. The original, My Father, this hero, was one of the most charming films of 1991. Hollywood accountants thought they could engage Depardieu and call the rest. However, they took the precaution of using Francis Veber to write a text in English. version although practically every word of the original is used. Depardieu brings his Gaulish charm and Katherine Heigl shows all the promise that bears fruit. The fact is that when the French make a kind of Lolita-lite, they do not get along well because the idea of ​​a dirty French postcard is favorable to them; Here, the Hollywood idea of ​​subtle lightness is to have Depardieu (totally unaware that his daughter has made it known that he is actually her lover), who was right to play and sing "something French", in an animated version of Thank Heaven For Little Girls. See the original.
