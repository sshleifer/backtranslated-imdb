Fred Carpenter has shown Eddie Monroe at Boston College and, judging by his enthusiasm, he has something to be happy about. An Indy taught and well done, impressive in appearance and budget. This film has it all: a tight scenario that grabs you and does not let you go to its surprise end. This spectator did not see it coming! Excellent performance all around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were particularly well placed in the pack, offering solid performances. And congratulations to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives as attractive and interesting to watch as any movie. I really enjoyed this movie. This confirms my belief that some of the best cinema work will come from freelancers, and Fred Carpenter seems to be one of the best.
