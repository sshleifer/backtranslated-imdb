"Porgy & Bess" is the first film my parents took me to see. Even at the age of 5, I was so moved by the drama that I screamed on the screen: "Crown, please, do not take Bess! I was lucky enough to watch Porgy & Bess's only TV show so many years ago and now I only have good memories (and record album) to remember this magnificent film. I was waiting and hoping that someday I might own a copy of "Porgy & Bess" - but that does not seem to be happening. What's the problem? Clearly, the public arouses sufficient public interest to justify its exit. After all these years, I remember it and it seems that I'm not alone. This film is full of human emotion - jealousy, lust, anger, courage, determination. "Porgy & Bess" is a buried jewel that deserves to be highlighted by a new audience to admire and a former audience to enjoy.
