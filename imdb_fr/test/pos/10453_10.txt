Spoilers in this review! Despite some very unlikely scenes, including physical education boys who measure their penis during a contest and the few mandatory teen vignettes trying to be posed, this film captures the painful essence of high school in an unprecedented way . completed. He does this not only by showing the trio of friends, Gary, Dave, Rick, who smoke, drinking, teenagers on the lookout, but also insisting on the very nature of friendship, which puts test their loyalty. This film is a snapshot of the end of childhood. For the timid Gary shy, when he sees the beautiful Karen for the first time, he instantly falls in love. The emotion of awakening in Gary is written on the screen, and he shows his love for her by taking her when she is put in prison by her lover. This love for Karen marks the end of Gary's innocence, as ties with his two best friends will be put to the test and broken in the course of history. The confident lady, Rick, is the high school person we all secretly want to be: handsome, cool, and still have incredibly beautiful girls in a swoon. Rick turns out to be a guy, but do not forget that his character is only 17 years old. He panics and makes a bad decision. From Rick's point of view, the story also speaks of looking for the girl of his dreams, a bad break, and then reconciliation at the end. The look on Rick's face as Gary enters and sees Karen kissing him, shows that he finally understands that his best friend and he love the same woman. As in real life, you do not retire because your friend has an unrequited love. This is the tragedy of the film. Rick is not a bad guy and through the movie, he constantly reminds Gary and Dave that they are his best friends. The quality of the soul of Gary's performance, however, is at the heart of the story. Lawrence Monoson is a beautiful loser. He does everything right, his heart is in the right place and his love for Karen devours him. Still, Karen is not moved by Gary's dedication and kindness. Karen represents all the people in the world who accept without giving back, who exist in the void of their own ego and who never stop to realize the emotional damage and trauma they inflict on others. This film is brutal in its statements about love and friendship, but it's what makes it unique among teen movies. It ceases to be a comedy and becomes a desperately romantic film, though condemned to a tragic conclusion. Whoever has already found the girl of his dreams and has not won it will understand. The heartbreaking nightmares of high school are as real as the emotional tensions of adulthood, and this film will remind you of it in a bold way. Gary's latest reversal, as he walks away with the inscribed medallion, is as poignant as the movie's moment. After watching this, we feel that it's really made of two films. The first part is an idiot sexploitation film for teenagers and, once the story begins, the drama is very touching. A great movie. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in the selection of many rising stars, including The Police, Cars, Devo, Oingo Boingo, Plimsouls, Waitresses, Gleaming Spiers and Phil Seymour.
