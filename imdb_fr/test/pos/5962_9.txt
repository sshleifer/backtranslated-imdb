One of Starevich's first films shot in France is perhaps his only political satire. The story of The Frogs Who Wanted A King reflects its title, as a group of high-level "croakers" feel that democracy has collapsed and is asking a king of Jupiter to lead his country. When he sends a stump, the frogs ask for another king, saying that the stump is only "political wood". Jupiter sends a stork hungry this time, whose vigorous frog eyes devour the inhabitants of the city. While the original "croaker" is about to slip into the stork's beak, he says his moral: "leave yourself pretty quiet". This film presents some beautiful crowd scenes with dozens of puppet frogs. Starewicz lets spectators believe that they all move at the same time keeping the background constantly moving and animating only about six frogs at a time. The somewhat cheesy dialogue and lighting problems in some places diminish the quality of repeated viewing, but its historical significance in Starewicz's life makes it an important element to watch. His feelings towards the government immediately following his flight from Russia are probably expressed in this film. In addition, the technical achievements of animating so many characters at once in a stop-motion movie are astonishing.
