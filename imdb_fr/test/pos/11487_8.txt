It was sad that COMMITTED only lasted two weeks in Dallas theaters. I thought this movie had a lot to gain. The scenario was funny, full of subtle emotional changes and the message was good. The game was great. Everyone did a superb job, especially with the intricacies of the script. Heather Graham not only has beautiful eyes, she has expressive eyes. By the way, all the actors were attractive! I do not know why he did not work well in his theatrical release, except that the studio did not seem to have much pressure behind. But it deserved to do better, and I hope it's going well in video. This is definitely one of my favorites for the first half of 2000.
