This film did not stay fresh in the minds of moviegoers, and it is a shameful shame. His spiritual adaptation to the screenplay should have allowed the Oscar nominations of the great writer I.A.L. The adaptation of Diamond and the flawless performance of Ingrid Bergman. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn to work with Bergman at such a young age, with more than a decade less than his 54 years - fifty-four! When she is on the screen, it flickers positively. <br /> <br /> It's a film that may seem out of date at first, but it's actually what would make me regret not being there during the sixties. Hawn's fashion is as sticky as Bergman's. (This is a minor flaw - is not his character a little too neat for a girl who still lives with her sister, but again, would there be another way for Ingrid?) And who would not want hanging out A disco called The Slipped Disc? <br /> <br /> The best compliment I can make to this film is that it has made me nostalgic for a decade that I have never seen and wanted more. Speaking of wanting more, I wonder what has become sexy actor Rick Lenz? (He looks like Griffin Dunne in this movie.) It was his first film, and I see no other major role in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn, she has done so much since it's easy not to be impressed, but I can not imagine any other actor in the role. <br /> <br /> Since the film is based on a play, online delivery may seem a little complex, but it did not stop my pleasure at all. In fact, I'm amazed how funny it is after more than thirty-five years. Because this film represents a bygone era, it has unjustly escaped the consciousness of moviegoers. It is more related to the period films that preceded it than those that followed. But do not let this prevent you from savoring the delights he has to offer. Grade: A
