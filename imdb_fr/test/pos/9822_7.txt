I read about 10 reviews of this movie, but I did not take any "to heart". Harrison Ford is criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring, and I really do not see what these things have to do with the movie. If I remember correctly, he had bad hair and bad reviews in Blade Runner, but he's still a favorite among the videophiles. He is slower than most of his previous films but does not deserve the damage he has received. <br /> <br /> I would gladly pay $ 7.50 to watch a bald Harrison Ford mow his lawn.
