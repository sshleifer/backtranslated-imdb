This was Eisenstein's first project in over a decade. The film takes place in the 13th century during the invasion of Russia by the Germans (Teutonic Knights - I think). Published in 1938, it is a very vague parallel with the forthcoming involvement of Russia in the Second World War and the advancement of Germany in Eastern Europe. There are incredible scenes, including the battle near the end of the film, and there is a shock when children are thrown into a pit, but it's not an easy watch. The film hangs out and is not always as brilliant as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes, Eisenstein is better in the clips. His talent is however present and constitutes a "must" for fans of Eisenstein and film historians. Russian propaganda at its best.
