This film is a mix of black comedy and drama, about two guys who worked in a butcher shop and wanted to create their own movie. When they finally realized this dream, they faced a new problem: there were no customers! One day, by accident, a guy dies in the refrigerator room and a new kind of butchery business starts ?? They start selling human flesh, telling customers that it's just chicken? and their business is starting to improve: human flesh is selling well! Oh! I forgot to say something ?? These guys are not normal! There is really something missing in their brains! <br /> <br /> The film presents beautiful scenes of black humor, but it is, in my opinion, essentially a drama. The one who shows us what is in the head of a psychopath, what are his motivations. I must admit that I was a little surprised by the end of the film, because I did not expect it to be possible without it being discovered, but it's probably because I see too much Hollywood movies ?? What I mean by that is that in Hollywood cinema, we always expect the punishment of the guys who do the "bad things". There is always a morality that protects "good values", despite the fact that we all know that in the "real life", it does not happen too often ?? And this film pleased me especially because of that, because it is part of a kind of cinema that is true, frontal, without false morals and that "sees" what is on the other side, behind the " conventional morality "?? It happens in independent cinema (especially European)! <br /> <br /> In addition, Nikolaj Lie Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first) have excellent performances in the role of "disturbed types" ?? <br /> <br /> Very nice Danish movie!
