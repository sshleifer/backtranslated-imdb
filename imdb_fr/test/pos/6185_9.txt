Ernst Lubitsch has given us wonderful films such as Design for Living, Ninotchka, Shop Around the Corner, Being or Not Being, and other wonderful films. But people usually place Bluebeard's eighth wife among the weakest films in Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> But I consider this film as an important film. This film started the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder and Walter Reisch wrote Ernst Lubitsch's Ninotchka script. Of course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. After that, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. Together, they wrote the screenplay for famous movies such as The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd. <br /> <br /> The film contains many fun moments. I thought "Mastering the shrew" was a lot of fun. There is a famous phrase called "Movies are slices of life". And here is a fine example from Bluebeard's eighth wife (1938). <br /> <br /> In the first session of the scripting process, Lubitsch asked the question: how do the boy and the girl meet? Billy Wilder quickly suggested that the opening scene should be the men's department store. "The boy is trying to buy pajamas," he improvised with glory. "But he only sleeps in highs, he is economical, so he insists on buying only the tops, the employee says he must also buy the pants, it looks like a catastrophe, and then the girl goes into the store. and buy the pants because she only sleeps in the pants. "Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were delighted. It was not until several months later that they discovered that Billy Wilder himself only slept upstairs and that he had the idea to keep it for months until he could use it. <br /> <br /> I got this information from a book. I think this film can be considered as the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Just after this film, he made some great movies like Ninotchka, The Corner Shop, and Being or Not Being. <br /> <br /> I thought Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitsch appealed to Gary Cooper, probably because Gary Cooper played the role of Long Fellow Deeds who inherited Mr. Deeds' fortune from Frank Capra and goes to town. But this is only my opinion. <br /> <br /> For my part, I really enjoyed the film. I rate this film 9 out of 10. Lubitsch's films are different because his films are slices of life.
