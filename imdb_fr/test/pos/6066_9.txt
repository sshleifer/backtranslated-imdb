We have just watched the last of the series broadcast on the SBS network and we will miss our weekly dose of Danish Delight. My wife and I took over the series after the end of the Swedish series "The Eagle" and it seemed like a very bad substitute for our favorite television series. Week after week, however, the series grew and, although not as brilliant as the Swedish series and much more serious in its investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly meal. <br /> <br /> Before these two shows, I was not really a fan of the police genre and I can not say that I am now, but the two Scandinavian shows have really provided us with a glimpse of life in these northern European countries through their special eyes. police units.
