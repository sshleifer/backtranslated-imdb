Fortunately for Bill Murray, this is a project so light that he has to carry it out. Meatballs tells the story of Camp Northstar, where rents are low, and how his counselors treat campers with each other. There are also many of their wealthy rivals on the other side of the lake named Camp Mohawk that end with a two-day Olympiad competition. Bill Murray is first and foremost a memorable film debut. <br /> <br /> The film is dotted with medium-sized laughter, laughter and some gaffes along the way. The biggest laughs come from pranks on the nerdy camp director. Three of them imply that counselors move their bed outdoors to different places while they sleep. Morty, or "Micky" as everyone calls it, wakes up along the edge of a road, hanging in trees several feet above the ground, to finally float on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also fun moments when the counselors get hurt, but this is a PG-rated movie that is not a bit of a panic. <br /> <br /> The film takes serious note of the role of a shy camper named Rudy. is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course, it's up to Murray to teach the child to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympics. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation seems to have been strongly reinforced. Notice how, when Murray saw the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus, he told him, "You must be the depressed little kid we ordered." You wonder if this line was really in the script or if Murray was just in redirect mode while the cameras were running. In other words, Murray might just as well have said to Makepeace: "You must be that actor we hired to play the stereotype of the lonely kid that you see in most summer camp movies and that does not fit not." But before it's all over, Murray's performance makes this conspiracy machine more bearable. He really seems to have good chemistry with Makepeace. <br /> <br /> The film ends with the games between the two rival camps. Very few of the events presented to us are even slightly credible, but "it does not matter". It's a very good movie on many levels. Do not let the absurd 5.6 notes that this movie is frightening you. Murray will make you laugh all the way. Just be warned ..... avoid the suites !!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman !! 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hunting dog.
