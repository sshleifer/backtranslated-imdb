I just saw "A tale of two sisters" last night and I really enjoyed it. I am a big fan of Asian horror movies recently and think it's a strong entry to South Korea. As in the usual American horror movie, there is not much that scares you, but the director maintains very well the offbeat and scary atmosphere, especially in clumsy character interactions with each other. Most scares are more conceptual and play on everyone's fears "there is something under the bed" of their childhood, but in this case it is the closet and the sink. I also liked the director's ability to grasp how dysfunctional this household is through scenes such as the first dinner the characters have together. He is also good at revealing the inner life and fragility of people through simple scenes such as the mother-in-law who wipes makeup in the mirror or sits in front of the flickering TV. I think this film is primarily an exploration of guilt and the consequences of living with that guilt on you. <br /> <br /> THE GREAT SPOILERS OF THE FUTURE (DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE WITNESSES TO BE REVERTED) I followed the story pretty well, but I started to lose when I dragged the bag. However, I think that the flashback in the end definitely bound everything. The film is very similar to "The Machinist" in that two of the character's culpabilities eventually lead to fits of mental confusion and delusions. <br /> <br /> Here is my interpretation of the film. The Su-Yeon we see after the girls' supposed return to the house is either Su-Mi's illusion or the Su-Yeon's ghost that only Su-Mi can see and interact with. The initial stepmother we see is, in my opinion, an illusion of Su-Mi. There is however a real mother-in-law and she appears for the first time in the film when she wears the gray pantsuit. I think that's the real mother-in-law to whom the father talks on the phone throughout the first part of the film and she does not appear until he picks her up and takes her to the House. Su-Mi imagined the mother-in-law before that (perhaps part of her dual personality?) This explains the weird sequence of a dinner where the mother-in-law's brother looks at her like she's crazy and does not remember nothing of what she says. I think it was Su-Mi who played the role of her stepmother in her double personality. The film shows him later in the scene dragging scenes such as the stepmother wiping her makeup in the mirror, later revealed to be Su-Mi wiping her makeup in the mirror. <br /> <br /> I think that the ghosts of the house are not entirely imagined by Su-Mi, and are either of Su-Yeon, or of the mother, or both. In the final flashback, it is revealed that the Su-Yeon wore the green dress and had the hairpin in her hair when she died. This is the green dress they showed before on the ghost sitting at the dining room table while the mother-in-law was looking under the sink. In addition, it is the hairpin that Su-Yeon wore in the flashback that appears on the floor when the mother-in-law looks under the sink. <br /> <br /> The real mother-in-law, at the end, is punished by the ghost of Su-Yeon who comes in a scene a lot like The Ring. After that, the flashback scene links everything together regarding the fact that the mother-in-law was primarily responsible for her death, while Su-Mi involuntarily played a supporting role. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the "mother" who Su-Yeon sees when she goes up to her room to cry, in the flashback, it's already a ghost. Maybe at that moment, the mother had already killed herself in the closet. This remains ambiguous. <br /> <br /> Another thing suggested, but not clearly explained in the film, is that it seems that the mother-in-law, at one point, was a nurse, caring can -being of the mother and contributed to her death too. It is unclear when his relationship with the father began and if it caused the death of the mother. It is also suggested that the mother also has mental problems, requiring a nurse. The mother-in-law alludes to this when she tells Su-Mi that you are starting to pick on your mother. I do not think she meant only physically. <br /> <br /> In addition, if we accept that the initial mother-in-law we see is in fact Su-Mi, there is also a suggestion of incest, since the father sleeps with her. . Is this why Su-Mi panics and shouts, "Do not touch me" every time the father looks for her in a later scene? Are these the "dirty things you've done" that she refers to in a later conversation with the father? This film is interesting because of its ability to interpret different things. Some scenes, however, were a kind of derivative, like the woman in the creepy black scene, which reminded me of Kayako's devious movements in the Ju-On / The Grudge movies. In addition, the final scene where the mother-in-law finally gets her desserts evokes The Ring. In addition, the idea that some characters may be ghosts is taken from "The Sixth Sense" or "The Others". <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked it, however, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (already in production) turns out. I have to be honest, I liked both "The Ring" and "The Grudge", so I'm not one of those pretentious guys who insist that re-doing can not be good too. A remake that really fascinates me is "Dark Water" coming out this summer. I have not seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my list.
