The red dust is both well played and well done, but I think the subject of the film will annoy many viewers as it did for me. There was a movie that was released earlier called "in my country" with Sam Jackson and it was not very well received and the two films were about the same, I think Red dust was better because of performances more interesting, especially The future winner of the Oscars, Chiwton Ejofor, but the plot is missing, it's pretty strong at first, but then the film strikes the audience with countless uninteresting sessions, it could have been a good movie if the writing had not missed. But see if for the performances.
