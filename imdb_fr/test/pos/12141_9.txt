Classe Tous Risques is a French gangster movie that does not seek style. That's why he has style. Because the film is so underrated and so factual, it becomes more and more engaging. And because Abel Davos is portrayed by Lino Ventura, we find ourselves emotionally in this taciturn killer who loves his wife and children, at a meeting with customs agents on the coast near Nice at night that neither he nor we wait, and who is just as willing to shoot a cop or a traitor with as little emotion as to remove a little stuffed animal. We meet for the first time Davos in Italy with his wife and their two little boys, one about 9 years old and the other 4 years old. <br /> <br /> "This man was Abel Davos, sentenced to death in absentia", we were told. "Fleeing for years, he had seen his resources run out, even if his anxiety kept him moving.With the Italian police approaching every day, France was again his best bet. he was forgotten. " <br /> <br /> Davos was a high-ranking gangster in Paris who took care of his friends. It was several years ago. A robbery to give him money to return to France is very bad Now he is hiding with his two children. He calls his friends in Paris to help him. He and his children had to travel from Nice to Paris, but the police pursued him and set up roadblocks. For the two best friends in Davos, the time has passed and they have moved on. They do not want to put themselves in danger, and for what? The obligation gives may to caution. They therefore hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to take Davos and the children in an ambulance, then travel to Paris with heavily bandaged Davos and the hidden children. We are on a journey where the Davos options are increasingly limited, where he has to find a way to take care of his children, where he realizes that there is no longer any friendship, where a betrayal seems likely and where perhaps he would stay his only friend is Eric Stark. <br /> <br /> This somewhat cynical film works so well because it does its job without worrying too much. There is no trench coat with high collars, nor playing with the gangster code melodrama that so many French directors have loved. All Risk Class gives us Abel Davos, a man who was once someone, who now slips to be no one and who reacts with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura dominates the film, but when he is associated with Jean-Paul Belmondo, a curious chemistry occurs. Ventura as Davos is sinister and anxious to take care of his sons. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a hard man who sees the murder of someone as needed as part of his business. Belmondo, the young thief who is initially sent to be an expendable driver and ends up being a friend on whom to count prevents the film from being just one more trick in the elevator. Belmondo was 27 years old and looks younger. His unlikely star power as a main actor - broken nose, under-reach jaw - shines on the screen. He matches Erik to Ventura when they share a scene. And the scenes of Belmondo with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes his girlfriend, radiate charm and sexual seduction. The end is a bittersweet destiny, and without stylistic posture in sight. We hear Davos say, "Abel is gone, there is nothing left." It would be nice to look at All Risk Class to find out what it means. <br /> <br /> There are many French gangster movies. I would place this one right there with Touch No Grisbi and Bob the Flambeur. To see one of Lino Ventura's best performances, watch Army of Shadows.
