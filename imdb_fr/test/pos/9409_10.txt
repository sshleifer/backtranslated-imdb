I had heard about the case, but I had not really paid attention to Fuhrman's whirlwind, who wrote the book, Skakel's arrest, and so on. The involvement of Mark Fuhrman and the results of his investigation. I particularly enjoyed the flashback scenes with Martha talking about her last summer. The actress who played her literally lit up her life and made her even more poignant than the real Martha was probably like that. It gave the impression that Martha was a real person rather than a victim. I would definitely recommend looking at this.
