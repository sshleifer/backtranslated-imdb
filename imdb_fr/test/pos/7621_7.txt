I do not know if these people saw the movie - some people apparently could not follow the "complicated plot". It's a billionaire who owns an oil company that also aims to hunt big game - wow - it's really ridiculous. Anyway, his new "drilling machine" crosses a glacier and, on the other hand, a separate world of our time where dinosaurs and cavemen are walking. Nothing innovative about it, but it's certainly not ridiculous. Anyway, the rest of the movie is about this T-Rex they discover (what the billionaire Boone claimed to be there) chasing them and chasing them. Look - it's an old TV movie - of course, the special effects look corny - they did not have CGs - they did their best and for a MFTVM, they did a hell of a job to the time. This film should be redone for the big screen - I'd love it and I'll be the first one online. Seeing this dinosaur with modern special effects stalking these guys would be great!
