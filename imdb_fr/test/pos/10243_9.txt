The story of La Laiti√®re is simple, without love and, despite the decades, it remains strong. Now 50, Minako Obha (Yuko Tanaka) lives alone and has two jobs ?? one as a cashier in a supermarket, the other in milk, making her daily tour of the Nagasaki hills. One of his stops is at Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a government official who takes care of his wife Yoko (Akiko Nishina), who is terminally ill. Minako and Kaita saw themselves as schoolboys, but after the death of Minako's mother and Kaita's father, who seems to have had an affair together, their own relationship was destroyed. Yoko, lying in her bed of illness, however, knows that her husband's feelings for the milkmaid are not completely gone and, in Kaita's interest after her death, she tries to find a way to bring them closer. <br /> Although the story may be simple, the emotions it deals with and the means by which it expresses them are really the heart and beauty of the film. The film takes its time to show the simple daily routines of each of the characters, their actions being recorded by an old lady who writes their story for a book while taking care of her own husband who shows signs of dementia. In this process, he describes the social conditions of people of different lifestyles, their daily interactions, the formation of relationships, and the interactions between past and present. The director looks after it beautifully with a strong visual structure and style. It is only later in the film that the story begins to follow a more conventional and inevitably melodramatic path, as if it were being constructed to match the narrative structure of the book being written. All this is validated by the emotional depths that the film touches, represented more effectively in Yuko Tanaka's outstanding performance.
