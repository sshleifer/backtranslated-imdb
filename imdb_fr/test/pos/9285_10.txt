This program is definitely my favorite non-sitcom television comedy. Australia produces very few good programs - most TV channels I watch (and I live in Australia) come from the United States and England. <br /> <br /> The funny part of this show is how controversial it is. Like when they crossed many security barriers at the APEC summit posing as Canadian diplomats. <br /> <br /> The show is composed of pre-filmed cascades, general satirical discussions on current world events and sometimes on stage. skits. All these elements come together to form a fabulous and extremely entertaining TV show. Segments such as "Ad Road-test" and "Message from Osama Bin Ladin" are hilarious. If you are interested in a hilarious and satirical television comedy, this is the show you should watch. <br /> <br /> All the guys are great and do a great job of entertaining you for half an hour. <br /> <br /> I would evaluate it 10/10.
