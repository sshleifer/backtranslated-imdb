It's really worth it to rent! Good entertainment with your own family. My 4 and 5 year olds (and I) loved it. The kept on the edge of their seats. I recommend that parents sit with their youngest children to watch this, as this can be quite suspensive for them. It is rare for you to find movies that you can watch with your children. It is therefore a rare discovery. Part of the game / realism is sometimes not quite there, or maybe it's a little old-fashioned, but children do not seem to notice or care, they love it. The games are predictable, but not at all - like trying to figure out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. The film does not have really scary content, so I doubt it will give kids a nightmare. It encourages children to dream, which we need to encourage and foster more in our children. Praise and be blessed!
