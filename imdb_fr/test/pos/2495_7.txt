It is along the comedy of the errors, of the erroneous affections which are transmitted from one to the other, flowers are transmitted and transmitted - like situations of cat and mouse ?? Flares, sparks of fire fanned and extinguished - guessing maybe she likes, likes or likes ?? Circle of emotions, evolving, relaxing, hiding, but not hiding, wanting to let him know, wanting to let him know, tell them: Good together, despite the seemingly confusing mixture of emotions from different parties involved. <br /> <br /> It's a refreshing, laid-back, free, easy and down-to-earth charmer - not glamorous Hollywood like "Notting Hill", but full of human feelings, fragility, vulnerabilities. Yes, everything revolves around a love letter found accidentally (lost). Kate Capshaw as owner of the city's bookstore, with a variety of characters portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stuart, Alice Drummond and Geraldine McEwan as Mrs. Scattergoods seemingly unaffected. Romance is in the air, love is omnipresent. You like the talented Kate Capshaw. ("The Alarmist" is another weird and funny little movie to watch: Capshaw has a wonderful chemistry with David Arquette and Arquette with Stanley Tucci.) <br /> <br /> "Notting Hill" is satisfying in his story that turns around the glittering couple of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, and the wonderful support of his circle of friends (from London). "Love Letters" delights with her quirky little town (Loblolly) and her story about Kate Capshaw's centrifugal spin effects on her friends and neighbors. The two fantasies, maybe somehow, the latter felt more feasible if it were to happen to you. And if you like words or poetic lines, this could be the movie for you.
