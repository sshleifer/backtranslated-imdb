Once again, John Madden gave us a wonderful movie. A simple but beautiful story set in true paradise and where the music can not be better, Stephen Warbeck enchants us once again, and good passages but ...... why the hell is Penelope Cruz in this movie? I asked myself the same question while watching this movie. Of course, her Greek accent is not credible, she is unable to play decently, even in a scene. Not even in the end, she did a good job, after so many events, after years, she finally could see Corelli again and she could not change the same face of stupidity that we had to endure throughout the movie. Anyway, Cage was very good at one of his best characters. Hurt is also great in his film and the rest of the cast did a great job. The end result is therefore a film that is really worth watching. It's a beautiful film that even Mrs. Cruz could not spoil. So far, I think it's Madden's best work, so no fan will be disappointed.
