Tomorrow is another day, it's NOT the sequel to Gone with the Wind, but a love-on-the-lam story, and surprisingly alert and moving. For an alleged hack relegated to B-minus as The Devil Thumbs A Ride, Felix Feist is a follower of filling his work with unexpected and inventive details. Steve Cochran leaves the prison after 18 years in prison for killing his brutal father when he was only 13 years old. Today, he is still shy and has puberty. It operates inside the fleshy frame of a man. Alone, he goes to a palace at 10 cents a dance and cracks for the brass and buffs of Ruth Roman. But the gunfire suffered by his police and police boyfriend forces the bad twin couple to hit the road and ends, like the Joads, in a camp of migrant workers in California. <br /> <br /> The revelation of Roman; in her best-known role, as Farley Granger's fianc√©e in Strangers on Hitchcock Train, she was sick and underused. Here, she adapts convincingly, from the blonde taxi dancer to the sacrifice of his wife and his future mother (and a brunette, in addition). Cochran is almost as good, oscillating between the suspicion of an injured child and the explosive reactions of an under-socialized man. And the end, though unconvincing, is nevertheless welcome. With Tom's Live By Night and Gun Crazy, Tomorrow Is Another Day has a redemptive sweetness and warmth that belies his film noir pedigree.
