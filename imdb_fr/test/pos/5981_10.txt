This is one of the very few films so overwhelming that it is very unlikely that you will watch it more than once or twice in your life (Claude Lanzmann's documentary Shoah and Come and See, directed by the husband of the director, Elem Klimov - who covers about the same unbearable territory but in a very different way). <br /> <br /> I guess it's as good considering the difficulty of ever seeing a footprint. <br /> <br /> Apparently, it's extraordinarily open. Christian symbolism and having recognized the presence of active Russian collaborators ensured that it was almost never seen in the USSR - and of course, post-Soviet Russia has very little interest in that time. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw it in London in a festival of Russian films released at the time of Glasnost (probably around 1988). However, apparently, it has been broadcast several times in the UK more recently, so at least one subtitled impression must exist here. <BR/> <br /> As far as I know, it was never released in If you have not seen it yet, your best chance is probably to join a movie company and harass it endlessly to find a copy and project it.
