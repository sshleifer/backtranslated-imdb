A film that is brilliant and sensitive to interwoven intrigues. As a general warning, the movie gets pretty dark about halfway through. As sudden as it is, it's a change that I found adapted to the themes of the film, especially the comparison between Ishkanani and the filthy rich, and (as Finn puts it at the end) how each person constitutes the tribe. and how each member of the tribe is reflected in each person. <br /> <br /> Anton Yelchin (Finn Earl) is spectacular in this movie. He's probably better known as Star Trek's Chekov or Kyle Reese in Terminator Salvation, but he's been involved in a plethora of movies you've probably never heard of (Alpha Dog, which is another brilliant performance of Yelchin's share, House of D, Hearts in Atlantis, to name a few ...) The fact is that this kid really takes this movie and makes it his own. Other excellent performances by Diane Lane and Donald Sutherland are what pushed this film to a higher level, from excellent to excellent.
