Viva Variety was a unique hybrid program that was both a travesty and a tribute to the programs it represented. <br /> <br /> It was very much a model of the 1970s classic, "The Sonny & Cher Show", with Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney playing in a couple of two divorced artists who have somehow been forced to organize this program together. , the wife of the couple dominating the man, and the constant barrage of "insult humor" that the couple embarked on, plus humorous sketches and performances of what is very nicely described as acts of "specialty"! <br /> <br /> The hybrid was a mix of facts and fantasies. Of course, there was no "Mr. and Mrs. Laupin", and the program's announcer, Johnny Bluejeans, was just as fictional. But all the acts performed were certainly real, and some were even entertaining! But there were also acts that would have clearly been better suited to Chuck Barris' old "Gong Show". <br /> <br /> The show itself looked more like a prolonged sketch of "SCTV" (it's from the MTV series, "The State", after all), and some would say it would have been better as a five-minute piece in the composition of a program like this, rather than as a series apart. But "Viva Variety" should certainly be high on its original concepts, and even though it was often weirder than funny, it was certainly worth it, especially when they made a trip to Las Vegas and have presented even more lavish acts. It is unlikely that we will ever see this again on television.
