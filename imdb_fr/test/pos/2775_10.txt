Susie Q is an original and does not look like another bad Disney movie, *** spoiler ***, a boy named Zach is moving to a new city and has problems at school. He is good at basketball. a girl in the 1950s died with her boyfriend when their car was crushed on a bridge. Susie (Amy Jo Johnson) ranks of power - the pink wardrobe - helps Zach as a ghost to get a necklace along the way. and then she gets into her boyfriend's ghost car and they float. later, when she misses him, he finds a girl who looks like him. (Do you believe in reincarnation?) Susie Q is a good movie to see from time to time but they hardly give because Disney needs to fill everything with stupid movies and shows that I give it <br /> 7 / 10
