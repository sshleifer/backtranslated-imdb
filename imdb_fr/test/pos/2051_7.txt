Let me start by saying that overall, I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight. I would give him a 7/10. The Good: 1. Acting: Samuel L Jackson is entertaining in almost every role. In this movie, he does not play his usual character, the guy who is in control, but Geena Davis is in control and Sam is in the game. His timing is perfect and he is the highlight of the film. Geena Davis also gives an excellent performance as Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore. She is a credible heroine in action and I do not think many actresses can take advantage of Geena Does's performance. 2. Action: It's a very action packed movie. Things are almost always crashing or exploding or someone is chasing someone else. The special effects are pretty good, especially when you're almost 8 years old. I can see pictures on a green screen, but that does not hurt much the acting game. <br /> <br /> The bad: 1. Why did it take half of the film to set up the plot? This movie needed to be edited at the script stage so it will not be released for as long. Maybe a drama or something can last that long, but people have to stay in the movie all the time to support it. I think if you manage to mark the start of the first half you will be totally eliminated from the second half. 2. Geena Davis is a cold weather and a tank top but she never seems to be cold. 3. Some things are unrealistic. Sam Jackson flies through a giant sign after being thrown out of a room, then lands in a tree and gets up. When you see this part, you will think it's a gag. fun movie in general 7/10
