"The man who knew too much" falls in the middle of Hitchcock who characterized many of his films in the 1950s: not a masterpiece of suspense at all costs, but a lot of fun anyway. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day play a couple on vacation who is caught in a heavy plot of foreign intrigues. The famous culinary scene takes place at a classical music concert, where someone will be murdered during a cymbal clash in the score. The mischievous Hitchcock allows us of course to know what it is, so that the race to stop the killer becomes a fierce race against the cymbalist. <br /> <br /> So much of this film reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase / Goldie Hawn Comedy "Foul Play" which, I believe, inspired this film. No movie is a big problem, but both are easy to appreciate. <br /> <br /> Category: B +
