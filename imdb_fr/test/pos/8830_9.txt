I first heard about it for the first time in 2005, first online, and then watching (and of course buying) the great, typical BBC book. Then I got the DVD; it did not disappoint! I had been hoping for years that someone would create a sci-fi program focusing on the thrill of discovery rather than on extraterrestrials, laser pistol fights and other Hollywood boogieman stuff! Thanks, Joe Ahearne (also for your work as Dr. Who, and Ultraviolet - the mini-series, not the crap movie of the same name)! What forced me to write this now (2 years later) is that I had just seen SUNSHINE last night. And what seemed to be in the same family as SPACE ODYSSEY turned into (about 2/3 of the entrance) Freddy Krueger meets 2010! It was then that SPACE ODYSSEY stood out as a positive example of the making of a science fiction film REAL; more science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (like SUNSHINE) also dealt with astronauts' shortcomings (EVA, Zoe's failure, Ivan's overwork on Venus, mission-controlled gaiters) and the very danger of exploring new planets with unknown dangers (the deadly radiation). on Mars). I would have easily paid to see this in a theater (I-Max, anyone?). And to top it off, not only was the view of the space beautiful, but the characters were also well drawn. I found their interaction more realistic than the histrionics of Sunshin's Icarus 2 crew (Icarus, stupid name for a solar mission - did anyone read the Icarus mythology?). Sometimes you need a film that is not very good to force you to watch a better movie again. As an armchair astronaut, I would be trading on Icare for a seat on Pegasus every day. In all honesty, however, the visual effects of SUNSHINE are quite amazing and memorable. That's why I insisted so much that he succeed as an honest sci-fi movie. So, even though this review is almost a Sunshin review behind the scenes, I hope it will be read for what it was supposed to be; strong support for a successful BBC TV movie where most big-budget and inflated film shows fail. ODYSSEY OF SPACE (TRAVEL ON PLANETS, here in the US) fuels the appetite for a strong SCIENCE fiction and gives a banquet. I also enjoyed the pseudo-documentary approach. As for the problems of time shift / speed of light, they are addressed, if you pay attention. Where SUNSHINE melts, ODYSSEY keeps calm. If you are thinking of going to the movies for another dose of SUNSHINE, stay indoors; Rather, opt for a real ODYSSEY OF SPACE!
