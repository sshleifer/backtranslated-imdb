Again, I read all the comments posted here and agree with the many smart people, but totally disagree with those who think it's / is hokum. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think nuclear power is pretty much the only energy left to us, unless our governments (federal and state) increase subsidies thinking that homeowners will use photocells on their roofs. Many attractive and expensive homes in Southern California are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy available, the sun. I live in a loft that is exposed all day to the sun on its roof. I hardly use air conditioning - I'm sure it consumes too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees less. We are lucky to have a "dry" heat in this part of the country. I come from the American Gulf Coast, so I know the humidity well ....... <br /> <br /> That said, I found that "the China syndrome" was a convincing film on what could go wrong, if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear power plants. I think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear him like the plague: they ARE safe. TMI is still online .... <br /> <br /> Director James Bridges carefully guides this scenario (directed by Mike Gray-T S Cook) to create a suspense and produce an interesting film. All roles have been well interpreted: Jane Fonda ("Kimberly Wells"), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell ") and producer Michael Douglas (" Richard Adams ") are all excellent in their roles, as well as all the rest of the cast I, too, liked having no score, it was so interesting to have a realistic glimpse behind the scenes of the television industry - that should not be surprising.Currently, Dan Rather sues CBS, and I hope he wins.Can you believe that Donald Trump says "he's a loser" Trump - whatever, "Tiberius1234" posted a great comment here - I agree, I'm agree that "spraying" with a spilling nuclear reactor is much better than living in a world that has been lost, and becoming "Blade Runner" and / or "Solyent Green." Stay away from your video games for few hours and watch this movie "dated" (really 't), and get some education on nuclear energy.I recommend it to the whole family ....
