My family really enjoyed this movie. Regarding what this film will do for Rugby in the United States ... well, I'm sure it will be debatable. But as for me and the others around me, I know we were more curious about the sport after watching the film and I personally gained a greater respect for the sport. You may wonder how this is possible, especially since the film does not explain rugby. But the fact is that it attracted you to the players and the emotion of the game and life. The film was both inspiring and entertaining. It made us laugh and cry. The chemistry between Sean Astin, Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well. Some people may think the film is a little cliché, but I sincerely hope that Hollywood makes more films like this one. I could not help but make analogies with the game and the difficulties of life. In the end, I found myself examining my own life to see what I needed to do best, in order to be the best person possible. Honestly, I am grateful to this film for teaching morals, values ​​and teamwork. After watching this, I really hope my kids are coached by someone who has a philosophy like Coach Gelwix.
