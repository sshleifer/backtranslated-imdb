In fact, I thought that Black Snake Moan was an excellent film that takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife strips him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten on the side of the road. Lazare discovers that Rae is a sex addict and that he was abused as a child so he decides to take things in hand by tying Rae with a chain to heal her of his wickedness. Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci have excellent chemistry together and their performances make you believe that Lazarus and Rae become best friends through their struggles and redemption. I was also surprised by Sam's ability to play the electric guitar and sing. S Epatha Merrkensen is great for Angela, her love interest, Justin Timberlake plays Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie, who is underused in the film but does his best to give him a great performance.
