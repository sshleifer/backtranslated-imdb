As an astonishing and thoughtful observation of modern youth life in Japan, Like Grains of Sand explores in subtle and meaningful ways such issues as rape, homosexuality and puberty. This gives an idea of ​​the culture of young people who are struggling to define themselves outside of their parent's generation, with its strict conformity and facade. What is typical of Japanese cinema, what is not said is often more important than what is, therefore, to those who do not know the film and the Japanese culture, beware. If you do not know what to look for, it may sound dull and minimalist (just like all the movies in Japan bar Mangas Bars). I saw him for the first time at the age of 15 and that's what initially sparked my interest in Japan, its culture and its language. Considering that I am now 22 years old and that I am learning Japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years, needless to say, it is a powerful film. Enjoy!
