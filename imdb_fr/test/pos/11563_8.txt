A little strange and little known western with amazing colors (probably the same material used in "Johnny Guitar", I imagine "Trucolor" or something that gives the impression that blood drops look like bright rubies), almost surreal scenes with twisted action and characters. Something different, far from being a masterpiece, but more attention should be paid to this little gem of Western encyclopedias.
