I would say that "Bride of Chucky" is a "return to greatness" but the series has never been really great. Very good # 1 was, No. 2-3 was disposable, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle / slogan: "Chucky Gets Lucky". He does so in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who has completely rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for "Star Trek: Voyager". Tilly did not just create a presence; she added much needed humor, story, drama, tension and a great sidekick / game for Chucky. And although I liked it in the feature film, it does not have all the merit: props (look at the first 1-2 minutes for tributes), writing, inner jokes (still opening + Pinhead ) and Chucky's lines were awesome ("In fact, if (this) was a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels to make it fair", among others.) Fortunately, Chucky and the series has abandoned Andy the "Hide" the soul "and has just moved in for a new way out of his body.He teams up with his ex (Tilly) whom he transfers into a doll" Bride "and a teenage couple from Bonnie & Clyde ( Really, Heigl?) To find this buried pendant with the human corpse of Chucky.This is for all Chucky fans, fans of the 1980s or even those who have never seen any of the previous films of "Child's Play. "It's funny, dark, harmless, bloody, but not above and despite Tilly's literary 20 minutes, it's always a pleasure to see her. After all, you hardly see her playing poker. (Side note: of course, I picked up on the reference Superman ?? Hackensack, NJ.)
