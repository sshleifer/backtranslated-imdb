This film by the famous Czech director and collaborator, Petr Jarchovský, is remarkable for its peculiarities, but boring and distracting in its details. Drawing on his theme and title from a poem by Robert Graves, this is a woman who counts in her life several men and odious parents who try to survive and protect her two children, Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova), aged 15, and a little blonde asthmatic. Kuba (Adam Misik). The poem is very present, but the theme - it gets lost a little. <br /> <br /> Marcela (Anna Geislerová), Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Luknár) lost everything in the floods of Prague in 2002 and there is nothing left, it seems, but good sex , to which they attack with such revenge in their small apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the TV, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek relishes such an explicitness and skates on the brink of embarrassment or shock. There is no good explanation for this, but financial despair has led Jarda to deal with stolen cars in the large garage attached to his apartment. His cohort of car thieves chased a boring Volvo, the pleasing Benes (Josef Abrham), the keys in the ignition, while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a nice guy, but not stupid. His Volvo is wired for satellite tracking in cases like this and this drives the cops directly to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort go to jail. <br /> <br /> "The beauty in difficulty runs away to the good angel, / On whom she can count", begins the poem of Graves. But in reality, this crash leads Benes to Marcela when he meets her at the police station. He introduces him to sushi and how to drink wine and provides him with a picture book about Tuscany, where he was born in Prague, but owns a beautiful villa and has lived most of his life. He is here to recover the Prague house now occupied by a couple with an old and infirm mother, whom he allows to stay. Every act of Benes is benevolent, even if it does not prevent Jarda from going to prison. <br /> <br /> In these circumstances, Marcela must withdraw with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer), the diabetic skinny diabetic of the current husband of Zdena, who, for children, begins from the moment they commit the capital sin of consuming his dietary cookies turns out to be the uncle of hell. Jiri Schmitzer diverts the film at this point and never lets it go completely. Even in the final scene, he is a menacing figure. It is amazing that Richard, odious, does not sexually abuse one or both children. He insists that Marcela must fend for himself and when Benes offers to take her under his wing, Richard and him become unlikely allies. Improbable - perhaps implausible. Why would Benes like it? But then, what is the whole story of Benes? On some things, the film gives too much information and on others, not enough. <br /> <br /> Clearly the "good angel", Benes is of an infallible kindness - and a polite and handsome old man, whose manners suit his Italian upbringing. It is only at the end, when he is pushed to the limit, by the sneaky occupants, on his property in Prague, he proves that he is not the type not to lie down or be trampled. <br /> <br /> It is also necessary to take care of the religious fanatic mother of Jarda, Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and of her interactions with Zdena and Richard. But she's just another joker who does not increase the deck. <br /> <br /> The poem was set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on the screen by accordionist-singer Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a longer-staged scene on stage during a performance in prison, seen by Jarda and the boyfriend of the car thief. If you worship Hrebejk as an author, you can enjoy this sequence; otherwise, he tends to feel free. There are also a number of songs by Glen Hansard / Marketa Irglova from the Oscar-winning Irish musical "Once", which includes the theme song "Falling". They feel more out of place than they would otherwise be because of their familiarity with "Once" - although this film was the first. <br /> <br /> People from Hrebejk get arrested; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to go astray and grow too much. The problem of ownership Benes endures can be helpful to show that he has a hard side. But such an elaborate demonstration was not necessary. The acting is good, and there is a marvel with weirdness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex and money are lost in Marcela's reshuffle and conflicts and the way she resolves them never become clear. It goes without saying that the theme and the poem of Graves are not solved and that Marcela always has a hot sex with Jarda during a visit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her children. But there are too many questions about what to do with the odious Richard or the pious and boring mother of Jarda (Emilia Vásáryová). Why did we suddenly learn that Koba was receiving letters from "India" supposed to come from his father, who is in prison? When did it happen? Interesting details, glued in a hurry. It seems like a world in which you can not see the forest for the trees.
