I took a DVD at 1 ?? reduction, having no idea what it is (but at this price, I can not resist ..) In short: I was positively surprised. <br /> <br /> So I did a lot of research. On the German DVD (part 2 of a series of 3), the episodes were recombined into two parts of 85 minutes, and broken down. Here are my results, based on the list of Wikipedia episodes: <br /> <br /> "Doomsday" is in my boots + voice (last episode). <br /> <br /> "Machine War" is Hel & High Water (1, 2) + Pod Listener + Juggernaut Down. <br /> <br /> Well, what can I say. Poorly dressed girls are of course interesting for older men. I've never looked so much at Charlie's Angels, so I can not compare, but the more I looked, the less I looked for the bikini tops and their trimmings. Instead, the characters (m and f) have become more interesting. I imagine that feminists are also having fun with that. Overall, it may be a guilty pleasure, but a pleasure it was: ^)
