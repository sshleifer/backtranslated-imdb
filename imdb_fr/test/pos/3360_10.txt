Often, when TV shows are transferred to the big screen, they lose their appeal. Not in this case! The historical precision of costumes, equipment and general artistic direction, like the television series, is remarkable. A good example of comedy and farce, with an excellent script and comic actors in the right places. Based on a classic television series that is unique in the history of British television comedy.
