General Trelayne is a super-being who wants to play a little game with the crew of the Enterprise. Many extremely improbable and absurd things seem to be happening and Trelayne seems obsessed with the human practices of war and murder. He seems to need to experience what he imagines to be a thrill and has created a human environment (though several centuries old) in which he can play his fantasies. The environment is subtly inauthentic and the crew immediately begins to detect inconsistencies. Soon, it becomes obvious that Trelayne is not just an immature god, but a very fallible being. Regardless of how you feel about it, stay tuned for the end of Twilight Zone. As many have pointed out, Trelayne's character inspired the more developed and entertaining character Q - and you can see in the construction of this personality by John DeLancie more than just shades of Campbell's Trelayne. It is amusing to compare how the four captains we met with Q treat him in such a radically different way.
