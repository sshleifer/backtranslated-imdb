I have always liked the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. In 1981, I had the chance to meet Martin Sheen in front of the Santa Monica Municipal Auditorium while he was waiting for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this artwork, especially his portrayal of the young captain. It is undoubtedly a must, a complete and an important part of the history of American cinema. "Charlie does not surf" The famous line of Robert Duvall (the other) does not need to be repeated because it has become a hymn often repeated and his character of Pattonesque will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk of the John Wayne tradition . It's a surprise to see what Laurence Fishburne's youth looks like.
