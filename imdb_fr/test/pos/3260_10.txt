Many years ago, I saw this movie (on TV maybe?) And I loved it. So I decided to rent it on DVD the other day to see if it still held in my estimate. It made. <br /> <br /> Located in Sydney's infamous King's Cross neighborhood (where prostitution, drug addiction and sex-shops thrive), it tells the story of "Jimmy" (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... maybe in the late teens or so, who does not have a stable family. He is on the margins of society and works as a "everything" for a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). He knows a figure of the underworld called "Pando", who is a local bigwig in the cross. Jimmy hopes he'll be on Pando's radar and "get in" with him ... a shortcut for upward social mobility, he hopes. <br /> <br /> One evening, Jimmy meets the beautiful young woman Alex (played by the charming Rose Byrne). You just know that a love story will be played between them. That night too, Jimmy is contacted for the first time by Pando (played by Bryan Brown). Pando has a "job" for Jimmy. It's the "foot in the door" that Jimmy was waiting for! <br /> <br /> To reveal more, it would spoil the many surprises that this film reserves for the spectator. Stylistically, if you like Quentin Tarantino's or Guy Ritchie's movies, you have to be listening to what to expect ... twists and comedies. <br /> <br /> What's great about this movie is its Australian -ness' look. It's not just a reversal of Tarantino or Ritchie, but a real Australian contribution to the genre. <br /> <br /> A fascinating aspect of this film is the way everything is connected. Sometimes you are introduced to characters with whom you wonder what they are doing there. In the end, all these "tips" bind beautifully. It's a bit like a band of Moebius celluloid. <br /> <br /> One of the highlights of the film is Pando de Bryan Brown's character. Pando loves riddles and it's fun to watch him play with his friends. These are the little details revealed about him that are so nice ... his taste for music, for starters! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger's films I've seen (The Dark Knight, 10 things I hate about you), that's maybe his best role. Was not caught with "10 things". If you're a fan of Heath Ledger (Ledger recently died of a tragic and accidental death), this is an opportunity to see him play his biggest Australian role, I think. There is a great chemistry between Ledger and Byrne in this movie. So, on one level, it works like a beautiful love story. <br /> <br /> This film does not have the horror of Tarantino and Ritchie's movies, but there are themes for adults ... scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty. In this sense, it is not an ideal film for very young spectators, but it is not a film that will excite the enthusiasm of the hunting dogs. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must say that it's great that Australia can make great movies like this one. Usually, the kind of movies that my country of origin produces can be little stimulating. This film has strong points where many Australian films have weaknesses ... that is to say. he has a good story, a good acting and a good script. We need more popular and quality movies like this one to be made here in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. The other Australian films that I liked are: <br /> <br /> Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My brilliant career (not yet published by me) Proof (nr) The Devil's Playground (nr) The year my voice broke (nr) Bad Boy Bubby (n / a beautiful black comedy) The Dish (nr.
