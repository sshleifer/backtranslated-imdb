Tim Robbins did a great job directing this film. I say that because he avoided conventions and clich√©s. He also supervised the superb performances of Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for his role) and Sean Penn. Even more surprising, Robbins is not frequented. It simply tells the story and lets events play in the viewer's mind. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinion on the death penalty, one of the most controversial topics of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in both directions. I can not recommend too much this movie, 9/10.
