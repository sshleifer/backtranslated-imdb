Tipping the Velvet was released in the UK just three weeks ago and I already see countless letters to national newspapers and television guides claiming that it has a complicated scenario, poor performance and a screenplay. even weaker. <br /> You find me angry. It's a heresy. <br /> <br /> I would really like to dispel any doubt by first congratulating Andrew Davies for allowing Geoffrey Sax to create this wonderful dramatization of Sarah Waters' novel by protecting it from such a fantastic scenario. Glory. But I'm afraid I have to change tactics now. <br /> <br /> I saw one of the best TV guides here in the UK (who will remain nameless) tirelessly describing Tipping the Velvet as a "lesbian love story". If they do, and I suppose they do, they try to promote interest in the film, then it's totally the wrong way to proceed (except that the sentence is an inaccurate and disappointing description). In saying such a thing, they are either a) moving away those who would be instinctively repulsed by "that" subject or b) attracting a class of people who will only look at a "serious action from girl to girl". Buy a video! Through this manifestation of serious inconsistencies, this magazine and other magazines devalue what is a brilliant adaptation of one of the greatest works of recent literature. Tipping the Velvet is a story of love, passion, evolution, loss and sorrow. This is not a lesbian love story. No result. <br /> <br /> The end result is a matter of style, with excellent performance in all areas (including Stirling, Hawes, Chancellor and May). When it comes to direction, it's intoxicating and immersive - sometimes fast-paced, sometimes not - but it never stops being nothing short of convincing. Overall, it's polite and well done, sex is undertaken with tenderness and delicacy - and although many will not classify it as a true "movie", it will remain among my favorites for some time.
