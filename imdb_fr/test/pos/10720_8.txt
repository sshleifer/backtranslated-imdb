This is probably the best cinematic representation of life in an advertising agency in Manhattan: the pressure of performance; client and agency requests; the parts; creativity; money; fresh surface with powerful corporate submarines. <br /> <br /> Mix parenting for Dustin Hoffman. <br /> <br /> The film is textured and deep. He follows his inner relationship as he tries to understand and live with what is happening; his relationship with Meryl Streep (and his friend, who becomes his friend) and his relationship with his son. <br /> <br /> While Meryl Streep was great, did she set the record for the shortest time on screen to win an Oscar? She can still deliver when she is lit.
