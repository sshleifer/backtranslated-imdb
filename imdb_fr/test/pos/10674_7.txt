"Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" (aka "Doppelganger") is a Twilight Zone science-fiction offer from Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (the team behind Space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and other). In the film, Roy Thinnes (from the television show "Invaders") and Ian Hendry play astronauts in a flight to the planet that shares an exact orbit of the Earth, but on the other side of the sun. so previously hidden from view. An insistent European space flight director (overflown by the late Patrick Wymark) is speeding up the flight and, after rigorous training, the astronauts are ready to leave. Thus begins the best sequences of the film, the launch, the flight and the landing on the "other" earth. The dazzling rocket miniatures (by Derek Meddings) and a dreamlike and elegant spaceflight (reminiscent of the best moments of "2001: an odyssey of space") are the easy highlights of the film. Landing on land "doppelganger" is both exciting and disturbing. After that, the appearance of the movie Twilight Zone comes into play; with an almost lifelike plot of the classic episode of TZ, "The Parallel". That said, the film is still a solid sci-fi film, with some intriguing intrigues of the "mirror world" to bite (writing back and left-handed handshake, for example). Scenes depicting mid-21st century land are less successful. where all men wear Nehru turtlenecks and jackets and all women wear mini-skirts. Some of the relationships with women in the movie are very "non-PC" by today's standards. And (in the most consistent failure of science fiction of the twentieth century), computers, phones and other materials are all big, colorful and clumsy (straight out of Patrick McGoohan's "The Prisoner"). Nobody predicted the age of the digital microprocessor! If one can accept these weaknesses with foresight, the film is very interesting, with a strong performance of Thinnes as a distressed astronaut. And with a beautiful nihilist ending in the style of the 1960s and early 1970s! For retro science fiction fans (like me), it's a "trip" to take!
