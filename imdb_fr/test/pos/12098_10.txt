I will honor Herr Hacke f√ºr den Filme. Mein Deutsch ist nicht gut. Enschuldigen Sie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I did not know how diverse the sound of Istanbul was when I live in Turkey.Faith Akin and Alexander Hacke took a different approach to Turkish music. Comment, play, see Istanbul and Istanbul The music of a foreign aspect gave the true meaning of the music itself. <br /> <br /> In this film, I discovered how different our (Turkish) culture was, how interesting our interpreters were, and how much respect they deserve. Unfortunately, no one has been able to serve this kind of documentary before.
