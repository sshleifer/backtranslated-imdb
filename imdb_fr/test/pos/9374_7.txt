I have not read the source, Richard Brooks' novel "The Brick Foxhole", which, I hope, is not as happy as its title, but I understand that the original villain was a homophobe and not an anti-Semitic . (And to be honest, Sam Levene is written like a gay guy picking up a drunken soldier.) But, okay, you have to follow the flow. Consider 1947. Even anti-Semitism has not yet been dealt with on screen. Many contemporary film makers were Jewish themselves, but anti-Semitism was verbatim for years because it was considered unpleasant. We can hardly blame the authors of this film for not letting the homosexual victim. It's really REALLY unpleasant - and besides, there may be a lot of people in the audience who want Robert Ryan to get away with it. We are certainly not free from prejudices, but we have come a long way since 1947. <br /> <br /> Looking at this for the first time in years, I was impressed by the rather slow pace of the first half of the film, the many shots of two people talking, the shadows, the time that elapses between the question and the answer, the uninspired montage. But I could live with it because of the subject of the film and some other things. <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan's performance is one of the things that keeps me close to events that are happening so deliberately. The guy does a wonderful job. Sometimes he may seem thoughtful, gaily subordinate and helpful to the police - "I can help, yes, sir." Then, alone or with another soldier, the smoldering hate goes up to the zenith, not so much by what he says, but by his way of looking. That scowling look, that penetrating look, those shining black eyes. Wow. <br /> <br /> The film took a lot of heat because of Robert Young's preaching speech about the murder of his grandfather. It does not bother me at all, although I suppose Dmytryk does not need Young to put his head in the camera while talking about "MICKS and PAPISTS". Nevertheless, considering the context, this is one of the most shocking moments of the film. Part of its impact is due to the almost informal dissemination of the message by Young, and partly to the fact that the message was not heard on the screen before. <br /> <br /> Another characteristic of the film that almost transforms him into the surrealist is the character of Paul Kelly and his relationship with the whore Gloria Grahame. Saint Guacamole, what elliptical conversation gave Kelly. "You know what I told you, all of these things I just told you are all lies." Its character crosses properly pathos with the creeps. It is impossible to know what to do with him. It adds almost nothing to the plot, but the film would be much less without his presence. <br /> <br /> It's a sullen and murky film. Its inhabitants live in the dark. And there is a murder on foot. Virtually no one screams or screams. The horror experienced by these men and that some of them still bear as malaria seems just beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> See it if you have the opportunity.
