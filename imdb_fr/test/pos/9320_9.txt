One of the best musical bios. Dennis Morgan is great as singer / songwriter Chauncey Olcutt. The cast is very good, especially Andrea King in the role of glamor Lillian Russell. The atmosphere of the turn of the century is the ideal setting. Technicolor is excellent. A simple plot, but the movie makes you feel good. Morgan has always been underrated as an actor and singer.
