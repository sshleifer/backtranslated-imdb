MY DINNER WITH JIMI is a glimpse of the breathtaking and dizzying journey Howard Kaylan with his folk-rock band of the 60s, The Turtles. The Turtles were a kind of "second row" act in the sixties, but the film clearly shows that they can eat, drink and party with the Hippie Titans Culture. And not only that, they had the musical chops to back it up. Many of the stellar acts of the time are visible when they interact with the group at work and during leisure. This provides my only complaint about the movie. Almost from the beginning of the film, one realizes that it is almost impossible to find actors capable of masquerading as recognizable personalities. Too often during the film, I felt that I was looking at an attractive exhibition of fake wigs and mustaches. But, if you're a fan of Turtle music, or Swinging 60, in general, this could be the movie for you. And, do not forget to see the supplements. Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, members of the group, speak in a very funny (and informative) way about their disastrous experiences with managers and agents.
