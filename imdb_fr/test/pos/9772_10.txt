I never sat for six hours straight to watch a miniseries, but Changi changed that. I'm not going to lie, I know some Australian movies can be pathetic and boring (actually, I like Australian movies pretty well but maybe I'm biased), but Changi is on a completely different path. Even if, historically, it is not correct, as we are constantly reminded, the show combines a superb action game, an excellent script and the addition of humor to offer us an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a prisoner of war camp during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Remember that the series was not meant to be a documentary. Do not let any mistakes disappoint you. <br /> <br /> This series features such a creation by John Doyle (aka Roy Slaven), better known for his comedy than for anything else, and an excellent director as well as actors who perfectly accompany this creativity. If you want to see how much hard work has been devoted to this series, visit the official website, it's really interesting and you will learn a lot about the real stories of changi. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Changi yet, be sure to do nothing for a whole day because you'll want to watch the show in its entirety.
