I remember this film as the other person who commented said. I recorded it but I wish I had it now just because it must have been one of the worst movies of all time. It's funny, really bad. I remember that the slogan on the box was "The ultimate frontal lobotomy". I got it from my mother, who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst film she ever saw, so my mom said, "My son is probably going to love." and the woman gave it to him just to take it away. I then filmed it, which I regret. I also remember that the "hollow screw" was one of those things that catches the ball ... things in the shape of a yellow cone, with a red "button" at the end, and when you hit the red thing, he sends a ball in the air. Well, they used it with a crank at one end and a corkscrew in the funnel. When the killer is killed, they show it by advancing with "the weapon", then move closer to what appeared to be raw chicken and dummy blood on the victim's head. I do not know what else to say about this "jewel" except that if you like bad movies, there is no worse.
