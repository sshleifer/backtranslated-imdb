It's a big show, it makes me wonder why it has been removed from the air so many times. But I think it's now here to stay! This show can not be compared to any other, Before Simpsons was pretty "at the edge" and at the time came Family Guy, and they stretch out of the "edge". The things that this show comes out with is amazing. Totally work the watch! If you love the Simpsons, you'll love the family guy!
