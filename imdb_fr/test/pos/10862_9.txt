This wonderful three-part BBC production is one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. The actresses show a very high level of talent, including Rachael Stirling in the role of Nan Astley. She is funny, seductive and cute. Love scenes and big kisses are very erotic, whatever the sexual preferences. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined and very credible. I guess it's a by-product of a good adaptation of a well-written novel. <br /> <br /> A truly remarkable and rhythmic drama that picks up speed after one or two boring (but necessary) scenes at first. . <br /> <br /> My vote: 9/10
