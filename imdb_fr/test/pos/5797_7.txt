In Russia, ordinary teenager Vera (Natalya Negoda) leads a relaxed life with her drunken father and single mother, without working or waiting for the call of a technical operator course. His brother Victor (Aleksandr Negreba) lives in Moscow with his own family and sometimes visits his dysfunctional family and Vera, always motivated to argue. When Vera meets the student of Sergei University (Andrei Sokolov), they fall in love with each other and decide to get married. Sergei settles at Vera but lives in conflict with his father. This relationship leads the family to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> I just saw "Malenkaya Vera" and I really loved this deep family drama. I am not familiar with the lifestyle of the former USSR, but there are unusual behaviors that I found very interesting. The first, when Victor tells Vera that she was conceived not because her parents wanted to have her, but because they wanted to move to a bigger apartment. Another, when the family goes to the beach by truck. Many difficulties of Vera's family and friends, repression in the park and other situations described in the film are common in third world countries. This low budget film is very well done and the story is very deep and real. The cast has great performances and the actress Natalya Negoda is very beautiful. The cover of the Brazilian magazine VHS, published by the distributor Sagres, indicates that Natalya Negoda was the central Playboy magazine. I am not sure of the accuracy of Portuguese subtitles, because many long sentences spoken in Russian are limited to a short translation in a few words. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Pequena Vera" ("Little Vera")
