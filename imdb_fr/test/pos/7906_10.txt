It's a shame that no one knows this movie. I think if it had just been a bit chilled and if it did not have such a small budget, I think one of the major film companies might have wanted to do it. I first saw this film at the age of 11, and I thought it was so powerful with the many illicit but illegal efforts Mitchell makes to keep his family together. That inspired me at the time and it surprises me now. If you are lucky enough to find a copy of this film, do not miss it!
