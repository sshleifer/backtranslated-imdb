This film is too good for words. It's amazingly awesome, funny and true to life. Looking at this, you know that whoever wrote this to DEFIANTLY felt the same as Jip and his friends in the movie. It was my life at one point and I was planning to go home to watch Human Traffic all night long before I even thought of going to bed. I think you are so loved by the characters and their lifestyle. Of course, this movie would not be for people aged 16 to 22, I guess. There is nothing wrong with this movie and it will leave you messed up all the way through. He does not have a particular story to that. The general idea is a weekend in the life of older teenagers in London and what they are preparing for. The places they go, the people they meet, the drugs they take and the experiences they have. You have to get this movie on DVD, no matter if you watch it, you must have it !!!
