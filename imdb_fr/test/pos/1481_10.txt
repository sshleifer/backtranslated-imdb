I liked this film too much. My only problem is that I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent, Michael Ironside. Corsican Ironside is just a low rent Jack Nicholson. I guess Mike was busy that year with "Highlander 2: The Quickening". Unfortunately, "Beastmaster 2" would have been a better career change. It is certainly the best of the Beastmaster series and in many ways is reminiscent of this great classic of the big screens "Masters of the Universe". Not only does he play the incomparable Mark Singer, but also an astonishing cast, especially the second daughter of "Sliders", Uncle Phil of "Fresh Prince of Belair" and the pervert of "Superman 2". This has upset my world and is certainly a must for anyone with no social or physical opportunities. BEASTMASTER FOREVER !!! ROCK N ROLL !!!
