I thought this movie was pretty good. It was on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) at three o'clock one night, and his quirky humor kept me awake until five o'clock. Kelly plays beautifully in this role, especially with the grandmother (whose note almost made me laugh in my seat). The main actress was fine, but the father was able to keep his character isolated from the marital conflict and keep the humor coming. If you like a good old and offbeat movie, I would recommend it. Unlike the other comment, I like Gene Kelly. He was the ideal lead actor for many early musicals and I think that in this role he is overflowing with charisma. One disadvantage is that the dance scenes get a little long, but if you can cross them, you are clear.
