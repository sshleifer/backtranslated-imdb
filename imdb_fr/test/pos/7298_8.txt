Okay ... so I'm looking at my parents' large DVD collection (mainly because they do not charge late fees ;-)) and I'm getting into "Mille Acres". I was stunned by the fact that it was a movie in which Jessica Lange AND Michelle Pfeiffer (with a little appearance of Jennifer Jason Leigh) that I had not seen. I do not even think I've heard of it before. Well, that's exactly the kind of find I've been dreaming about since I have to admit that my parents raised two moviegoers with my brother and me. With a few exceptions (we can not even get them to consider watching Lord of the Rings movies, but my father LOVES the Matrix - GO FIGURE trilogy), we have very similar likes in the movies. <br /> <br /> It was a particularly AWFUL day today, from the weather point of view. It was raining all day, so I fell in this movie and soon after, I was hypnotized. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the best "sleepers" I have ever seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer play very well in their roles, especially as they play very different types. The character of Jessica Lange is a fan who will appeal to people and who, although the eldest in the family, rarely plays a leading role. Instead, she bows to her father (Jason Robards) and sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and is determined to teach her little sister Caroline (Leigh) how to do the same. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very strong cancer survivor who is barely able to contain the anger of her unhappy life. This film is five years before White Oleander, so it was a source of inspiration to see her play a character as strong and upset. <br /> <br /> I must say that this film will probably be more appealing to women. However, true movie buffs, regardless of genre or target audience, will find it difficult to deny the charm of this drama of family secrets and what they do to the people involved and those who make them. love. I do not know how I missed seeing this movie before, but it was really a good distraction on a rainy afternoon. ENJOY!!
