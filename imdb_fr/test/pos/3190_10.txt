I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3am. My brother and I were surfing the chain and we only see a young Russel Crowe. But not the phone thrown Russel Crowe, we had come to know and almost love back in the States. This film, to my surprise, was incredibly creative and hilarious. It features a bunch of clumsy teenagers with hilarious stories of strange sexual experiences, including a crafty salesman, prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother. If you have the chance to meet this movie, I strongly suggest you take it back. I must say that this film was incredibly entertaining and I thank the people of Australia who made it ...
