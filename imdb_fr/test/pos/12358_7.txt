It is a mistake to refer to any movie of this era as a horror movie. Most of the first supernatural German films are not so much horror films as obscure fantasies borrowed from the works of German romantics of the time, such as E.T. Hoffman and others. In Fritz Lang's "Der Mude Tod" (also from 1921), the personified death removes a young man from his love, but in Lang's film, the behavior of the characters can not be mitigated. None of the two young lovers deserve to die, but in certain circumstances they are only together in death. <br /> <br /> In Victor Seastrom's "Korkarlen", repentance is always an option. Fate can be changed - and delayed death - through the choices of the characters. Although the scenes of the Ghost Chariot's collecting souls are truly strange, these horrible images of Death as a great leveler are compromised by the offer of redemption of Death to the real monster of this story, David Holm, a brutal drunkard who because of a perverse hatred of humanity, spreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone with whom it comes in contact. <br /> <br /> One Christmas Eve, Holm is hit by a fight with a drinking buddy. As the first person to die on the stroke of midnight, Holm must become the conductor of the Phantom Chariot and gather souls during the new year. The Phantom Chariot, led by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on the way to ruin, comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way, Holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who have tried to help him. <br /> <br /> Maybe my disappointment about the end of the film is a criticism of Selma Lagerl√∂f's novel on which it is located. based. But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape his fate and see his repentance arrive too late to prevent his wife from poisoning her two children and herself, and seeing Holm suffer the consequences of his sins by being condemned to collect their souls. It would have been an appropriate punishment and a bigger horror than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others. In the film, however, the unalterability of fate is not the message; redemption is. The driver of the car allows Holm's spirit to return to his body, and he saves his family in no time. His repentance is reminiscent of Scrooge's repentance in "A Christmas Carol". <br /> <br /> If the banal and sentimental end does not offend you, there is still much to admire in the film's images. The special effects are amazing by the standards of the day and still hold, which is all the more miraculous as these double exposures were created inside a crank camera. In addition, the restored film on the new Tartan DVD is fabulous.
