A little "film in the film" case, or as the theme is the virtual game here, which is the reality or even more frightening what reality is the "real". Like all Cronenberg there are organic things, like the wonderful idea pod: the organic pistol, a weapon made of bone and tissue that pulls teeth. If there are slower moments, the sets, the conceptions and the ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. Maybe you do not like it because the way the movie is going is pretty unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it's well worth it.
