Mickey Rooney (as Mi Taylor) is a young man who follows an imaginary road in ruins. He meets Elizabeth Taylor, 12 years old (Velvet Brown). She loves horses, but has a sad history with animals. Mrs. Taylor is in love with the meaning of Mr. Rooney's horse; she brings him home and provides him with room and board with his family. Anne Revere and Donald Crisp (like Mr. and Mrs. Brown) support them very well. Butch Jenkins and Angela Lansbury are tense siblings of Taylor. <br /> <br /> The plot of "National Velvet" is not plausible; For example, the circumstances leading to Taylor's driving in the "Big Race" are quite difficult to reach (but were probably more credible on paper). Nevertheless, the links of the characters with the horses and with the character of Mrs. Revere are well designed. Rooney and Taylor are excellent in the lead roles; there is a balance between Rooney's "star child" and Taylor's new "child star", adding depth to their characterizations. <br /> <br /> The excellent performances of Rooney and Taylor are further enhanced by direction, photography and edited by Clarence Brown, Leonard Smith and Robert Kern. A sentimental classic. <br /> <br /> ******** National Velvet (14/12/44) Clarence Brown ~ Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor and Anne Revere
