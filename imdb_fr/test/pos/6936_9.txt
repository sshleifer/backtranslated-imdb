OK, I received the DVD game last week and I am finally starting to publish my reviews, but I liked this sequel in many ways. <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead. OKAY. This one films quickly, has very good effects of gore and a really successful atmosphere and style. In fact, I would say it's perhaps one of the most stylish DV filming films I've ever bought. Most of the time, I'm rather angry at DV movies because I'm boring and looks like a soap opera. Even a movie like Bone Sickness that I prefer has incredible ranges of DULL. Not this movie. It never stops long enough for you to catch your breath. Although I would not say that I liked it better than the first film, I will say that Sheets has certainly improved technically in the two years between films. This one has a better gore, the inevitable scenes of zombies, deflated characters and some actors back (although their roles are different), mainly Jerry Angell as a very good psychopath with a mule hell killer. The plans are more ambitious, as is the scenario this time around, because we can say that Sheets is trying to shoot a lot more than in the first movie. Some work, some do not, but I must say that at least he was not just trying to make a larger version of the first movie. This time there was no mention of a chemical spill plant, but only satanism and occultism that revives the undead. I congratulate Mr. Sheets for trying to do something different with this one. I give this movie two bloody inches!
