At one level, Hari Om is a film using a familiar genre - the road movie - to tell a familiar story: a curious Westerner explores the mysterious East. But the film revolves around two characters: a young French beauty (Isa) eager to live life to the full and a motorized rickshaw driver (Hari Om) aspiring to Bollywood, very different cultures, their increasing attraction to each other, and the beautiful crazy chaos that is India today. The gap that separates them can never be filled, but the director manages to bring the two closer to a case without harming the plausibility of the story. India and its inhabitants are essential ingredients of the story and, with the exception of the main characters, the roles are played in a beautiful and persuasive way by the inhabitants recruited during the production of the film on the road linking the Indian towns and villages which form the frame of the film. A major disadvantage for this viewer: a Keystone Kops chase towards the end of the film as Hari fleeing gangsters ready to recover a gambling debt. But the closing scenes where Isa and Hari bid farewell are poignant and unforgettable.
