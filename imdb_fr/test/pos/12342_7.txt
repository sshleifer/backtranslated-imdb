This is a decent horror film of the early 80s in which a girl (Meg Tilly) wants to get rid of her image of "goody two shoes" and is now part of a gang of girls called The Sisters. Their initiation is for her to spend the night in a mausoleum. Too bad that the mausoleum is the "last" resting place of some psychic Russian psychics and it is not quite dead yet. Looks like this guy was found in his apartment with lots of things stuck in the walls of his telekinesis practice, and a bunch of dead girls was found in the closet. All the evidence that hitchhiking can be dangerous, so listen to the girls. The girl of this man (Reymar) is rather upset by the death of his father and is confronted to a man who said that he knew Reymar and that he also gave him a cassette. Her husband (Adam West, of the Batman celebrity) is there to laugh and laugh, not much else. But it seems that Reymar's daughter may also have abilities she does not realize. Be that as it may, after leaving their unfortunate promise to the mausoleum, the rest of the Sisters take off to fetch things (like masks, sheets, etc.) to come back and scare them, but they do not suspect this. what's going on and what's going on. they have more than the shit that scares them. Even in death, Reymar is a very busy guy and revives a lot of corpses for entertainment. And it also seems that he has a weakness for bait in prison. Overall, it is an acceptable horror, nothing intense, but not terrible either. The DVD of Media Blasters also contains another version of the film which is a rough montage, I suppose, I only looked at it a bit, so I do not know how different it is from the theatrical release, but From what I've seen, it's a "warts and all" presentation. 7 out of 10
