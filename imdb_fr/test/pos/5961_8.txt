Excellent exercise on several levels: <br /> <br /> - showing the spirit of colonialism that has not yet ended in France <br /> <br /> - more generally the spirit of boring superiority of all Westerners <br /> <br /> - A revival of spy and thriller films: OSS 117 is stupid and stupid! <br /> <br /> The good idea is that, despite all these messages, it's a funny movie, full of jokes and gags, very light and sparkling. <br /> <br /> Special mention to Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. <br /> <br /> Must see. Wondering how are we going to enjoy it in the United States? <br /> <br /> This seems to be a success in France, so a new version is likely to come.
