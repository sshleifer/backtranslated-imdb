Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). That's how the movie starts. Adele decided that she and her daughter would move to California without asking anyone and leave her husband for no reason. The story is about the relationship between mother and daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the amazing work of the actresses. Natalie has been named to the Golden Globe for this role. She is one of the most talented actresses I have ever seen, just like Sarandon. They really look like mother girls. The soundtrack is also excellent. The movie is amazing. *10 of 10*
