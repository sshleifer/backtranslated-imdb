In the movie Lumumba, we see the faces behind the monumental change in the history of the Congo after its reconquest on the Belgians, as well as the motivations of those men to whose hands the raped and hungry country has fallen. <br /> <br /> Lumumba is not a film for hyper masses; it demands the attention of its viewers with a raw and honest acting game and a complex and charged dialogue. The main plot is shown through action, it's almost entirely based on words, but there's a recurring flap that's just action and it's the stroke of genius that makes the movie an enlightening panorama and powerful of the political struggle the independence of the Congo gave birth to. <br /> <br /> This film is real. It is a crude description of those in power and those on the street. This is revealing in its content. And he moves in the passions and emotions of his superbly portrayed characters. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a fan of history, a film buff or just a lover of good stories, Lumumba is a must.
