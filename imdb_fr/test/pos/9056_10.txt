I'm usually away from film festivals and I do not like slap-stick comedy, but I have to say that picture was excellent. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz from the TV show "Numbers" and Lorraine Bracco, Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were at their usual best. It's an incredibly high-level comedy with visual, spoken, and satirical interludes that kept the audience, and I, laughing throughout a pretty deep-rooted plot. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mr. Parness for dealing with a real but real subject in a way that can be appreciated but fully absorbed by his audience at all levels of the intellect. The plot remains intact throughout the film and the comic relief adds to the message without being too thick to be deformed. The mix of segways is wonderful and the product as a whole is wonderfully in good taste. <br /> <br /> I can say with certainty that this film will go far and should be seen by an audience of all ages; the problem is real, as is the powerful impact of this production.
