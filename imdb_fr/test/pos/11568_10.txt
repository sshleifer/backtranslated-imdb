After the success of "Muppet Babies", Warner Brothers wrote "Tiny Toons". But instead of doing Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and all the other Looney Toon gang kids, they created new animal characters, children with distinct personalities, but personalities identical to those of their predecessors. Buster & Bunny Babs (unrelated, which has become their gag or slogan), Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig, Dizzy Devil, Shirley 'the Loon, Elmira, Max Montana, Furball, Sweety, Rats and Matching Pets from Perfecto Prep , and the original Looney Toons launch. The "Tiny Toons" lived in Acme Acres and attended Acme Looniversity, where Looney Toon's gang worked as teachers, mentoring the younger generation to understand comedy. <br /> <br /> During the show, various potted shots were taken at Bush SR. administration, pop culture, and various other gags and parodies. <br /> <br /> Buster & Babs, arguably the main characters in the series, as mentioned above, were similar to Bugs Bunny in some ways, but they also had their different personalities and different cartoon styles, namely, Babs 'tendency to pose as everyone else, while Buster, who could be a good boy himself, usually played the right man (or right rabbit) in Babs' antics. Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not a Daffy Ball Ball, but a Daffy egomaniac), with an ego almost as big as Daffy and an obsession for the staging of Buster & Babs identical to that of Daffy with Bugs, but he usually fell flat face in his attempts, yet he remained strangely endearing. Hampton was an even more shy version of Porky Pig, and he had the heavy task of playing Porky at Plucky's Ducky. Shirley, the blond duck girl, was a girl from the New Age Valley where Plucky would come in and out of mockery or struggle for her affections. Dizzy was the purple version of the Tasmanian devil. Furball was Silent Sylvester and Sweety was the pink Tweetie bird. There was also the purple skunk that sucked a boyfriend and the pint-sized versions of Wile Coyote and the Road Runner. The evil was defined by Montana Max, a rich child who was always trying to make money or make people's lives miserable. There was also Elmira, an animal lover disturbed that everyone feared. And then there was Godo Dodo, a strange creature who did not have a clearly designated species, except that he was from "Wacky Land" or something like that. <br /> <br /> References to pop culture included Batman. (quite often in fact), Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Dances with Wolves, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, Fast Foods, Ten Commandments, Twilight Zones, Saturday Night Live and even The Simpsons, among others . > <br /> Not only funny, but he also managed to be warm and touching, something his successor "Animaniacs" never quite achieved. Also followed by "Taz-Mania".
