I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who commented on it here ... I went back again and again to see it again and again ... I think 9 times in total. It's great, it's how I would describe it ... The soundtrack, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the lifestyle that the children started on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had put in place ... of course, the powers in place must intercede, but when I forget this part, I find myself wanting to be in the film and live like that! So good that it's available on DVD now ... it was not there in years! <br /> <br /> TLW
