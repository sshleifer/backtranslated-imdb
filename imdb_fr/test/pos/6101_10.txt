*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Wow, what a delicate situation Joanna found herself in a difficult situation. After accidentally crushing a young child, she called for help before returning to the crime scene in the midst of a group of angry spectators. Of course, it's too much for her, and she runs away from the scene. Fortunately, the child is not dead, but is seriously injured and in a coma. Thus begins the greatest battle of Joanna's life: should she remain silent or speak? At first she does not know it, but eventually she realizes that living under such a secret is torture. <br /> <br /> At one point, she even joins a research team to help find the culprit. And little by little, a detective begins to question the behavior of this woman. She wants to tell the truth and she never wanted to flee the crime scene, but is it worth it to say and the whole city hates you for it? <br /> <br /> The thing with this film is that you do not choose the sides. Joanna is really a good model, even if she made bad choices. You feel for her, even if you know that what she did was wrong. His career illustrates what every human being would suffer if something happened to them. <br /> <br /> Margaret Colin is an absolutely brilliant actress. She was amazing in the TV show Now and Again and excellent in movies like Independence Day and The Devil's Own. Her performance here is so realistic and not forced that she carries us throughout the film. In the end, I wanted to see more of her. Lisa Vidal has also provided some good support work as a gentle and resourceful detective. <br /> <br /> To conclude, if you want to see a film that will make you think long after, a film that will say "It's the reality", then you will not want to miss this one. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
