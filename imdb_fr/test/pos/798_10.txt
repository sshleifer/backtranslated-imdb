I really like Traci Lords. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but she is pretty good at it. She plays the dowdy, conservative, journalist at a "T". It's a great little thriller that lets you guess a good time. Jeff Fahey is also good as a boss of Traci. I think that given a decent break, Traci could be a major actress. She is certainly no worse than some of today's great ladies.
