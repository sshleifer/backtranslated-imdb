I saw the movie at the cinema when it was released, then I watched the VHS tape over the years and, while walking in Target, I saw this DVD provided with "Pushing Tin" for the exorbitant sum of 5 , $ 50. <br /> <br /> It's something about this comedy that really touched me - how Kelsey Grammar, "with a tattoo on his stuff", is an unorthodox commander who inherits a sub- rusty diesel sailor and a crew of hand balls and misfits. He faces the best of the Navy - a Los Angeles-class nuclear attack submarine - and his former captain (Wm Macy). <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern plays the villain, Rip Torn the Admiral directing the exercise - If you do not 'laugh hysterically during the segment "silent course" with the cook, well, you have a different humor from me. <br /> <br /> Towards the end, the machinist says "DBF" without any explanation - these are apparently basic knowledge acquired by a former submarine consultant - thanks to Google, I learned that with the advent of nuclear submarines, the old salts wore pins "DBF" - Diesel Boats Forever. <br /> <br /> A friend of the Navy said that many of the technical aspects are not correct, but that does not matter: this is one of the funniest movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> I do not know it. think it takes a light to know who will win in this exercise!
