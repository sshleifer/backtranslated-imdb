You must see it to believe it. Shot in Hollywood on the strip in the middle of the ladle, everything revolves around the 70s, this film made at lower cost must really clutter the theaters of the city center of the day. Again, I bet it was a week-long race. In fact, it's rather hilarious. The acting is appalling, the direction is nonexistent, but the hair, the clothes, the pre-disco rotten music and the general gloom of the story are staggering. Sleazy, it's very sordid. Highly recommended (if you can find it)
