I did not catch Gilmore Girls when he came out, so I'm still catching up for the first season. I have read most of the user reviews. For negative comments, I have to ask which show are you watching ?? <br /> <br /> This show is a classic, excellent lines, characters and a good acting. And best of all, NOT your standard formula show always with an occasional twist to the story. There are probably more women who are reflected in the Lorelai / Emily relationship than in the Lorelai / Rory relationship. The characters and scenarios are not PCs, but they are real! <br /> <br /> If you find the dialogue annoying, I suggest you record the show to be able to watch again the parts that do not understand you.
