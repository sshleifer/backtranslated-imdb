This show is great! I like all the actors! He has a great story and characters. This is the perfect drama. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have an excellent dialogue. They can both be really funny. I miss Vanessa Marcil of the General Hospital, but she's great here. James Lesure is awesome! He can be hilarious. Molly Sims plays a dimwit very well. The writing is great! They maintain an excellent pace. The show can really leave you in suspense, which is one of my favorite elements of a show. I can not wait for the new season to begin. This show is part of the top ten of all my shows. I hope this show will stay very long. If people know what is good, it will be. I never want the show to end. Already.
