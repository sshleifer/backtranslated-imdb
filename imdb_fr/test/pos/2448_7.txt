There have been a lot of movies about people coming home after a war and facing, but "The War at Home" is worth the detour. Jeremy Collier (Emilio Estevez), a Vietnamese veteran who has difficulty communicating with his Texan family, much of the film may well upset you. But nothing can prepare you for what will end up being revealed. <br /> <br /> Part of what makes this film so good is the way it gives the viewer the feeling of both Texas and the generation gap. Jeremy's parents Bob (Martin Sheen) and Maurine (Kathy Bates) clearly have a problem with their son's attitude, both about the war and his rejection of Americanism. His sister Karen (Kimberly Williams) does not know who to line up with. But after dinner, there can be no neutrality. <br /> <br /> Then we Americans may never be able to fully overcome the Vietnam War, but this film can probably help us to seriously consider the consequences of the war. Many people. Emilio Estevez has certainly directed the direction. Also with Corin Nemec and Carla Gugino.
