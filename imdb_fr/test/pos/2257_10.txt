I thought this movie was amazing. I was a little skeptical because I really did not know what it was, but it was a beautiful story. I cried a lot and I also burst out laughing. <br /> <br /> I think it's very important to create films about the Holocaust and its impact on people (it only happened 60 years ago!) I went Germany and Eastern Europe and I studied the Holocaust. This film has been very important to me. I think this movie did an incredible job capturing this story (I will not go into details, I do not want to ruin it), but I really recommend it to anyone looking for a movie that, I know, may seem cliche your mindset about things.
