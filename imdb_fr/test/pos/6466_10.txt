This is one of the best performances of Cassavetes. The entire cast is exceptional, as is the sublimely subtle direction of Martin Ritt. The anger, anguish, and despair of urban labor battles are beautifully told in a manner that is neither intimidating nor condescending. In a way, it is dated from its time, but in many ways it is gloriously timeless.
