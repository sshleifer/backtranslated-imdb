Remember - before Sidney, there was Dudley. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges is hardly remembered today - because his age of glory in sound films ran from the late '20s to the' 30s. Except for one performance Major: The good mood of the ship, even though it's a drunk doctor in the 1927 movie MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, most of his films are barely rekindled. Plus it's a shame because he was a great actor. In 1931, he played the role of Casper Gutman (the original actor who would play this villain) alongside Ricardo Cortez's Sam Spade in the first film THE MALTESE FALCON. In the same way, around the same time, he played the recording angel in OUTWARD BOUND in the Leslie Howard version - the same role Sidney Greenstreet had played in BETINGEN TWO WORLDS ten years later. the doctor of this ship again), or hateful (in CHINA SEAS, as the first officer judging, sneering against poor Lewis Stone but proving that he is as tall as the coward in a moment of crisis). He held his own against Paul Robeson in THE EMPEROR JONES. He is the Chinese freedom fighter who works with Gary Cooper in THE GENERAL MORN AT DAWN. Digges could do anything. <br /> <br /> Here is Mr. Thompson, hypocritical director and burglar of a reform school in which Frankie Darro and his friends are sent for committing a robbery and wounding a store owner US-Greek last incident for most of them). Digges is as bad here as in CHINA SEAS, but it's very close to hating it. It can somehow transcend its roles ... later on that. <br /> <br /> Darro has a group of urban offenders (including a Jewish boy and "Farina" from "OUR GANG"). As noted in another review, this is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see them shaking car owners to pay them to "watch over and protect" their cars. When a guy does not do it, they demolish his car calmly. The robbery in the store of the American-Greek is also represented graphically enough: his skull fractures when pushed. <br /> <br /> The boys are arrested and brought before Judge Arthur Byron, an honest but honest judge, who realizes that he can not leave the children with their parents: the parents are unable to watch them or are incompetent. Unfortunately, there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: a Jewish father more concerned about his business than his son, the stereotype of Farina, the father "Yassum", and an Italian father whose willingness to cooperate prevents his son from launch in the reform. school. <br /> <br /> Once there, the boys find the regime oppressive. Sometimes one of the guards or the nurse (Madge Evans) tries to speak on their behalf. But Digges does not have time to pamper. His diet is determined to break the boys so that they behave well. Unfortunately, Digges and its accounting partner are greedy. They serve inferior food to the boys and pocket the profits. <br /> <br /> One day, a new official comes from the state to examine the reform school. It's Jimmy Cagney, who is a neighborhood painter whose gang voted for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he could not get the position of park commissioner), Cagney became assistant school inspector. Allan Jenkins (in his first film about Warner Brother) supports him. <br /> <br /> The irony is that if Digges had been a little more careful, Cagney would probably have let him continue. But Cagney arrives to see Darro brought to Digges to fight. The goaltender and Darrow had problems with respect earlier, and Digges now intends to punish Darro for running away, but is badly injured by Digges' barbed wire fences and by the free use of a whip. Cagney stops Digges and lets Evans heal Darro's wounds. And she explains to Cagney the reality of the situation and gives her idea of ​​the real reform reform of boys by giving them confidence in responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film goes all the way, showing that Cagney and Evans are on the right track, turning the reformer into a "republic" that allows boys to function properly. This leads to a conflict with Digges, whose profit is reduced because he no longer receives supplies. But the ploy is derailed when Cagney himself discovers that he may have serious problems with the law. Digges sees his opportunity and takes full advantage of it. But then he goes too far ... much more than he expected. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, many films showed children that they were taking steps to correct wrongs and change things. Darro appeared in WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD. Cecil B. De Mille did it THIS DAY AND AGE, where the children teach a lesson to a gangster played by Charles Bickford who scares him. This happened in the 1930s. THE MAYOR OF HELL attains a similar intensity of revenge and search for juvenile justice. But this is the only problem of the film. The Digges character is a rogue and a hypocrite. We never really cheer him up. However, if he was not a thief, we could follow his point of view (even if it's counterproductive). The early scenes of Darro and his gang attacking people actually make the hardness that Digges would follow seem quite understandable (even though his ways of flying are not so). In addition, he has a time when he is rightly angry at Cagney - at that time, for hiding from his own conflict with the law - by giving orders over the phone between long distances and a lost Digges. When Digges learns what really happened, he is rightly furious to see Cagney teach him about behavior. This is closest to Mr. Thompson's sympathy in this beautiful movie.
