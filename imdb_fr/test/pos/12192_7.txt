Despite critics criticism, I liked this movie. In fact, I liked it better than Interview with a vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than the Cruise attempt. All the main actors of the series were present: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and a half-dozen more (although most of them are cameos). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main actors (and Jesse of Talamasca). Also, despite other criticisms, I think that this film and this music were faithful to Anne Rice's representation and ethics, at least as I see it. Aailiyah was very good like Akasha, in fascinating places (his first entry and mini dance scene). The film did not capture the extent of the book series, but I thought it was a good complement. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of this series, mainly because of Anne Rice's style, sensibilities and treatments. And I found this film a faithful and often superlative representation of the author's vision.
