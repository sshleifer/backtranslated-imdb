A fun and humorous mixture of music hall (mainly in the first third) and procedural mystery of the police as the stories of the various suspects begin to collapse. The final revelation of the murder can be a surprise if you do not look closely. A stern look at the Paris of the time. You can ignore the final scene (the Hollywood ending). Louis Jouvet is the best police inspector who seems to be just passing through, but who is really on top.
