I think this movie is different from most of the movies I've seen. It was exciting in a way, and no matter what others say, I'm surprised by the final solution. Certainly did not see it coming !! Even if it's sad, it's worth watching. I do not see any movie that looks like that! The actors knew what they were doing. If you say that this film is void, you probably say what most people would say. But if anyone says that this film is ordinary, I absolutely disagree. And Norman Reedus should be more noticed. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm weird but I like that a lot. It was a bit of a mess, but who cares? I'm tired of boring and ordinary movies.
