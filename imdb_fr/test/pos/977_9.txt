It was enough for me to add my comment to raise the average on this one. Paul Giamatti lets all that hang out in this one and he is funny. He would probably say it was easy, but he's doing really good work and should have earned something. The DVD has been around for a number of years and my kids (4 1/2 year old boy and 9 year old girl) are going to watch it again and again, and the humor is grown enough so I do not mind hearing it at 'background. (and I'm running on TV for really funny games) A simple moral message, a lot of decent action and slapstick, "bad" kneeling adults to mitigate the advantage, a minimum of vulgar language and minimal pot jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard.
