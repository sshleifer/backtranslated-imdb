This film is a work of pure class from the beginning to the end, forget for a moment the famous hold-up without dialogue of 28 minutes, forget that it takes place in Paris and forget that it is Black. The film itself, the premises and the execution make it an experience of pure gold. He is intelligent, intelligent and thoughtful in every detail, just like the robbery itself. It portrays real characters who are not only credible, but with whom you show empathy. It is a film that does not glorify the notion of theft but shows it for what it is ... theft. This shows that a burglary is hard work and that it is ultimately uneconomic to do so. Now everything is considered a 28-minute audacious sequence without a spoken word that takes place in a sumptuous Paris, with a particular attention to detail, a fantastic cinematography and this last scene ... when you look up and see these trees. A wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques ... It's a masterpiece for me and I'm happy to have seen it.
