First, let me say that while I generally appreciate the work of Mike Judge, I was just shy in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill, Beavis, and Butthead. I usually prefer smarter comedies, and that's the irony of idiocracy. <br /> <br /> In a future world where the incarnations of Beavis and Butthead's views, his worst instincts and intellectual abilities are part of a chaos, the semi-Mad Max semi-Blade Runner society, disorderly, where every fantasy of director becomes reality, a man with a medium intelligence is threatening and accused of speaking gay, and the mentality of the crowd takes over. And this world is also incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is obvious that the executives of Carl, Jr., Starbucks, Costco and Fuddruckers will be horrified by the twisted values ​​of their products in 2505. <br /> <br /> There is had some missed opportunities with the movie, and the relationship between time travelers - the other being a medium-minded woman who worries about the retribution of her boyfriend (pimp) - could have been stronger; chemistry is there. And there do not seem to be too many women in the future. <br /> <br /> I left with a smile, but the experience is a little better than the memories. So this is my kind of popcorn movie, and it will be fun to come back in video. Recommended! FYI stays through the credits for an extra scene.
