Discover the first 20 minutes while the suspense has not yet exploded. We have a good look at the super secret Los Alamos just a few years after the big bomb test that ended the Second World War. Except for enhanced security, it seems quite threatening. Notice how it is a TV repairman, an obvious ordinary guy, who guides us through safety. Once past, it's like any other city in the United States, beautiful houses, quiet streets, kids going to school and a family television blinking. Later, we see little Tommy and Peggy frolicking in streets lined with impressive facilities separated by locked doors. The film seems to say, "Okay, we're tough, just because we have to be, but deep down, we're still just people." Now, I expect it to have been reassuring. Cold War message to the public is still not used to government research "overnight". It is a clear effort to reassure the population. The darkest note is when Tommy's mother (Clarke) worries about her son's mental state. He does not say "when I grow up"; instead, it's "If I grow up". This note of doubt reflects not only a reality of Los Alamos, but also a national reality that, in 1952, had just seen images of the apocalyptic bomb H. Also note how FBI agents are described with professionalism, a standard feature of the McCarthy era tariff. When we need brute force, it is not them, but the citizen, Gene Barry, who refutes the information, an old version, I suppose, of the "restitution" of the modern era. <br /> <br /> Once the kidnapping has taken place, the suspense does not let go. The plot is well managed with colorful locations in Los Angeles that let us guess. The climatic scenes around the cliff dwellings may not be a plausible hiding place, but the view of northern New Mexico is superb. In addition, the old stone apartments are one of the most exotic funds of the decade. Also note the heavy use of the police helicopter that is starting to be used as a law enforcement tool. Among an otherwise mastered cast, Nancy Gates remains a bubbly presence as Professor Ellen Haskell. Never Hollywood glamor, she was always a beautiful actress unknown and a winning personality. I also expect it to be one of Hopper's most successful efforts, and although people have since become accustomed to the nuclear threat, the film remains a revealing and captivating document of his time.
