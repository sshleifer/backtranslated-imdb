It was Charlie Chaplin's first film. Yes, there was some sound and lyrics inserted in his previous movie, MODERN TIMES, but it was still a silent movie. It was not until 1940 that the audience heard Chaplin speak in the cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is incredibly famous and enjoys an excellent reputation. Although I enjoyed the film, it did not impress me as much as the other Chaplin feature films in their mid-twenties or thirties. This is because some Chaplin members were very upset when he played against Adenoid Hynkel, especially when he was delivering his speeches. The silly pseudo-dialogue just seemed like something that a smaller comedian would have used (like the Three Stooges). Plus, playing with a fun Hitler is hard for me. <br /> <br /> However, when Chaplin played the role of the Jewish barber, he was not particularly funny he was a great voice for reason and decency. This film should not be considered a comedy (especially that it does not really excel), but for his excellent acting and his humanity. The last speech of the hairdresser (imitating Hynkel) is brilliant and almost brought tears to the eyes. Watch the movie for that reason alone.
