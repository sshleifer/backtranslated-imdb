Nowadays, it is ridiculous to evaluate this movie 18 (or X in the United States). The film has an erotic story both sexual and sublime to tell, but the images are rather innocent. Throughout the film, you experience and experience the spirit of the late '60s and early' 70s in typical modes, dialogues and cinematography and experimental lighting. And this is the part that is worth visiting.
