I like the previous description of this film as a poem of life. Last night, I caught this totally randomly on the Movie Channel, and I was captivated enough to stay true to this idea. There is really a truly unique voice in the film, a meaningful narrative poetry, without sinking into pretensions. There are also many hilarious moments from Wirey's school days that are raw without being a little joke. It's sad that this movie is so badly rated. The fact that there is so much "1" makes me think that the numbers are cooked - I do not see how anyone could see the film as catastrophic. Of course, it is by no means a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique look on a very particular life, on a man whose attraction comes from his detachment, detachment he must overcome before destroying it. Give this film a chance. It came out of nowhere for me and I feel richer for that.
