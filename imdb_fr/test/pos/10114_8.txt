Call it drivel manipulator if you want, but I fell for it. Of course, there could have been more character development. Yeah, there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant "movie of the week" score, but Ed Harris was flawless, Cuba Gooding adorable and touching, and let's look at people in real life, how many of us really get to know the motivation of others. Not a lot. We had a little glimpse of the motivation of the coach (a very provocative dialogue in my opinion, not to forget so soon) so it was a nice tribute to a human being who left his "comfort zone" to reach out to another human being, and at the same time, touched the lives of hundreds of others. A lesson that we all need to remember. Why is the right thing to do so often the hardest thing to do? I recommend this beautiful little movie to all those who have heart. You will not be disappointed. And bring your Kleenex. 8/10
