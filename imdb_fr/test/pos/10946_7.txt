This film, as my Chinese girlfriend informed me, presents two well-known Hong Kong pop stars. Although this can make the film a marketing move, I found the acting game acceptable and they are cute both. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty bad overall. Vampiric traits and weaknesses, however, are used in a humorous way and have created particularly entertaining fragments. The argument between the two girls made me laugh, and it gave a good balance with the well-executed action scenes to create an entertaining movie.
