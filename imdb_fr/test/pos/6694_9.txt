K-Pax is a very intriguing film. Prot (Kevin Spacey) is he really an extraterrestrial or is he a mentally disturbed human who just thinks he's an alien? This is the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before Prot's deadline for leaving Earth. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds and new evidence is discovered, both theories develop credibility. His ability to map memory of the region of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possess. Yet, hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, full of devastating events that could have caused such an aberration of the personality. The end seems to give the answer, but it is ambiguous enough for you to wonder if you really know. Normally, I do not like lady or tiger ends, but this one is tempting. I have my own theory that fits all the clues, but I do not know if my theory is more accurate than the others. <br /> <br /> Director Iain Softley ("Wings of the Dove") tells the story. delicately, with a lot of talent. It is a rare example of a director who remains in the shadows and encourages talented actors to play exceptional roles to let history dominate. This does not mean that the staging is technically inferior because it is excellent. However, Softley remains discreet and provides great power through the use of subtlety, a nice change from the vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer like to shout, "Look how bright I am! "<br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is once again delivering a great performance as a prot.This is an extremely demanding part, forcing Spacey to make the Prot a little cool and logical, then shifting gears for evoking his altered alter ego under hypnosis Spacey is so credible as a stranger and human, it makes the task of the viewer all the more difficult.Jeffer Bridges is also great as a relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning to the truth about Prot. <br /> <br /> This is an inspired narration for the thoughtful viewer.I noted it 9/10.If you need to have the closing at the end of a movie, this movie will be very fr However, if you like a fascinating mystery that makes you think long after the credits, you will not be disappointed.
