It's by far the best cinematic version of William Faulkner's fiction I've ever seen, and I've seen some of the most important ones. Filmed in the hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, in Faulkner County, it truly reflects the feeling of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County. Intruder in the Dust is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but even if it's a clich√© to say it, it would be the jewel of someone else's career. That kills the good but simplistic Harper Kill a mocking bird fifty feet in the ground (I read this one in ninth grade and that's exactly what it belongs to). Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters play a major role in the film, Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably the most widespread character in all of Faulkner's fiction. Lawyer, he works easily as a narrator, because unlike many of his characters, Stevens is a man of logic and not emotion (at least if he is older). Lucas Beauchamp is perhaps the most important of all Faulkner's black characters (he plays a major role in one of Faulkner's masterpieces, Go Down, Moses); unlike all the other blacks of Yoknapatawpha, he refuses to prostrate himself before a white man. He is proud and many whites find this quality execrable in a black man. One day, Lucas is found standing near a dead white man with a newly fired pistol. Most people in Jefferson and the surrounding area do not see the need for a trial and everyone is convinced that Beauchamp will be lynched before the end of the evening or at least the next day, the murder and arrest having taken place Sunday. Beauchamp, for his part, declares his innocence and tries to convince Stevens to help him. Stevens refuses; the case seems open and closed. But his young nephew, Chick Mallison, because Lucas helped him in the past, is ready to help him now. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, no Hollywood film of this period deals with racism as openly as possible. one. Hollywood movies rarely persecute the black population but prefer to relegate them to the rank of servants. If you are an African-American actor, you may as well give up and accept this role of mammal, maid, maid or doorman, because this is the only way to work. In Intruder in the Dust, you'll find one of the most memorable non-bearer roles of a black actor, Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchamp, as I described above, is not a stereotypical character and could have been hard to accept for the public. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical and kind. The recent success of the arthropic film, Far from Heaven, is an excellent example. Beauchamp is a kind of asshole and he is very stubborn. Although he may be a little less present here than in the novel, he is by no means a stereotype. He is a complex human being. Juano Hernandez plays extraordinarily well in Beauchamp. I have not seen the film for a while, but it also appears in Robert Aldrich's 1955 film, Kiss Me Deadly, as well as in the film adaptation of Faulkner's latest novel, The Reivers. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great in the movie. I should also quickly congratulate Claude Jarman Jr., who plays the big role of Chick Mallison. The novel unfolds from his point of view, and he is the conventional hero of the image. Jarman is quite an actor; he captures the character (who also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction, for example, recounting events that occurred a decade or more before his birth in the 1957 novel The Town). He would play another big role next year in John Ford's underrated film, Rio Grande. The only other Clarence Brown film I've seen is National Velvet, an entirely different picture of Intruder in the Dust. His work here is exceptional. I really have to trust him to have captured Faulkner to perfection. Other famous adaptations of Faulkner are too melodramatic (The Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, which I really like) or too cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, which I do not like too much, this cold is a misunderstanding of Faulkner). The only other who is doing really well, according to his sources, is Douglas Sirk's big filming of Pylon in 1958, Tarnished Angels (a novel really different from Faulkner). 10/10.
