This film is masterfully directed by Clive Barker, he really knows how to relate the audience to the characters. I think it's missing a sequel to this one, Barker should have devoted himself to following this movie instead of doing the boring Lord of Illusions, it's a scenario that, I think, was a real trash. But I also think that for this reason and because of the lack of sequel, NBreed has become a classic horror movie cult.
