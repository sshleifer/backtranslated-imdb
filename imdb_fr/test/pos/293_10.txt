I would like to submit the following blunder. <br /> <br /> During the bridge scene, soldiers walk in the river, asking to be taken away and trying to escape. Some soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board their suitcases. Soldiers are not delivered and never carry suitcases in a combat zone. They have duffel bags, backpacks and handbags, but no suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of order. In addition, if you take a closer look, you will see that the suitcase floats above the water. This is probably a very good indication that it is empty, otherwise it would sink.
