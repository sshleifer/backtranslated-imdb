I was reluctant to see this movie before reading the external comments and user comments posted here. Why? Firstly because Mick Malloy's humor can (in my humble opinion) be quite rude and disproportionate, as evidenced by the fact that he shot a TV show a few years ago. And second, good Australian comedy films are unfortunately as rare as Tassie Tiger. <br /> <br /> Mick significantly restricted her natural comic exuberance in this amazingly watchable film. Who would have thought that a petanque club would provide the setting for one of the funniest Australian movies of the years? The casting is excellent, with old, familiar local players all performing credible performances. <br /> <br /> Interesting to see John Clarke play the villain in this piece. It's a one-dimensional piece but JC always adds a touch of class, as always. It's good to see Judith Lucy also take a Guernsey or should I see the bowls on the big screen. She is a real talent, a pity that a number of her answers were delusional. His own material is much more spiritual. Interesting character however. Bowls reporter on a local cloth. The crackerjack may not be the funniest movie I've seen this year, but it's certainly a fun diversion that's worth a visit. Many other people obviously agree with me because it is the most profitable Australian film of this year. It's good to finally see someone doing a delirious and sweet comedy without trying to pound laughter like so many Australian "comedies" before him. <br /> <br /> Finally a little detail. If you're wondering which Australian rules team, Mick supports the flag on his workstation. Also watch out for his former criminal partner, Tony Martin, who makes the announcement in the final bowl scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
