The problem I have as a Finnish is that most of the actors in this film are in every Finnish film. I have the impression that Finland has only five actors. I think that if you are not Finnish, you really like this film as a refreshing novelty. <br /> <br /> This film tells a chain of dreadful events that badly affects a few people. Alcoholism, cold climate and darkness may be clich√©s, but they are still very real in today's Finnish society. Many Finns suffer from depression, especially in winter. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film is very melancholic. I liked and the management of Louhimes was still very solid. I really liked this film, the only negative is that you see the same faces that you have seen over and over again.
