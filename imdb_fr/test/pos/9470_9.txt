She is the man is everything I wanted and maybe even a little more. I love the movies "chick flick" as a teenager and I knew that it would be great !! In the same vein as 10 things I hate about you (one of my favorites of all time), She's The Man is a unique comedy, well written, very well performed, with some of the funniest lines and a physical comedy that I have seen for a long time. . It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther.) But She's The Man is actually a funny, more intellectual humor and most of the humor relies on the spiritual scenario, the "Three's Company" style story of mistaken identities, conflicting messages and actors. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a star !! Even from the days of the horribly entertaining (but also strangely entertaining) "The Amanda Show" she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy, and is probably one of the most talented actresses in the world. , personification and spiritual dialect made Previously, her big-screen debut (where she was the star) was rather "What does a girl want." Which is rather hilarious and well written. the ultimate girl next door, it's a shame that she does not do more work on the big screen because she could be the next "She." She's the all-American, cute, down-to-earth, teenager bubbly (even if she is twenty years old now) and whether or not she will be able to transform her talent and style into an adult actor, it will remain to be seen, but for the purposes of this film, she is perfect! legitimately draws the rather odd plot of her im his twin brother and makes him credible. Not quite ... but credible enough. Most of the scenario is based on the comedy of his mistakes trying to be a guy, but it's just hilarious laughs and nonstop. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in "Havoc" of 2005 by playing Duke. He is the jock, the captain of the football team and, ultimately, the object of affection of Bynes. Unfortunately, he is also Sebastian's roommate (who is Bynes). He is a good man and the chemistry is perfect between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who is attracted to Sebastian (who is again Bynes). She does good too, although her share is small and she does not really affect the rest of the cast in any way. another. James Kirk is great in his small role as true Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is amazing ... they are absolutely believable as twins and more, one could understand by far someone who believes Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast has its place somewhere, and its roles range from short-lived to support, but essentially, they all support the story between Bynes and Tatum, but everyone supports Bynes's amazing performance more or less. She easily wears the film without hesitation and is well worth it. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that shows so much in the trailer, and yet it's not one of those movies. it's not funny anymore. The elements of the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the film. The new director, Andy Fickman, is doing an incredible job on this film. He weaves a potentially complicated scenario, makes it sink naturally and makes everything fall together. The story is loosely based on Shakespeares Twelfth Night, but it is remarkable how much they have managed to translate this modern film. It's apparently completely out of the wall but more accurate than you think in classic comedy. There is not much to say about the drawbacks, except that the last half-hour gets a little longer and also becomes predictable, but that does not change the hilarity of the first half of the movie . Nevertheless, you will laugh to tears and this is one of the funniest movies of the theater right now !!! 9/10
