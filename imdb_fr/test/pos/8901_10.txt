After another raid in an empty village, the Vikings leader Timandahaf misunderstands his adviser Cryptograf's explanation that "fear gives wings to the inhabitants" and thinks that it is fear that makes the villagers fly. They decide to chase the champion of fear in Gaul to learn to fly and make them invincible warriors. Meanwhile, Vitalstatistix's nephew, Justforkix, is sent from Parisium to the Gallic village to become a man and Asterix and Obelix are in charge of training the boy. The stupid son of Cryptograf, Olaf, listens to a conversation with the coward Justforkix with Asterix and Obelix and kidnaps him. Returning to the Viking village, Justforkix meets Abba, Timandahaf's daughter, and they fall in love with each other. Cryptograf, ambitious and Machiavellian, intends to marry his son Olaf with Abba and become powerful. In the end, Asterix realizes that it is not fear that gives wings, it is love. <br /> <br /> When I was a teenager, Asterix was my favorite comic book and I read all the stories of Goscinny and Uderzo. This feature film shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a delightful and wonderful animation. The romance of Justforkix and the beautiful Abba is lovely and the situations in which Asterix and Obelix participate are hilarious. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Asterix e os Vikings" ("Asterix and the Vikings")
