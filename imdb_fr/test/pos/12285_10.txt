It is clear that the value of this film far exceeds the cost associated with the format (mini-dv). In fact, the filmmaker adopts the format and integrates it so well in the scenario that I forgot the fact that I did not see the typical film of 35 millimeters. It has the main attraction of independent films such as Clerks & the work of Robert Rodriguez, combined with a fantastic "new" interpretation of the genre of romantic comedy. "This Is Not A Movie" is an honest film with honest portrayals and a superbly rhythmic story. There is not a point in this movie where I thought a scene could have (or should have been) omitted. On the contrary, the director draws amazing performances from truly talented actors and does so in extremely confining circumstances. From page to page, this film is a dignified and relevant story that strikes on so many levels (creative, technical or other). I highly recommend it to anyone who loves movies or those looking for a little charm in a medium otherwise devoid of charm.
