Forget everything you've read about Mallachi Brothers' "Snakes on a Train" video, especially if it's a negative review. This film is much more fun than the film that it tears obviously: "Snakes in a plane." Frankly, I am surprised that more people are not rhapsodizing about this low budget asylum release. Instead, most of the critics I read are not interesting or critical, except for the usual and stupid idiocy of herd mentality, such that acting was amateur, the action did not match the advertising, and the whole was a terrible loss of time. Of course, this does not help that the title is a clue to the obvious nature of the scam of this movie. In fact, I got the impression that "snakes in a train" surpassed "snakes on a plane" for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> First, the producers used real snakes until the last fifteen minutes, when they replaced them. Fake giant snake heads or a computer generated a super giant snake that consumed a whole train like Amtrak. How many movies does a snake take on a train? As a result, "Snakes on a Train" is the first movie to reach this height. <br /> <br /> Second, this low-budget movie uses horrifying macabre effects. The woman who coughed snake babies - the real ones - was fantastic! The special effects of his forearms torn later in the film were visually enticing! In addition, you can see a little white girl being eaten alive by a snake. She was as cute as she could be, no more than about 10 years old, and she died screaming until the wicked giant serpent head Ol√© engulfed her. Not only children in danger, but children eaten! This is exactly the kind of graphic material you will not find in 99% of theatrical releases in Hollywood. Of course, she was not eaten by a real snake, but subversive thinking counts. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, it's one of those cursed movies where Alma (Julia Ruiz of "That Guy"), the chief female character - no heroin - gets mistreated by her parents because she did not marry the man they recommended. As a result, she is filled with snakes, spits out amounts of green radiator fluid residue, and then squeezes a baby snake. Imagine Medusa, the mythical characters who had snakes for hair, but with snakes in her belly. Her psycho-shaman-type boyfriend collects all the snakes that move her because they are heading to L.A. on a train to see a family member who can put all the snakes back into her and bring her back to normal. Talk about a hit character who performs stomach rollover routines. Prepare for a lot of mud, blood and blood. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the train had only about twenty passengers, not hundreds. Nevertheless, it seems that the Mallachi brothers filmed this above-average horror movie aboard a real train with real snakes and played the swinging motion of the train on the rails. <br /> <br /> Fifth, snakes sneak around you for the first hour by infiltrating the train before they get strange and attack everyone. In other words, it's suspense, suspense, before people die from a snakebite. <br /> <br /> Up to five minutes, when the snake gets bigger than the train that flies off and the train swallows it "is distorted, wonderful and avoided.It does not have the deficit edition from the attention of a big league movie in Hollywood, it's a fantasy about an unhappy Hispanic woman victim of her feminist attitude, opposed to society. <br /> <br /> In total, you have some tricks Fantasy-type gore, suspenseful snakes crawling around the train and a gigantic gigantic snake at the end Incidentally, they get on the train because a group of other Mexicans have bought a train employee and the Mexicans to edge think that the girl is so cute that they left her with her boyfriend for free. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than "Snakes on a Plane" if you want a movie of Horror difficult, produced independently.
