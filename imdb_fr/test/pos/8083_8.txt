"The Vicious Circle" is a very unknown British mystery story. Like many of Hitchcock's films, this is a man accused of a crime he did not commit and who does everything possible to prove it. This time it's Dr. Latimer (John Mills), who finds a murdered German actress in her office. As a good man, the doctor calls Scotland Yard, which turns out to be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing special about this little movie. Still, watching the movie is a fun way to pass the time. I liked following the development of the plot. Good actors are a plus.
