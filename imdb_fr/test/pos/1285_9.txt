I just watched this three times on DVD - once in a "normal" way, once with the scenes in a consecutive order (in this black film of a black film, the beginning, the middle and the end of the story mingling), and once with the director's comments. Pretty incredible. A naked story, told with more talent, energy and substance than most of the big budget extravagant features released today. <br /> <br /> I think it's a much more successful film than the following memento, which introduced me to Nolan. He is eager to see what he is doing with a larger budget (and bigger box office stars) in his next film, Insomnia.
