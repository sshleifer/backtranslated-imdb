One of the most magnificent films ever made. The game of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply remarkable. This is the crown of the career of director Winner, who has often been quoted himself, claiming it was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied several times, but it has never been exceeded. Wildey J. Moore, the firearms maker, has repeatedly stated that the growth of his brand since the mid-1980s can be fully attributed to DW3, and rightly so. It's not just a film, it's an art that many generations will admire and enjoy. Although this film has never been fully appreciated in the United States, it has been hugely successful in Europe and Asia, where it is regularly broadcast in film schools and remains a popular success in student cinemas. all of Europe. Overall, a real classic.
