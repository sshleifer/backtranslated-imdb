It is well known that Irene Dunne could sing a little more than a little. And I think that his talent as an actress can be really understood once a Haydn sonata or a Debussy song has managed to succeed. His instrument is his voice and his manipulation is purely musical. It could attack any part. The only thing she could not do was not to succeed. This film is a perfect example. In this film, she channels Ruth Gordon (because the piece is the thing) is feminine, charming, voluntary and effaced, generous, protective and combative but never pretentious. She manages to remain as credible as Alexander Knox plays another difficult role that he assumes with confidence. The viewer believes in what he sees and cares for. It is refreshing to watch a film that is both entertaining and intellectually stimulating, while pressing the right patriotic buttons. I sincerely hope that all of Dunne's work will one day be on DVD, because it is very difficult to keep such a secret between some insiders.
