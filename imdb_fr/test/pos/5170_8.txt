I just watched it on the Hallmark channel. I was surprised by John Denver! This film was full of clichés, but it was to be expected (a movie made for Christmas on TV, go ahead!) The acting is as good as any other film of the 80s made for the TV movie . As I said before, the story is predictable and clichéd, but it's still good. If you are looking for a beneficial Christmas film, it will certainly scratch your eyes. <br /> <br /> I was also happy to hear that the film was shot in Georgetown, Colorado. It is a true mountain town west of Denver. Very cool because it's my home region. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of John Denver (I always found him very cute) but he was a decent actor. He is very good as the good old boy as he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it, do it. I'm sure it will be again in 2007.
