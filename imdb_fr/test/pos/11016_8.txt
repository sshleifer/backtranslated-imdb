Because it is late and I lack vocabulary, I will describe this film as "beautiful and heartbreaking", imploring the forgiveness of those who fear such clich√©s. Robin Tunney does an amazing job in portraying a young woman struggling with Turret Syndrome - her character was absolutely sincere and compelling, and I will follow her career anywhere because of this film.
