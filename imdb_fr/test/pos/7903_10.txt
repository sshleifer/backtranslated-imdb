Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays Vanaja, age 15, who lives in a rural area with her loving but alcoholic father. If she wants to succeed in life, she will have to overcome the liabilities of low caste and poverty. <br /> <br /> I went to the film while waiting for the performance of an unhappy woman who is crushed by society. This is not what "Vanaja" shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. She will not accept her fate with tears or a simple resignation. She wants to succeed, and it is never clear that she will not succeed, despite the difficulties. <br /> <br /> The acting that Mr. Domalpalli takes from his amateur roles is miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya is outstanding in the leading role and Urmila Dammannagari does outstanding work as Mrs. Rama Devi, the wealthy landowner who is a famous classical dancer. <br /> <br /> In the film, Vanaja learns South Indian classical dance, as she did in real life. I could not say how good Vanaja's dance was compared to Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were mesmerizing. (Do not think about Bollywood, it's a classical dance, it's also very different from ballet, because in ballet, the dancer lifts her heels off the ground.) In the Indian dance Sound, the heel is the main point of contact .) <Br /> <br /> It's a film not to be missed. It will work on DVD, but will be better on a theater screen because the dance will be better highlighted. However, if the DVD is your only option, see it as well. Just make sure to see it.
