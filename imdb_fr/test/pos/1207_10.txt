I saw this movie for the first time in the early 80's on cable. It was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race and a lot of things that I'm sure I missed. However, about a year ago, it came back in my life when I started to enjoy it with my son. He is a little young (9 years old) for a lot of themes, but he understands that dancing hippies is fun to watch and he has the idea that this ending is ironic. Although I can not think of other films like this, he has an autonomous genius that I really like. He also does a unique justice in Central Park. Most musicals are lost to me, one way or another. "Tommy" was above and heavy hand, "Oliver" seemed to be a crowd control on the big screen, "The Wall" was so abstract and indulgent abstract, but listened to "Failure of the Flesh" in Hair That sounds good for our time today, as in the eighties, as in the sixties ... truly timeless.
