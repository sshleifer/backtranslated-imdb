TOUGH LUCK follows a homeless tramp as he interferes with the world of clandestine crime of deception and chaos. Archie (Norman Reedus) has been released from prison and has nothing to lose.

Soon, Ike reveals a strong desire for Archie to murder his mischievous wife, Divana (Dagmara Dominczyk), erotic dancer for the carnival. Things get complicated quickly when Archie falls in love with Divana and warns her of the ploy. They embark on a very torrid affair that leaves little to the imagination of the viewer, after which they quickly develop a plan. Together, they plot to murder Ike, but things do not go as planned. <br /> <br /> I would be lying if I said that this movie did not surprise me. Personally, I was blown away by the quality of this movie. After renting it several years ago, I was expecting another clich√© thriller containing many of the typical elements and themes that are featured in many such films these days. In a few minutes, I became hooked and I found myself very involved in the world of this film. It's the kind of film, a bit like BUFFALO '66, that sucks you in and transports you to style and the feeling of paranoia. It's a film that really succeeds amazingly. One thing that I particularly appreciated is the way the movie describes its characters. The film is not as simple and clear as it appears in the summary of the plot. These are characters that fascinate you and fascinate, including those who are supposed to be the bad guys. In truth, there are no good guys or bad guys in this movie. All the characters have flaws that are realistic and incredibly realistic. There are not a lot of films that can do this job as perfectly as this movie, but it's really a movie style that I like and want to see more movies today. There were a lot of crime movies that looked like that in the early '50s, but there has not been one as striking and unique since! <br /> <br /> As far as defects are concerned, I mostly have minor problems. The film itself is not really original. However, I doubt that most people expect it to be original. The editing style of the movie can also be irritating to some people because it tends to have a shaky camcorder type camera. Even if it did not bother me and I really thought it added to the atmosphere, I'm sure most viewers will not be so captivated by this and might find it generally disconcerting. However, despite its minor flaws, this is one of the most underrated movies of the 2000s. It's so refreshing to be lucky and watch an unknown movie that turns out to be good. It seems that this film is a direct video output, although this film is much better than that. If it had been screened in movie theaters, it would not have won awards or seen many things, but it would have been much more grateful than today. Recognition that this film deserves. TOUGH LUCK is an amazing, entertaining and twisted neo-black thriller with a real sense of class and style, juxtaposing and enough content to make the average viewer more than satisfied.
