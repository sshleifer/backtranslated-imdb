if you have not seen Vijay in "Ghillli", "Gilly" or "Ghillie". go watch it. sensational. its devastating hilarious. I do not know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was serious or not. There are tons of hot guys in this one, look for someone who calls Velu "Maacha". The one with the bright braids, extremely hot. His teeth are bright too. Vijay Rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It's very deep. Look at it, you will not regret it. There are big bursts of laughter in this one. If you do not speak Tamil, learn it. Then you will have all the jokes inside. It's one for the whole family, except maybe violent parts should be ignored. I saw this film about eleven times .... and it counts. <br /> <br /> Wow!
