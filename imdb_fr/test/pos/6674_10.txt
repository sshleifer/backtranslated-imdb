I thought this movie was highly underrated. The subject seems a little strange, and I was startled at first, but once I watched the movie, it did not seem strange to me at all. I was intrigued by all the possibilities offered by the story and I was eager to know how it would end. Once that's over ... I thought about it a long time later. I'm happy with everything from K-Pax, from acting and storytelling to science and psychological issues to the end. This film is not particularly optimistic or happy, even if it makes you laugh occasionally, but I found the film particularly entertaining and stimulating. I own it now and I intend to watch it several times.
