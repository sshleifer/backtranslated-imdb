Night Hunter starts in '1968' as a young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) is unexpected in the family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when another vampire hunter, Sid O'Mack (Sid Haim) betrays his family and the give the vampire, to help Jack in his quest, we give him a book containing the name of each vampire alive or dead, regardless of how we look at it ... Jump to 'June 1995' & Los Angeles, where the now adult Cutter (Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, also credited as co-producer) has only four names in the book, including Argento (Vince Murdocco) and Carmella (Sophia Crawford). Together, they are the last of the American vampires. While they all dine in a restaurant, Cutter blocks the party and kills them, job well done? Bad King of Vampires Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest) calls the last four vampires from around the world: French Tournier (Maria Ford), Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmer (David 'Shark Fralick) and Sangster (Vincent Klyn) for find Cutter and kill him. Meanwhile, detective Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no idea. A curious journalist by the name of Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith) takes part in the battle between Cutter and the Vampires on which rests the fate of the Earth! <br /> Directed by Rick Jacobson I thought Night Hunter was a fun way to spend 85 minutes. The scenario of William C. Martell mixes martial arts and horror with some success. It moves at a steady pace and at least is never boring. Fortunately, he does not seem to take himself too seriously. The character names that refer to other horror movie directors / actors are a bit sticky. Some might be surprised at how much Night Hunter looks like Blade (1998), when it was made a few years ago, this long, skinny coat, dressed as a vampire hunter who happens to be an expert in martial arts, the scene taking place in a discotheque and the innocent woman attracted by the world of vampires. Night Hunter does not really respect the law on traditional vampire movies, for example, the sunlight only irritates their eyes, they can only reproduce on a solar eclipse (why?), The stakes in the heart and the Garlic are not good for killing a vampire in Night Hunter, it's breaking the neck. I could have done with a little more horror and a little more blood, because that leans more towards the side of the martial arts. The dialogue is appropriately corny and the characters are pretty silly enough. <br /> <br /> The director Jacobson does his best to spoil the film, the action scenes are correct, but they lack something weird. reason, every time a sequence of action occurs, it constantly shakes its camera, it's as if the camera was placed on a full cycle of washing machine! Hey Rick, buddy, it's not smart or elegant, it's irritating and annoying. The gore is disappointing with some bloody gunshot wounds and a few splashes of blood, breaking the vampire's neck unfortunately does not cause a lot of blood. <br /> <br /> With a budget that probably does not represent much, Night Hunter does it competently all along. The acting game was bad most of the time and what's going on with "The Dragon" in Don "The Dragon" Wilson? Has he legally changed his name? Does he sign the Wilson 'Don' The Dragon 'checks ?! Does he receive mail with this name? I think I could do something like this, from now on I want to be known by the pseudonym Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews ... <br /> <br /> Night Hunter is one of those movies shit that transcends its limits and its horror become a pure entertainment in gold. If you like fun movies, then Night Hunter could be for you, if you're looking for thrills for a big budget in a similar vein (Vampire's, veins & blood get it?), Then Blade & its sequels would likely be best choice. Damn it, I loved it, so follow me.
