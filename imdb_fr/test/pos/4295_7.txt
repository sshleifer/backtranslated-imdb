A well written scenario. A moving story showing the best of middle class English. Some great actors Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of the best British actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I did not know, but to her credit, she does a great job playing ******'s wife. The director, Julian Fellowes, did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film a meaty scenario. He did not dramatize his portrait of the English middle class. The rhythm of the movies does not weaken even if it is not a film rhythmic in the face. A good twist in the plot, which is not predictable A charming English country village. I really enjoyed this movie. The places were also very well chosen. If you like relationship movies, it's a movie to watch. Better to have tissues ready!
