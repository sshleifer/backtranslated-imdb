This lost and interesting film (written by Terence Malick) features Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest, two wacky southern brothers, in search of a seafood restaurant. Margot Kidder has never been so pretty and Forrest should have been to be nominated. Originally called The Dion Brothers, this light film with a violent end is pure happiness! <br /> <br /> Where is this movie? I have been looking for him for 30 years. Keach was still great at the time and I'm surprised he does not have more worship (maybe yes). These guys are a crack-up with more ambition than brains, but totally adorable guys !. A 7 out of 10. If you can find it somewhere, you'll have fun.
