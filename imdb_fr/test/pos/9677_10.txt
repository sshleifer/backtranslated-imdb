When I saw this show for the first time, I was 9 years old and it immediately caught my attention when Stewie tried to call Lois on the phone at the hotel. I laughed and continued to watch. Once the episode was over, I wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. This is different from Simpsons and other shows on, for example, Cartoon Network, because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it's for good reason on TV-14. The fast movie cuts after each line of typing and the cute and amusing movements and behaviors of the characters make it special. The talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and voice of many characters in the series. A good theme song, and a crazy family that always has something funny, make it my favorite drawing with Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Go see that, it's funny.
