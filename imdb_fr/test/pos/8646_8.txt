After two brief scenes that initially seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired beauty, obviously rich, in the back of a limousine. His driver stops at a strange spot on Mulholland Drive, a winding, densely wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. While her driver and another man sitting in the passenger seat turn to kill her, two racing cars coming from the opposite direction crash into the limousine. Only the black haired woman survives. She climbs the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in the apartment of a woman on vacation. Shortly after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the niece of the woman on vacation, comes to the apartment and runs into the black-haired woman, who is now suffering from amnesia. Most of the first part of the film is Betty and the black haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her bag by hand. This is interspersed with strangely surrealistic threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional raids into a country of thugs and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It may sound a little complicated and disjointed, but it's not half. The film is constructed so that meaning can always be interpreted. It is basically guaranteed that you will not understand this movie and that you will not have much confidence to arrive at your own interpretation the first time. Even if you have a lot of experience with similar movies - such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004) - you may not understand it second-look , is. The studio was aware of this in that it asked director David Lynch to write "10 clues to unlock this thriller" and placed it on the back of the insertion of the chapter list in the DVD. Lynch being of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. It is not useful to try to understand from the outset that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a long time to determine which parts are supposed to be "real" and there is a complex nesting of flashback in some sections, with only contextual clues indicating that it is flashback. <br /> <br /> But is the film worth watching or trying to understand? It obviously depends on your tastes. On a superficial level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, even if it will tend to appear a little slow and too disjointed for some spectators. But these qualities, and many other surreal aspects of the film, are typical of Lynch. A privileged Lynchian moment is the old couple at first, smiling oddly, almost as if they were ghost extraterrestrials trying to get noticed. If you know this style and like it, you'll find a lot to like about it, although in many ways Mulholland Drive is quite discreet for Lynch. It should also be noted, for viewers who will be primarily interested or who appreciate it as much as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive presents a hot lesbian scene. It's not free, although I have no problem with the free, but rather is an important hinge in the film. <br /> <br /> Like all of Lynch's films, it's easy to marvel at his unique approach to every aspect of the film's art and attention to detail. Any serious film student (including "wheelchair students" / "movie buffs") should study Mulholland Drive; many will like it. Lynch does not let anything pass without manipulation. It includes brilliant color combinations (such as the plethora of reds and pinks) with significant symbolism. He makes unusual use of the sound, such as the sound of the phone ringing in the partition section that follows it (when Betty arrives for the first time at the airport). He asks his actors to deliver their lines in a multitude of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic strange pauses. It reveals his strange and surprising sense of humor, such as the name "Winkie's" and the sign "Hot Dogs - made for Pinks" which provides a clue to the symbolism of color. <br /> <br /> Lynch's attention to detail in the production design provides important and subtle clues throughout the film to help understand the meaning. It is interesting to note that Lynch apparently even claims that DVD programming is unusual - there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the movie in real time, fast forward, or go back to specific points. <br /> <br /> If surrealism and the veiled meaning of the film appeal to you, or if you just like it. "puzzles", so Mulholland Drive is definitely worth seeing for this aspect. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad and generalized level. I will not tell the standard interpretation here - it's worth doing a search, but only after seeing the film several times and drawing your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written about the film and its interpretations; there are even websites dedicated to it. <br /> <br /> For my money, though, even though I usually like Lynch and find a lot of interesting things about Mulholland Drive, it's not quite a 10 for me, less not yet (I have the feeling that my score could still increase in later views). For me, however, the "twist" aspect of the film is much better done in other works such as The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive attracts me more for its surreal surface touches, but the plot does not present them as well as some of Lynch's other films. <br /> <br /> Still, Mulholland Drive is definitely recommended to the good crowd. If you are serious about cinema and do not think about what you are watching (as if those two did not necessarily coincide), you should not miss this one.
