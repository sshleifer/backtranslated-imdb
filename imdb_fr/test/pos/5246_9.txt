John Wayne's first role just impressed me. Like a television mailbox on AMC, I had to check and make sure I had the right date. Indeed, this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm wide screen process. On top of that, it contains some of the most realistic and realistic images of the trek in the west that I saw. Trolleys, men and animals really came down at the end of a cliff by a rope. The trees are cut by beefy men - and beefy women - so that the train can move more than 10 feet. The Indians are not the "handsome boys" of the townspeople who portrayed them later; they are the real deal. A river crossing in the pouring rain is so realistic that it must be real (in fact, I understand that the director Raoul Walsh almost lost the entire cast during this sequence). I could feel the wet cloth. Every day is an agony. The various subplots are forgotten, but the film as a whole is not. I can not think of another title that could beat The Big Trail by evoking a sense of living history on the Oregon Trail. Bravo.
