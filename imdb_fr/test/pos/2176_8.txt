I guess this is the first time I see a Roscoe movie 'Fatty' Arbuckle. I really loved him in his role as butcher. The way he moves is very funny in my opinion, for example the way he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expressions really suit the role he plays, for example the way he winks at the audience. But we could add that it was probably not too difficult. Anyway, I think he would have deserved a longer career. As you probably know, he was ruined by greedy journalists who earned money by making false accusations that he was involved in a scandal. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very important. In the first half, Fatty and Alum are employed in a store and rivals for Almondine's affection. After an intense food battle, Almondine is sent to a girls' school by her father, the store's owner. (This is the beginning of the second half). Fatty and Alum both enter the school trail, and the battle for Almondine continues. (Some character names are different in the version I've seen.It seems that, for some reason, they replaced the original title cards with new ones.) <br /> <br /> There has a lot of tacky gags like food fights and stunts, but they are well made in my opinion. And there are some gags that I really liked, for example how do they make the dog run the pepper mill (or is it a coffee grinder?), Or the scene where Fatty puts on a coat although that's not either obviously not necessary, or when Miss Teachem the head of the girls' school gives Fatty a spanking, and he spanks her on the back. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is also funny as part of his first film; a good addition to the distribution. In the first period, he is a shopkeeper, in the second part, he supports Alum in his fight for Almondine. I loved his acrobatics, for example when Fatty pushes him from one room of the school to another, he does not show a simple hush, but lands on the hands and the head and makes a small pirouette. Pay attention to a scene in the fight for food: Alun throws him a sack of flour, but he misses and strikes the shop owner instead. That makes Buster laugh, which must be a rarity, because it always displays a neutral expression (which - as you probably already know - has earned it the nickname "Big face of stone"). (Another note: Alum John, who plays Alum, was the nephew of "Fatty" Arbuckle and later became famous for the "Fuzzy" role he played in many westerns.) <br /> < I do not like this one as much as I like, for example, "One Week" and "The Balloonatic" (movies that Buster shot later, without "Fatty"). And it did not make me laugh often with laughter - but it made me smile a lot, so I gave him eight points.
