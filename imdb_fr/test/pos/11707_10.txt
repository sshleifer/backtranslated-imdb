It's worth it: if not for the work of Mick Molloy, then for Judith Lucy. She brings her usual classic style of unbridled homeless to the role and steals the show in pieces. <br /> <br /> IMHO: I'm not really an autograph hunter, but I collected 3. The first is Samuel L. Jackson, the other 2 are in this movie: Tony Martin and Mick Molloy . Altho Martin makes only one appearance, Molloy not only played the main role, he also co-wrote and co-produced this film. I've been a fan of their band for years (apparently, I was the only one to laugh when urinating in the first episode of the short film The Mick Molloy Show), so I went to that with great expectations. I am happy to say that I have not been disappointed. With Mick working a lot on this subject, his usual trademarks are legion. Phrases such as "blow your ass" and "these bowls are a mansion" are omnipresent, as many Winnie Blues are sucked. It's also the kind of stupid and original story you expect from someone like him. It sounds like one of those jerky American sports comedies where they form a baseball team with prisoners or something of the sort. But rather than trying to make interesting a terrifying American sport like baseball or American football, this film focuses on a sport usually left to the Gray Army: Lawn Bowls. But the main difference between this comedy and other sports comedies is that it's actually very, very funny. What's even better is that even though the subject of this film is a young kid who joins an old popular game, it's never insulting to the elderly, and it's never sneaky. We're having a blast at the genuine 1972 prices. Mick is awesome in the first real acting role in which I've ever seen him, just like Judith Lucy and the rest of the cast, but most of them have had a lot of practice ... It's the best Australian comedy I know. I have seen for a long time. Go see it and discover the joys of Lawn Bowls! <br /> <br /> IS A LITTLE LOVED: Major League? <br /> <br /> SCORE: 8/10
