I finally got the excellent Sazuma DVD of this movie full of interesting extras. I read a lot about it and unfortunately I missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. It's not exactly what you expect, but it's worth watching if you like strange and unique movies. I much prefer to watch it again than all the recent horror movies that have been thrown up in Hollywood these days. For me, what is bad for the experience is that some music signals are obsolete and rely too much on cheap synth sounds. For me, all these tonal / harmonic elements of the score could have been highlighted and replaced by the excellent sound design of David Kristians. But this is only my opinion. Otherwise, it is a bold and edgy image with meditative and poetic elements welcome, like the fading of the photographic sequence that is beautiful. I look forward to seeing Ascension and congratulating Mitch and Karim for their efforts in producing unconventional cinema. They are a great source of inspiration for my own short film production.
