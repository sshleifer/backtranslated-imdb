Greta Garbo plays in "Anna Christie", a "talkie" from the MGM dating back to the early 1930s, the first time "Garbo Talks". 'Anna Christie' is a powerful film but not for everyone. The film is shot as a play, short in set and cinematography, long in dialogues and dramatic descriptions. Eugene O'Neil, author of the play "Anna Christie", is known for his dark work. Anna Christie, the character of Garbo, is a dark figure with a tortured past. <br /> <br /> The sound quality on the DVD was mediocre. The problem is that George F. Marion, who plays the role of Anna's father, Chris Christofferson, is difficult to understand verbally. Marion gives a good performance as drunken old sailors who sink into insanity with her devil's fixation "devil's sea". But his dialogue is written with a very strong Swedish accent, true to the original O'Neils play. Marie Dressler's dialogue as Marthy Owens is also difficult to understand. Dressler cryptically portrays a drunken old woman, a "wharf rat". His dialogue is also faithful to O'Neils' original play, as is Charles Bickford in the role of Irish seamans, Matt Burke, who sues Anna in a difficult relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the films is Greta Garbo. As a victim of neglect and abuse, she leads a heartbreaking life and leads to a life of prostitution. Garbo was a huge star at the time and was considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Here, his eyes are not glamorous, he is tortured. The posture of his body almost doubles in agony. She rubs her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. Garbo conveys to the viewer these anguished feelings to convince us of his misery. <br /> <br /> It's a dark subject and Garbo gives it life. It's not a light meal, not fun, not for everyone. "Anna Christie", it is a strong emotion that springs from the depths to be examined, it is a tour of hell.
