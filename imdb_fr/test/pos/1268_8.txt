There are two things I noticed in this movie. (This is not a spoiler, it's just a narration error.) When Cole takes Bill to his first B & E, he finds the "box". As soon as Cole finds him, he says, "The box, everyone has a box." A minute later, just before throwing the contents on the floor, he says, "We're really lucky, you do not see them often." <br /> <br /> Observation # 2 (Spoiler alert!) I had to look at the thing three times, I could not understand two things. Then I looked at the timeline and saw that they had backtracks from it to the previous one during the time changes. So, at times, we actually looked at three different times in about a minute of time on the wall. <br /> <br /> It was a good thing, because I did not know how many times I could look at it before returning it to. Netflix. <br /> <br /> Color me obsessively.
