Surprisingly good police drama of the type "Average Streets". Prefigured elements of "Goodfellas" and "Casino". The first big role of Joe Pesci. Smart dialogue. I think the Maltese guide gives him a bomb index. I can only guess that no one has bothered to watch it. <br /> <br /> Saw this at the Tarantino Film Festival and he said that Scorsese had used many of these actors in Raging Bull.
