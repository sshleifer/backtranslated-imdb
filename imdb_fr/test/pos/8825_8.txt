Looking at this PPV, I was expecting a lot, since Smackdown is the best show in the WWE, it's a very good PPV since it's the last before Wrestlemania. <br /> FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W / MELINA IN A 6-MEN TEAM GAME A good way to start the game. It started a little slowly at first, but later, the pace accelerated and the match became more exciting and entertaining. Benoit takes the plunge and asks Joey Mercury to break free to get a win for the Hardy Boys and himself. 6/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND GAME - GREGORY HELMS {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBLE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG AT A WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CRUISE GUEST COMPETITION I'm a huge fan of Cruiserweights and I'm never disappointed to watch it, especially during this game. Chavo Guerrero launches Jimmy Wang Yang on Frog Splash to win and become the new WWE Cruiserweight Champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD GAME - FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN It was not really a wrestling match, it was more of a comedy match, even though it was not a clear fight, it always amused me with fun antics. Finlay means the little boogeyman with the shillaeg to get the win. Boogeyman does not deserve to be on a PPV, and does not deserve to be in the WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH MATCH - KANE VS. KING BOOKER W / SHARMELL It was a surprisingly good match, I thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out to be a real competitive wrestling contest. Hat for two men, shooting a very entertaining match. Kane wins after Chokeslam on King Booker. 6/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH - PAUL London & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO WITH CHERRY FOR TEAM WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS This is not really a good match, but Deuce & Domino need more training to fight. London & Kendrick retain their titles after Kendrick has a cumulative record on one of the guys for the win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH - BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. Mr KENNEDY FOR THE ECW CHAMPIONSHIP Mr Kennedy attacks Lashley from behind, before the start of the match. It was a good match, but not really good. Lashley & Kennedy have a little chemistry, but not enough to make a good match. Kennedy wins by DQ, after Lashley nailed him with a chair, then assaulted him with the chair to the entrance area. Lashley still retains his title. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN CENA & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the biggest team match I have ever seen. Hats off to all these men {yes even Batista} for having made a match as close as a classic of the main event 5 stars. These 4 men played very well in the match because it was a very interesting and entertaining team match. Batista turns his back on Undertaker and leaves him, prompting Michaels to choose Sweet Chin Music, then Cena to sign an F-U to win. 7/10 <br /> <br /> I do not know why everyone says that this PPV is not good enough or that it is boring, I just do not understand. This is an excellent PPV that Smackdown always provides. An excellent PPV. <br /> <br /> Overall, I will give him 8/10 and a B +
