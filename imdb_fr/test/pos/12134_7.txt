Has anyone ever read or heard comments from Scorsese or David Chase (executive producer of Soprano) about "Death Collector / Family Enforcer"? I bought the DVD after not having seen it for a while on the cable (about 20 years old), but after seeing "Goodfellas" and all the "Sopranos" running so far. In retrospect, the two guys must have seen Death Collector / Family Enforcer and absorbed its flavor, perhaps inspiring the tone of their masterpieces, which are the opposite of the godfather's romantic trilogy. Being a guy from Jersey, it's interesting to see how Jersey's meadows have evolved since the mid-70's. It's not the swampy dump that he was, although it sometimes happens that a body s' introduce into local waterways. In addition, it is a bit bittersweet to see a newly built World Trade Center in the other side of the river in the opening and closing scenes. Who could have imagined?
