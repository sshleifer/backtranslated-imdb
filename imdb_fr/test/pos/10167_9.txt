A film that tends to be buried under prejudices and preconceived ideas - it's a remake! Doris Day is in! She sings! - Hitchcock's second attempt in "The man who knew too much" is his most underrated film and is undoubtedly a masterpiece in its own right. <br /> <br /> This is, in more ways than one, Doris The movie of the day. Not only does she achieve the best performance of her career, more than standing up to James Stewart, but the entire film is subtly structured around her character rather than her own. After all, it's a film in which music is both a motive and a plot. What better cast than the most popular singer of her generation? Consider: Day's Jo McKenna abandoned her career on the stage to settle with her husband and raise their son. This seems like a mutual decision, and she does not seem to be unhappy. But look at how Stewart is teasing her in front of her concerns about Louis Bernard, hinting that she is jealous that Bernard is not asking him about his career. This is clearly a recurring joke between them - she responds with a "har-har-har-har" which denotes the familiarity of this gag, suggesting that she has some latent resentment about her imprisonment and that they both realize it. After their son is kidnapped, Stewart insists on doping her before giving him the news. It is a cruel scene, brilliantly interpreted by the two actors, which illustrates the imbalance of powers in their marriage: it seeks to control and control its reactions, essentially using its professional knowledge to suppress its voice in marriage, just as its medical course. Deleted her singing career. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the Ambrose Chapel testifies to the power of this voice, while it must dominate in its clarity and volume well trained to merge into the congregation of women traffickers - they almost warn what she will become if she continues to suppress her talent. At Albert Hall, it's his need to scream, to exert his impressive lungs, that saves a man's life, and in the embassy finale, it's his talent and reputation that allow him to locate his son. On the other hand, all of Stewart's male activity is counter-productive: his visit to the taxidermist is deadlocked, he is left behind at the church while all the others go to Albert Hall, and his efforts fail. to kill the murderer. thus depriving the police of potentially useful information. It is only when his action is joined to the voice of his wife, during Hank's rescue from the embassy, ​​that he actually succeeds in doing something useful. <br /> <br /> Far from being forced by the film to give Day a "Que Sera Sera" is the first musical instrument of the film, prefiguring the nightmare that is about to engulf the McKennas; "the future does not belong to us to see" indeed. It also sets the stage for the finale, in which the close bond between mother and son through the music will allow Doris to save the day. <br /> <br /> The film's most famous sequence puts music at the center of its concerns - the speeding up of the assassination attempt at Albert Hall. This long, wordless sequence is perhaps the most extraordinary thing Hitchcock has ever done in a film, the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told in a visual way. We see people conducting conversations in this sequence, but we never hear a word they say. We do not need - the pictures say everything. This is also his most exquisite sequence of suspense, the pieces moving slowly as the music is built. The editing is incredibly tight, perfectly suited to the music. There is no frame irrelevant - anything that does not directly concern the assassination gives the viewer an idea of ​​the environment, the geography in which all this is played out. This is slowly building, but in the end the suspense is almost unbearable. When Jo screams, it's not only a relief for her, but for the audience. <br /> <br /> Ambrose Chapel's sequence is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has had to attend a non-conformist church stick-in-the-mud service. The sequence Embassy seems a little flat after that of Albert Hall who preceded it during the first viewing, but the second time seems actually more effective, the final march taking advantage of the magnificent use of the song Day in the background , recalling the music as ambient noise in the "rear window". The score as a whole is subtle, allowing the music of the sources on the screen to be effectively highlighted. <br /> <br /> Bernard Miles is a discreet villain, a bit mundane, but with a dry mind. He is dominated by Brenda de Banzie in the role of his wife, who stands out between sinister and friendly. Just look at the way she smokes a cigarette while her husband is preparing the murderer - her position is that of a pure gangster, resembling outside of central England, but she clearly has a soft side and perhaps maternal feelings towards Hank. <br /> <Stewart is excellent, although if Hitchcock always called him "Everyman", as the director's daughter seems to think, it confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart embodies a hypocritical intellectual who adheres to fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who mistreats his girlfriend in Rear Window and an obsessive necrophile in Vertigo. The day is nothing short of phenomenal. Just watch her reaction to the news that her son was kidnapped - she never exaggerates anything, but she does not sell it either. It's one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. He never lets us forget what are the issues for the McKennas; they feel the most fully human of all his central characters.
