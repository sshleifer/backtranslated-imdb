The above summary is not really a slam against this film because the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar ("The Saint") meets a woman in distress and helps her. He also comes to the rescue of a police detective accused of accepting a bribe. On the way, he meets interesting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearly" Gates) and when he reveals this mystery not particularly convincing (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and everything just great! George Sanders is once again the great British clever accomplice and once again manages to make an excellent B-detective series movie. Nothing particularly special, but a familiar and airy product that will surely please fans of the genre.
