Paul Naschy, as a ghostly guardian of security, is more frightening than most of his polite werewolves. The story is not unknown, a bunch of kids are going to party in an abandoned school. The fact is that one of the fathers of these children did the same thing years ago, but he is now dead and the last group of children seems to be reliving an event 23 years ago. It's pretty good for movies of this type, and there's a mysterious air about what's going on because apparently what happened to the kids is a little mysterious and maybe the truth has not been revealed . So no, not just your standard part. It goes well enough and you do not lose interest, as many movies do. The strange story is compelling enough to interest you as well, and there is a suspense that is lacking in many movies these days. . The end is pretty steep and I guess it stays mostly to your imagination, but again, it does not exceed its reception either. 7 out of 10, check it.
