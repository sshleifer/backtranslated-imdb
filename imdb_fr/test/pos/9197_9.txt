It's probably one of those much commented but undiscovered movies ... It's probably a masterpiece of Spanish cinema, like that of Bu√±uel. "15 days with you" could be the best "now and them" revisited other films from a long time ago: it could be "Midnight cowboy" but it could also be "The lovers of the Pont Neuf" -spot- look (but the most realistic) "trainspotting". This difficult story has room for humor, love and obviously dramatic sense. In the new Spanish social cinema, this little diamond could be the resurrection of Italian neo-realism and Ken Loach's best films. <br /> <br /> Probably the best movie I've discovered in the last 10 years.
