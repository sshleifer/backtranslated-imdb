The imagery controls this film. The characters, although interesting, end up setting themselves back. The first scene I remember is a framed black and white photo of the ocean, which then opens full screen and color. The water bubbles give way to a small coffin that breaks the surface. The theme of the film is that death can be accepted and introduced into the realm of the living. <br /> <br /> Water as ultimate consciousness, as a tool of God, is used to force people to put their "houses" in order (day of judgment). The dead must be taken into account and transported to a better place. Anything that remains unresolved or unresolved will be washed away. There is no clash with the past, a hidden memory of what was. <br /> <br /> This film has been compared to O, Brother Where Art Thou, and the threat of water and its use as a purifying force. similar to this film. What is different in this movie is that the arrival of water is knowable and, again, the focus is on what needs to be done with the here and now. <br /> <br /> I agree that some scenes recall a work by David Lynch. Take, for example, the dinner segment with the waitress with deep voices and androgynous. The setting and the strange character provide the same surrealist feel as the back presenter in the Fire Starter scene. The difference is that Lynch attacks us with the image to express the psychological processes of a troubled character, while this film seems to use surreal elements to create a moral message. Men in black suits can not have anything they want - they must be patient and accept what is available.
