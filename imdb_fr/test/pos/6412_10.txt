This film, one of the best I've ever seen, talks about incommunicability. He plunges into a livid Taipei, stained with cold colors, where the rain falls incessantly; a DAMP world. He presents the story of two people living in this world, a man and a woman. a coincidence, or destiny, connects their existences, but they can not open to one another with words. The characters are a reflection of our society's difficulty in interpersonal relationships. An incommunicability which here is pushed to the extreme limit. all the characters exchange only a few words during the film, the dialogues are almost absent and, when certain words are pronounced, they are often weak and empty, far from describing the real feelings of the people. Thus, the progression of the story, the revelation of the feelings of the character are developed (brilliant idea!) By musical digressions, apparently meaningless, which stain the film. The unfolding of the sentimental event and the drama of the protagonist woman lead us to a magnificent, highly symbolic end. A film totally different from the usual one, an intelligent realization realized by a director of great talent. PS. Forgive me for my bad grammar !!
