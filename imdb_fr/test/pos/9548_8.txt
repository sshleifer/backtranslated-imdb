I saw the film in Izmir as the closing film of the Izmir Film Festival. I did not know anything about it but for now I'm glad I did not refuse the chance to see Ding-a-ling-less! It's one of the funniest movies I've ever watched and believe me, I've seen zillions of movies !! (I'm a movie critic!) Intelligent scripting and dialogue ... Smart details ... What else can I say? An independent masterpiece with a unique style of humor ... You can not be surprised at what he is capable of now. Ding-a-ling was shot five years ago and I'm sure director Onur Tukel is more mature now. I have heard that his next feature film is a political satire and I can not wait to see him with his previous books such as "House of Pancakes" ...
