I just watched this one again. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had a lot of fun. That's why this kind of movies is meant to entertain people and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does it for me and for everyone I've shown it to. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a group of teenagers in a van fleeing in a group of escaped convicts who took over an old farm. When a scarecrow (who is in fact a demon, I think) is disturbed, he revives and revives the corpses of local cemeteries. This leads our heroes to escape and land in the arms of two crazy killers who are torturing some people in a grocery store in a small town. Soon, it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie! Different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) at a very fast pace and good music, there was always something going on and you never get bored! Of course, it's cheap, but you can say that this film required a lot of care and hard work. I read other reviews and all I can say is that these people misunderstood. If you want 35mm Full Moon plush toys, or if you like modern things like Urban Legend, then please let that go. If you like low-budget movies like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I advise you to buy it now. <br /> <br /> Makeup and gore are very good, the acting is sometimes uneven, but overall It's pretty good and editing is very impressive. There is enough in this one to fill two more films! It's actually one of the best serial movies I've seen in a long time.
