This film won a special award in Cannes for its acting and it is not difficult to understand why. (Some spoilers - but to finish, you will have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of the war between Russia and Germany during the Second World War, Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris ( Aleksei Batalov), but they are uncomfortable when she learns that he enlisted in the army. Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him that she loves him. Boris is touched but his ultimate destiny remains unknown to Veronika or his family. Mark, Boris's cousin, violates Veronika who feels compelled to marry her. Degraded and lowered by the coward Mark, Veronika clings to the hope that one day Boris will come back. Superb camera work and beautiful scenery by director Kalatozov. (For those interested in filmmaking, another Kalatozov film, I AM CUBA, contains at least two superb sets, one of which is a long follow-up plan that begins with a funeral procession in the streets of La Havana, and rises to two floors in a cigar factory., Follows the procession through the window and follows the procession on a long and long avenue, all without cutting.) A superb acting, especially from Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris's cloak), made even more moving by the pure under-denouement. A devastating romantic film with a breathtaking performance by Samoilova. (This film is frequently associated with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)
