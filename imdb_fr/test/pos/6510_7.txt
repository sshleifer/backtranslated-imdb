Okay, I think we all agree that Michael Jackson was the low point. <br /> <br /> And the special effects too. But, please keep in mind that it was not a big budget movie, all right? Not all movies get the same budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars. <br /> <br /> However, I thought it was pretty funny. B-? In my opinion, nothing would waste your time. <br /> <br /> The parodies are always fun to watch, and it's not because it's not a big budget that it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good movie, even if it was weak at times. <br /> <br /> I hope this comment will help. ~ Angela
