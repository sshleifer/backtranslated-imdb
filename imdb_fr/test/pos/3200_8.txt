This short film (and the poem that composes it) is one of the greatest metaphors I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> The poem is beautiful! This exactly describes the feeling of a person who pursues a dream and can not achieve it? but he also says how to fill it! I see "The story of the cat and the moon" as a beautiful metaphor for human relationships, passion and love. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's also a good job. Although very simple, the animation, in black and white, gives an allegory tone to the film and its message, but also to tenderness and nostalgia. <br /> <br /> In addiction, music also contributes to this poetic feeling. <br /> <br /> "Nothing else counts! I'll wait! She'll come when she can or when she wants!"
