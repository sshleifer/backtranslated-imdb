I'm surprised that Memento (which is an excellent film) is so well considered in the Top 250 and that it does not even appear! What is that?? To be honest - when this movie ended, my knee-jerk reaction was that this movie was better than Memento. After the euphoria of the fabulous end disappeared, I concluded that they were equal in excellence. I do not understand why he is not part of the Top 50 with Memento. I'll try to guess that (sadly) it's because it's in black and white or because (still sadly) the characters all have British accents ... unfortunately, that's no reason not to enjoy such a movie. <br /> <br /> I tell you that if you like Memento, you will love it too. Brilliant!
