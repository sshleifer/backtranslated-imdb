Not bad, but could be much better, also seems to follow a basic diet for the crime drama. You have Sandra Bullock as a policeman who has trouble working with others, you have placed with a new partner. There is a closed case, but a cop is still working on it, and there are so many lines in the film that it makes you want to shout. <br /> <br /> However, if you can look beyond the stereotypical elements, there is good movie hiding below. It's striking and the subplots worked for me. Well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase.
