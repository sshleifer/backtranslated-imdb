It's one of the darkest and most heartbreaking films Bergman ever saw. I also think it's one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does for human souls. <br /> <br /> The couple of musicians who left a big city for an isolated island living as peasants, find themselves capable of indescribable and shameful acts that it would have been impossible for them to imagine, then that they were fighting to survive the horrible reality of the war. They betray their souls, their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to survive just another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow shine as usual as a lost, confused and terrified couple caught in the middle of a civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
