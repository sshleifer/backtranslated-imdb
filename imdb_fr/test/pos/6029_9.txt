This film is a little slow at first, for about 10 minutes. But once you have started, you can not turn it off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best roles and are excellent at acting. You will never guess who the killer is. I gave a 9 to this film, because in some places, Adam Beach needs to talk a little bit to hear what he says. <br /> <br /> 9/10
