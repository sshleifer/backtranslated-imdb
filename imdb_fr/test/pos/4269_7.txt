Where are we going from here? this is the main issue of this film. And do not get me wrong, "mainly ETC". The effort made in 2003 by director john jansen raises many more questions than he answers, but none as poignant or powerful as this one. <br /> <br /> The film plays like an ongoing conversation between you and your university friends, and I'm sure many of the issues raised by the main characters you will recognize during your own debauchery parties drunk. However, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer. Questions are asked ?? everything from banal to deep ?? but Jansen skillfully obliges his audience to examine and answer these questions ourselves, without the help of the characters. <br /> <br /> The first side opens up to an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of non-linear segments to present us. to the main characters. We meet them on the morning of April 8, 1994 ?? the day kurt cobain committed suicide. And it is Cobain's death and the journey in his wake two days later in Seattle, which serve as a backdrop to the film. By exploring Cobain's life, music and death, the characters try - more or less successfully - to understand and cope with their own lives. <br /> <br /> certain aspects of the film are what you are We can expect an independent film on a small budget: the performances vary from mediocre to exceptional, the strongest performances coming from Jessica Scott (holly) and Noel Wood (Daniel); some dialogues are certainly a little stiff, but are never completely lost; and there are some minor sound problems, especially once on the road, which sometimes make it difficult to follow the action on the screen. <br /> <br /> but despite its flaws, "mainly ETC". is a solid and deeply moving film. In the midst of captivating poignant moments, ridiculous humor and intimate troubles, jansen cleverly combines all the character's sons and illuminates his own struggles while making them accessible and appealing to us. and because we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify with the issues and problems with which they struggle, and we can look back and remember where we were today. there in 1994. Many people have changed the world. <br /> <br /> While jansen boasts about the writing, editing and making of the film, his photographs must also be commended. With a strange eye and an amazing ability to capture and attract us to each of the characters' worlds, jansen managed to produce shot after shot, shot after shot, long after the credits. <br /> <br /> And no criticism of this movie would be complete without a nod to the soundtrack. the music of this film has an extraordinary effect; sometimes, subtly highlighting the action, other times, occupying a central place, without ever hindering or deteriorating into a kitsch video clip. the soundtrack plays like the biggest ultimate hits, although I guess the label probably would not please the director. <br /> <br /> The new edition of the double DVD archive features deleted scenes, movie trailers, music videos and documentary cobain. the deleted scenes give an overview of the film's realization through alternative opening and closing sequences, and it is certainly a treat to have the rare and beautiful Raining Kind video available. the documentary cobain is correct, although it is a little less resistant to wear, and more complete documentaries are certainly available for hardcore fans. Visibly absent is a director's commentary, and I can not help but wonder if Jansen intends to republish it at some point with this tasty piece attached. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the next time you're looking for a hard work from a talented filmmaker, I recommend you get involved.
