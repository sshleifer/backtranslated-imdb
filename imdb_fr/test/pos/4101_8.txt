The story of a classical story is in the music of Burt Bacharach and in the lyrics of Hal David. The actors look like real people in this fairy tale where the outside world meets the mystic Shangra-la. It's a pleasure to watch Bobby Van, whose game reminds me of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke), who still manages to carry the gravitas in his roles. <br /> <br /> The surprise here is Charles Boyer as a great senior lama. Who would have known? <br /> <br /> Leading actors, including Michael York and Olivia Hussey, make this work a guardian for those of us who cherish people.
