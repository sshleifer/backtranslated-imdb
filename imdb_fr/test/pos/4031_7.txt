This movie is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien movie (which is excellent). He borrows the main premise: a man was poisoned and spends the rest of the movie looking for his killer. But I like the fact that the writers have chosen an English teacher, instead of a private cock, as protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the movie moves fast enough to keep you awake. But what March this movie is a strange dated quality about him (probably because of the original music score of the appalling 80s) combined with a sense of "black" affect. Dennis Quaid smiles inexplicably throughout the film, but he is still convincing. Meg Ryan is doing well as an interested / loving person. When the film gets spoiled, it's when Dex (the teacher) meets the British bodyguard / his driver and their duels are quite laughable. The bodyguard works for the rich widow (played by the charming Charlotte Rampling), but these scenes are too dark to help the film, even if the "plot" of the family is rather interesting. Dex also continues to come to the same place and find this bodyguard, which is rather a coincidence. In the last part of the film, a man is shot through a window and, from the outside, he is seen jumping over it - it was pretty bad. But aside from some of these obvious flaws, I think it still holds. I certainly did not predict the end, so it was good - there is a twist, and although some posters here think they were misled, I thought it was a beautiful and believable end . Dennis Quaid, with his strange smiles and dark eyes, is most likeable in The Right Stuff, Great Balls of Fire, Inner Space and Cold Creek Manor. But here, as a Dex, he's supposed to be a little silly, so he did a good job. Pretty decent film.
