Okay, the first time I saw "Talk Radio" was in a video store for only $ 2.00 on VHS, believe it or not, and I looked at it and I thought it might be Howard Stern because I watched it for about thirty years. seconds, so just do not see it anymore. Then I went to another store about a month later and found "Talk Radio" on DVD for only $ 5.00. So, I see that it was done by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. So after the movie, I was speechless. I have never seen such a movie like this. Here is the main plot, then I'll tell you what I thought. <br /> <br /> This is a host of Dallas radio, Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio host who talks about everything that others tell and interrupts and takes it seriously. Now, a network wants to put their show live anywhere in the United States. Barry's show has many interesting callers, such as Chet (a neo-natzi), Kent (a kid addicted to rock'n'roll), John (a rapist), and so on. . Now, some people who call resemble the same actor / actress. But I think everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Now, what I like about this movie is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. The dark music in the background agrees very well too. There is a flashback scene in the movie and how it started with the radio, and I think they played well. <br /> <br /> But the big thing about the movie is the end. It surprised me and it makes you a little paranoid about the wireless interlocutors and everything is wonderful. It also tells you how to tell people what they need in a big city like Dallas. One of Oliver Stone's underrated / weakest films was mentioned, but I think it's his best in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But if you like movies with paranoia, this movie will give you the impression of being in a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background. I often watch this movie again when I'm bored, actually I watched it tonight. Yeah, if you really want to have the sinister feel of the movie, watch it at night with the lights off. It may sound crazy, but it makes the movie better! <br /> <br /> Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I do not think the film was so successful was perhaps in my opinion because of the title. "Speak Radio." It does not seem very complicated or anything, it's a bit simple. A better title like the book "Talked To Death" or maybe "The abusive radio host" or something catchy and not quite "Talk Radio". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Oliver Stone did not usually do Universal, I do not think so. Paramount could have been a good company. I do not know. Something about this movie did not work very well, but I like it a lot. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage."
