To be brief, the story is thin as paper and you can see the end arrive a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth and an incredibly young Phil Silvers keep the film afloat and sometimes lift it up in the air . Some of the songs are terrible (the "poor John" is a wreck of the train) but most of them are very funny, and the scene where Hayworth plays on the absurdly huge game for Kelly's rival must be seen for to be believed. Another treatment is the perfect NYC-perfect sets in the best Hollywood tradition. <br /> <br /> Another attraction, if you are considering such attractions, is the horribly horrible masculine "chivalry" towards women. The oily lightness and transparent obsequiousness that passed for the male charm at the time (at least in the movies) are presented here in their most sinister form. Some of the men look like a cartoon wolf. <br /> <br /> A minor disappointment is Eve Arden, trapped in a role so minor that she has virtually no chance of doing anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interaction between her and Silvers - a missed opportunity.
