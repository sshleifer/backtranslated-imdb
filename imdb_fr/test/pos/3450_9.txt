Too bad the poor critic who did not like / did not understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead! <br /> <br /> This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most people I've ever seen, but it's neither dark nor preached like the movie type "people ordinary ". It's mostly humorous, although it's not technically a comedy. <br /> <br /> It all looks a bit like a fantasy, maybe Shakespear's "Dream of a Night". Beautiful and intelligent women abound, with a magnificent cinematography and a non insulting scenario that does not miss a beat. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see him every time this movie is rebroadcast on cable. It's like reading a favorite and precious book.
