Uh .... a serious movie about troubled teens in Singapore, a country I do not know much about, but who has the previous false impression that all children are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and the government . Well, I guess I'm wrong, just like other cities / countries, they also have their troubled teenagers who also lead the unsuspecting rebellious lifestyle of drugs, fights, foul language and ... many more obvious signs of being a bad boy. The surprising part of this movie is not really about how these kids are running into trouble, but about the subtle gayness behind their so-called loyalty. The link between these "brothers" could very well come from an unconscious gay tendency inside these boys. Although it's not uncommon for str8 guys to have very close friendships, but watch this movie carefully, it should get into all kinds of gay movie festivals and I would not be surprised if it could win many more rewards this direction!
