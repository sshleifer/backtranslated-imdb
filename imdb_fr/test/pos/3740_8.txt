By discovering something, the trip is so much more fun, so much more surreal and so much more emotionally stimulating than when you finally arrive at your destination. Falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world. You feel energized, invigorated and alive. You just want to be with this person every second of the day and the very sound of his voice makes you excited and sometimes excited. Love and all the physical and emotional side effects that come with it are pure happiness. Everyone will guess, but when you start your journey together, nothing can be compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner, two in the center emotionally scored. the elderly. In this film, they are about to embark together on this mystical journey where love and the discovery of emotions along the way will help them save them. <br /> <br /> Lane deals with the typical jerk of an ex-husband who still loves him, but in his eyes, only because the woman with whom he cheated no longer wants him. Even if she was hurt by him, even if she really hated him, there is a part of her who plans to take him back. Why could you ask? Because in life and love, comfort is sometimes more important than intelligence. Yes, this man has deceived her, but she has children with him, she has built a life with him and there is obviously still a link with him. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere plays a recently divorced husband and a separated father. He also lost a patient while she was reacting negatively to the anesthetic. He is now being sued by his family and his guilt is strengthened, but he is annoyed by the question. This brings him to Rodanthe in the first place. Although his lawyer told him not to do so, he felt compelled to visit Rodanthe's wife's husband. He stays at the inn where Adrienne looks after. Soon, they comfort each other in the arms of each other and discover that they too can have a second chance in life. <br /> <br /> Now it looks like a simple idea for a movie, and although it may be something Previously, Gere and Lane are the owners of the movie. Diane Lane illuminates the screen with her smile. Her eyes sparkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character deserves to be watched. The character of Gere is a little different. He is harder and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and passion to get him out of his shell. He discredits himself for his tense relationship with his son and secretly blames herself for the patient's death. Outside, he tells everyone who hears that it is not his fault and that he has made 1 victim out of 50 000. But basically, it gnaws at him. They meet at a time when both need someone to listen. <br /> <br /> Gere and Lane were already in the movie together, but this is the first time they play with lovers. They married in Unfaithful, but here they play lovers who meet up when the people of their lives have abandoned them. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I would like to see more movies with them together. In fact, I'd like to see more movies with Diane Lane, but it's a story for another time. <br /> <br /> Nights in Rodanthe is a very exciting and romantic film about two lost souls who run away. They both become better people, they both become stronger people. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to everyone, not just couples. It's a film about redemption, absolution and second chances. <br /> <br /> He will also ask you to bring tissues. <br /> <br /> 8/10
