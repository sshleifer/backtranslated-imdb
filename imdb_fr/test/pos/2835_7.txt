This is a bright and photographed western exceptionally well written by the veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is his main assistant in this regard. His strong plot can be told in a few sentences. Captain Richard Lance, a small book cavalry officer, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after the massacre of a fort. He insists on bringing the man back to his trial, to send him to Tucson; his commander sends another man to try to bring the prisoner to justice and the patrol is destroyed. This means that the leader has escaped and Lance must now lead a second patrol - and he chooses the men that the fort can save the most, a company with problems - to defend the fortress that had been wiped out and save the command of another. attack by stopping the bottling pass in this area. As Lance, the young Gregory Peck is pretty strong. Among the other actors of the big distribution of this film which really shows the life in a cavalry outpost resembling a military establishment of heterogeneous and conflicting types, one can quote War Bond Anderson and Lon Chaney, War Bond Anderson and Lon Chaney . Jr. as troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as fellow officers with Nana Bryant as the colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton while the love is in a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captured warlord and Jeff Corey plays the scout for the Fort. There are really two great scenes in this very well done west - the long section of the fort before sending the last patrol and that long patrol to the doomed Fort. Defying himself. Once at the fort, Peck must make a great speech in which, at the request of the men on whom he is preparing, he explains to them why he took them. by reading their faults one by one; they then tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place, he brought the Indian instead of going himself - and he proves them wrong for the rest of the movie by winning his battle solitary by intelligence and courage. The music of Franz Waxman is good, the qualities of production are admirable; the discussion of what would happen if Lance took the warlord was to be true; other than this insoluble error of the central character, it's a big western. it's my favorite for fifty years.
