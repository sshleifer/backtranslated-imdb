I saw Love in Limbo playing for the first time about five years ago on free TV channels. Since then, it's a film that I will always remember very well as one of those movies you see and that is always influenced by. <br /> <br /> For the uninitiated, the Australian film has a long history of staggered comedies about the adorable losers, and Love in Limbo is a perfect example. While Russel Crowe is the only actor on the list (although nowadays he only needs movies), the rest of the Australian cast is good - he still steals the show like a nervous, nerdy and virgin loser . <br /> <The general principle is very similar to American Pie. A group of friends who want to get fucked and become men. As you might expect, the entire movie is devoted to this (with a subplot on the mother's main and various incidents) and is replete with humorous situations that push it towards the inevitably sweet end. <br /> <br /> If you liked American Pie, do not expect it to be the same, but expect the same conventions to emerge. Love in limbo is not a disgusting romantic comedy, but it certainly has its share of laughs, punches in which the good wins, and in situations that any type, Australian or not, can tell. <br /> <br /> See if you liked: American Pie, almost famous. Highlights: Good Australian casting, easy to understand, good value. Weaknesses: predictable by points. My rating: 8 out of 10
