Although many audio recordings of great musicians like Jascha Heifetz survive, film or television recordings are actually limited. That's why musical offers such as "They Shall Have Music" are rare jewels. While, with modern eyes and ears, one can quibble over the plot, the discerning viewer should put the unique pleasures of this film into their own perspective. The plot was designed to appeal to young and old audiences of the time, but it remains enjoyable to this day. An important aspect of the experience of watching classic movies is to see them through the eyes of the viewer of that time. <br /> <br /> I must oppose the critic who complains about a film in black and white, or who feel obliged to report that their students have expressed such reservations. These are juvenile complaints that reflect a limited historical perspective. For the teacher, this should offer an educational opportunity to explain the unique qualities of black and white photography and its place in the history of cinema. In fact, color can stand in the way of a good screenplay or music. For example, the black-and-white photograph of John Ford's "diligence" is, like the photographs of Ansel Adams, an artistic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> As for Heifetz, I could no longer disagree with what he was made of wood. If you want a blatant emotional attitude, attend a rock concert. The role of a classical musician like Heifetz is to move the audience, not himself. The emotion of Heifetz is reflected in his play and not in his body language. He had a rare ability to extract every emotional nuance from the music and transfer it to his listeners. It is the listener who should be moved, not the artist. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, a reviewer asked to see Heifetz on YouTube playing the 1st movement of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto, with Frank McHugh in the audience. This is from the movie "Carnegie Hall" of 1947 and not "They will have music" "Carnegie Hall" is an even bigger treasure of many great classical artists at their peak. We are fortunate that there have been film producers who, at least in these limited cases, have chosen to present these artists. It was another time that was not totally overwhelmed by the guts of the lowest common denominator we know today.
