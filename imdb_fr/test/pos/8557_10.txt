We do not know why this extraordinary movie was never officially released on DVD ... Anthony Quinn's performance makes it a must-see show. There are relatively few films in which an actor identifies so deeply with his character, a phenomenon that is always unique for us, the cinephiles. <br /> <br /> But the powerful portrait of Quinn representing an innocent Romanian, literally dragged out of his house and every day life by forces he does not understand, is only part of what makes the size of this film. The scenario is based on a book published in Paris by a Romanian priest who fled the communist takeover, and the film manages to plunge into a region little known in the history of Eastern Europe. The misadventures of Johann Moritz (told openly and honestly, without the politically so good right now in Hollywood) are a succession of eulogies on the lost innocence of the Romanian people. It is devilishly ironic that this eulogy is signed by a French director, working with American money from an Italian producer and overseeing a multinational distribution led by an extraordinary actor of Mexican origin. <br /> <br /> I saw VCD mentions of this film in various Asian Internet stores, and I was fortunate to take possession of a digital recording of this film, aired on the British version of TCM. But it's a pity that "The 25th Hour" is nowhere to be found on MGM's future DVD map.
