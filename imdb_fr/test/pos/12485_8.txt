Is it a mystery of murder? Is this a police procedure? Is it a look at the seedy French theaters? The Quai des Orfèvres is all that, but it's above all a funny comedy of infidelity, jealousy and love, which takes place in post-war Paris. It may be surprising that Henri-Georges Clouzot, the director of films as sinister as The Raven, or thugs as suspensive as Diabolique and The Wages of Fear, is the director. Clouzot, however, was a clever filmmaker. "In a mystery of murder," he tells us, "there is an element of playfulness, it is never totally realistic, I share Hitchcock's point of view, which says," A mystery of murder is a piece of cake with raisins and candied fruit, and if you do not, you might as well shoot a documentary "." Quai des Orfèvres is a wonderful film. and it's not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Jenny Martineau (Suzy Delair) is an ambitious singer in music halls and dinner clubs. She is a flirt, she sees nothing wrong with using a little sex as well as talent to get a contract. Her stage name is Jenny Latour. And she really loves her husband, Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier). Martineau is a bag a little sad. We then have their neighbor, the photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renant). She is blonde, gorgeous (think Rita Hayworth) and capable. She and Martineau have been friends since their childhood. Dora, however, is certainly not thinking about friendship when she looks at Jenny, then arrives George's Brignon (Charles Dullin), a lavish, rich and dirty old man, who often asks Dora to take "photographs of art "of his protected young women he poses himself. He offers a contract for a movie to Jenny and offers a dinner at his house to discuss the details. Jenny is more than eager. Maurice is furious and forbidden. Jenny yells at her: "You're jealous of the rich! Well, I want my share of their dough, I'm all for royalty!" "Your father was a worker," shouts Maurice back. "And then, under Louis XV, I would have been Madame de Pompadour, I would have heated their tights!" <br /> <br /> And after Brignon is found dead with a broken champagne bottle next to his bloody skull, there's Dora trying to make things safe for Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine gets the deal. Antoine (Louis Jouvet) is a tall, tired, middle-aged, single boy with foot pain. He saw everything. He served in "the colonies" with the Foreign Legion and returned with an adopted baby and malaria. The child is now about eight years old and Antoine is passionate about him. One of the first things Antoine discovers is that Brignon not only had his brain with a bottle, but that someone shot him in the heart. That he has done? In a short time, Jenny, Maurice and Dora make alibis, lie and, at one time or another, confess. How will Antoine discover the murderer? Will we have the chance to see some excellent music hall songs sung by Jenny Latour? Everything becomes clear, but only with the time and persistence of Detective Antoine. We still have many kinds of love leading to all sorts of motivations, from jealousy to nostalgic looking hair ... and all mixed with a fun mix of Gallic fun. <br /> <br /> Clouzot takes us to a Parisian neighborhood of shabby but non-threatening neighborhoods, oppressed music publishers where melodies are played on the piano for buyers, in restaurants with discrete private dining rooms. Most importantly, he takes us to the music hall where Jenny Latour often performs. Jenny can be seen singing, with seated couples and single men wearing their jackets and bonnets standing. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film is largely in this environment. Jenny singing about "Her little tra-la-la, her sweet tra-la-la", we follow her after trying the song at the publishers until the rehearsal of a crazy show with Jenny in a hat to feathers, a corset, garters stockings and not much else. <br /> <br /> Delair, Blier and Renant all do a magnificent job, but it's Louis Jouvet who keeps everything together. He was a wonderful actor who hated making movies. The stage was his world, and he only made films if he liked the director and made money to finance his stage work. Jouvet was tall with a long face and large cheekbones. He was not conventionally handsome but he had what it took to dominate a scene. To find out how good he is at playing comedy, watch it in Drama Drama. He is a fascinating actor. At one point, he says, "I love you very much, Miss Dora Monnier." "Me?" she asks. "Yes, because you and I are two of a kind, when it comes to women, we will not have a chance." Jouvet brings all sorts of nuances to this line, from sad regret to a sweet amusement.
