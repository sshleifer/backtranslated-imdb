We are in 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11-year-old girl who grows up with an idealized vision of her 19-year-old sister, Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is the author, the seeker of truth, the repairer of all the wrongs of the world. Then one day, Phoebe and her mother Gail (Blythe Danner) learn that Faith is dead. Faith committed suicide. Phoebe and Gail are both overwhelmed by this news and, although saddened, Gail cries. Phoebe can not give up. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened. <br /> <br /> We are in 1977. Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) is 18 years old and decides to go to Europe despite the objections of her mother to discover the truth. During her lifetime, Faith was inseparable from a man she called "Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf claimed to know nothing of Faith's last days, Phoebe convinces him to tell him everything. A few days later, Wolf realizes that he has not abandoned the past and joins Phoebe on his pilgrimage to Portugal. his own guilt not to prevent suicide. Although angry, Phoebe realizes in the end how Faith was human and fragile. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I'm old enough to remember the robberies at a Red Army bank and I was 10 years old in 1969. That story was familiar to me. I still remember the young men who tried to decide whether to go to Canada or not to avoid the repechage. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it has probably happened several times in real life during this period. Camilla Belle was nice and fun to watch as she described the beloved sister, excited by what was going on around her. Jordana Brewster easily slipped into the role of the old Phoebe. Blythe Danner was the mother who always supported, a role she knows too well on American television, unfortunately. I would have liked to see it with a more solid material to work. Cameron Diaz perfectly played the immature anarchist. Although, sometimes, his performance as an activist of the 1960s seemed to stand out. Of all the characters, it is Christopher Eccleston's wolf, which has experienced the strongest growth. When we introduce the character at the beginning of the film, we can see that he is a man of the world. He is a patient and kind man, full of anger at the injustices of the world. In the end, he realizes that the direction he leads with Faith is false and begins to "grow" by deciding that he should fight injustice in his own way. Faith refuses to join him and that eventually leads to his death. The Wolf of Eccleston is the most real of all the characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was nice and provoking. "The Invisible Circus" is rated TV-MA, but it contains very little curse, sex or violence. The subject of the film is the reason for the rating.
