I absolutely loved this film as a child. I can not find it anywhere! I mentioned it to friends the other day, and none of them remember it! Someone can help me? My older sister remembers it vaguely. There was also another movie I remember that was half live and half animated, but I can not remember the name. The characters were animated and the background was real ... I think I remembered it was a kangaroo and I think the scene was in Australia. I came out of my mind trying to get copies of those movies that were a memorable part of my very enjoyable childhood. Edit: I looked on IMDb this other movie and discovered that it's called Dot and the Kangaroo! All I had to do was type "kangaroo" into the character search bar, and the name of the movie in the list looked like a bell! MAN, I love IMDb! Thank you!
