I was in mid-adolescence when I saw this film and I was struck by the beauty of the young stars as well as the endearing cinematography and the simple sweetness of the story. I'm surprised to learn that Alvina recently died, that Bury apparently did not work in the film industry for almost 30 years and that both would be in their fifties. <br /> <br /> Elton John's soundtrack is incredibly beautiful. and supports the air of protected innocence that the characters live in isolation. I saw the movie poster, calling it "Two Kids Quis'Aiment", which apparently means something like "Two kids who love each other" - the English language distributors have been advised to abbreviate title! <br /> <br /> Paul, the 15-year-old ignored son of an English businessman living in Paris, meets Michelle, an orphan, at the zoo. The two take what they want as a vacation day in the rural home of Michelle's late father, but end up staying there for a year, isolated from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home. After the baby is born, the police go to Paul's workplace and take him away. <br /> <br /> "Blue Lagoon" comes to mind as another film that almost takes up the theme of protected innocence in an isolated paradise. So sad that "Friends" never came out on DVD.
