Luchino Visconti became famous all over the world after his wonderful production THE LEOPARD. Film buffs have come to know the director's style as one of the new postwar realists, an aristocrat who developed his free thought and who, as a result, expressed himself as 'artist. However, applied to this film, MORTE A VENEZIA based on Thomas Mann's novel, it is a slightly different story. <br /> <br /> The whole film is, at first sight, so unique, so psychological and so influenced by the various thoughts of an artist (both the director and the main character Gustav von Aschenbach), it seems to be "unassailable" for many viewers. As a result, these opinions about the film have become "too slow", "unbearable" or "boring without end". Why? The reason seems to lie in a significant view nowadays: "The good film is parallel to a flawless action". Here, it would be appropriate to say: "The good movie is parallel to the lack of action". In fact, everyone would be able to say a sentence about the entire film content and that would be enough. Everything we find in MORTE A VENEZIA has a sense of vague reality filled with both depth and depth that seems to be significant for every moment. And this is the case when we notice the psychedelic scenes of Venice, when we see Gustav at the station, when we receive his intensely emotional memories. Insight into one's decaying mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for the viewer to continue watching the movie is to do his best to feel and experiment rather than see and think. Everything is condemned to disappear, to wither like flowers on the meadow when their time comes. In other words, all have a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogues. As a result, it is unlikely that you will have the idea of ​​the movie after a single viewing. You have to see him more than twice with a constantly open mind. Whether you like it or not ... It's a different story, very personal. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​are the factor that is noticed at first sight and stays with us all along. Beauty as something very meaningful to the main character who seems to come and go; rest yourself as something to which he is going so badly and which comes to him in the most unexpected manner; the feeling that he finds in a teenager who appears as a model of all dreams and desires, as a forbidden fruit of the homosexual lust that disappears. Costume designer Piero Tosi does a wonderful job in this movie. Through a lot of wonderful wardrobe, it gives us a very realistic view of 1911 when the action unfolds. The director of photography, Pasqualino De Santis, offers us a fantastic visual experience that can be described as a feast for the eyes. And basically, the music of Gustav Mahler, the composer whose life inspired Thomas Mann to present the character. <br /> <br /> The performances are first-rate, especially Dirk Bogart in the role of the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants to rest after a hard artistic work and tries in vain to find him in a city crowded with Venice. For the majority of the film, we have great insight into his thoughts, feelings, and acts of anger, exhaustion, and despair. Although sometimes depressing, it keeps us on track until the end, without losing hope for a less tragic end ... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) represents the model of decadent homosexual desire, but also a model of beauty and purity which seems to last very long. In short ... "Farewell Tadzio, it was too short" says the main character. Mark Burns does a remarkable but highly controversial job as a kind of "super ego" Alfred with whom Gustav argues over ideals such as beauty, justice, hope and human dignity. For Alfred, beauty belongs to the senses. How Freudian, but how dangerous this idea! And always present in the Italian artistic films of the time, Silvana Mangano, here as elegant Polish lady, mother of Tadzio. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments are indeed the highlights of the film; However, not all viewers will find them unforgettable. As with any other film, they require a lot of effort to get on track, in the director's individual ego and between the four walls of his psyche. Among these scenes, I feel that the sequence of the beach is very important, especially the way Gustav observes Tadzio. The physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to get closer ... I also appreciate the photos when Gustav is sitting in the gondola and the city view is moving in the background - how much that can remember memorable thoughts of existential transfer. Are not we, people, a kind of "passengers" in the world, in the journey of life. <br /> <br /> In the end, I have to tell you something important. I had found MORTE A VENEZIA extremely strange until I started to look deeper into what the director is trying to convey. Then each scene has proved to be meaningful in its interpretation with which you do not have to agree (I do not agree with what the main character does), but you should at least to tolerate that as something that the author really meant. Listen to his voice, allow him a few words in a page of reality ... <br /> <br /> Therefore, there is a long way to go to understand the film because few films like this have were shot in 1971 and are done now. Paradoxically, it seems that we all have the right to feel the necessary feelings about this film in the long run, just as we all should once live a strange, inevitable, generally unexpected reality that death is ... 7/10
