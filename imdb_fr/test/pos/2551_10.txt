Ramin Bahrani's second feature, Chop Shop, is a rare breed. This is an American film that tells a story that is not usually found in American cinema, that of a minority living in poverty. It's a simple beauty job. Filmed in Queens, New York, in the shadow of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop embodies neo-realism. Featuring a cast of non-actors, it has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic "Thicycle Thieves" than anything made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all music and sounds are diagetic. Looking at it gives the impression of watching a great foreign film, it takes us to another world because it is so rare to see it. However, this other world is not Rome, Istanbul or New Delhi after the Second World War, it is a modern city of New York. <br /> <br /> Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Ale. He is a 12-year-old Latin American child with no parents or family unit to look after him. He lives in a tiny room at the top of the auto store where he also works. He shares the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). Neither did it pass in the second year. The beer, although young, is hard and mature. He acts as the head of the small family. He puts his sister in touch with a job and does all he can to earn money when he does not work at the cutting shop. He sells illegal DVDs in the streets and sweets in the subways. He looks for car parts and sells them to the many auto stores that line the street where he lives. <br /> <br /> Alejandro is heartbroken when he learns that his sister works at night as a prostitute. He is gradually losing interest in respecting the law. He starts stealing the first car parts and later the wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist of Bicycle Thieves, we can not blame Ale for becoming a thief. It's just survival. Ale and Isamar are saving in hopes of buying a $ 4,500 van. They see the van as a way out and there is a lot of optimism. However, as is usually the case in neo-realism, we know that this can only lead to disappointment. <br /> <br /> The fascinating performance of Polanco is what gives legitimacy to the realism of Chop Shop. Here is a 12-year-old character who must be incredibly independent and naively vulnerable. Whether he drives cars to the store, sells Snickers movies and bars or plays with his sister in their skinny room, he is genuine. <br /> <br /> Chop Shop is a reminder that all American children do not grow up on a land of opportunity. The lifestyle of Ale is what many in middle-class white America regard as "the third world". They become aware of poverty and deprivation in foreign countries by sipping their coffee and reading the New York Times on Sunday morning, but are blind to it in their own streets. Once you have looked at Chop Shop, you will think differently about the children who peddle sweets on the subway. <br /> <br /> More comments on www.mediasickness.com
