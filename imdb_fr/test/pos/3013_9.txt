It must be said that the director of The Cell, Tarsem Singh, is fairly well established with his first feature film, which turns out to be one of the most amazing films of contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a movie. As a thriller, he stands out from most of his peers, with skillful editing and scary scoring, creating an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere. However, it is ultimately Tarsem's skill for the intricate and disturbing scenography and the images that bear witness to the shocking terror of the film. <br /> <br /> As with many recent films, I was shocked by the alarming hypocrisy of those who commented negatively on The Cell; to defend the film, I will address some of these issues. Intrigue seems to be the main concern, and although it is not revolutionary and borrows a lot from the Silence of the Lambs, it was never designed to be the most important aspect of the film. the plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision - both horrible and wonderful - is presented to the public, in the same way that the plot of Silence of the Lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of his two main characters, Lecter and Starling. While The Silence of the Lambs is clearly the top film, it is irrational to condemn the plot of The Cell and, in the same breath, to praise the Silence of the Lambs. <br /> <br /> My finale The concern is the mention of "MTV style" direction. It pains me to see directors who use innovative camera and cinematographic techniques be condemned. A camera has the potential to be much more than just a tool for recording events; The angles, pans, color settings, etc., are fully used in The Cell in order to create the feeling of a dream state that could not have been achieved otherwise. This is essential for the film because the premise is the visualization of the subconscious of a serial killer. If you just want a series of static shots, stick to the plays and give up the cinema. <br /> <br /> That being said, The Cell is completely entertaining, terrifying and breathtaking, both in rhythm and design. Anyone who can look beyond the script - perhaps uninspired, but never boring - will find one of the best movies of the year 2000.
