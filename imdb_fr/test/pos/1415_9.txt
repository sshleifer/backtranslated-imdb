Stephen Hawking has one of the greatest minds, or if it's too simplistic to impose one of the most curious and daring, he is also trapped in a body paralyzed by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and by a computer to communicate. . Maybe I did not know enough about Hawking coming in (I always knew him as 'that guy who talks like a computer who knows a lot about the universe and everything else, you know') that he is British, that he was a normal child and, perhaps most remarkablely, the illness that would have left him dead at 21 years puts him in a position to put his life in evidence. <br /> <br /> According to Errol Morris, visually as curious and coldly sensual. Dazzling Portrait in A Brief History of the Times, Hawking was already brilliant, while other Oxford students were confronted with formidable algebraic equations, he answered more than three times more in an hour), but faced challenges of other theories by other scientists, he rebounded with his own. Under certain complex scientific discourses - and if you have less than a B - in astronomy, like you, you will have to keep your ears particularly attentive to explanations about the possible infinity of time or the peculiarities of the black hole - there is a human who only wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday. <br /> <br /> Morris captures Hawking as it should be for those who never tire of his theories of how particles can enter and exit a black hole, or if there is even a creator or not depending on how much one takes into account Einstein and the time. But it also captures the story of the man and his condition, making it much more interesting than if Morris had done one or the other. Too many speeches about the cosmos would make our head hurt, too much about his personal life and we could wonder what is going to happen to this man whose book of the title of the film appears for more than five years on the list of the best sales. <br /> <br /> Almost in spite of his appearance, Hawking defines what a conscious entity in a universe in which, he observes, he will not be separated from if and when the universe will disappear in 10 billion dollars. years from now. Throughout all of this, in A Brief History of Time, we see a genius and his humility (not to mention the ten cents of his colleagues and his family here and there) through an unfathomably hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe .
