The great British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia) makes this strange film about a writer in trouble, obsessed by people in a row. It turns out to be harmless at first, but it quickly becomes dangerous after pushing the game a step further after meeting a like-minded man who shows him the ins and outs of the break-in. The two men quickly interfere in a strange world where the mafia and prostitution mingle. Jeremy Theobald plays the writer and Alex Haw the like-minded friend. Both are good performances. This low-budget film was shot in the style of total guerrilla warfare, with no license for any place and no big star, but with what a lot of big-budget movies do not have: a clever scenario and a creative direction. An impressive start by one of the best directors of the moment. Good product!
