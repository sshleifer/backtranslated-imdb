If you liked the 1993 "Nemesis" cyborg movie (erotic, science fiction), then you'll love this one. I loved it as soon as Elvis Pompadoured's hero pulled out a samurai sword during a shootout. Like "Nemesis", it takes place in a post-apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police thrillers where the well-armed hero must confront well-armed rebels to solve a plot of powers opposed to the unwashed masses. but that's where the similarities end. The ambiguous mayor, dead or alive, tries to keep the calm masses on the medicines he sells them. The rebels, helped by mercenaries and a cyborg, try to curb his suffocating grip on his subjects. After several unsuccessful attempts to curb the rebels, he sends his highest police officer to murder the rebels. This film follows the trail of most action adventures but is not afraid to color itself off the line.
