Journalist Kimberly Wells presents the minor aspect of the short story; puff pieces that do not contain much new merit. When shooting on alternative energy in a nuclear power plant, an accident occurs. Kimberly's friend and cameraman, Richard Adams illegally films the men controlling the incident in the control room. Jack Godell, head of the control room, prevents the reactor from doing damage. After an investigation into the incident showing that everything is fine, Jack can not help but think that something is wrong. After discovering that the generator pump's weld seals were cracked, Jack, along with Kimberly and Richard, was trying to inform the public and shut down the unsecured panel. drama that still has so much relevance today. Nuclear power has always been a hot topic of debate, whether it is the surest safe alternative energy source, radioactive waste, and nuclear power stations waiting to be the next Chernobyl. Not to mention nuclear energy, The China Syndrome explores freedom of expression, the right of the press and big business. Based on Jack's falsified information discoveries, his knowledge puts an end to a massive investment in the construction of another nuclear power plant, which many men seek to profit from. Kimberly, who desperately seeks television news, finds that the struggle for truth is more important than accelerating her career; Constantly pushed by Richard, he never wanted to be silenced to demand that the public be informed of the accident. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas and Jack Lemmon are simply irreproachable. Fonda presents Kimberly as a fragile woman on the outside, both emotionally hard and determined to reveal this dissimulation. Douglas brings a strong performance as Richard, fighting for honesty and truth. Lemmon shines above all like Jack., His performance is a very charged drama. <br /> <br /> China's syndrome is a fascinating vision, still relevant today as it was when it was first released.
