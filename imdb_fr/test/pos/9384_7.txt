A big bed possessed by a demon eats people, among other things. I did not invent. <br /> <br /> Completed in 1977 and officially released on DVD in 2003, "Death Bed: the bed that eats" is a film whose plot is impossible to describe. You probably know this from the excellent article by Patton Oswalt, as well as Stephen Throwers' essential book "Nightmare USA". As you look at him, you wonder what follows <br /> <br /> -Who is George Berry and what drugs did he smoke / inject / sniff before writing and making this film? <br /> <br /> -Is it a horror comedy? A combination of a horror film and an art film? A weird joke about the audience? <br /> <br /> - What am I watching? <br /> <br /> "The bed of death" really challenges any explanation. I know this term is overused, but it could not be more true than it is here. This description really beggars. It's a horror comedy, as well as hybrid movie / horror art. But everything is so surreal, you have to see it. The score sounds like electronic excerpts from an old Candlemass album, the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything, the direction is surprisingly competent and the film sometimes looks like a Jesus Franco movie - it's to say if his films were intentionally funny. <br /> <br /> In the end, there is really no way to describe this movie. Lord knows I tried, but in reality, few movies are as weird, unique or as breath-taking as this one. See it ... but you've been warned. It's also the only movie George Berry has ever made. He definitely left his mark on the kind of exploitation with that, I'll tell you.
