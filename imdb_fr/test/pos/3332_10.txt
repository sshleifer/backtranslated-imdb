These comic book authors are relentless with their nerdy (and fun) word games. The first shot we see here is an insular prison with the following inscription above its great doors: "Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose is Good Noose." Inside the prison, the first sign we see is "Welcome: sit down." They then show an electric chair. <br /> <br /> Corny gives way to the intelligent, because our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With his pen in his hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes! In no time, he traveled the United States, crossed Canada and is part of the north of the country. This is where we see the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and, of course, our hero Droopy, here called "Sgt McPoodle". His mission is to capture the criminal in general from Alka-Fizz. Then, with his faithful little blue horse, he goes out in the thick snow to hunt down the wanted wolf. <br /> <br /> From here, we have the normal story: Droopy is always one step ahead of the wolf. No matter what the latter does .... and the two characters are involved in crazy and very funny visual gags. Droopy even comes out of an eagle egg on the top of a mountain. The wolf can not go or do (plastic surgery!) To escape the intrepid "Sgt. McPoodle". Moreover, no one in the history of cartoons has perhaps had more exaggerated reactions than this wolf every time he sees his nemesis! Her screams, her face and her body stretched with horror are each time a big part of the visual gags. <br /> <br /> One could think that this caricature of a joke would be monotonous, but it is not the case. Tex Avery and the gang are good examples. This film is one of 24 drawings from the DVD "Complete Theatrical Collection" containing stunning visual effects restored.
