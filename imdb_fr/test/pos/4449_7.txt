First of all, I must say that I am a big fan of Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento. Although I did not see absolutely all their movies, I really enjoyed almost everyone I saw. I really like giallos and I thought that Argento was the master of the genre, after watching movies like "Tenebre" and "Phenomena". But after seeing Fulci's "New York Ripper", I discovered that he could do some very good giallos in addition to his graphic zombie movies and even surpass Argento, to a certain degree. <br /> <br /> I like Fulci's style, and yes I like gore, but I think this movie, although it has a plot and characters more developed than its other films, is not his best. What I do not like is that it can be confusing sometimes, especially at the end. And the fact that we passed from one suspect to another, then another until we even suspected the little girl lingered a moment, I think it goes too far. I know that giallos are supposed to let you guess until the end, and that the killer should be very hard to find, but this movie plays a bit too much with our minds. However, I liked the scene where the witch is killed, I think it is very well done and gave me chills. The acting is also very good and the photography is excellent. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a bad movie, I think Lucio Fulci has made better films than this one, and I think his best is "The Beyond", a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience. <br /> <br /> I give "Do not torture a duck" a 7 out of 10. <br /> <br />
