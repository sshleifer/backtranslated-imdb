Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole film is really shooting and fighting, but it has a very good vampire plot! For people who say they do not shoot up and fight movies like they did before. Well, this one is really hard! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was very good too and he steals the show! He really plays like a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think this very beautiful actress is very underrated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really cool to see Vince Murdocco in this movie! As for the action, it's really great with all the rifle fights and the cool battle scenes. The fights on this picture are really the greatest I've seen! There is so much going on in 86 minutes. For action fans, you'll be dazzled by all the firepower and the great fights this movie has to offer! Night Hunter is a difficult film to locate. If you are in a video store and you see it for sale, buy it because this movie is a great keeper and the box is cool! There is a ton of action that must be seen to be believed! Look and see if you can find bargains on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place vendors! In my opinion, Night Hunter is one of the greatest fighting movies I have ever watched and the characters are really cool. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and want to see Nicholas Guest in an excellent performance, I highly recommend any action movie lover who loves filming, fighting movies and vampire movies and who looks for a real nonstop action movie but fails to deliver it to get and buy Night Hunter today!
