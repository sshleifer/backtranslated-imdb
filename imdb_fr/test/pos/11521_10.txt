I must say that this film had an excellent distribution, sets, music and camera work. Cameron Diaz was great, she had a very exciting ride, very disconcerting, while Jordana Brewster had a serious roll but still captured one. For me, Jordana is very nostalgic, she reminds me of one of my classmates! What really attracted me in this film is the very clever work of the camera and the choice of places. the story is very well written. it's a must. Those who love mystery movies should watch this one, I guarantee you that it will keep you in your seats until the end.
