I blow hot and cold on Carne. It can really be a headache for me. I think his inspiration may have left him a little earlier than other directors of his generation. Admittedly, a man who had reached maturity in the 1930s with the Popular Front seems uneasy in 1950s France, with its rampant commercialism and strong American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars and it shows. The party scenes last much longer than expected, as if he was trying to save time for the anemic scenario to work. The character of Roland Lesaffre - he plays the older brother of Pascale Petit - seems to exist only to reassure the director that his old-fashioned ideas are still valid. <br /> <br /> At two o'clock, this image is much too long. Nevertheless, let me congratulate Pascale Petit for her performance at the game; she was a natural man who should have defied Brigitte Bardot for the supremacy of the sexpot, but went astray. Andrea Parisy is also excellent as a girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate (yes, they still thought that way in the fifties). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor to be able to play the role of an anarchist in a convincing way: he is great here because he saves a cat of death, then notices that he does not support cats. Jacques Charrier only reminds me how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant smile and empty eyes.
