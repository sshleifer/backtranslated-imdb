it did not look like a fantastic movie. The film is dark, with dark shades. The soundtrack was too exhilarating to introduce visual imprints. I'm sure they were aiming for something militant, but it did not work out. The scene where Astin tries to escape is a perfect example. Why does it sound like the Goonies? There is no comedy, there is no light for that !! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is good and the acting is also very good. I enjoyed everyone's performances. It is available on Netflix's online viewing. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit, but write your own soundtrack !!
