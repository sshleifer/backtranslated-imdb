When it was presented at the Seattle Int'l Film Fest, I was the only person to applaud and applaud. The rest of the crowd booed or were silent. It's a well-played little film that plunges into the reality of humanity of a young homosexual. This is a real man. and do not play the hyper-buffered tasteless muscular gay paositif that goes for the genre of non-porn gay cinema (and that's why a lot of contemporary gay genre movies are so boring). This film is an intense passion and a great tragedy. The acting and the direction and cinematography is fantastic; all this keeps the film clastrophobic, tense and passionate. Do not miss this if you can find it.
