Manna From Heaven is a light comedy that uses the exaggeration of human weaknesses to entertain the audience. Throughout the film, goodness is expected to surface in every situation. The result is that the moviegoer finds himself sitting with that silly smile on his face, peace in his heart and great expectations for mankind. Watching this movie was a most enjoyable experience. (I dare say an uplifting experience, but some would say it looks corny !!)
