A raw and bold thriller that aimed at great philosophical heights that he could not quite reach. I still enjoyed the film immensely. There were great suspense elements that left me with the thrilling thrill of waiting for thrillers, and I realized this purely psychologically, without resorting to blood and bloodshed. The soundtrack and the decor added perfectly to the suspense. Sometimes he was a bit unpolite, especially the acting and character development. It could not have been a better film than if we knew more about the nightmares of the past that the characters see when they close their eyes and why they feel this desperate need to search for the "answer" that is an integral part of the story . After all, they seemed to keep looking for him, even if they knew or at least had a clue what could happen to them when they found him. I would recommend watching this movie if you are ready to look beyond the box to see the potential of a rough diamond.
