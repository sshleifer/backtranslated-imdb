After reading all the reviews on this movie, I'm still amazed by Fox's reluctance to release a full-screen version restored to DVD. Yes, the story is perhaps a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was Fox's second Real Cinemascope film and the production values ​​alone deserve a restoration and a distribution. I saw this movie in the second year and it sparked my long-standing interest in everything Egyptian, culminating during my visit to Egypt 4 years ago! Incredible movie's power over a child's imagination, huh? In high school, I read the book and promised myself to make this dream trip. However, this film was made in the style "old school", which means that the Egyptians were represented by British with pink skin and blue eyes. However, did anyone see the current series of HBO "ROME"? All that is old is still old. We can not imagine why, nowadays, we continue to recruit actors like aristocrats of Mayfair in the Roman drag. No actor from ROME could pass for an old Italian. That being said, the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in the history of mankind. This film is extremely attractive (to quote NEFER) for its historical information (BEER! BRAIN SURGERY! IRON!), As well as for its superb cinematography and score. I have a terrible DVD version of Taiwan that I watch over and over again praying that someday a restored widescreen version will be available. For anyone interested in this topic, I highly recommend the historical novel "A God Against the Gods" by the author of Advise and Consent. If one of your movie buffs knows how to contact Fox to encourage them, please let me know!
