Some points to address in response to the comment of the previous person. You just have to pay attention to what's going on in the movie. <br /> <br /> (I guess they are spoilers) <br /> <br /> The red stuff under David's mouth? Poison of ivy, the woman says not to scratch it or otherwise "it will spread". <br /> <br /> David becomes "crazy" because the stranger tells him to get out of the house, which probably proves the theory of a case that is going on between the wife and the stranger; he runs after the man. <br /> <br /> David does not lose him in the woods, he just strikes the stranger a few times and leaves his wife to pick up the coins. <br /> <br /> Only the woman eats the mushroom. <br /> <br /> I must say that after this point with the woman and the stranger, I began to be disappointed. But the end is composed for the entire film. <br /> <br /> And for that and for the very last scene ... it's one of my favorite movies. I should have assembled it earlier, but I got distracted. Honestly, I was really surprised. <br /> <br /> This film is interesting, it's the least we can say. But if you do not look at it for the performances that the actors give, I'd say you'd better drop it, because that's all that keeps this film in place.
