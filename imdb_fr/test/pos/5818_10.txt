Life is crazy. You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We are all a little Minnie and a little Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems better to be discerning ... but then what might be missing? <br /> <br /> You must be yourself. You do not have to park cars and shout at random on people, but you can not hide behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend and act as if everything is fine. And sometimes you really have to be careful, because why are you still alive? <br /> <br /> I will not evaluate this love in comparison to other Cassavetes films, because they are all absolutely unique works and each their own act of expression and exploration of our lives. In this sense, they are all excellent and the comparisons are odious. Of course, this film has this crazy quality, sometimes infuriating, but finally wonderful and liberating that all his films have: you never know what will happen, and you never know what the characters will think, do or feel. following. The characters themselves either - and do we really want to live our lives differently? Unlike Moskowitz, you can have a great job and spend money wisely in your IRA, while living the life of an adventurer in your feelings, your mind and your life experience. Yes, we can have both. This is what Cassavetes shows us. Thank God, someone did it.
