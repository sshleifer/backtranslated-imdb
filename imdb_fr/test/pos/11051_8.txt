For Greta Garbo's first talking film, MGM cleverly chose ANNA Christie, winner of the Eugene O'Neill Pulitzer Award of 1921. <br /> <br /> Similarly, producers supported Garbo not with one but two members from the original Broadway cast (George Marion in the role of Anna's father, Chris, and James T. Mack in the role of priest Johnny - transmuted in "Johnny the harp" for the movies so as not to offend). <br /> <br /> This small change is interesting. Like too many films accused (by those who want FILMS to be FILMS and ignores their origins) to be little more than filmed plays, the problem is not the play but the filmmakers who would not be more faithful to the property. . By diluting a cinematic stage work so as not to shock anyone, or by opening it up because they COULD, too much lose the very qualities that made the piece worth filming. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the studio's respect for O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in Frances Marion's generally sensitive screen adaptation. Marvel of wonder, Marion allows even the point of the scene where Anna de Garbo reveals her past on "the farm" to the man she wants to marry and the father who sent her tactfully! What did the League of Decency have to think about that! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in the source piece has always been that Chris's friend, Marthy, tends to move away from the first act, then disappear from the last two so that Anna can staging - both sides of the truly good woman men do not always recognize. Marie Dressler (who had already made her debut on the Broadway stage before going to Hollywood) is a perfect balance for Anna as well for Garbo as Anna in this area and for the fast-moving film just 90 minutes, not does not leave us too much time to miss it - one of the few benefits to showing the atmosphere instead of being eloquently described in the original - the scriptwriter AND is wise enough to get away from O'Neill for bring Dressler back for a moving tour. This scene two-thirds of the film will remind much to the appearance of Julie Laverne in SHOW BOAT. <br /> <br /> The beginnings of Anna and Marthy's scene (16 minutes after the beginning of the film) measure each other and create all the tension of the rest of the story which counts among the most moving scenes of the room. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> ANNA Christie is a great tragic play and a good drama. It is hard to imagine that a remake of the last days, which would almost certainly lose the courage and atmosphere of this remake of 1930 (shot for the first time without sound in 1923 - also with George Marion's Broadway Chris) - could improve this excellent shoot. <br /> <br /> The internal scenes are the most like the show, but no one should miss the outside. Although the wallpaper does not match modern technical standards, the background gives a better insight than most of the world's era movies where the game is played (especially in the port of New York). <br /> <br /> Almost all of Garbo's naturalistic performances in the era of sound have stood up well (only the scene of the often-parodied death of CAMILLE, 7 years later, will occasionally attract sneers because of heavy management and parodies), but this ANNA Christie, with the variety of his 1932 films, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the sublime Lubitsch, his comedy of 1939, NINOTCHKA ("Garbo laughs!"), is surely his better. <br /> <br /> O 'Neill fans who are fascinated by this piece at the edge of his famous "sea plays" should find the good movie of the Second World War released the year before the entry of the States States in the conflict, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). He is almost as cleverly drawn from these sea plays as this is from ANNA Christie and presents a young John Wayne in one of his few non-Westerners, who supports a fine cast of veteran actors telling him the way to to follow.
