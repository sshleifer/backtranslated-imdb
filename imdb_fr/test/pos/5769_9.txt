A sign of what to expect in this film came when I noticed that it was the first (and probably the last) movie to have in its credits a "Technician Vomit". <br /> <br /> Hours of silly gags, hilarious violence and great burlesque humor. <br /> <br /> This movie was exactly what you wanted from the boys at the bottom, and it's a pleasure to see them in great shape after Rik Mayall's life. a threatening accident. <br /> <br /> Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are too similar to their bottom characters, so we can have reviews, and Edmondson does a surprisingly good job in also making the film. <br /> <br /> This film has already given rise to predictable comparisons with the Fawlty towers that are simply not there, and the Paradiso Guest House itself is hardly torquay! <br /> <br /> Beware of excellent clients dialogue between violence and chaos. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the background, you'll probably hate that - but I loved it.
