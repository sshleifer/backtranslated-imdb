My daughters 4 and 6 love this show. We came across a PBS station and they always ask us when it's on. It reminds them of their grandmother who looks after them every day in the summer. It's funny too and sometimes they keep talking about one scene or another. I would definitely recommend this show to all young children. It is very clean and shows you that you have to slow down and not watch TV all day long. When Nana reads a story, she is slow and she talks about each page with Mona. It reminds me to slow down when I read the following book to my daughters at bedtime and talk about this book instead of going through it just to make it sleep.
