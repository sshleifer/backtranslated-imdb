Shattering film on the making of a movie. Shows the intense and strange relationships that can develop between filmmakers and their actors; manipulation and games of the mind; the egoism of the performers. As in any workplace, sexuality complicates things, but here at the n ° degree, because they film a scene of sex. <br /> <br /> Absolutely fantastic performances of Grégoire Colin as fragile, macho male wannabe in the lead, and Anne Parillaud self-portrait of the director. The image of her laughing and eating a banana at the end, having finally got what she wants from her puppets, is pure delight.
