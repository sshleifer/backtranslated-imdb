As an independent Long Island filmmaker and having had two theatrical releases to my credit, I had always been told how much I could learn from watching a FRED CARPENTER production. "as an introduction to his great budgets, production, casting, sets and stage talents, my heart turned to his characters, his story and was totally conquered by the end of the turn / tilt that made it possible the plot of the film! The places are wonderfully chosen and the human emotions in his characters bring a realistic link to my link with all the elements that Mr. Carpenter has used throughout, for the benefit of his film!
