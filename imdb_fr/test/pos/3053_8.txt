Know that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist about Music Hall, I know what is associated with the New York site or not. Theodore's film is just the "Music Hall". No Rockette is in the movie. Only wonderful skaters, great actors and fun. I just thought you would like to know. Really a wonderful movie. You will never know who the "murderer" is by watching this movie ... until the end. What a beautiful terrain and beautiful ice skating. You never see that kind of performance again. The Roxy Theater and the Center Theaters in New York presented ice skating shows!
