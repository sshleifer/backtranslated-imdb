The most attractive factor in this masterpiece of a movie is not the beauty of the main actors. Nor is it their exceptional acting work and their hot chemistry. <br /> <br /> For me, it's the staging of the whole film. Settings, lighting, props ... all this adds to the atmosphere of love between the main characters. A puff of smoke from Chow's cigarette tells us his state of mind. Lizhen's tight cheongsams, always changing, reflect the constraints of decision-making. /> <br /> The excellent use of Mis-En-Scene gives the film the amount of sensations needed to embody the complex nature of the relationship between the characters. The film leaves the public unsuccessful aspirations.
