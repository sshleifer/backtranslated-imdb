It was an excellent movie. I am dealing with a child I raised who has FAE and watching this movie was more than just words can explain. I also bought the book and it was great. I would like a copy for my personal use and for my son's teachers to view it as well. I would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a while, or refer someone to buy it. Thank you, Myra. I would recommend this film to anyone caring for children / adults with special abilities. This film should be rebroadcast on television. The team of doctors who were following my son would also like to have a copy. His special education teacher also asked me to try to find a copy he might have or could borrow. <br /> <br /> Thank you
