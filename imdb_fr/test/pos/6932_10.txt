Todd Sheets has created one of the greatest LOW BUDGET zombie movies. The story is excellent, the blood is great, the psychos are mean! Yet the film sometimes lacks dialogue and slow imagery. <br /> <br /> Even so, ZB2 offers what every Zombie movie should offer: gore, good screenplay, fast adventure in the macarb. If only the sheets of paper MR had received a budget of $ 100,000, this film would remove EVERY zombie movie, even the all-powerful Dawn of the dead. <br /> <br /> But over time, he improves and as he wins, more money goes into his pocket. Thus allowing this man today, the modern genius, to better formulate his vision. <br /> <br /> Just remember that Zombie Bloodbath 2 was only one of his big stepping stones when he was at the top of Gore Mountain.
