When I saw Going with the wind, I thought there could be no better actors than Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable to play Scarlett and Rhett, but I saw the movie Scarlet. I fell in love with this dramatic story. I love Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler, he is fantastic. It's a movie I could watch a thousand times and that would not bother me.
