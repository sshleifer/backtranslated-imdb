The film was certainly faithful to the real story on which it was based. It was difficult for me to find newspaper articles on the real facts, but when I found them, I could see that the truth, in this case, was stranger than the fiction. Judith Light was terribly perverse in her role as a mother in this film, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role, which I think is an excellent performance. Rick Schroder was completely helpless because his son had also defended him in court. This is an example of the difficulty, in some circumstances, for a child to accept the actions of a parent, no matter how criminal they are. One can find fault with the film, but not with its treatment of the reality on which it was based.
