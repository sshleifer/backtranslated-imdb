I saw 2:37 at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and I was blown away! A scene of panic opens this film at 2:37 pm in a high school in Adelaide. This scene is not resolved by the time we go back to the beginning of the day and we introduce teenagers who are preparing to go to school. The audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters and explores everyday issues facing teens - including drugs, promiscuity, homosexuality, bullying and violence. Each scene is played again and again from the point of view of different teenagers and recalls Gus Van Sant's elephant. This is a remarkable film by the director for the first time, Murali K. Thalluri. It was made with non-professional student actors and was the subject of unprecedented work in 76 scenario projects. It features breathtaking performances by a number of student actors, most notably Teresa Palmer as Melody. This film of maturity is both intimate and stimulating, with a surprising and disturbing end.
