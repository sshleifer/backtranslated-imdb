This film was a riot, it made fun of "Madonna - Truth Or Dare" in all the right places. I love Madonna and I like Julie Brown. How could I ask for more ... Julie's parody of "Vogue", entitled "Wave" was hysterical ... "Kelly LeBrock think she's great, she's just crazy on a paper plate". "Brooke Shields, Dawber, Pam Spam Personality" !! I could have died! And wait to see what she can do with a watermelon!
