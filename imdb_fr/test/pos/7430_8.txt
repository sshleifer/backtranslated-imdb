Errol Flynn had a gift for comedy that was unfortunately rarely exploited. With the right material, this film demonstrates that he could have been comfortable in a soft comedy in the manner of Cary Grant. Out of its various incursions in the genre it is certainly the best. Patti Brady gives a great performance in the kid part and Eleanor Parker is just beautiful through the movie. The wonderful Hattie McDaniel, unfortunately underused in this film, is an added bonus. Flynn performs his comic task with the same easy style he has brought to his role of bullying. The fact that it gives the impression that it is easy does not mean that it is the case. A great little family comedy, ideal for the Christmas season or any other time when you want to be cheerful.
