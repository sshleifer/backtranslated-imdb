The incredibly impressive romance of Kar Wai Wong is for me, perfect. Located in the 1960s in Hong Kong. As we are shown, this happens in a turbulent period. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman who meet in an apartment in Hong Kong, in which they both live. Chow Mo-wan works for a newspaper company. Su Li-zhen Chan is secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan create a special bond after discovering that their wives and spouses are constantly committing extra-marital histories. One with the other. <br /> <br /> The characters of Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are simply incredible. Leung and Cheung both manage to create a chemistry as amazing as it is better than any other Hollywood romance revealed today. Combined. The film focuses on the focus of the two main actors and their feelings after the infidelities of their partners. Kar Wai Wong manages to create a character development so strong between these two characters, that you really start to feel the feelings. Leung and Cheung are both incredibly incredible and are better than any Hollywood couple shown on the screen today. Combined. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to describe Fa yeung nin wa if not a beautiful and energetic romance that also offers a dark and atmospheric piece with a superb cinematography. So many elements of this film contribute to make it irreproachable. In addition to Kar Wai Wong and acting, the cinematographic images of Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee are obsolete. Beautifully sober. The clich√©s of Kar Wai Wong help your mind to create its own world. A world that creates these characters. Original, melancholy and nostalgic. This film is incredibly memorable. <br /> <br /> The costumes created by William Chang, one of Kar Wai Wong's regulars, are absolutely beautiful. Cheung, who wears an elegant dress with beautiful patterns up to the ankle in every scene. She is a stage thief. His costumes say a lot about his character and an emotion slips into all his dresses, bright colors and elegantly used. Very original. Chang, also the interior designer, creates a brilliant setting for the dark room of the film. Especially with the help of the wonderful music used in the scenes and the masterful editing of the film, again by Chang. William Chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an unsung hero of this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is one of the best of this millennium. Incredibly convincing and filled with nostalgia. The shots are mesmerizing and haunting. Kar Wai Wong proves to be a master at the top of his art. The game; the music; cinematography; publishing; production; Costume and direction help create ONE perfect little movie. A masterpiece in making love movies. Visually spectacular. Overall, a masterpiece of filmmaking. A film that reminds me of the old Hollywood classic was the one that never was. Never forget Fa yeung nin wa. I know I will not do it.
