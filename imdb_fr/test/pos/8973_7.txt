Well, we certainly saw and many other people and myself were expecting worse. There were some good things too, but I did not expect him to fail in other areas anyway. <br /> <br /> First, the acting was above average. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I loved Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the cement of this film. If it was not for him, this film collapsed and hit the bottom. His performance was by no means amazing but absolutely necessary. He gave a good spiritual and cynical performance in what most other actors could easily have made his character a clich√©. Tom Hanks really gave a great performance and did not disappoint, but he did not impress. What I could not bear is that Julia Roberts was involved in this movie. It was as big as a misunderstanding I've ever seen. For her, it's a bad actress, at least for me, she was too young for her character and she was wrong even for the character she played. <br /> <br /> The realization was average for me. I'm not really a big fan of Mike Nichols' recent movies and this one does not impress me either. It was made with a Hollywood touch cap and caricature that I could not bear. The worst thing about all this is that he tried to make it a really meaningful movie at the end. I love meaningful movies, but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two to the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the waste spread throughout the movie. This is something Mike Nichols seems to have done a lot in his recent record. <br /> <br /> The most impressive part of this movie was writing. The dialogue was very well organized and allowed the story to unfold. The writing was what really was able to bring this movie to an above average level. In so many scenes, I partly mocked the writing. <br /> <br /> That's what we saw at least. Most of the scenery was good in the movie if you understand what I mean, but not much else. I liked that this movie does not glorify everything America has done. It is obvious that throughout the war in Afghanistan, the United States gave arms to the people who are now against us. We are too blamed for this film. This shows that what may seem good in the short term can turn into a horribly false in the future. This film had a good original message but it did not give it correctly. Overall, it was entertaining.
