When I was younger and today, Mr. Bean is a work of genius. Rowan Atkinson, three-time BAFTA nominee, has been chosen to portray the almost silent (mimicking) stranger in search of a human, falling on Earth, causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes. He tried to pass an examination, put his trousers in front of a blind man (he did not know he was blind), went to church, tried to dive beside a pool, had lunch on a park bench, saw a scary The film, changed in his car, picnic with a fly, spend Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), take care of a baby in Portsmouth, go to the Room 426 at the Queens Hotel in Portsmouth and wins a pet contest with his Teddy. , drove to the top of his Mini on a new chair and even met and knocked out the queen. Among the guests were Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock of They think it's over, Caroline Quentin, David Schneider of The Day Today, Richard Wilson, Eryl Maynard of The Fast Show and Roger Lloyd of the Vicar of Dible. He has been nominated for BAFTAs for the best comedy (program or series) and the best light entertainment program. Rowan Atkinson was the number 18 of the 50 biggest British actors, the number 24 of the Comedian and the number 8 of the British favorite. Exceptional!
