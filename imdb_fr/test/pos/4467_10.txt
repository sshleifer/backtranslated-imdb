It's Lucio Fulci at his best. If only all the films he had made were like that. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary film is as intriguing as Dario Argento's "Bird with the Crystal Plumage" ... <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Argento but you're not do not like Lucio Fulci's films, like <br /> <br /> "The Beyond", "Manhattan Baby", "The Cemetery House", etc. This one has nothing to do. to do with others ... this is what Italians call "giallo" ... it would be a bit like a film "that has finished" is done "in a word. <br /> <br /> You do not know who the killer is until the last moments of the film. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, there is the plot: a maniac living in a small village begins to kill little boys ... A journalist (Tomas Milian), a sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet), a priest (Marc Porel), her mother (Irene Papas) and a witch (Florinda Bolkan) are the main characters of this tangled and bloody story. > <br /> Talking about the actors, I want to say that Tomas Milian is superb (as always) and Florinda Bolkan is great ... the witch of the village ... <br /> <br /> Do you want to know who is the murderer? ... <br /> <br /> I can not tell you ... but I can tell you that you have to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10 ) ... of course!
