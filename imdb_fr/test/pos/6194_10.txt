I found this show by accident and was surprised to discover that no one I knew had ever heard of it. It was by far one of the best shows I've seen in months or even years, and I can not wait to see more episodes out. Sleeper Cell describes the psychological struggle of an undercover agent inside a terrorist cell, who must constantly make difficult decisions in order to maintain his coverage while remaining true to his true cause. It's an extremely well done show. It intrigues you from the first episode to the end and, although slowly progressing, it's fast enough for you to feel at the edge. Really realistic and human, it covers important topics and each episode is an interesting question to ponder. This show is not one of the cops on television and does not try to be anything. It's authentic and unique. It is a show about a human being, his difficult choices and his life of struggle, where a simple mistake can cost him anything. <br /> <br /> I attributed to this show a 10 for a good screenplay, a good progression, an excellent cinema, excellent music and realistic characters each with a story to tell.
