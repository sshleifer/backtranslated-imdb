I was anxiously awaiting the release of this DVD (and its follow-up {A Prisoner Scorpion: Grudge Song} # 701)) for some time. I really liked the first two movies in this series. After watching this movie, I must say it's probably my favorite of the three. <br /> <br /> These three films were made by Shunya Ito. What's great about them is that even though they all have the same main character (beautifully played by Meiko Kaji), they are all very different from each other. <br /> <br /> The first film (Female Prisoner No. 701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical film of Women In Prison. But the character of Scorpion is very intriguing - he reminds many anti-heroes of many spaghetti westerns. And the director has often used very interesting and unusual visual approaches. <br /> <br /> The second film (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a tour de force. It's not really a WIP movie, but Scorpion and six other prisoners escaped. <br /> <br /> This film (Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito. This one plays much more like a police drama. Once again, our heroine is on the run. But this time, she managed to maintain some normalcy in her life (relatively speaking anyway). She finds a job, she finds a home, she makes a friend outside. But, of course, everything must finally be undone. FPS: Beast Stable has a simpler story that is told more slowly than its predecessors. But I found that it involved from beginning to end. And do not worry: there is still a lot of depravity in this movie! But I think that these films transcend most of the exploitation films, because the most disturbing elements are interpreted in a lighter tone rather than being used exclusively for an in situ shock. Yes, there have certainly been moments in this film where I fell sharply. But I did not think they had hurt the value of the story (well, maybe once or twice). One thing that I really enjoyed in these films is the ongoing construction of the Scorpio myth. With this entry, the development of characters is much more used than in the two previous ones. We see that she is more than just an avenging tough guy! <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier in this review, a fourth movie followed. He also introduced Meiko Kaji as Scorpion, but had a different director. Without revealing anything, I want to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way as to render a sequel totally useless. The fourth film is still pretty good but it seems to play a superficial role in a hallucinatory trilogy. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in extra-ordinary movies. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed alone (like the first two movies), but I would also advise you to watch others first if you have not already done so.
