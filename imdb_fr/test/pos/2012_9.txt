I enjoyed this show, it was broadcast in the UK, but not at rush hour, and they seemed to have moved all of this above schedule, so I could not watch them all. I was surprised not to be back and I did not know why, but I guess it's not important. <br /> <br /> The two best performances were excellent. They were very credible as friends. . The two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. I guess it was part of a whole series of lifestyle-oriented shows, friends being the obvious main event, but sex in the city took place a few years later. <br /> <br /> The characters go out to have a coffee, they drink in nice bars, that sort of thing, a little woody allenish somehow.
