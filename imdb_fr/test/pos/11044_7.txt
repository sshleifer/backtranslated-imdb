"Anne Christie" was Garbo's 14th film and the first in which her Swedish voice was heard. She plays the main character, Anna, who has struggled to be abandoned by her father Chris (a drunk barge owner played by George F Marion), and to the misfortune of the life she has to lead to keep her head out. the water. <fr /> <br /> The meeting with Irishman Matt (Charles Bickford) could mark a turning point for her ... or does he? Garbo looks great in this drama that, while seemingly rather clumsy and moving at a slow pace, still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later. Marie Dressler plays a role in the role that has earned her a second chance of success in such films as Min and Bill, Dinner at Eight and Emma; while Marion and Bickford are more than enough. <br /> <br /> An interesting slice of the film's story. Garbo would speak better in the following years, but Anna Christie will always be remembered for the first time she spoke on screen.
