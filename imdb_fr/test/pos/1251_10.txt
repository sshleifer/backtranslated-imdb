It's so nice to see Bruce Willis get off his action throne and see that he's really a talented actor. He shines in this film as an almost 40-year-old image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner child - until he meets him face to face. It's one of those rare films that does not leave the audience indifferent and really offers something to the family. It's about taking care of each other, keeping a part of the child inside of you and realizing that you are not growing up exactly as you thought. Willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with children (just look at "The Sixth Sense" with Haley Joel Osment), and he has excellent chemistry with Spencer Breslin here. There is nice photography and music, and the end is beautiful and uplifting. A great movie to do with ALL of your family members.
