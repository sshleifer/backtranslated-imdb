Having been a faithful fan of Asterix all my life, I must say that "Asterix and the Vikings" is probably the most successful of all Asterix movies. It contains very funny jokes and the animation is superb. As many people have pointed out, this does not really fit the plot of the comic ("Asterix and the Normans"), but in many ways it's just as good, because this book is , in my opinion, remarkable. We have a lot of fun in the culture of the sixties, and most of them are very old. <br /> <br /> What really made me shudder was the way they incorporated a Disney-style plot into the film that diverted the attention of Asterix and Obelix. We have a misunderstood boy who does not fit, Justforkix. We have a boy girl who is not suitable because she wants to be treated on an equal footing with men, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened because the boy is ashamed to be totally honest with a girl, but in the end, their love wins out. This is the plot of so many Disney movies (and, what's just, other studios as well) that it's not funny and that the plot was old twenty years ago. I mean, they even gave Justforkix a whimsical animal companion. <br /> <br /> Not only did I find this derivative and this cliche, but it really hurt the story and left me dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> I think that says a lot about the quality of the rest of the film and the fact that I still enjoy it so much, despite the misplacement of the plot.
