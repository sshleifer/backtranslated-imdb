* SPOIL ALERT !! PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE SPOILED MOVIE !! * <br /> <br /> Initially I planned to see this movie last weekend, but my plans eventually made me unable to see it. he. So me and my friend planned to see him after school today. Boy, we are happy to have done it. The film begins in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as "Napster" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], left ear [Mos Deaf] and John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a flight to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the full opening, which lasts 10 to 15 good minutes, and involves a pursuit by boat, which opens the film straight. As he drives away in their van, Steve Frezelli attacks the group, steals the gold medal and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retired) leader of the group. En route for a year later, where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the best puzzles that anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for his father's death, when he was calling on her to retire) said they found Steve (who hid) and wanted to take revenge for what he did. . She refuses first, but later agrees, and the team gets together, with the help of Wrench (Franky G), mechanic, to make the perfect flight, while creating one of the biggest traffic jams of the history of Los Angeles. This film is a perfect mix of action with fun elements. There's a joke going on about Seth Green's character, Lyle, who created Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who made a cameo) stole it while he was falling asleep, and Lyle ended up answering only it is called "Napster". There's even a funny phrase in Seth's film that says, "He said in an interview that he called it Napster because he described his hair as if it were a diaper. because * I * took a nap when he stole them! " The beginning and ending sequences are just great, and everything in between is perfect. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's role was a little weak. He was not a big bad guy. He acted as if he was paid and was only the bare minimum (which is a fact, because he was forced to make this film because of a contractual obligation). But, even with this problem as the only real problem of the movie, the movie is still very nice and I highly recommend seeing it. And even if the movie does not interest you, go see Seth Green shine in the comic role. He is perfect. Note: **** on *****
