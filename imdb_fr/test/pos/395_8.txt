Victor Mature, a barely civilized and out-of-control mountain man and trapper, may be featured on the poster, but Robert Preston, a failed Union colonel, led his men to be "cut into ribbons" by the Confederate artillery of Shiloh. sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence, has the most interesting part, married to a young and hard to recognize early Anne Bancroft. The uncivilized mature lusts of the colonel's wife give the film an interesting and dark subplot that goes so far as to refer to the lust of another man's wife at a given moment of James Whitmore, who interprets the figure of the father, the older, wiser man of the mountain. Directed by Anthony Mann, this film is lost among its most famous westerns with James Stewart, but even so, you do not really need the Indian threat to make a film worthy of interest, although Preston can prove his bad judgment as commander again in a failed expedition to finally subdue the Indians, in a well-organized attack in the forest that quickly turns into a rout.
