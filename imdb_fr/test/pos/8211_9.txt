So far, all comments on this film are negative, but I must say that I found "The Net" interesting. Few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat but this one did it. Another advantage is that most action / suspense movies are full of language, but this one has few blasphemies. I found a nice movie to watch. However, I am a bit biased, being a big fan of Sandra Bullock. *wink*
