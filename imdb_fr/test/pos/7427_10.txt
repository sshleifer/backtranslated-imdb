This film is a hidden gem. I do not understand why this movie does not have more airtime. Errol and Eleanor Parker are an attractive and daring couple. And their chemistry is impeccable. I really liked his daughters' contact with him as Robin Hood. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Errol Flynn. It's nice to see Errol play a father too. According to all the testimony of his own children, he was a very attentive and affectionate father in real life. In addition, the support cast is wonderful too. You can not go wrong supporting players like Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson. Hattie McDaniel makes a much better movie right off the bat. This film has now become a holiday tradition at home. Enjoy!!!
