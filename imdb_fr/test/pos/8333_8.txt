During the Second World War, the United States developed a brand new HUGE bomber. Lois Lane and Clark Kent will cover the history of the aircraft for his first mission. Lois embarks on the plane before taking off. There are also Japanese saboteurs on board who intend to fly the bomber in Tokyo. Will Lois be able to warn Superman? What do you think? <br /> <br /> A colorful and fast cartoon. The animation is a little jerky but much better than anything we see today. The color and sound have been beautifully restored. Just two problems - ugly partition and racism (especially in the title). That aside, that's fine. An 8.
