I am stunned and dismayed by the number of critics on this site who did not understand the purpose of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black-and-white relationships or old / young relationships, although I think director Craig Brewer deliberately added both elements to refine the imagined taboos. This is not sexual abuse or sexual addiction, although Christina Ricci's character, Rae, is a typical example. This is not a popular religion in the black community, although religion plays an important role. It's not a love story, although there is not one, but two happy couples in the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where "everything is warmer", although it is located in the south and it is undeniably hot; Saint Smoker, even the slogan writers did not understand the point. <br /> <br /> Black Snake Moan is a parable about the Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they play, how it heals them. <br /> <br /> It's as if movie producers sit with a blank slate and ask, "Okay, if we wanted to help people understand what Blues really is, what would it look like ? "Then they put it in the rural south. Then they imagine two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes to war and his abused daughter sleeps with everyone in town. Then we will throw in a graying sociality, touched just a little by the popular religion (they know that Jesus wants their life, and although they respect him, they know they can not give him that), violence between men and women, and a lot of smoking sexual images, including - ready to go on top? - a black man wearing a sleeveless jersey holding a white girl half-naked at the end of a 40-lb chain Fill it with authentic blues delta sounds, turn it into a real blues picker, use the music As the main healing element in the plot, staple clips of the Son House blues-man at both ends, and that's it - you have a modern parable the blues are all about. Even the climax of the film is not a conflict of characters, but the whole city dancing hot dances with hot blues. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by an uncontrollable lust and is cured by the religion and tenacity of Lazarus (Jackson) (and do not forget the chain.). the end. Is this an expression of a healthy life force restored, or just a little more of the same trashy behavior that ruined it in the first place? Brewer wants it on both sides, but blues is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I guess he would say that blues gives a healthy expression to both sexes (sex and violence) without going wild. I have doubts. <br /> <br /> Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget that we look at Samuel L Jackson; the man is incredibly good. He even chooses some of his own tunes in the movie and his play is authentic, dirty and hot. Christina Ricci is not usually so good. True, half of her work is done by the costume that was not there and her slender figure, but she is a wonderful combination of cynical lust, rebellion and vulnerability; Congratulations to her, she has arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to make sure he was a professional actor and not a true country minister. <br /> <br /> Parents must be aware of what they are getting if their children bring it home. The language is quite far from the charts, the first half hour is full of sexual graphics, and women are raped in twelve ways during the film (Lazare means good and is decent, but honestly, chained a woman to the radiator?) In addition, Ricci spends half of the movie dressed for sex; if you have teenagers, they will lick the screen halfway through. I do not recommend this for children of any age. Adults only, please. <br /> <br /> That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, popular religion and sexual abuse and tells a story that is redemptive in many ways. It's unorthodox, but it's worth it. And, my God, the soundtrack is hot.
