I am not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites however are Unforgiven and Tombstone. This movie however, I loved it! It was great! The plot was well done and it was a funny movie. Everyone who participated in this movie did a great job! I even think he beat both movies in one way or another. Well, not really Unforgiven, because it was a great movie that these two can not compare in the long run. I think, however, that beat Tombstone. Both had their strengths. For example, they both had some very well-known casting, very good conspiracies and very good filming. But Posse beat Tombstone in four ways in my opinion. First, the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better at Posse. The idea was original at Posse, unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference, the action sequences! Oh my God! Posse was a western with very good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was fast. Like modern shoot'em up movies. The action also had big budget explosions! The fights were very good too. Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I suggest buying this great movie!
