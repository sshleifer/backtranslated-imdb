I was really surprised when I came across this movie on cable TV a few years ago. History is a wonderful example of how our country is constantly evolving and struggling to conserve and use it as needed. Conflicting desires of the "people" and the government. The actors were fantastic in their performances and I absolutely fell in love with Tantoo Cardinal - she is so credible and was a character in this movie, just like Rip Torn. The story was also a love story about the land, the past and the two main characters. I tried to buy this movie and I can not locate it, but I would like to own it.
