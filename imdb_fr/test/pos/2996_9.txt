When I saw this movie for the first time on video in a department store ... it intrigued me. Given the fact that I thought I was in love and that I was the same age as the young people in this movie at the time (although I know they are old enough to be my parents), the more the soundtrack written by Elton John & Bernie Taupin, just before they "make a difference" in North America ... I thought I had nothing to lose by buying it. I was not deceived. <br /> <br /> So far, I've shown it to many guys I've been out with and to my current boyfriend ... obviously, they did not find him so charming than me. .. preferring to call it a movie "chick" ... but I always laugh and cry. This film has been largely neglected. It is good to see that it is available for rent in one of the local video stores around here so that other people can share the magic. <br /> <br /> It may be a little exaggerated ... but it gives you a slight sense of innocence ... and renewed faith in love.
