To consider the film as a skate documentary would not recognize several important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta (a well-known figure in skateboarding himself) produced a film that not only discusses the birth of what we know today as skateboarding, but also examines the socio-cultural and economic circumstances in which the sport has emerged and attracted great interest. In addition, his film is rather personal: the direct association of Peralta with this cultural phenomenon serves both as an informed film investigator and subject-participant involved. In this role, he is a "participant observer" par excellence, while bringing together a wide range of personalities who were an integral part of this movement and who have been deeply touched by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive and underprivileged sport. culture. The film uses a unique stylistic form of cinematographic and sound editing, and the narrative (by Sean Penn) and the interviews adopt a rather authentic and unrehearsed form, which resembles the anarchic and nihilistic spirit of surfing on the sidewalks. The film presents the kinetic appeal of a long musical video, tempered by an archaeologist's sensitivity to the importance of time, place and circumstances.
