Many years ago, I enjoyed the old old Doctor Who, so when the new one came out, I just had to check it out. I was so happy - with the characters, the story lines, the updated look, I became hooked! From season 1 (27 for old fans) to season 2 (28), it keeps getting better. This fits well with older series, although you do not need to know the old ones to enjoy this new version. <br /> <br /> Even though there was a casting change, I highly recommend Doctor Who - with Chris Eccleston AND David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that they gave the characters so much depth. The doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, perhaps because he is the last TimeLord. The range of emotions shown by Chris and David is truly remarkable and I felt with them pain, anger and sense of adventure. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to every episode, although she is much braver than me. Thanks to his talent, Billie will go far in the industry.
