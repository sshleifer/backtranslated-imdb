So, after years and years, I finally found this movie! I was dying to see how it corresponded to my memories. I distinctly remembered the plans of the ghost boy running in the mine, waiting behind two wooden boards crossed in the mine shaft, just looking with a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most scary shot of my childhood, I remember chills running down my back. Looking at him now, he is obviously far from being so scary, but rather unconsciously strange to see the same pictures again. If anyone wants a copy, send them a private message. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty classic. It is strange that the message is rather blurred this time around: there is no real morality (except that "ghosts are there to help us?" Or "do not have prejudices against ghosts!"). greed / capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. However, the captain committed an irresponsible act on a large scale, encouraging both children to follow the vague implications of a ghost, not only in a mine, but in a new borehole, which is totally dangerous. The captain then encourages the children to go down a huge ladder, deep in the mines, just because he thinks the ghost wants them too. It's also a little strange that the ghost chooses the boy to help the trapped adults, not just to help the trapped adults manage. Never mind.
