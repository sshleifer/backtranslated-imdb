Having never read or seen the original work of Bard, I can not begin to compare this work to its history. So I will not do it. Instead, I'll just say it was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that seemed a little more modest in the budget but decent enough to take advantage of). I thought all the main actors were doing a good job. The magic style seemed blacker than white and will surely offend anyone who gets mad at this kind of thing, but I thought it was well done.
