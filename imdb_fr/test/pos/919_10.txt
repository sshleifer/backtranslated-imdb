I use IMDB a lot. Mostly reading other people's comments about movies I did not see. I thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life and how I look like a movie. I think I've seen it at least a dozen times since the fall of '94, when I first saw it at the theater. <br /> <br /> I think Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think it's his best. It was his last. I was very sad the day I learned he had died, because we had certainly lost the opportunity to get something more. <br /> <br /> RED is simply the best Kieslowski + incredible movie of Trintignant & Jacob + Sobocinski's cinematography. If you have not seen it, look for it !!! If you have any, come back! <br /> <br /> Red: just a masterpiece. please, forgive my poor English!, reader
