Tommy Boy, Peter Segal's 1995 cult film, is a hilarious film, an evergreen artist. Chris Farley is a talent we will never forget !!! <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is a simple story, told in the most funny and zany way possible. Farley & Spade begin a journey filled with unstoppable laughs, even the portion of Rob Lowe is damn funny. As a child, I remember watching "Tommy Boy" again and again and again. This is part of my childhood favorites and it will always remain so. Even today, when he comes on T.V. I stick to that as an unconditional fan. I'm pretty possessive about this movie. <br /> <br /> The management of Segal is great. Chris Farley may have died in 1997, but still live for me. What actor! Look at his work in "Tommy Boy", he is so comfortable. He then made fantastic performances in such films as "Berverly Hills Ninja" and "Almost Heroes", but his work here remains the best to date! I love you, Farley! Spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. He is an excellent actor in all respects! <br /> <br /> Rules of "Tommy Boy" .... 100 inches of this writer!
