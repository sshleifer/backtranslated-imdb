That's right, we have a 2008 movie using the themes of "Brief Encounter" and "The Bridges of Madison County". It is essentially the story of the lost loves, the redemption and the triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> The performances of Richard Gere and especially Diane Lane are very good. Gere gives here the kind of restricted performance as a doctor in search of meaning after the death of a patient on the operating table. Lane is the mother of a rebellious girl and a nice young son who separated from her wandering husband and who also lost her father the same year. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn steals the show in a meeting scene with Gere. He is the broken-hearted husband and he tells his love to his deceased wife, it will make you cry. <br /> <br /> Just back from her triumph as a "doubtful" mother, Viola Davis appears as a friendly understanding in the film and literally hangs her hair in a rather benign performance.
