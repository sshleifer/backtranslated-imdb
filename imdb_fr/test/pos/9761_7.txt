If you like the book, like me, stop watching the video after the meeting between Jean and Joe in Australia. Until then, this is a fairly faithful interpretation of the book and the graphics are excellent. 10 out of 10 at this point and I have enjoyed it several times. After that, the story is seriously rearranged and revised so as to destroy the essence of the book, that is, how John created a city like Alice (Springs). In the early days, the main change is to make Strachan a single 40-year-old instead of a widower aged seventy. It rather distorts this love story, especially when there are also small changes that help make it more selfish and stingy, such as: in the book, he lets Joe know from the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in Australia, but in the video, he gives Joe no idea of ​​John's whereabouts or intentions. The last hour of the 5-hour video scans and distorts the last third of the book. I do not see any reason why they got into a brawl between Joe and Jean - it's completely wrong and seems to be just a crazy Australian at Pommies for telling them what to do. Then they bring Strachan for the wedding (instead of three years later) and ask him to read the toast !! - very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel as expressed in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the writers. These abominations took time during the last hour, which was not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how John recreates Willstown as a place where she and Joe can be happy.
