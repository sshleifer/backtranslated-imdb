In addition to having minor flaws, this film is a masterpiece and certainly the best war movie I've seen. Not the mention, it's one of the best movies I've seen in every genre. I might have written that for No Man's Land, but now I think it's better. It was very sad at the end and I almost cried after the two shocking scenes that took place within 5 minutes after the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Karel's performance as the main character was fascinating, although he is supposed to be a rookie given his age. This film makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least approaches you) and makes you hate any form of war and politics. Flashbacks at the prison hospital make the movie even more delicious. <br /> <br /> One of the flaws of the film is the non-British accent of the so-called British. Most British on-screen were actually British, but what about those who are supposed to be British and speak with a foreign accent? It really does not fit into this adorable movie. But that's about the only flaw I've noticed. The effects could also be a little better, but we all remember many movies from one country in particular, which have a huge FX effect and absolutely nothing else. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is a total masterpiece and each individual should see it. If you want to travel in Czechoslovakia in the 1940s and if you want to witness virtually a huge amount of emotions at once, this film is for you. If you do not want to do that, this movie will make you want to do it.
