No, "Lifeforce" is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's an average film with good effects and a captivating story (and of course Mathilda May). This is perhaps one of my favorite SF / horror movies for the simple reason that they are trying to reason through the science of space vampires. How many times do you see this? Even in "Alien" (the SF movie / horror of all time), science does not enter history at all. In "Lifeforce", they try to make reason an unreasonable world. <br /> <br /> Now, do I think it's a success? No, I think the film raises the problem of a massive ensemble cast that Hooper strives to keep together and on track and that viewers need to focus on more than one "villian" and there is too many trips on the road. <Br/> <br /> To be honest, the film is a feast for the eyes and a pleasure to watch. but there is great potential here for a higher remake to capture what Hooper was trying to do and really create a powerful and scary horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the remake occurs, however, I demand that Mathilda May have a cameo.
