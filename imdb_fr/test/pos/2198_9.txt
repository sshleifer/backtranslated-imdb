"Sweeney Todd" is in my opinion one of the few "perfect" musicals. Like "My Fair Lady" and "West Side Story", he has a wonderful and intelligent score. It offers the two main characters and several secondary characters interesting roles. It has a timeless theme, revenge. He has a lot of humor and is equally powerful when presented simply or on a large scale. <br /> <br /> "Sweeney Todd" tells the story of a man simply wronged during the industrial period in England. This shows man's inhumanity to man and how, in Sweeney's own words, "There are two kinds of men, there is one who remains in his place and one who has the foot in the face of the other. " In order to correct the harm done to him, Mr. Todd proposes a revenge plan. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, who owns a meat pie shop under Mr. Todd's hair salon, they decided to ask "those upstairs to serve those downstairs". <br /> <br /> I had the chance to see the original version of Broadway eight times (six with Cariou and Lansbury, the other two with Hearn and Loudon). I saw the rebirth with Bob Gunton and Beth Fowler, as well as several other concert versions. <br /> <br /> Although the technical aspects of this production are lacking, to say the least, I think this version of filmed production is the best. Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles, and they have a wonderful time playing against each other. <br /> <br /> Very good support work from Ken Jennings and Edmund Lyndeck. Although Betsy Joslyn and Cris Groenendaal, as young lovers, they have absolutely no chemistry and are fundamentally unassailable. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
