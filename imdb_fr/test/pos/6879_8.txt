Anthony Wong, the notorious actor of HK CATIII, is for once (well ... not in fact - he was cop in DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS movies and some others ...) and not in Weird psychopath in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Usually recognized for his role as a complete wackadoo in CATIII "bad guys" like THE UNTOLD STORY and EBOLA SYNDROME - this time, Wong is about to get the bad guy ... <br /> <br /> Wong plays a guy who goes to a wizard who promises to make him very sweet dreams for a price. True to her word, Wong dreams of making love to fiery schoolgirls - but dreams have a price that goes beyond the mere price of money. The wizard can manipulate dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost, make Wong sing his money and his business, kill his family and finally kill Wong himself ... Wong's brother comes to town to discover what happens, and finally discovers that the murder of his family is the work of the evil wizard - but it turns out that Wong's brother is himself a pretty wizard at the cul-de-poule and, with the help abused woman abused - reverses the situation. .. <br /> <br /> EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the most enjoyable CATIII movies I've seen in a long time. Some of the CATIII entries such as RED TO KILL, THE UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - NIGHTMARE EROTIC are missing, though they are still thin in terms of sex and subject, are more "fun" than some of the more serious kind. More like ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more "carefree" CATIII entry that offers a lot of nudity and good humor, without being too comical. This is definitely worth a look, especially for genre lovers. 8/10
