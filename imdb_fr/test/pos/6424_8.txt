"Footprints (on the Moon") is arguably the strangest, most complicated and most unusual ever created by Giallo. This may be a constraint for some fans of the subgenre, but this film does not present many of Giallo's trademarks such as bloody knife herrings. However, to compensate for all this ?? and much more ?? "Footprints" enjoys the indefinitely mysterious and non-imperative atmosphere I have ever experienced in this type of film. The level of mystery in this film is so high and unbearable that it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scary. As the female protagonist Alice Cespi herself, you have absolutely no idea what's going on or why, and this feeling of utter helplessness is without question the main highlight of the film. As a spectator, you want to help this poor woman understand the things that overcome her, but you just can not. Alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet and peaceful life is abruptly interrupted when she wakes up one morning and slowly begins to realize that she has absolutely no memory of the previous three days. She finds a torn picture of a hotel on Gama's holiday island and decides to go there to investigate what happened. On the island, several people, including a lonely little girl, seem to recognize Alice. She was the only one to use the false name Nicole, wore a red wig and acted as if she had come to the island to protect herself from an unknown danger. Meanwhile, even the poor girl's nights are restless as she has recurring dreams of astronauts jumping on the surface of the moon and a strange scientist called Dr. Blackman. The plot of "Footprints" is really weird and slowly dark, and especially the cosmic plot is really hard to relate to the rest. Alice assumes that these are just pictures of a sci-fi movie she saw a long time ago, which seems like a pretty reasonable explanation, but you feel there's a deeper meaning and a real connection to all other events. Fans of stylish and stressful Italian cinema can not afford to miss this movie. This is the psychological tour de force of director Luigi Bazzoni, with a photograph of breathtaking beauty and music that transforms the mind. Despite the lack of violence (or perhaps just because of it), the film is truly disturbing and the mental agony that Alice undergoes, frankly affects the viewer emotionally. As is unfortunately too often the case in Gialli-cinema, the highlight is suddenly quite brutal and gives almost no faultless explanation of all the difficult events you have seen for an hour and a half. Nevertheless, the content of "Footprints" will let you contemplate long after the end of the film and its powerful impact will only increase. Florinda Bolkan is sublime as a tormented star and receives excellent feedback from limited support actors, including the young Nicoletta Elmi. Klaus Kinski, the eminent star of the sect of the Euro-sect, is also honored, but his role is a long cameo. This film is actually much better than Giallo's "The Fifth Rope" of director Bazzoni, more acclaimed (and much easier to obtain), so hope that "Footprints" will soon receive an extravagant DVD.
