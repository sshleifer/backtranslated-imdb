In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the classics of the family of all time. It stars Mickey Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). <br /> <br /> Velvet wins a racehorse, named (Pie) in a raffle. She falls in love with it immediately. With the help of Mi, an ex-jockey, they train him to run in the Grand National. After the jockey who was to run Pie withdraws at the last moment, Mi convinces Velvet to take his place. <br /> <br /> This is a well-presented film. A beautiful story and an acting game of the first order. The inner game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. Here is a wonderful family photo directed by Clarence Brown. The photography is beautiful. It's a movie you'll enjoy for years to come. <br /> <br /> This image is why Elizabeth Taylor became famous. Mickey and Elizabeth stayed close after the movie. They always send postcards after all these years. <br /> <br /> One side notes. Elizabeth loved the horse "Pie" so much that the studio gave it to her.
