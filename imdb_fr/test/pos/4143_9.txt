I was lucky to be an extra in this movie when I was about 13 years old at the rink scene. My high school theater class was invited to participate. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played live music all day! As a musician, I can appreciate the tireless work and dedication of these guys in their roles. They had to play these songs 20 times. It is very difficult to maintain coherence and energy in these conditions. This is visible in a close reduction on "It's going to be the day", but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably would not have understood it. <br /> <br /> Skating all day on school day and being transported to the past was an incredible thrill. I also had my first "rendez-vous" on the film. I had to accompany a girl to the ticket office. Woo hoo! Even with an old haircut and warm lights melt Vaseline in my hair, it was worth it. Fun things. <br /> <br /> The film is excellent and is very satisfying as a whole. Busey plays his best role of all time and the cast is superb. I am happy to have participated in a great movie of the day. To think that I could have been in Corvette Summer or something like that. No. <br /> <br /> An amusing irony is that years later, I was in a video store in Malibu to watch the movie the week of its video release. Gary Busey came in and stood right next to me. I showed him the blanket and whispered how great he was and how much I was an extra and everything else. Quite weird, but very cool, for what it's worth.
