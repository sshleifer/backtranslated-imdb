I first saw this mini-series when I was a child and although I'm no longer a child, I still love it! It's hard to find professional copies, however, when it's on DVD, it's MINE !!! =] <br /> <br /> An excellent cast, great intrigues and lots of action, romance and even a lot of well-placed comedy. I am not a historian of nature, but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction!
