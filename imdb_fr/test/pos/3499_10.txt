Being American, I have never been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare. I found no pleasure in silly and silly humor in American teen movies, and although it was a slightly similar type of humor, I could not help but laugh. I almost never laugh at a movie. And usually, a movie has some fun parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over. In fact, I will buy this on DVD when I find it.
