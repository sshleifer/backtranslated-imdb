Another film "must have". Henry Brandon is a favorite! I was so surprised to learn years ago that he came from Germany because he looked and looked so typically American! And was not he great in "The Searchers" as Scar Head ?? !! Another of my favorites, I have it and watch it again and again. Now, if I could add this one to my collection, it would make my day! This is a great story of wildlife and film for all ages. The landscape is really beautiful and the fate of the threatened snow leopards is evoked with such emotion that it will arouse the interest of endangered species in anyone, especially children. If I could, I would give a copy to all my great and great greats!
