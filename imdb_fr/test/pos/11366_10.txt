I followed this whole series when I was a child in elementary school, by choice, not because it was compulsory for the school. I read the pieces to the rhythm of the series. This experience gave me a lifetime love for Shakespeare and his story. It even gave me a little bug, albeit at an amateur level. Every time I read a piece of Shakespeare's story, the images that come to mind come from this black-and-white production, seen on a large TV with a "rabbit ear" antenna, with all the "ghosts" and the flickering that go with it. it. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are minimal, if my memory is faithful, it has nothing to do with the quality of the acting. At the time, I did not know who the actors were. Now, I find that many of them have become well known over the years. I particularly enjoyed Hotspur and Hal, which I see now, were played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would love to see this available on video, especially since many pieces are rarely played and even less in video. It would also be useful as a televised production document of plays of the mid-twentieth century.
