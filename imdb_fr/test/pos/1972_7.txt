EXistenZ is about a futuristic video game about a "pod" system almost similar to virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is perpetrated on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it is repairable, the many years and $ 38 million spent on development will all be lost. However, the only way to fix the game is to play with the only person she can trust in trust (Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but it does not really start before. The best thing about this movie was the twists towards the end. Well worth a visit. 7/10
