Hey, I think this movie was awesome and it had great graphics and I was happy to be able to use Final Fantasy 7. I think this game is the best I've ever played. It's a very good movie that I loved. They should use Ether from Final Fantasy 7 again or Final Fantasy 10 both pretty awesome from: Tyler Sheena. I hope you can send me a message if you have details if there is another one. he is animated but he looks realistic enough and his fight scenes are impressive. I have not seen so fast to fight in a movie for a long time. The final game fantasy 7 is also really great, not good graphics but it's really fun and challenging
