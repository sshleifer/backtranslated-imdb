"Coconut Fred Fruit Salad Island!" is a hilarious show that takes place on Saturday morning on WB. It features Fred Coconut and all his friends on the island, and every episode is a very funny mishap. Most of the time, it's because of Fred's difficulty with coconut making antics that make him funny, and other things happening on the island at the same time. The humor is great and nobody on the island is very bright, which makes it as fun as it is. I do not think it could be funnier. The vocal talents of the characters are magnificently superior and exaggerated, which adds to the hilarity of the series. If it's never on DVD, I get it A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for good laughs.
