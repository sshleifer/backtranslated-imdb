These guys are great and everything they present to the public is first class. The musicality of this band is incredible and we should all be very grateful to live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it! I recently saw these amazing musicians playing in Houston, TX and I was blown away. I have not missed a show from the power windows and I must say they are better than ever. Everyone should embrace them and teach others what true musicality is! There will never be a trio as tight and well established in our lifetime. Let's hope and pray that they will not retire soon!
