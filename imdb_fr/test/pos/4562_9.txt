This is one of the most satisfying adaptations of the book on television. The actress who makes us believe that a Borg can be sexy makes us believe that a spy and a traitor can have certain qualities that redeem. <br /> <br /> The television script does not exactly follow Cornwell's story, but it's both exciting and rewarding. like a story of a sacred good thread. If you have a yen for uniformed romance, there is a lot of sexual energy gushing between our Sharpe man and the elongated whore. Makes me wish that his role is closer to that of books. But it does not matter if there are enough injured heroes, redeemed heroes, angry heroes, fleeing heroes and heroes in battle to keep you abreast of your DVD reading.
