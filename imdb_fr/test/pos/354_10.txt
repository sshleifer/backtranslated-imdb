* THIS COMMENT WILL LIKELY HAVE SPOILERS !! I checked the spoiler box just in case it might not have spoiler, but be aware of things if I say something you could consider a spoiler and I do not do it! * Wow ... best game since Super Mario 64. I have this game on the first day of its release, and before I got it, I looked at some gambling websites (yes, they did had already read before its release) and I was shocked. I was expecting something like Sunshine because, lately, all Mario games have gotten worse. But this one totally beat the other games. The scores on this game even beat Halo 3! It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: This is not the best, Mario's games are never known for their intrigues, and this one does not really make the difference. Bowser kidnaps Peach again, but this time invades the Mushroom Kingdom at a festival celebrated once every century. She receives a flying saucer. She throws lasers at the ground, then throws anchors into the ground and tears the castle and its foundation into space. <br /> <br /> GRAPHICS: Absolutely beautiful, the best graphics on Wii to date. The effects on the water are also very pleasant. If you ever see water, it is so real because of the effects it has put on it. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: Simply amazing, the music of this game is orchestrated. Not all, but even those who are not orchestrated always sound very good. <br /> <br /> GAMEPLAY: Very funny, it makes you want to play more and more, and for me, as usual, I tend to be very frustrated with games if I die a lot, I want to say, I'm certainly not the only one, but this game for me does not have much. Now, it's a bit like that, but not the same as Mario 64, where I get completely crazy and end up shutting down the game because it drove me crazy, this one never did. <br /> <br /> DIFFICULTY: There are two types of difficulty, because you can technically beat the game with only 60 stars, which is pretty easy, but to beat the game 100%, you have to get 120, as always, and this quest is much more difficult. but at the same time always very amusing. <br /> <br /> LENGTH: Good length, certainly not too short. It took me about 15-16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars, but 120 took me more like 45-50 hours. Now I did not play a lot, I first played a lot a day, then a few hours each day, and then the next two days, I played it all day. For me though, I think the 60-star quest was a bit short, so if you want a long game, I suggest getting them all. <br /> <br /> PRESENTATION: Now, the cinematic scenes of this film are superb. The way they are, it looks so much like something I would see in theaters. So far, these are the best cinematic scenes of all Mario games. <br /> <br /> GLOBAL: This game is really a great game, and I advise you not to wait for Christmas, get it as soon as possible. This game is also a good mix of old and new. You will have levels of sensations in which you will move from one side to the other, or from top to bottom, because they will change their gravity, but even the music contains old classics. So, this game seems to be like a masterpiece. For me, it's my favorite Mario game of all time, but others may not agree. But it's still a good match. I recommend to all players who want to have fun in a game to get that.
