I saw this portrait very emotionally painful and it was fascinating. The conflict between Williams' public and private faces and the pressure he was under is enlightened so that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. The cast played beautifully, but Michael Sheen was outstanding. I only realized it was him when I saw the previous comment. He looks completely different physically in this role, from any other role in which I have seen him or as himself. Williams' autobiography differs markedly from his diaries, as depicted in this film. The film is sometimes painful to watch because of the emotional agony felt. However, it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be highly recommended.
