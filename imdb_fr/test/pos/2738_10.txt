In the short Golden Age period of Super Movies with Super Magnetic Sound, we purchased a GAF projector for $ 148.00 at the closing of a downtown Chicago camera store. It seemed that GAF was withdrawing from the camera and projector sector; although they would continue with their other businesses, such as Sawyer's previous Dimensional View-Master 3 color slide viewers. <br /> <br /> We had not been able to anticipate the fast approach of the video camera, the Betamax, the VHS. and the possible revolutions of the DVD. With the Super 8 magnetic sound camera that we also bought, we took some sound recordings like our daughter, Jenn's first communion and her younger sister, Michelle's graduation from kindergarten. It was around 1979-82. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we also bought some Daddy toys to accompany him; like some super 8 magnetic sounds LAUREL & HARDY Films and W.C. Shorts FIELDS from Blackhawk Films, Davenport, Iowa. We also bought a soundtrack from Columbia Pictures Home Movies, which looked like a forgotten classic drawing, UPA's GERALD McBOING-BOING (United Productions of America / Columbia, 1951). It was the hit of our Home Movies Time! <br /> <br /> As members of this baby boom generation, the wife (Deanna) and I remembered Gerald McBoing-Boing; for Gerald had a network television show on CBS, early Sunday night, ca. 1955. Bill Goodwin was the announcer / animator. But we had never seen this original theatrical comic from UPA; We did not know that the young master McBoing-Boing was a creation of Dr. Seuss, famous for "Grinch", "Horton" and "Mulberry Street". <br /> <br /> The assembled staff was very talented and profound. Exceptional production values ​​are obvious. Director Robert Cannon and Supervisory Director John Hubley were veterans at the top of their game. The authors were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss, Himself), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott is no longer remembered for his written contributions to UPA, but for his collaboration with Jay Ward in television properties such as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. PEABODY, FRACTURE FLICKERS, JUNGLE GEORGE, HOPPITY HOOPER and FRACTURED FLICKERS. With Jay Ward Productions, he was a writer, voice man and general general of the company. <br /> <br /> The caricature receives its only "voice" from the narrator, radio / film / television actor Marvin Miller. You remember him? He was Michael Anthony in the television series THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions / CBS Television Network, 1955-1960). <br /> <br /> Bright color schemes and imaginative design have been brought to give the UPA's entertainment a particular sense of loneliness, fearing apprehension and ultimate triumph. And, we might add, the animation is definitely of the "limited" variety. <br /> <br /> With so many great stories, ours begins with a simple principle; we are born different. In this case, it is the young boy Gerald McCloy, who was born to produce sound effects by communicating rather than speaking. The children can be cruel and he is soon dubbed by his unflattering nickname by a group of provocative youngsters chanting, "Nya, nya, you're not called McCloy, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing, the Noise Making Boy! " At this point, the animation team is doing a remarkable job of shifting the emotional gear to marginalized youth from joyful and carefree to lonely isolation, to depression and despair at not being able to turn to no one for help and understanding; not even to his mother and father. <br /> <br /> A frightening dark scene featuring a highly stylized escape scene from UPA with a train and a snowfall just as stylized brings Gerald to the edge of absolute despair. But then, he is interrupted by a gentleman announcing that young Gerald is wanted by the producer of a radio program to provide the sound of the show to the studio. <br /> <br /> ONCE the first show is made with Gerald Featured in the department of sound, he rides in a huge limo (which seems to have anticipated the Stretch Limos of our time) to applause and admiration of his classmates and the world. <br /> <br /> It has been said that there are very few plots and that, in this case, this story is most likely a variation of The Ugly Duckling; after all, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and a true happiness. <br /> <br /> NOTE: United Productions of America, or UPA, was a center of outstanding creativity in the field of Cartoon. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several suites and a television series, but also the very popular MR. MAGOO theatrical cartoons and the subsequent TV show (with vocal talent by Jim Backus), FROSTY THE SNOWMAN's original classic cartoon and the rather bizarre DICK TRACY Cartoon Show (with Tracy's voice delivered by Mr. Everett Sloane!).
