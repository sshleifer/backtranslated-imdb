I managed to get an original broadcast of this film on BBC by the BBC and I liked it so much that I had to try to locate it in its original packaging. thanks to Ebay. <br /> <br /> Removed from any format since 1990, this exceptional film about wildlife is finely constructed and well played. Directed by Stewart Raffil (MAC & Me), the scenes of bouncy tigers crossing the wilderness of Alaska are simply breathtaking and its timeless story of a trapper trying to survive alone in the frozen lands with two young tigers evolves each viewing . <br /> <br /> Why no big company chose this film to distribute on DVD is a marvel; but makes it very special if you know it is also difficult to locate. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie by accident or if you locate it to add it to your collection, make sure you never let it disappear from your seize. Movies of this caliber, as shown, do not come often. <br /> <br /> A true masterpiece in every sense of the word and worthy of his laudatory comments, "WHEN THE NORTH Wind Wind" will sink into your heart as soon as you see it.
