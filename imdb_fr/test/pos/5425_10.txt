Richard Condie is a Canadian wonder to share with the world. Whether for early work such as "Getting Started" and the Oscar-nominated "Snit" by "The Apprentice" and "La Salla", a digital achievement, Condie is a popular local hero. But no single work marks his career as "The Big Snit". And did I mention that he was nominated for an Academy Award? Darn tootin '. <br /> <br /> "The Big Snit", although it is clearly a bearer of outdated message from the 1980s (the short film revolves around the nuclear annihilation of the Cold War, but do not worry? This is hilarious hell), has a broader meaning, as does most of Condie's work in a discreet manner. While the planet takes cover of Armageddon, a couple bites on their boring habits (in the manner of Condie, he saws the furniture while she shakes her eyes, literally). And do not forget to watch again and again, because there is always something to watch. Condie is charging this guy with countless visual gags and memorable slogans. <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage this animation to be found. In Canada, it is usually seen in a National Film Board video that includes other stellar shorts (including the equally funny "The Cat Is Back", the compatriot from Winnipeg's Cordell Barker). The Americans will have to dig a little further, but continue like that ?? the reward is worth it.
