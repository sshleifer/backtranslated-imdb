OKAY. So it can be done! We have here the perfect vampire movie. Gothic, beautiful. With all the ingredients. A realistic vampire. A wonderful story. Take note - I am from Transylvania and I assure you that this film respects the tradition of vampires! It's exactly like the tales I heard in my childhood. For a Transylvanian, it's quite ... credible. You have to see it, if you are interested in real vampires, as they are described in medieval chronicles and not how they are done in recent Hollywood movies (as far as I can tell, the Hollywood problem is to mix vampires with pretty much hilarious to me vampires are neither beautiful nor beautiful, they can only inspire horror and repulsion Incube - called in my country The Night Flier, is the only beautiful demon who kills his victims by loving them. ) I recommend it to all gothic! See also the suites, they are all 4 very good! And of course, do not miss DArk shadows! Nosferatu In Venice and Klaus Kinski are similar. I recommend this one to.
