I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience that appeared on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the film in the exact way we had envisioned when preparing the film. The sets are incredible and well designed for each character. John York and his team built decors that fit not only the characters, but they also worked well for the filming, allowing us to move seamlessly through the walls and from one setting to another. Each character has an incredible arc, which makes it a beautiful story. I feel that all the actors gave excellent performances. I do not agree with some of the other comments that the acting was not good. Look at it and decide for yourself.
