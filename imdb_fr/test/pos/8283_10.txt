It was one of the best movies you could ever find as a child. I lived with the adventure Chipmunk from 4 to 8 years old. The story of this movie was: Dave goes on a business trip to Europe and sticks the boys with Miss Miller. While playing a video game Around the World in 80 Days, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), surround the Chipmunks and Chipettes in an adventure in which children must fly over the globe in a hot air balloon. What they do not know is that the "game" is really a diamond smuggling ring. And when they are found at the airport by the bad guys, a chase ensues! And that ends in prison with Klaus and Claudia and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor safe with Dave and Miss Miller. But I warn you now, it's a very good musical. Most people hate musicals, but I'm not one of them. I love musicals like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Do not Dance and just about anything (except My Fair Lady). If you see this, share it with your children (if you have any)!
