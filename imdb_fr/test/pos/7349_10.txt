Viva La Bam was one of those shows for which I had no expectation, before seeing it, and I had never realized it until I saw my friend watching it. I thought Jackass was pretty funny, but the stunts were just that, funny and I've never really been in the show. When I watched Viva La Bam for the first time, it was the opposite effect, I loved it. It was more like a TV show, which many "reality shows" have today. I was hooked and wanted to see what new scheme they were going to cook for each episode. Throughout the last episode, this caught my attention and although some ideas sometimes seemed reworked, there was always a newer and more funny twist. Viva La Bam is one of those shows that makes you addicted and I have not seen another show that looks like him.
