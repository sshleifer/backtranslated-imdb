I must admit that this is one of Cameron Diaz's unpublished films and I was also surprised that she had an important role, but she was not the main role. It touched me a lot because I can really understand the pain of losing a loved one, as I have experienced it. <br /> <br /> Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were very talented in their portrayal of protagonist Phoebe and I also have to hand it to cast members to find two actresses who are so alike that I really thought they were sisters (in real life). This is one of those movies that Cameron did to play and not to play the role of star. She looked at the role of the beautiful rebellious hippie who wants to change the world, even if she sometimes revolts without cause. <Br /> <br /> Born from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength is her big sister Faith, little girl Phoebe is naturally very upset by the departure of faith in Europe. As she grows up, she goes out looking for her sister and ends up being disappointed by the truth about her sister and falls in love with her sister's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story and an equally great place to tour around European.I will look at it again.
