One of those films I visited in The Criterion Collection and, as usual, was a change of pace. It turned out to be an excellent decision. I was almost fascinated by the quality of the film, its history and the way it was. The film's almost minimalist feel with sparse dialogues and almost constant music has added an evocative level to the film. It's really a great movie to spend time with and enjoy.
