Chick Flick? Of course .... You're done already? Many times ... Predictable? Yes ..... To watch? You bet! I am delighted by Sarandon and Portman's portrayal of otherwise ordinary characters in a familiar story. I am a big fan of mother / daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good and the weak is the performance and development of the character. Although it is NOT the BEST of its kind, I will buy it and look at it again. I felt that the characters were credible and that the acting was superior.
