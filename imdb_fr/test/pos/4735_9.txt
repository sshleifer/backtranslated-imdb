When I started watching, I was thinking of watching a pro-Koresh amateur documentary. However, I had never seen 3/4 of the sequence used. They interviewed people saying that the FBI / ATF had been the instigator of all these things that seemed unrealistic so far, but that it was followed by a video and an FBI testimony. I was amazed. The documentary followed the senate's investigation after the fire and, after watching the interview and the video, you would be shocked to see how the Senate and the Attorney General turned their backs on the Davidians to cover up the aggression. FBI / ATF. If you start looking at it, you have to finish it. Otherwise, you will think it's propaganda.
