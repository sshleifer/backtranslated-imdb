To paraphrase Thora Birch: "I like this movie a bit, it's exactly the opposite of everything I hate in a movie." <br /> <br /> This dark film was too discreet and intelligent to get a theatrical release. luck of success would have needed an expensive promotional campaign. And a new story where nothing extraordinary happens - where the focus is on character development - has a limited target audience. Anyone who has heard of a mature teen movie? <br /> <br /> But if you have the opportunity to see it or if you can part with a few dollars for the DVD, you could do a lot worse. "The wife of my teacher" is not revolutionary, but it is very valuable and resists repeated viewing. <br /> <br /> Jason London (Todd Boomer, high school student) is the star and is perfect for this character. as well as his roles in "The Man of the Moon" and "Dazed and Confused". He is helped by the exceptional work of his actors. Tia Carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) as Todd's math tutor and in love with her interest. Christopher McDonald as a teacher in a beautiful self-parody performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee are Todd's best friends and Jeffrey Tabor is his father. <br /> <br /> As someone has already said, this is a "mature" teen movie because romantic relationships are universally futile - at least as far as end-of-life standards are concerned happy. Even Todd's parents are indifferent to each other, his father panting after the main character and his mother (Leslie Lyles) literally on the phone all the way to the screen (a device that provides comic relief increasing with each successive appearance). The London-Carr√®re romance has an unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman story you are likely to find. <br /> <br /> But the real strength of the film lies in the evolution of relations between the three friends. There is no overworked melodrama here, only three immature who alternate between testing themselves and trusting each other, subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing. They actually succeed in establishing a "credible" relationship to three, perhaps the first in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
