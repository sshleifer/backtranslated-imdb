[CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life. They just counted the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to the color and the fabric. He needed a life. He therefore consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A bar for singles was a good place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon arrived on the dance floor, we understood what caused Disco to die: Jon killed him. Jon then tried to take girls to the video store. He ended up feeling in his mouth. Literally. Laundromat was not a prize either when Jon and his future partner got a glimpse of everyone's underwear. Jon tried to pretend to be a buff on the beach, but he quickly angered a real guy, which left Jon again, feeling uncomfortable. Literally. Jon then tried to flirt with the girls who were walking. No result. Jon has released a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately, when he mentioned that his cat was fat, a fat man arrived and stomped on Jon's guitar. It was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Jon, an ad was shown on television: an ad for Lorenzo's school for the altered personality. This guaranteed a lifeless person to earn a living in a few easy steps. Jon and Garfield attend the class. The building did not look exactly like TV and Lorenzo was not as powerful as on TV. Jon was sitting next to a pretty girl named Mona. So, while Lorenzo taught self-introduction, analysis of your pulse, and pretending to speak a foreign language, Jon and Mona know each other well. They leave together, forgetting everything about Garfield. At home, Jon and Mona sat on the porch and spoke. Garfield was jealous of Mona lest she move him away from Jon. Garfield envisioned the future: Jon and Mona get married, she settles and soon, she gives birth to a small Arbuckle delighted to tell the story of Garfield. Back in the present, Garfield would not accept it. He tried to get Jon to get rid of Mona until she started scratching her ears. But then, Jon learned that Mona was allergic to cats. So that was the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other from time to time, and Garfield was sure to be with them. <br /> <br /> Another hilarious show from Garfield TV! It was made during the television series Garfield and Friends. Garfield has been thinned a bit. Somewhat. Since his drawings of the early 1980s. The scenes of Jon trying to pick up girls are funny, just like the one where the fat guy hits on Jon's guitar. Good old Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Thom Huge is Jon. Frank Welker (The third man of 1,000 votes) is Lorenzo. And June Foray (The woman with 1,000 votes) is Mona. If you like Garfield, then I recommend seeing Garfield Gets A Life today! He just released on DVD with Here Comes Garfield and Garfield on the Town! So check them out today! You are assured a good time. Hi, has Garfield ever let you down? <br /> <br /> -
