It's really a classic kung fu. This film seems to have influenced martial arts movies for decades. Spanish guitar background music, competing schools, incredibly high jumps on the roofs, catching spears, cheating in tournaments, secret training for an exotic karate technique, themes of patience and perseverance, etc. , were copied by much later films such as "The Karate Kid" (1984), "Hero" (2002), "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) and "Kung Fu Hustle" (2004). <br /> <br /> I feel lucky to have seen this film for the first time in 1972, shortly after it was released, just before kung-fu movies became mainstream movies and before Bruce Lee do not become a known name. I saw her with two of my friends in a downtown San Diego theater frequented by sailors. Even though the scenes of glowing hands and glowing eyeballs made people laugh, the audience was entering, as was our small group. It was a very memorable film for me. Decades later, I could still remember several specific scenes, even after I forgot the title of the film. This film is particularly special to me now, because one of those two friends I had seen with him for the first time (Kitty Hawk sailor Kenneth Lee Hines) has since died. This film is a memory of that day before we took judo. and karate lessons the following years. <br /> <br /> As for the kung fu movies, I would say that this film is 10/10. But since I have to keep the general public in mind, I'll call it more objectively 8/10, because of obvious technical flaws. I simply recommend to neophyte viewers to consider these technical flaws as proof of their vintage character and authenticity, then to happily take advantage of its testosterone chaos.
