No, it has nothing to do with the sitcom "Seinfeld" or his eccentric and hilarious character, Cosmo Kramer. In fact, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is an excellent drama, probably one of the best of its kind and one of the greatest movies of all time. I'm glad he won more Oscars than "Apocalypse Now" because he really deserved such fame. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs. Kramer" is an excellent film, so well done and so perfectly balanced that I do not change anything that way. There is nothing wrong with the movie. It's a film of the highest quality. And that stands the test of time too. Not only does he not look old, but his cultural impact is enduring and his realistic story remains just as meaningful as it was when he was released in 1979. A timeless classic. They do not make such films today. <br /> <br /> This film is dramatic, realistic, simple but brilliant, intense, powerful, sweet and even tragic and sometimes depressing. Yet he also has a good sense of humor. He has no special effects, but who cares? It's not the film or the place to discuss such a thing. For a film like this, such a thing would be useless and absolutely useless. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. The chemistry of the actors is just perfect. All the actors are great, but the top 3 are the best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, performs here his best performance as Ted Kramer, an adorable but distant workaholic. Meryl Streep is great as Ted's wife, Joanna. And the cute little Justin Henry is great as Billy, son of Ted and Joanna, loving but sometimes stubborn. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is instrumental and wonderful. The opening song (guitarist Frederic Hand) is brilliant. The rest of the soundtrack is mainly composed of Antonio Vivaldi's classical music and is simply dazzling. <br /> <br /> This film also has an incredible development of the characters. See the character of Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes a great father after having no choice but to take care of his son, trying to adjust his new responsibilities to his job after being left by his wife Joanna . With this, Ted discovers the most beautiful things in life, but also realizes that life is beautiful, with the problems of his work and the return of Joanna, who wants the custody of their son. But even Joanna changes for the better and the end is an unexpected surprise when we see this for the first time. <br /> <br /> This film also contains some elements, such as court scenes where Ted and Joanna face a brutal character. assassinations unleashed by the lawyers. Another thing to see though is when poor Billy falls from a gym in the jungle with his toy (a plane) and has badly hurt his face. But again, the scene is very well done and the result is very intense: his father runs fast and crosses many blocks, ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a movie that's a good lesson in life. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be on the Top 250.
