I saw this film for the first time when I was in grade 8 and I remember it deeply touched me. I saw it about a year ago (I'm now 29) and it always touched me the same way. It is a great film that personifies the struggle of "principle against pragmistism". The character of Voight is the idealist teacher who will not yield to the psuedo-racist inclinations of the superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. This story also embodies the struggle of the resistance to change, and more particularly to cultural change. Often to the detriment of children. When these battles finally end, Pat Conroy loses and pragmatism reigns triumphantly. Or does it? The children he has to leave are better at ease to know him, more exposed to the "real world" and to classical music. The other teacher at the school gained respect for him and he learned a lot about himself. A great movie with a heartbreaking end. I recommend to everyone who enjoyed the movie to read Pat Conroy's book "The Water is Wide". He will stay with you!
