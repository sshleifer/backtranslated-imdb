What can I say? The little child inside has always had great affections for the following: giant robots, giant monsters and a naughty and megalomaniac villain and this film keeps its promises. As an adult, it is easy to point out the many flaws in this film and say that it is actually just several episodes from a children's television series. Despite everything, I find the ending very moving and the content surprisingly adult. Fun if a little absurd sometimes.
