Really, this movie should be published on DVD. I just received a pirate copy of what I think is a movie studio and I was delighted! It was on my list of movies to simply own because of the casting. Three of my people, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both being at Romeo & Juliet, as well as John Gielghud. Sorry for the bad spelling, there was so much that I thought that for the small amount I spent, it would be fine. Boy I was right. I will not give any of this, you may already know the story anyway, but I will simply say that if you can get a copy in ANY format ... Do it! @ You will not be sorry. JPC
