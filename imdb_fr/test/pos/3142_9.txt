John Ford has paid tribute to carts a special image, "Wagon Master" made after two great epics of the Indian cavalry ... It's a charming poetic film, full of romantic reincarnation of the pioneering spirit ... It did not have to crown the biggest ones that preceded it ... <br /> <br /> Photographic, it's extremely simple ... The camera moves only once or twice throughout the film and never when a director would have done it. move to emphasize a shot ... Ford even resists the temptation to follow his camera in breathtaking scenes at dusk women walking tiredly in the dust behind their carts ... They come and go, while the camera remains motionless and the audience remains a spectator of the march of history, not a participant ... Of course, when Ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically, as in "Stagecoach", he knows how to do it ... But "Wagon Master" is a tender and nostalgic look on the past ... <br /> <br /> Filled with traditional Western songs performed by The Sons of the Pioneers, it tells the journey from west to west. Utah (1879) of a Mormon wagon train led by Ward Bond as Brother Wiggs and two young horse dealers (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr). And in a series of beautiful images, as the train of wagons battles the outlaws, Indians and nature in their struggle to reach the "promised land", the modest "Cart Master" manages to capture the history and legend of the West ... <br /> <br /> Ford himself declared that "Wagon Master" (of which he wrote the original story) was one of his three films, "which are getting closer to what I wanted to achieve. " <br /> <Ford's career as a Western director was amazing ... More than anyone, he was able to use that genre to protect his feelings about family, society, and the way of life. American life ... Ford considered the border as one of the lands to be subjected by a special class of settlers and lawyers whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come after ... Westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they had acquired, and the civilized townspeople who followed them still had to hold them in fear and respect ... The Ford Westerns often use flashbacks that emphasize the history The authenticity of his approach ... <br /> <br /> In "Wagon Master", for example, folk songs from the soundtrack tell us about the difficulties of the pioneers of a century ago and Ford shows them. almost in a documentary way ... In a sequence, the train is encircled in a circle and the colonists decide to hold a square dance ... To shape a dance floor, they must lay boards on the sand of the desert, and with this Ford's ritual celebration shows the defeat of the wilderness through the metaphor of boarding over the land ... <br /> <br /> This is a very enjoyable movie to watch, full of optimism wonderful and light, and it's easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfying ?? This never breaks with the mood and style of the first sequences ?? But we wonder if the ultra-romantic best suits the chosen theme. <br /> <br /> The grueling experience must be one of the most physically demanding and stressful tests for man's nerves (with his) never put himself ?? It must have been sowed with doubts - was it wrong to sell everything and to come? How can we hope to survive? How are we going to fight at the other end of the race, almost every painful step in the road? <br /> <br /> However, nothing of this feeling is reflected in "Wagon Master". Travel - this is the general ebullience - does not strike us as particularly dangerous ?? It is possible, of course, that the Mormons are so "strong" in religious spirit that it tends to act as anesthetic ?? In other words, their reactions were not those of a normal human weakness ... If that was the case, Ford was right and the skeptics were wrong ?? <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that it is just and proper ebullience, especially at first meeting, of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. It is the essence of youth adventurous with a light heart, especially from the western youth of this extraordinary time ?? It is a remarkable relationship and it stays in the mind ??
