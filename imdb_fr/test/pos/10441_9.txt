I really like this movie. I love it not just because it's a good early 80's movie with an excellent soundtrack, but I found that there are moments that make you think. These are only moments; not the whole movie. It's certainly not like "less than zero". <br /> <br /> The scenes deal with typical peer pressure and also with more difficult issues, such as betrayal of trust. These problems are not easily solved or forgotten by the characters. Some scenes will stand out and invite reflection on her own adolescent experiences and how these experiences may have affected her character and adult perspectives. <br /> <br /> You can watch this film and think about the issues facing young adults. and your own experiences. Or you can simply pay attention to the quest for boys to depersonalize! :) Anyway it's a good movie.
