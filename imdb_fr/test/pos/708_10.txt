The first time I saw this movie, I was a child. I was ten when he came out, but since my family never went to the movies, I saw her on Network TV. I remember watching it alone ?? and to have cried afterwards. It was only the second film to produce this answer (Rocky was the first) and there have not been many since. I can not say exactly why; Larry "Rain" Murphy deserved more than Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know that I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time. Stoic. He did not need a stopwatch or freedom to regain his dignity. He ran because he could. He needed no other reason. I have a rule today is that when I see this movie late at night on cable TV (the only time most will find it) I have to watch, no matter what I have to do the next day morning. Fortunately, he does not play often like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites, so I sleep enough and I do not get tired of the story of the unrepentant imprisonment of a man and his personal victory.
