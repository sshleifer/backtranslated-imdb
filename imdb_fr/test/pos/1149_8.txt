In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, in the early twentieth century, Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisouli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), his son and daughter. His intention is to obtain money and rifles for ransom for them, in order to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Morocco (Marc Zuber). In election time, US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him out of jail with the American soldiers. I do not like films about explicit colonialism and disrespect for the sovereignty of other countries, but "The lion and the wind" is indeed a great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress of the 70s, is wonderful. She plays an abducted woman as in the remarkable movie "Soldier Blue". Sean Connery is perfect, as usual, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. Brian Keith is great as the US president. I do not know much about the history of Morocco to analyze if there is a truth in this story, but this film is an entertainment worthy of interest. In Brazil, it is only available on VHS. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Vento e o Le√£o" ("The lion and the wind") <br /> <br />
