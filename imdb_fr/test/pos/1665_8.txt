The fact that after 50 years, the film remains very watchable, says a lot. It is smarter and more interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre that you can find and has a certain endearing sense of innocence. I'm not a big fan of this type of movie, but I could watch it all without getting bored, which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share your taste in movies. I liked the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the clever heist scene that allows you to guess which turn they will shoot, and the end like everyone else. Looking at the sequence of shots, we realize the power of silence, unfortunately so underused in the current cinema.
