Spoilers. This review has been modified due to the maximum number of words. <br /> <br /> `The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> This sentence is as famous as "I look at you, kid" or "Are you talking to me?" or "May the Force be with you" or "I'll be back" means a little more than a few. When spoken, it stays in the air with significance and meaning that do not go unnoticed. What could drive some viewers crazy is that they could never find an answer to the horror if they did not watch the movie again and did not try to watch each image closely. <br /> <br /> What exactly is this line? dialogue means? The horror we are talking about is the reality of war. The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted, they turn against their innate instincts and kill their fellow men without any sign of guilt. When Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) stands in front of the dying Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film, "The horror ... the horror". is the achievement of Willard's corruption. He pitilessly killed a man of cold blood as part of his mission. This is not a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases, a character wins something, whether emotionally, physically, mentally, or all three. But Willard wins and loses at a time. He acquires the feeling of having lost his morals. And it's a shocking end. <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to the artistic side of cinema. This film is totally different from "The Godfather". It's hallucinogenic, visually dazzling and an ode to the culprit of human nature. At first this seems realistic, then it becomes strange, then symbolic and, in the end, original in its unique perspective of the spiritual side of the war. It's not so much a film about the Vietnam War as it's a film about the war in us. <br /> <br /> At first, it seems to be another war movie. Captain Willard (Sheen) is commissioned by an army lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to murder a renegade American colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who is hiding somewhere in Vietnam with a horde of soldiers serving him more or fewer slaves. <br /> <br /> Willard carries out his mission "with extreme prejudice" by going on a boat with four soldiers, including the Captain, the Chief (Albert Hall), the Chief (Frederic Forest) and a very young 'Larry' Fishburne (who later appeared as Morpheus in 'The Matrix'). <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is in many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. While our main character, Willard, continues his journey, he meets a range of original and strange characters, including Lieutenant-Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper) Their vivid gestures and mannerisms can be likened to those of much smaller Jeremy Davies in The Million Dollar Hotel, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Davies failed to establish any connection with an audience; Hopper does. It looks like the poetic atmosphere between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter who comes and goes and speaks in foreign languages. In this case, he translates Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not sure that Kurtz needs a translation from Willard. <br /> <br /> Many movies are lucky enough to have one or two scenes or memorable lines. "Apocalypse Now" has a lot. Kilgore, descending into a Vietnamese village in which Wagner's "The Valkyries Ride" plays, remains one of the most memorable scenes in the history of cinema. There is sharpness, brutality, an ironic tone, and a feeling of play When Kilgore kneels on the beach and says, "I love the smell of napalm in the morning, it smacks of victory" we all smile. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to lie to you: "Apocalypse Now" is a strange film, it's not exactly the easiest thing to analyze, the ending can frustrate some viewers if they do not understand Marlon Brando's important speeches But what really matters is that this film speaks of the dark nature of the human psyche.The horror is the realization of the war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says, `You have the right to kill me, but you do not have the right to judge me. '" Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the public to judge, and for many na√Øve viewers he may appear as crazy man with the power in his head, but that's not what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to make clear. "In fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz realized how much he had gotten it and how many others had had it. Walking through devastated villages, he finally realizes that we are naive and live our life in a paradise for crazy people. We are totally naive about our environment and possible misfortunes until they strike. Seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes how easily he can be struck by something. Just as he could easily end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that those who did it are people who have abandoned their morals and have left them at the door. Many people think that horror is one thing. He is two. For Kurtz, horror is the reality of his naivety and the reality of the impact of war on men. And after Willard murdered Kurtz and heard Kurtz's last words, he also realizes it. He realizes the effects of war. Seeing so many soldiers without any sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what a war can do to a man. And what it did to him. The horror. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
