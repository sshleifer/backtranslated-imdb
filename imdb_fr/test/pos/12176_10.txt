I was looking in the TV guide for movies coming from Germany and I found one called The Bunnyguards, so I watched it and burst out laughing! I wanted the DVD but it's not available here (I could order it in Germany but it does not have subtitles). It was viewed again. So I recorded it and I watch it from time to time. <br /> <br /> I looked for information about this and discovered that his real name is Erkan & Stefan, but I know him by his Australian title: The Bunnyguards. <br /> <br /> Some people I know from Germany do not like Erkan & Stefan because of their accents, but not being German myself, I did not notice anything. The jokes are good, but some Germans might find their accents repulsive. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is funny and that the DVD has English subtitles on all the extras (a 2-disc edition only having subtitles would be bad) I would buy it in a wink! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a good story.
