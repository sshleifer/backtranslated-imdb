The shortcut to being so-called more conscious in this strange period is that you are "blue". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to keep us from what is happening / happened in recent years in our country (the United States). It does not scare anyone, but we feel better, as if we do not get any benefit from living here and getting all the good things an American citizen gets just by being an American citizen. <br /> <br /> But I'm so sick of complaining about it. This is useless. I have not taken a lot of action lately and I wonder how many people have it. Maybe I just broke down because my job was "outsourced" last month and I'm now looking for work in shrinking technical support, where most jobs are going fast in India and elsewhere abroad. I think that soon it will not be profitable to be a citizen here with a dilapidated infrastructure, a declining labor market and an obsession with war. These days, it seems that anyone who speaks can be questioned about his "patriotism". Anyway, back to this review: USA The Movie is an obscure DVD that makes me understand that some people have taken action, whether through politics, events, arts or media. The filmmaker is obviously passionate, competent, willing to get out of the norm, frustrated, unique, clever, etc. <br /> <br /> I went through the entire site linked to the DVD and got lost in all the articles and essays. etc. who are there. The DVD also contains references to different times, views and historical points. Sometimes someone does something outside.
