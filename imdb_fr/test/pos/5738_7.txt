A group of teenagers decides to go to an abandoned school where, 27 years ago, a horrible massacre had taken place. Unfortunately for them, the person responsible for the massacre is still hiding in the corridors of the abandoned school and he is not happy with their presence. <br /> <br /> This movie does not look like most modern teen slashers we've seen. It's much darker, much more suspensive, not a skeptical murderer, etc., and I liked it for these reasons. From the filming point of view, it's not great. The acting is below average. The writing was pretty bad and clich√©d, containing random allusions to American horror movies, some of which did not even make sense (like ... "Have you seen Scream 3?", Asks a girl Yes, yes, and it has nothing to do with going through the doors of an old school, so it has nothing to do with this movie). But, hey, it's a slasher movie, it's part of the fun. In addition, the under-use of the characters has been heavily exposed in this film. There were six main characters (not counting The Security Guard) and, to be honest, only three or four were actually used. Two characters (the symbolic black guy and another girl who was not important enough to wear a label) were barely talking: between them, I would estimate about five or six lines in total. In addition, girls (except one) were not well enough trained to differentiate them from each other. They could have replaced the girls with each other several times throughout the film and I would not have noticed the difference. The pace, however, works well because the horror starts from the beginning and rarely stops. The atmosphere is well used and the direction reveals really scary moments. . . although, overall, the appearance is a bit cheap because of what I suppose is a low quality camera equipment (and its operation). The end, although I liked the idea that they were going, was pretty badly done. He felt pressed and without sufficient explanation to make it effective. With the time they spent running around without looking for anything, they could have spent a little more time on the conclusion to make sure that it did not look like a random event given without good reason (which is a default movies modern horror are afflicted with). However, ignoring some tedious problems and trying to focus on the first 98% of the film rather than the end, it is actually a rather good modern slasher that should be checked, especially if you are a fan of Spanish and / or atmospheric horror. <br /> <br /> Mandatory slasher elements: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There is blood and blood, realistically, but no buckets. The violence is extremely well done, without excess, but rather brutal in places. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: A bit, and with the hottest girl in the movie. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer: The security guards are barely considered "cool", but this guy is pretty mean. His terrifying smile was frightening. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: The suspense is excellent. . . very tense, very well done. There are also extremely scary moments that have merged the jump fears and the scary atmosphere. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: not at all, actually. <br /> <br /> - Clumsy dance scene: Of course: between a couple of guys and a woman half reluctant in the flashback. <br /> <br /> - Classic quote from the movie: "One more trophy." <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 7/10. It may be difficult, but Session 9 fans may want to be content with the same tone and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
