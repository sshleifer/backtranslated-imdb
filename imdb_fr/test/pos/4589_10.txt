Most people are totally unaware that this film exists. Fox, who paid the judge to make it, kept it in the box for a long time and then spent nothing to promote it. I guess it made a lot of people think that it was one of the garbage films being emptied at the end of the summer. Well, I'm here to tell you that it's a fun and rather scary look at a future that is not so hard to believe. Basically, the judge puts forward the notion that stupids outbid smart people by a wide margin. Then these stupid people become more and more stupid, spending most of their time watching television and having sex, which produces more stupid people. By 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear as a genius, who speaks "all faggy". Seriously, is it so hard to believe? Of course, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as a time-traveling army guy, desperately trying to return to a more comfortable time. Where is this story going to earn its cult status, it's with the many funny one-liners, like "can we put it in family style" and "hey guy, I'm having fun here!" It's a funny film and a very sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be tired of pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee that I will buy it on DVD the first day of its release. and more.
