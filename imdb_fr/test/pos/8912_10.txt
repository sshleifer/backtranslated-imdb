Alien Warrior (or the King of the Streets) is one of those 80s jewels you mistakenly encounter, then watch him marvel as he admires how wonderfully stupid and overflowing he is. <br /> <br /> A rather attractive extraterrestrial arrives. on earth (LA to be exact) and falls into a world of drug traffickers, gangs and corrupt police. He falls in love with the beautiful blonde haired teacher who only wants to help inner-city children to read more. He also manages to anger a drug antenna chef sniffing coke who is dedicated to destroy it. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this movie at first viewing ... of course, it's hokey, silly and low budget. But you can say that the filmmakers had their heart in the right place, and damn it if the thing does not work! I only pray for it to be on DVD soon. <br /> <br /> There is a warm soundtrack, break-dance, violence, nudity ... all with a positive and healthy message! To see him
