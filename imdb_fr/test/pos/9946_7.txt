Four or five episodes of Johnnie Socko and his flying robot were mounted together. Funny giant robot struggling with a giant monster targeting children. Parents will of course go crazy because the action is violent and the robot / monster battles look like professional wrestling and the man with violence is the kind of thing that we find at the school of Saint Valentin d'Al Capone and at the Gangster Training Academy. I liked that, but then again I grew up in the series. If there are problems, apart from the variety of "men in costume" effects, it is that the film unfolds as a series of episodes sewn together, with a climax every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who run out of Ultraman or Godzilla
