"Fame" was one of my favorite movies for years! It's not just an 80s musical movie about "this" high school in New York, it's LEGENDARY - people are no longer referring to the high school of performing arts, but to the "school of fame"! ! <br /> <br /> The characters are real, they are not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film follows them through the four years of school, starting with a hard-hitting monologue from a student at Auditions and ending with a spectacular graduation show. <br /> <br /> Apparently, some people think the Broadway show is better, but I think about it though. that you should definitely see this movie anyway, and then have your own opinion. For those who like to watch movies and would like to have the "classics", it's probably one of them. This is an example of one of those movies that was really great, with actors we loved during these 2 hours, and then we never saw them again ... they are classics "famous students". <br /> <br /> make FAME live forever.
