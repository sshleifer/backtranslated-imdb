Hello. Hello and goodbye. but before leaving, I want to talk to you. I just want to quickly mention some key points of this movie. the first being eroticism. especially homo-erotic. <br /> <br /> yes, well. start. When a man and a man love each other very much, they merge into a spectacular explosion, not forgetting the offer of cinema we call the Venice merchant. <br /> <br /> the erotic love of homo was sensual at worst. and even more sensual at best. it was hardcore and emotional. it hurt me inappropriately and I'm sure I touched it back. and when no one was watching I touched a little too. <br /> <br /> I laughed because portia was refused. she was the second in line of our friend homo erotic love. oh antonio. Antoni. just toni. I love you. more than you liked this guy. whose name may or may not contain a "B". he was very ugly. <br /> <br /> antoni was very fat. he lathered his body in a box of hair grease and sensual juices and proceeded to mix on the screen and introduce himself to the guy with the name that I like the film in conclusion, go see the film without them Erotic connotations of homo for the love of a man like Antoni. just toni.
