I saw Heimat 2 for the first time on BBC2 in the 90s, as I lived and worked with artists and musicians, hoping for future success. So, 'The Second Home' - friendships made after leaving home, the pursuit of professional excellence - resonated strongly with my living reality. I was captivated by the characters, the story, the lyrical photographic work and, above all, the music. I could guess the beginnings of German electronic music, the 1950s Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Can, Neue, 70s Faust, the sound experiments of John Cage, Walter Carlos and the British electronic psychedelia of The White Noise. The soundtrack composer Nikos Mamangakis studied with Carl Orff of Carmina Burana-renowned. So I found his contemporary tastes of the world of electronic pop and sound effects. <br /> <br /> I did not see Heimat or Heimat 3, so I looked at it as a set in itself without before or after. As someone else has said, it's both epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. Many favorite moments, including the wonderful voice of Gisela Muller (Evelyn), the marimba Bach by Daniel Smith (Juan), the piano playing by Henry Arnold (Hermann) and the cello playing by Salome Kammer (Clarissa). <br /> <br /> I could write more, but it has already been said here. Why can not British or American television produce such masterpieces? The Wire had the realism, politics and epic breath of a city. David Lynch and Dennis Potter also had too much imagination for their televised series work, but it is a sublime art-house and soap opera. This has never been included in the critical selections of the best movies, but it should be. Always as poetic and powerful as when I saw it for the first time over 17 years ago. I look at the 3 boxes each fall for their "mellow fertility". Inspired and inspiring.
