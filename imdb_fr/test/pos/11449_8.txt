A group of mostly obnoxious and extremely unpleasant teenagers go to an old, scary, dilapidated morgue near a graveyard for a flawless Halloween party, animated by the bizarre oddball obsessed with the occult, Mimi Kinkade and her vacant boy. Friend hungry bimbette Linnea Quigley. Foolish, profane, beer-drinking, and sex-loving foolish bandits hold a session like a joke (very bad idea, because the old sorry dive is naturally said to be haunted by demonic spirits). Of course, this misguided session awakens these cranky and hostile evil spirits, who kill abominably and possess the majority of kids, turning them into murderous, ugly, claw-nosed and boiling-faced ghouls that ravage the usual ravages of havoc throughout their lives. the war. duration of a night of pure terror particularly dark and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's essentially your umpteenth performance "Evil Dead" vigorously graphic and relentless down-to-earth, cluttered with closed, there is no easy way out a single claustrophobic frame , outrageously excessive splashing, a humn'shiver synthesizer that constantly beats, a total feeling of nightmare darkly dark and loaded, and vibrant cinematography carierizing (camera work held in hand, hyperactive, causing overactive precipitation, blueprints smooth and winding tracking, camera angles decked out with lunatics, even the camera on a cart making a figure eight at 180 degrees gracefully slippery). Fortunately, Kevin S. Tenney's clever, confident and elegant management keeps the extremely worn and spinning procedure at lightning speed; moreover, Tenny gives the film a polished and appealing appearance and effectively creates a certain carnival atmosphere ooga-booga carnival phantasmagorically grotesque and grotesque. <br /> <br /> However, the wonderfully gory and imaginative makeup effects of Steve Johnson are: true show star. The bloodthirsty highlights include Hal Havins (who played a troubling role in the same role in the same obese and irritating role in the immortal "Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama" at about the same time) his tongue being bitten, Quigley massaging himself. tube of lipstick in one of her breasts (bravo!) and ruffling the eyes of a guy while she makes love to him (double bravo!), a libidinous teenage couple who gets fired doing exactly what you believe in a coffin (the chick has a broken neck while the guy has an arm cut), Kinkade igniting his hands and, in the most nasty scene of the film, a bad old man is sliced throat inside after eating a piece of apple laced with razor blades. The trashy'n'thrashy rock score also smokes. And then there's the incredibly wild, sexy and uninhibited Kinkade demon dance, a sizzling number with flickering strobe light and striking jumps that Kinkade herself choreographed. Okay, this combination is nothing more than a completely stupid and useless, though nicely edited and agreeably vulgar piece of scary terror movie films, but if you fancy entertaining and deadly entertainment, a terrifying horror these nicely coarse and juvenile dross are just fine.
