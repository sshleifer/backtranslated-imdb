This film took me by surprise. I get used to getting as little information as possible on movies before I participate, because movie trailers and reviews provide successive features. All I knew on entering the movie theater was that it was a documentary about a long-time married couple and that IMDb readers gave it a score of 7.8%. . Filmmaker Doug Block decided to register his parents "for posterity" and at the beginning of the film, we receive the necessary interviews from his parents, the well-spoken mother Mina. and less than the future dad, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and I did not know where the filmmaker (Mike & Mina's son, Doug) was going to take us. In fact, I doubt Doug himself knew where he was coming from! <br /> <br /> Life takes unexpected turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is hard to say how much I was touched by this story and the unique way it was told. Absolutely captivating from start to finish and it's really a must, even if you're not a fan of the documentary genre. This film will make you think of your own life and could even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. "51 Birch Street" is one of those rare cinematic experiences that makes a strong impression and never leaves you. The best news is that HBO participated in the production. So, instead of playing in front of a limited art house audience, millions of people will finally have the chance to see this incredible work. BRAVO!!!!!!!!
