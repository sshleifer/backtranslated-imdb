For all homicidal addicts, this movie was great! All the characters in the series made their appearance in the film. This helped to solve some (but not all) problems in the series. Unfortunately, unless you really watch the series, the fun would be lost, as the movie made heavy references to every season of the series. This would probably have been appropriate as the finale of a series rather than a separate film, but we must take what we can get. I hope they will make more movies and continue to present Homicide characters in Law and Order.
