A young Korean artist lives in Amsterdam. She is a bit lonely and has never had a serious relationship, insisting that she is "waiting" for the right person. She works in the public square and draws portraits for the passers-by, but she also allows herself to paint her favorite flowers, the daisies. But, suddenly, she has a secret admirer. The flowers are delivered to her residence every day at 4:15 pm, usually daisies, but she can not catch the sender in the act. Indeed, without his knowledge, his son is a hit-korean and he wants to stay hidden for the moment. One day in the square, however, another attractive Korean man sits for the artist and finds himself carrying a pot of daisies. She concludes that it is her shy hero and the man she has been waiting for forever. This second gentleman also has a secret; he is an Interpol agent. The killer can see everything that happens on the spot thanks to the presence of an apartment nearby. Of course, it is disturbed that another man has entered the life of the girl. How will this dark love triangle unfold? It's a beautiful picture to watch. The setting in Amsterdam and the surrounding countryside is really charming. Add to that three of the most attractive young Korean actors and, visually, every viewer has a breathtaking panorama in front of him. The story is also interesting because it is a mix of drama and action, with a hint of unexpectedness. The costumes are very attractive and the production values, high. In short, anyone looking for a quality foreign film with a captivating story and stunning scenery finds this film a wonderful choice for an entertaining evening. If you have someone's hand to hold during the view, so much the better.
