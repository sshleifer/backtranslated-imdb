Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to prison for the murder of an autistic child. When in a hurry with the question "Why?" he has no answer. In prison, he meets Pearl (Don Cheadle), his teacher, who decides to take things in hand and helps Leland to understand why he did it. Throughout this film, we learn about Leland's hectic life, including her ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), her famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey) and all her sad life. <br /> <br /> This film is Matthew Ryan Hoge's second film, and is spectacular in almost every case. This is a movie that will let you think at the end, and wonder how it all works. The film is quite dark, but if you get there, you'll realize how good it is. <br /> <br /> In this film, there is no villain. No one can be held responsible for everything that happens. There are no stereotypes and the public does not try to prove Leland's guilt. Instead, we sit down, relax, and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the film. All the problems described in the story are very real. Addiction, parental expectations, overwhelming sadness; they all exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling gives one of the greatest performances of his career in this film, as a depressed teenager, Leland. His father lives in Europe and cares little about his son. Becky is the only person he loves, but she herself has problems. He knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the movie, "You want a why, but maybe you do not have one. Maybe it's something that just happened. There is a why, but we do not find out before the end. Watching the film, the audience is surprised that a young man can learn more about the world. Leland notices things that people tend to ignore. <br /> <br /> One of Leland's conversations with Pearl was particularly disturbing to me. Pearl just cheated on his wife and when Leland asks why, Pearl says he's just a human. Then Leland says something that never happens to anyone: "Why do people only say that after doing something wrong?" <br /> <br /> Another fantastic job was Chris Klein. In the film, he plays Allen Harris, the boyfriend of Becky's sister, Julie (Michelle Williams). Although he is not one of the main characters, I was amazed at the depth of his character. You can talk a lot to Allen. You know how much he cares about the Pollard family. It's as if they are his own flesh and blood. At the end of the film, you realize how much he would help them. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a masterpiece that has been overlooked by many people. If, however, you take the time to look at it, you will probably see that everything I mentioned above is true. And once you finish watching it, you will never look at the world again in the same way. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
