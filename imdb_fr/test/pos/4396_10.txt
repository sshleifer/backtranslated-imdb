My husband received a OBWAT DVD for Christmas and it was the best gift we received! We watch it every time we need to laugh and we have already seen it 12 times! The landscape of this film is beautiful and the music is exceptional! We also bought the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home whenever we are. If anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for moviegoers, this movie is the case! The characters are hilarious, charming and their facial expressions are too funny to describe them! George Clooney fan, but now I'm also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete) and I'm looking for them now in other movies! You must see this movie !!!
