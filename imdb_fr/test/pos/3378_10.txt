I just want to say that the role of Chris Diamantopoulos as Williams for the whole show was worthy of the Emmys. It was amazing how he was doing well. And being as fast, random and as creative as Robin Williams is really ... WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos was supposed to say 20 quick lines and make 15 different characters while reproducing those lines, while looking just like ROBIN WILLIAMS who makes these characters ... well, my friends are awesome. It's one thing to do an imitation of Robin Williams for a few minutes. This is another way to do it for any TV movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how I felt about the series and I do not know how much they played with the facts, but I know it was Chris Diamantopoulos who made me watch. So, for that, I give him a 10.
