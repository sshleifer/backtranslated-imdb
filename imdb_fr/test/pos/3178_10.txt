Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool / and / or channel that opened young minds of black culture. The goal and the prospects were a message of positivity for our people and a hope for change. I advise this selection to all American households to experience the struggle and the reward. The series never had the chance to flourish in the idea that blacks of the middle class become business owners. The problems were so compatible with the real situations that affected the lives of so many people. I sincerely hope that all the volume can be restored and put on DVD so that the Americans can enjoy it as a family. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
