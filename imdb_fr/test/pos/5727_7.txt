OKAY. All in all, this three-part documentary will bring together most people interested in the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovering our universe. If you have read and understood Stephen Hawkings' brilliant book "A Brief History of Time", you could benefit from the visual description of certain concepts ... which I did to some extent. Greene is bearable, but obviously, in the interest of the masses, tends to explain things in a slightly condescending way. This is of course deliberate and will suit almost everyone watching this series. <br /> <br /> The invited scientists have been good. (No Hawking, but I guess he has his own DVD) I was waiting for him to appear, but they are running through the same almost 3 parts ... (very American here, with some British and antipode)) I bought the Nova 2 Disc Edition (NTSC) and some inclusions really hurt the overall experience. <br /> <br /> 1. The "this is brought to you by .." at the beginning of EACH part was a necessary evil for the first part, but seeing it twice before was over was very ordinary. <br /> <br /> 2. I can not help you, I guess, but there is a bit of overlap at the beginning of 2 and 3, which led me to hit the FFW button a few times. <br /> <br /> 3. This set of records came directly from the television. (quite different from the BBC material that is unmatched for presentation ... Planets, Blue Planet, etc.) My 7/10 is based on content alone. The niggles were there but I overcame them. If it had been done with this classic British-themed presenter (you know this one), it would be a perfect record game in my opinion. <br /> <br /> If you have seen this and want more ... I highly recommend the book Hawkings "A brief history of time" ... I wish it was also a film. <br /> <br /> Happy reading.
