* SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> There were still a few years left in Great WrestleManias. But this one was certainly good, with a lot of good games and a great match. <br /> <br /> Demolition has always been at its best at WrestleMania. I'm happy that their last WM houah (I refuse to include the other version) was a victory over Colossal Connection. I liked Andr√©'s gag, which never scored. <br /> <br /> Few fans know it was the first time someone beat Mr. Perfect. For some reason, the exploit of Brutus Beefcake has never been recognized. Or the fact that he did it quite easily. <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation's victory over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM history, including the second 24/9 match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Jake and DiBiase were able to fight at WrestleMania. This made up for the fact that the quarrel had to be suspended for so long. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the Big Bossman-Akeem quarrel to get warmer, but the Bossman just hit him. Even though Bossman was like a heel, he was just awesome as a face. He was always intense and obviously loved his job. <br /> <br /> If the warrior simply had a better work ethic and perhaps tried to learn how to fight, he would have been a great WWF champion. <br /> <br /> Worth a look, especially since boring games are too short to complain about. And the team matches are all very exciting.
