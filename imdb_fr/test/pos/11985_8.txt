This is not particularly well written. The songs are not memorable. The cast, however, draws a lot from this situation of Martin and Lewis in the Navy. They both look great as young sailors. They are credible. The scenes on the submarine show how cramped he had been in the underwater missions of the 1950s and earlier. <br /> <br /> Many sailors in many scenes. Hundreds perhaps, on a large outdoor sports field, then in a boxing arena. <br /> <br /> You will see James Dean in his scene. It stands out even if it is an extra here. In a scene where Jerry walks down a busy street, we see some of his comedy "almost an accident" that he will show years later in The Patsy. <br /> <br /> Dean, giving boxing instructions to Jerry to watch. Jerry in the ring shows his great energy that was his trademark in the late 40s and early 50s. Dean and Jerry dancing is a treat. Not great, but better than most non-dancing movies. <br /> <br /> To see if you do not like black and white. Good end. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
