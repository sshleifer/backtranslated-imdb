It is a film that should be seen and treated as a work of art. It is a work of unconscious love done by the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima, which contains many truly artistic elements. The film goes from color to black and white, from the past to the present, Mishima's fictional works. All without being confusing in the least. The only thing that makes me understand is that the whole film, with the exception of the spoken parts of the narrator, is in Japanese. Another masterpiece that deserves an audience but has not been found. Criterion, if you're reading this, it's a movie that should be published under your fingerprint with as many extras as possible. This film really deserves more. 10/10
