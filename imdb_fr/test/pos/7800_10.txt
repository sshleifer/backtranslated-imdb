It's my favorite Indian movie of all time. He's a comic genius. Salman Khan is hilarious. But Amir Khan steals the show with his spiritual dialogue. Karisma Kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own - one wonders if the stylist has deliberately forced her to wear some of the clothes just to make the movie more funny (at one point, it looks like she is wearing a diaper) . Andaz Apna Apna is the only comic genre movie to make me laugh from start to finish. There is not one boring moment, each scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will make you laugh. I particularly liked the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) "finds his memory". I have seen this film so many times that I lost count. And I'm so happy to say that this time Bollywood can claim all the credit for this fantastic film as far as I know A.A.A. This is not a replica of a Hollywood movie (THANK YOU GOD). Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who understands Hindi / Urdu and loves good comedy. <br /> <br /> Look at it, you will love it !!!!!
