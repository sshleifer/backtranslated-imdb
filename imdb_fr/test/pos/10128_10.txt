Normally, I'm not a type of dramatic / sentimental film type, but once I saw the trailer for "Radio," I could not resist. Not only is it a good movie, but there is also a lot of acting. Cuba Gooding Jr. did a great job in describing James Robert Kennedy, aka "RAdio". Ed Harris has also done a fantastic job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see a comedy too. So for a nice story, a good acting and a little comedy, I give "Radio" a 10 out of 10!
