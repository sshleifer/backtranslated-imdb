Everyone knows that Lindburgh has made the first transatlantic flight. So, how can there be suspense or intrigue in this movie? Well, there is. Do not ask me how, but there are some. Partly because of the director's story-telling expert, but most of all because of Jimmy Stewart's extremely engaging performance, we are drawn into the story as if it were happening for the first time before our eyes. Despite the fact that half of the film is shot in a small cockpit, it is as dynamic as any action. So, if you are afraid of seeing this movie because you already think about the story, try it. I think you will be impressed.
