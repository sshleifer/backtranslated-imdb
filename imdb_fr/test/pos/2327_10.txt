The scripting of subtle comedy is unmatched by any film in recent years. The characters are interesting, even if they are a little predictable. The comic timing written in the script is ample enough to offset a worn-out plot of sloppy. When you are sure to know the end ... SURPRISE! Highly recommended for all ages, even if the youngest will probably not appreciate some of the most subtle references, they will certainly appreciate a scene of galley in particular! Super movie!
