Ironically, what makes John Carpenter "The Thing" such an entertaining sci-fi film is his elements defying the genre, the mystery, the suspense and the narrow structure of the plot.

Nowadays, we simply turn the switch and put our mind in "pause". Is "The Thing" a "good" movie? For the rare individual who still values ​​his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be "entertaining". His plot suggests, his end is uncompromising and he has some redemptive statements to make about human paranoia. During subsequent viewing, we begin to note a lack of depth in the game of actors, but the tense scenario remains convincing. Of course, "Citizen Kane" is not the case, but again, science fiction has never been the kind of thinking man ...
