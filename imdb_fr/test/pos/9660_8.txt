It's probably the best movie of 2002 about Romanian cinema. I recommend that it be an intense drama without lack of action and thrills. The film focuses on teenage life in the suburbs of Bucharest through the main character. He does not focus so much on the shape or definition of the character as on the anger he feels with other characters. The title "Furia" means anger rather than anger, but could be considered in the film in both directions from the actors' behavior. The somewhat strange love story (not a typical romantic story, but rather a modern suburban design) is well-crafted towards the end. This is a captivating photo and cinematography captures the suburban nightlife, making it a fun and enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> You will not be bored for a minute, I promise!
