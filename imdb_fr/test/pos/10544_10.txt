At first, this seems to be the romantic news movie where a girl meets a boy and falls in love, but the fact is that this movie has a feeling that others do not have. The first time I saw him, I could not see him full But while I was walking, I thought I had to see him again but I had no opportunity at that time. A year went by until I saw this film in a non-free channel and I saw it and I recorded I saw it once, twice ... up to 200 times and I am not joking. I knew all the hart dialogues and I do not know why, but I saw it every day and I never got bored.And I must say that I'm not used to seeing a movie more than two The act is very good. Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and Katherine Heigl too. I would like her to be in a good movie because I think she can do it. I can not get out of my head.
