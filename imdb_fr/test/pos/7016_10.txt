I heard about this movie for the first time from a friend. She loved him and always looked at her. When she told me about it and how old it was, I immediately decided not to like it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was such an amazing movie! I like music and dance. I bought the soundtrack and the DVD immediately after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were brilliant. They captured the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. They were both good dancers. After watching the film, I wanted to be able to dance like them and I hope I can start dancing in the ballroom and Latin dance soon. I became a fan of this kind of dance and became addicted to all the movies and programs that talk about it. Dirty Dancing has revealed my passion for dance and music. My favorite part of the movie is when Baby enters the staff headquarters and sees them dancing. This is obviously the last scene where Baby and Johnny dance together in front of everyone. I think everyone has to watch Dirty Dancing at least once in their life. If they do not, it's their loss !!
