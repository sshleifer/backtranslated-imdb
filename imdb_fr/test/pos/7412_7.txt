I just saw this film in preview and before reading my comment, know that it is very subjective because I love techno, trance, club, house and music of this kind. <br /> <br /> Carl, whose brother Jason (or whatever his name) died of an accident: he fell from a roof, "drunk". Carl meets his brother's girlfriend, Sunny, and the two are not motivated by a private investigation into Jason's death. Carl is involved in Jason's ex-life, filled with clubs and drugs. The film itself, seen from an artistic point of view, is nothing more than a big pile of films. The plot is predictable, all the characters are extremely clich√©s and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town, innocent girl of beautiful appearance, big bad king of drugs ... the list is endless) and most of the actors that the plot is simply not credible. Matthew Rhys's portrayal of the foolish boy from Greater London and the sudden drug take on people he does not even know does not seem credible, unlike his female counterpart Sunny, played by Sienna Guillory, whose behavior seems more realistic to the viewer. Tim Curry interpreted the king of the drug Damian as a joke: a fake caricature, too "selfish" and too ridiculous to be true. <br /> <br /> BUT: If you like club music (club scenes like the chosen tracks are just great), if you enjoy a simple love affair with a sweet girl like Sunny (yes, I admit, I lost my heart;) ... that makes my comment even more subjective, I guess) with some (predictably) you will definitely enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone else: FORGET IT ... IT! <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 (objective view) <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 (my personal opinion and also my final vote)
