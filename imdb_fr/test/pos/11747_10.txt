I consider this love story, written with sensitivity, to be one of the true masterpieces of the screen. After watching this film, initially on the screen with my mother in Los Angeles, California, when it was released, it was many years before I had the opportunity to relive it. The beauty, the simplistic and calm elegance and the tranquility of the film have set me apart from many other films of its kind. Yes, tears come to my eyes when I see them and I hear the chorus of this unique song in a lifetime. maybe still, today, my most beloved movie of all time. I hope this classic love story will be appreciated and appreciated by our future generations.
