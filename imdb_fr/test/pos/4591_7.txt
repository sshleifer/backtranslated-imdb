There is a lot of trouble with this movie. I will not lie. I will say that most problems have the impression that they come from a budget that was cut below the film, as well as some bad breath work. <br /> <br /> This is not an office space. Do not expect comedy levels in Office Space. It's very funny anyway. It's a mess, but a lot of fun at the same time. A funny movie. In the way Caddyshack is funny. A mess of fun scenes unrelated to boring and boring scenes. <br /> <br /> This works as a whole, however, and certainly deserves a large-scale release. This is the best commentary on the nation Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV you can hope for. The very fact that a movie explores the idea that stupid people are reproducing at an alarming rate while smart people do not do it, is excellent in my book. Not very politically correct but deserves at least a debate.
