"One minute to pray, one second to die" is a quality spaghetti western with a solid cast and an interesting storyline. It is beautifully filmed, with a relatively high production value for a film of this kind. <br /> <br /> Alex Cord does a remarkable job in portraying Clay McCord, an outlaw with increasingly debilitating seizures. He seeks amnesty before his enemies get closer to him, but he is too pretentious for his good when he asks for it. Robert Ryan offers the best performance of the film as governor of New Mexico. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also very good here. <br /> <br /> This film is very good, but it does not seem like one of the best spaghetti westerns on the market. It lacks too much style to be in the same league as the big ones. It has some nuances of spaghetti, but overall, it looks a bit too much like an American western. This is particularly evident in the musical score, which is acceptable for films in general, but rather dull by Euro-Western standards. The soundtrack reminds me a bit of the music of "The Unforgiven". Although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a way that is a little too conventional for my taste. If a spaghetti western fan and a Western Hollywood fan had to watch a movie together, it would be the ideal compromise. <br /> <br /> All this does not mean that anyone should avoid this movie. I loved watching it. As I said, it's a very well done movie and I recommend it to anyone who loves westerns, spaghetti or whatever.
