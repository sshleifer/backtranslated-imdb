When we talk about independent cinema in the United States, it is often inferred that this means that the filmmaker or the people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted. This is not always the case today, unless one is a solid author and the freedom of creation comes always with the warning that one must find its distribution in one of the independent divisions of the great studios or get caught for one kind or another. low level at a valid film festival. But Putney Swope, Robert Downey Sr's film about a tough African-American, was accidentally promoted to the advertising guru position in a production company, * is * an independent cinema, a kind of work that went well with the Romero's likes of Night of Living Dead and Cassavetes are confronted at the same time where they do not get a typical studio cast, but cause waves, kick in the ass and take names in the world of cinema. For all its rough and raw moments, it's unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's also a funny film, very funny. Sometimes the sense of humor is so ridiculous that it's almost impossible not to laugh, from the mere appearance of President Mimeo with his wife to dialogues from Swope's commercials like "I Can not Eat air conditioner "a real voice" soul ". It's as intelligent as the audience it's aimed at, that is, whoever has two brain cells to assemble and who can see that this work is not offensive or * shocking * because it is designed to shake the cage, and he does that very well. well in the first five minutes. Once that's gone, Downey Sr launches his blitz as a filmmaker with nothing to lose: his protagonist is part of Fidel Castro, Isaac Hayes around 1972 (and yes, it's in 1969 in the film) and hard to cook. with a shooting sequence to make Mr. Spacely on the Jetson look kind. And do not forget these characters, my god. <br /> <br /> There are so many lines and memorable moments that it's hard to keep track. From the most hilarious assassination attempt of all the movies to the only advertisement for the "Face-Off" skin cream that contains replicas that would give South Park a chance to make money for the dirty mouth, up to a small gap with Jack's The movies of Hill playing the role of the Muslim who keeps mocking Swope and this boy with the nun who curses a storm and impresses Swope with a fast blow. It's a pretty straightforward message about the media and advertising, but there are also a lot of highlights where we talk about racism in America, sometimes without having to do more than a gesture and sometimes with something of Huge like having black panther types go well and that around the Swope advertising scheme. And for a low budget production (I mean super low, hence the comparison with Night of the Undead and Faces), Downey has very good actors, all non-unionized, and it's hard to imagine that some of them had their first time here. <br /> <br /> It's worth mentioning that Downey's style does not make it perfect: it's raw and sometimes too crazy and dated for its good, and I'm sure I did not do it. I do not feel the humor underlying some ads since I am a full generation after their broadcast (although the "Miss Redneck Jersey" is definitely not lost for me). In general, it is one of the most beautiful periods in its history, a satire that stings and a feature dominated black that knows too much of an excess of power, regardless of the color of the skin. It is, as someone might say, "well ***".
