Kite Runner is without a doubt one of the most amazing books I've read in recent years. I might have high expectations of the movie, but nevertheless the film was good, the decor seemed realistic. nothing has been imagined. the dialogues were not very attractive or powerful, they were right. The movie was not a bad experience at all, especially in the last 15 minutes, when he became very emotional and even the hardest of men would probably cry. But my imagination was much better than the movie ... I cried more while reading the novel than seeing the movie. but overall, it's a good movie to see for those of you who are not readers. but readers, the novel would be a better experience, so if you want to see the movie, read it first, and then compare it to the movie.
