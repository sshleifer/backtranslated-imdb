Although it's dark, depressing and sometimes hard to watch, You Are Alone has captured my attention and has been refreshingly frank in its dialogue. He really captured the anguish of teenage relationships. Plus, the soundtrack was amazing. The words and tone of the songs complemented the film's sadness so well that one wondered if the tracks had been created specifically for the film. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever watched. His convincing and credible performance made the film. I wondered if she was really a prostitute. Who knows. Anyway, the movie was definitely worth the detour. LOVE, YOUR SISTER! Yes, it's true....
