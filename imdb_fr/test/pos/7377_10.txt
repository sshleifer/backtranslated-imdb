I would like to say that I absolutely loved the campfire tales! For me, it was one of the original horror movies with a crooked end. As if the content of the movie was not scary or strange enough, you have the end. It's a really great movie and I'm so happy it's released on DVD on August 30th. I will not hesitate to get my copy that day. I do not think the film received all the credit or recognition that it should have, because all those other films came out soon after and were recognized, but if my brother had not told me about the film, I would not have known. Which stinks because in my opinion it's much better than any "Scream", "I know what you did last summer", or any other horror of that time. So I hope you can see the film yourself and at least see the difference. I loved it, and being a fan of horror movies, Campfire Tales was like a dessert for me!
