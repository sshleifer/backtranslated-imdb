This film was well played and kept my interest for the main character throughout the film. Stu Unger has lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu was alive today! This film paints a picture of Stu Unger's life. It was interesting to see how the connection was growing. I would have liked to see more details about Stu's party, his game and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But overall, the film was well done, well played and the story touched many facets of a life rich in larger-than-life events. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be praised.
