From a simple description of the main elements of THE TOLL GATE's plot, one might think that it is a Western revisionist of the 60's or 70's. <br /> <br /> * Our hero is a thief, a killer and a pyromaniac; <br /> <br /> * The love interest is that of a single mother whose husband, a man without a shift, abandoned her with her child; <br /> <br /> * twice our criminal hero is "unofficially" released by the authorities in exchange for good deeds, which is presented as a commendable act; <br /> <br /> * the only acts that are presented as truly perverse are the treason of his family and that of a criminal collaborator; <br /> <br /> * the hero tries to get straight to the point, but turns to the crime again after being unable to get a job; <br /> <br /> * the hero is on the run from both the sheriff and the gang of criminals; <br /> <br /> * the final redemption of the hero is accomplished by strangling a man with his bare hands and throwing his body on a cliff; <br /> <br /> * and the "good bad man" ends the film by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and descending alone in the Mexican desert, never (presumably) paying for his life of crime . <br /> <br /> This proves that there is nothing new under the sun. <br /> <br /> Of course, THE TOLL GATE does not quite display the cynicism or moral nihilism of his successors: the hero's redemption is set up when he goes to the band after reading a passage of the Bible. I can not imagine Clint Eastwood doing that. <br /> <br /> THE TOLL GATE is an excellent film from every point of view, and Hart is a very good actor, who is not ready for the great histrionic often used to convey the emotion of our days. before the sound. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
