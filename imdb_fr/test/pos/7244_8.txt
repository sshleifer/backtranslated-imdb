As always, Joan Hickson is wonderful as Jane M. Subtil, lively and conscious. I do not want to dwell on her acting skills, because they are sufficiently rented on this site. I would like to criticize some of the smaller parties, the rest of the cast seeming to have been hand-picked by director David Tucker. <br /> <br /> Liz Fraser's performance as Mrs. Bent (the mother of the missing daughter Nora) is a joy to watch. Subtle and deeply moving, this mother in mourning dependent on alcohol and who loves her daughter in despair. A good long shot of his monologue (thank you Tucker!) To enjoy it fully. I was moved when I saw her for the first time at the time of the broadcast and I am moved again. I have it now on DVD. Brava. <br /> <br /> Joanna Hole as Madge, the tour guide, seems to me very funny. She is about to play but her role may have it. She is so funny as a too organized guide who wants to do good for everyone on this bus, I find it hilarious. His reaction after boarding the bus is great ... As always: to make comedy, you have to take it very seriously, and that's what Ms. Hole does. <br /> <br /> I hope these two ladies have a good career (I live in Holland and I do not know if they have been .. All theatrical productions can not be googee .. .). Their on-screen performances deserve it. <br /> <br /> Pieter
