I had to get old because I was fascinated by this movie since the first time I saw it. I'm watching again right now on HBO. It's a very simple movie about two people falling in love after discovering that their spouses had an affair. The plot is very thin, but the actors played very well in this film. Kristen Scott Thomas shows up for the convention and Harrison Ford is an internal affairs policeman. These two men meet in unfortunate circumstances and fall in love with each other. I love the soundtrack. Perfect fit. One thing I can not understand, this film had a budget of $ 68 million. Was it past? The plane crash or Harrison Ford's salary?
