I am 15 years old, usually no kids of my age usually watch these old classic movies. But it's one of my favorites. I was totally hooked after watching it for the first time. It's really good if you think about technology and movies at that time, the music is excellent, the script is OK, the choreography is excellent, you have to see it. I do not know why there is a prequel for this movie. Few people like this movie, but I love classic love movies, they are so much better than movies now! This movie will make you smile, cry and make you dance. The music is breathtaking and beautiful. I have not seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (prequel), prequel should have played the original actors, that's what I hate prequels, they ruin the original. Nobody wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many people will agree that for a film, the original, the sequel and the third are enough. Beyond that, people will not be bothered to watch it. Who remembers the film about St Benard Beethoven? I think there are 5 films in all.
