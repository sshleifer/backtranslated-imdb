In 1929, the director Walt Disney and the animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of the animation with the release of the very first part of their series "Silly Symphonies", "The Skeleton Dance". Iwerks and Disney have been collaborating since the early 1920s on Disney's "Laugh-O-Gram" cartoon series; However, their friendship suffered a blow when Iwerks accepted a competitor's proposal to leave Disney and create his own animation studio. It was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued to develop his style and technique (and created the character of Flip the Frog). Although his work retains the same quality, it is not very popular and in 1936, the studio is closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures and decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. <br /> <br /> "Skeleton Frolics" of 1937 is essentially a remake of 1929 the classic "The Skeleton Dance", the film that earned him glory and fortune. Like this short film, it takes place in an abandoned cemetery where, at midnight, the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play. The dead come out of their coffins, ready for the show that is about to begin, while a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra, and begin to play a merry air. It's not easy being a musician made only of bone, because some members of the orchestra have problems of parts of body. However, the group managed to make a good show and another group of skeletons began to dance. Some of them face the same problems as the orchestra: it is difficult to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends at dawn and, at the very moment when the sun will rise, the skeletons will go to their graves. <br /> <br /> Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself, "Skeleton Frolics" faithfully follows the pattern established by "Skeleton Dance" many years ago, though with one crucial difference: Iwerks did everything the film in Technicolor. The bright tones allowed Iwerks to create a visually appealing film and use the many new techniques he had practiced since his departure from Disney, creating effects of depth and dynamism even better than those he had conceived before. It's certainly a more experimental film than "The Skeleton Dance", though, unfortunately, that does not necessarily mean it's a better movie. For starters, the film is virtually identical to the one he did with Disney, the only differences being music (more on this later) and color effects. It looks beautiful, no doubt, but it really looks a little original after all. <br /> <br /> However, it's not the lack of originality of the concept that really hurts the film (after all, Iwerks performs it a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is rather uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one directed by Carl W. Stalling for "The Skeleton Dance". In other words, if the DeNat melody is effective and theme-specific, it's easy to forget about it quickly, while Stalling's song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film, this is of great importance and the mediocrity of the music thus makes Iwerk's flawless animation work. Personally, I think that with a better musical accompaniment, one would also remember "Skeleton Frolics" that "The Skeleton Dance", even if it is not so revolutionary, because it is always a funny film to watch. <br /> <br /> It's nice It's unfortunate that most of the work that Iwerks did after leaving Disneyland is now forgotten because of its poor success. However, it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (the main rival of Disney), it did not lack the quality It was probably a case of bad luck that made the man who gave the Disney's mouse life for the first time facing a Disney failure. Despite its flaws, "Skeleton Frolics" is a very funny and visually stunning movie. film, although it is not the most original and cool film (we can not help but think of "The Skeleton Dance" by looking at it), it definitely reminds us that the skeletons of Iwerk are always there to haunt us and inspire us. <br /> <br /> 8/10
