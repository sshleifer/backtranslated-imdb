I went to this thinking thinking about another raw movie with rude humor. Saying my first sentence I do not like this humor and this movie had its moments but I loved it. Justin Long has never really done comedy like this, where he's sarcastic, intelligent and I love. Lewis Black .... enough said. The end that I really liked because it had to be taken seriously, that is, if not, how would you solve it? Yes, it's another underdog story, but not in your usual format and the film was not their ups and downs, they are people who come together for a common goal: go to university where they have been accepted. The cast was amazing and yes, I laughed when I did not think to do it and the laughter lasted longer than expected. The parents and the sister played well their roles but their characters are put in case of need. The film was not centered on them but at the same time, they showed up when we expected it or not. They played very well in the story, and I loved the familiar faces Anthony Heald (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long), Ross Patterson (The New Guy) and Sam Horrigan ( Brink). Blake Lively added something to the movie that made it even more enjoyable, as did B's friends. I recommend this movie to anyone who has hated these coarse comedies of the last 4 years and really wants some humor and a story in reality! ~!
