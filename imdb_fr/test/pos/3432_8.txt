Very entertaining movie with some of the best Swedish actors. Everything is filmed in black and white with the real feeling of 40 years old. Most of the film, you are on a train bound for Berlin in 1945, among a mix of characters ranging from refugees to 2 gays and 2 nuns. I really recommend this movie if you like to laugh.
