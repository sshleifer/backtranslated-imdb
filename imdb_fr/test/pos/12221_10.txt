I bought the complete season of Surface. watched in 3 days! I was so captivated by the plot, theories and basically everything about this show. The actor who plays Miles is awesome. Mile's sister, father and mother acted as their families would. You can connect to so many levels, it's fascinating. <br /> <br /> I find the animals so wonderful that you can almost connect with them as a parent is for a child. It would be something if a creature of this kind really exists. <br /> <br /> I am saddened, this Surface does not have a second season nor at least four other shows. I have so many questions that need to be answered and I hope they will perhaps create more or maybe in a book. <br /> <br /> I really like the show. For those who have not looked at Surface, if you like science fiction, you have to watch that !!!!!!!!!!!!!
