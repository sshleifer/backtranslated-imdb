If vampire stories are your cup of blood, then this gothic feast based on Anne Rice Vampire's chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience. A true consortium of undead in a contemporary setting, "Queen of the Damned", directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness, and unhappy souls who dwell there for eternity. <br /> <br /> The vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), bored by a world that no longer excites him, has been asleep for many years; but suddenly, the sounds of this world he hears from his long sleep change and, loving what he hears, he ventures to investigate. What he discovers is a world filled with new sounds, a new kind of music - catchy and penetrating - sounds that assail the senses and make him feel alive and welcome. And he knows his time has finally come, that it's time for him and those like him to come forward and face the world on their terms. To this end, he becomes the leading man in a group - a unique singer and performer. He presents himself as a vampire and quickly brings an audience that extends well beyond London (where it all begins) and finally take him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to to be beyond everything. Lestat is powerful, without question, but some of his ilk are not favorable to the fact that he has revealed them, one of which is Marius (Vincent Perez). ), a powerful vampire of his own right - the vampire, in fact, who "created" Lestat so many years ago - and they gather, gather and plan to meet Lestat at the concert. And they do not go for music. But there is also another thing: at one point, Lestat inadvertently awakened his "mother", the most powerful of all vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah), who was about to make his presence known to all, and especially to the one she chose to rule alongside him as his king: Lestat. And at the concert, do not worry, Akasha will be at the rendezvous, without fail. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, this is the story of Lestat, and Rymer presents it in a setting rich in atmospheres and exquisite moments, although his film has less spice than saying " Interview with the vampire "or" Bram Stoker's Dracula ". It has a good rhythm and some scenes offer real chills, but overall, the film is not as threatening as it could be, nor as much as one might expect. In the final count, in fact, the amount of cremated flesh outweighs the true bleeding, although there is more than a taste of gore and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with red substance . There are also some good F / Xs, especially in sequences that accentuate the speed of vampires, as they move and fly through the air faster than the naked eye can discern. It's a decent job for Rymer, but he could have put more guts if he had played on the alienation evoked by Lestat; As things stand, you have an idea of ​​his detachment, but not enough to fully involve you. <br /> <br /> In "Interview with the vampire", Tom Cruise brought a charismatic power to the role of Lestat, But Townsend is even more effective, with a look and an attitude that perfectly capture Lestat. He plays it with a sense of acceptance, and under scrutiny you can even find a hint of remorse and nostalgia. It's a good performance that sells his character convincingly. <br /> <br /> As Marius, Vincent Perez also does a good job - he's actually one of the film's assets - although his character is a little ambiguous; this, however, has more to do with how it was written than with Perez's performance, which is very good. <br /> <br /> Marguerite Moreau, like Jesse, is a young woman too curious for her good; and the magnificent Lena Olin in the role of Maharet, Jesse's aunt, who plays a central role in the outcome of the drama involving Lestat and Akasha. <br /> <br /> And as Akasha, Aaliyah is an absolutely fascinating presence. What more can you say about her if she is not a talented performer, with extraordinary talent and beauty? And tragically, she left us far too soon. <br /> <br /> The following actors are Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spence (Khayman), Matthew Newton. (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Maudy). With a story much stronger than the usual offerings of this particular genre, Anne Rice fans will be delighted with "Queen of the Damned", a beautifully designed film presented by director Rymer and her appealing cast. Focusing her attention on the drama of the story - and the way it is presented - rather than just providing thrills, Rymer has managed to produce a real horror film that clearly outperforms your appetite for more of the same thing. And that's the magic of cinema. I note this one 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
