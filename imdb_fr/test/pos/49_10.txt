Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting a time filled with emotions and various characters through the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly supports "it takes a village to raise a child" and recalls an important moment in black history and culture. I gained incredible respect for Macy Gray as an actress. His character was a little crazy, but adorable; Clearly, we all knew someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as a nanny. I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress. Law & Order never showed the depth of Epatha's acting abilities like Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and surprised! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood ... it was a sweet nostalgic walk in the backstage of memory. I really enjoyed the film and I look forward to the release of the DVD to enrich my collection.
