Accepted ... let's see. The only reason I chose to watch this movie was the hot dog advertised when Shrader (sp?) Said, "ASK ME OF MY WEINER". After that, I had to see this movie and I watched it with some friends ... and WOW amazing. One of the best movies of the year. The whole movie I was laughing like crazy! The plot in this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) is not accepted in any of the schools he has postulated, so he creates another fake college for him and his friends in order to trick his parents and convince him of the to enter college. . So he puts the finishing touches to his parents and cheats them ... until more and more students come to the website and see the clicker (ACCEPTANCE IS ONE CLICK AWAY) and all these rejections come to this school . They face many problems and they do not seem to be able to get anything. 10/10
