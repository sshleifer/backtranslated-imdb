By mistake, I ordered a BBC series, their new version of Robin Hood. Very disappointing in comparison with RoS. Terrible costuming and backgrounds. While I enjoyed the sheriff, who was taking the example of Nick Grace, the rest of the cast left a lot to be desired. As "for example", Marion's costumes seemed to come from Walmart. And Sir Guy, well, he looked a bit like a movie character on the space! RoS stole the show, probably forever, in the story of this story. Casting, costumes, stories, sets, filming and soundtracks by Clannad are all superb, as evidenced by all the continuous returns around 26 years later. RoS is a timeless classic. Thank you to everyone who made the series.
