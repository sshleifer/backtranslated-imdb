It is less visceral than the only other Tsai film I've seen ("Long Live Love"), but the idea of ​​making breakthroughs in the emotions and lives of others is clearly illustrated here, while Tsai is staged, usually with long catches, suggesting a sense of alienation in Taipei. The musical interludes, inspired by Grace Chang, are a source of perplexity, but they are a step forward that adds a new dimension to the slowly evolving relationship between the young man at the top and the woman at the bottom. It's not necessarily an easy-to-watch movie (though it's not hard to handle), so I want to warn all casual viewers looking for "independent" entertainment (like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie). But if you want to know more about the isolation of city dwellers in Taiwan and the universality of alienation of cities and romantic aspirations, watch this film immediately.
