Although this little film is lost in the wake of On The Waterfront, Edge Of The City can certainly hold its place with this classic star. This is another story about the docks and the code of silence that governs it. <br /> <br /> Next to the corrupt union Lee J. Cobb directed in On The Waterfront, Jack Warden is a real little corruption. But he's quite real as a gang leader on one of the wharves that intimidates other workers by wielding his fists and hooks and getting the rest to give him some of their hard-earned money. And all this money is hard earned in this work. <br /> <br /> One of the guardians can not intimidate is Sidney Poitier, another gang leader, and when he tries to intimidate the newcomer John Cassavetes, Poitier takes him under his wing. The two friends develop a great friendship. Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee even summon Cassavetes with Kathleen Maguire. <br /> <br /> Warden is really a disgusting creature and he is sad to see how much he is almost by the force of his personality and his physical prowess. everyone in submission. In this sense, he is harder than Lee J. Cobb who had to rely on a collection of impressions to impose his will in On The Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Edge Of The City marked the debut of Martin Ritt's big-screen director who did a great job with a good cast of New York-based players and a cinematic position. The budget of the film is well displayed, but you are so impressed by the overall cast that you do not care. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes, lonely past and hip and hard Poitier, is fine, but my favorite in this film is Ruby Dee. She should have been rewarded for her performance. His last scene with Cassavetes is exceptional. <br /> <br /> Catch this one if possible. I wish it to be on DVD or VHS.
