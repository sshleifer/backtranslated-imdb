"Four Girls" begins with another clone of the "Little Women" type melodrama. A single father with four girls eligible for musical talent has his hands full in trying to keep them online and guide them in their court rituals. What makes the film turn is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star, according to some critics, the first anti-hero long before James Dean goes to the big screen. From the moment the dark and threatening figure of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appears at the door of Ann Lemp (Priscilla Lane) splashing his self-pity and his condemned philosophy on the rest of the cast, "Four Daughters" becomes well more than a flick chick. <br /> <br /> Although Garfield is the main reason for watching "Four Girls", there are other flashes of genius to enjoy. Hungarian-born director Michael Curtiz, later responsible for "Casablanca" and "Mildred Pierce", shoots some of the images with his camera (helped by Ernest Haller's cinematographer of "Rebel Without A Cause" fame) who remains in the spectator's mind, for example, the creaking door on which Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), Ann's first suitor, rocks so happily, becomes symbolic of the mood and affection changes of those who use it . <br /> <br /> Garfield delivers outstanding performance is evident, but the rest of the cast follows him almost all the time. Jeffrey Lynn, an underrated man, plays his role perfectly as a neglected suitor whose love for his darling Ann never fades, even when she is with another man. Claude Rains, a little disconcerted as the father of four young women who arrive in the age, gives a beautiful portrait of a raging family leader who gets lost in trouble. The three Lane Sisters, already famous for their musical talents, turn into accomplished actresses and play their role well. A host of supportive actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson and Eddie Acuff, make all this credible. <br /> <br /> The way the opposites attract is part of the stratagem that allows to touch the quick of the imagination of the viewer. Ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are down. She always looks on the bright side and, like many people caught in the claws of the Great Depression at that time, she saw prosperity at hand. Mickey recites a whole list of bad things that happened to him in search of company in his misery of Ann, which Ann refuses to do. Mickey expects to come out with a lightning bolt striking him dead as he turns around the corner of his life. Mickey has little talent as a composer; Ann has talent to resell as a singer and musician. Ann is great on beauty; Mickey loves personality a lot in a distorted sense. And the differences continue again and again. The way all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the film, not to be missed. <br /> <br /> See "Four Daughters" for John Garfield's fantasy film debuting on the big screen. The only time he was better came seven years later, when he once again hypnotized moviegoers with one of the greatest on-screen performances of all time, like Frank Chambers in "The Postman Always Rings Two time ", in front of the no less charismatic Lana Turner. But also watch "Four Girls" to catch important items that can be missed if too much concentration is placed on the star of the show.
