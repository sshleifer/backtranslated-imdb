Anyone who is familiar with horror movies knows that most of them are not scary at all. Some people like gorefests with below average stories and character development. Personally, I like horror movies that deal with interesting atmosphere and concepts (eg, a tale of two sisters, Kairo, etc.). No matter what type of horror film you personally love, there are only a few that really scare you. Noroi is one of them. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary-style film, which means that the entire movie is a compilation of video clips linked by the legend of a demonic entity named Kagutaba. The principle is that a journalist filmed his own footage by interviewing people associated with the demonic rituals associated with Kagutaba, and then compiled footage from other sources related to his research. The result is a scary and frightening experience that seems very real and very disturbing, even if the story is wrong. <br /> <br /> Some have compared Noroi with The Blair Witch Project, but the only similarity is that of the documentary. style. One obvious difference between the films is that Noroi scares the viewer by connecting events to each other using different sources. For example, the journalist records the outside of a house he is researching and sees something strange on the porch. Later in the film, an excerpt from another character's personal video introduces this same strange event. The viewer's memory connects the two incidents and chills begin to be felt. Another example is a TV show with a psychic child who answers all but one of the questions correctly. In fact, his answer is so false that the viewer can wonder what the filmmakers thought. Later, however, this bad answer turns out to be linked to an extremely disturbing event. It's really a smart movie. <br /> <br /> Another difference between Noroi and Blair Witch is that Noroi does not provide one, but two very long finals, the second of which is placed one minute after the start of the credits. and is the biggest scene of fear in the history of horror cinema. I do not say these things lightly. It totally destroyed me. <br /> <br /> Other aspects of making a movie are well done. The legend and the ritual context of Kagutaba are very interesting and most of the actors did a good job. The only extravagant performance comes from a guy who is supposed to be crazy anyway, so that's to be expected. Cinematography is intentionally grainy because all images are supposed to represent videos shot on camcorders. Japanese movies are not known for their special effects, but the effects used here were great. In some cases, they create a sensation of another world (for example, static interference or the first end) but in other cases they are extremely realistic (for example, the second end). <br /> <br /> When all is said and done, Noroi is the scariest movie I have ever seen. I would even go so far as to say that there is no film offering terror as pure as Noroi's. See now
