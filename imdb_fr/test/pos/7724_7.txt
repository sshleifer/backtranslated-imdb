There were about 60 different movies and TV shows, in addition to the classic opera of this tale of a crazy sex girl and her unfortunate lover soldier. This story has been made so many times, in different ways. <br /> <br /> Vicente Aranda directs Joaquin Jorda's script adaptation of Prosper Merimee's novel and play. <br /> <br /> It's the ONLY Story of Carmen Carmen <br /> <br /> Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen, full of passion and able to lead simple men to do tragic and terrible things . Leonardo Sbaraglio is the unlucky soldier who is trapped in Carmen's poisoned network and leads to do bad things. <br /> <br /> Jay Benedict is the author Prosper who tells this story. <br /> <br /> There is not much action, BUT there are very hot sex scenes. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's almost a movie of NC-17. <br /> <br /> since I have seen this tale so often in so many Guises I was not too impressed. <br /> <br /> It's a very well made film and will interest everyone who may not know it, <br /> <br /> My criticism is not too enthusiastic too It may be that I miss the fantastic Bizet opera score. <br /> <br /> See this as you may like it more than me. <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points out of 100 IMDb 7 (out of 10)
