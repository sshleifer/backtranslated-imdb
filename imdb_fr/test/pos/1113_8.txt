The most vivid portrait of the quaintness of a small town I've seen for a long time - and I'm not just talking about Australian films. This work seems to have been done "under the radar" and, in reality, it is a fascinating work, which has an almost invisible worldliness in the recent Aust. film making. <br /> <br /> Sometimes he's rather slow and strange - he seems to be strolling here and there, not really sure whether it's a thriller or a "head movie". But the amazing aspect of Alex Frayne's film lies in his ruthless, iron-fisted direction. It never weakens, it is highly controlled, precise and absolutely assured. Cinematography is one of the most astute, beautiful and lyrical I have ever seen. Sound is all psychological, music creates tension. <br /> <br /> From the third act, the story is intensified and the episodes cross and converge - do not try to reconstruct the enigma of the last 20 minutes. It's a little impost - but at that moment, the film has turned you into a trance, a kind of hypnosis, and you've been sold an enigma - which has no real answer.
