Quality documentary about two Sudanese refugees resettled in the United States. This is the basic story of a fish out of the water with a touch of non-fiction. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived before coming to America and how they had adapted when they arrived here (in Houston, Texas). They expected a kind of paradise but discovered that it was much more difficult to prepare for it. well in the states. They range from optimistic optimists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. Wherever they go, they meet bureaucrats with scraps of paper that most citizens can take for granted. They fear being blacker than African Americans and do not feel accepted for this reason. One of the "Lost Boys" manages to leave Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas, where he finds the conditions a little better but still less ideal. There are people trying to help them and try to hurt them in this film. Those who looked at a weapon and stole it are not shown, but talked about it, which led a lost boy to comment negatively that "all blacks in America are not good". I also found it interesting that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, a month before the attack on the World Trade Center by terrorists. I had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy, but it is not mentioned at all. Nevertheless, a documentary really well done without narration. None is really necessary. The "lost boys" do a great job explaining the events unfolding around them without any help, thank you very much.
