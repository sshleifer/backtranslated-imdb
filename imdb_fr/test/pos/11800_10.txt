Such a great movie - I was upset all the time and so emotionally defeated in the end! The two young male actors in the film were more than convincing in their performance, as their friendship and mutual support were quite credible and I thought the comparison between their respective situations between their personal life and their health situation was so real. The success in making this film is obviously a team effort. For actors, EPs, producers, writers, directors and for all the production, I say "WELL PLAYED!" Having missed the credits at the beginning of the film (it was broadcast on HBO), I was so surprised that I had to do research (although brief) on the Internet to find the title of this film - something of 'as formidable should have been known to me - a clear indication that this movie needs to be reissued!
