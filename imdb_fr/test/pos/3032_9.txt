Forget the plot of this movie. Forget the fact that it is wonderfully performed by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget the fact that this is one of the few movies with Jennifer Lopez that I can handle. Although the story is hard to believe and much of the dialogue seems artificial, the only important thing to remember when watching this movie is that it contains some of the most surprising and disturbing images ever recorded. It's as if Salvador Dali decided to do a police drama. A must for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a backdrop for the presentation of true visual art works. I should give this movie a 9/10 for its amazing visual display.
