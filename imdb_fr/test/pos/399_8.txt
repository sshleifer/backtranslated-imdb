Anthony Mann usually did westerns with "the big ones" - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda. . . the list of cowboy stars. But in this movie B +, he tackles something very different and meets a certain success with what turns out to be a real western. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a trapper / mountain dweller, and they are usually romantic in the movies - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not actually a typical mountain man, but a clean cut. heroic figure who goes out with real mountain men. Not here. For once, a real mountaineer - vulgar, brutal, animalistic - is the central figure and it's something to see, giving Mature one of his best roles later. The actual interim customs are provided by Robert Preston, excellent as an egocentric Custer-type cavalry commander, and James Whitmore, Spencer Tracy, the poor man, as another of those old players who feel trapped between Indians ever more hostile. and the force of civilization which announces itself of the other. Anne Bancroft very young, the wife of the officer, who is initially rejected by the sight of the macabre character of Mature, discovers that his own varnish of civilization erodes as she begins to realize, at its great shock, that she is drawn to him. Rarely, if ever, a strong, distant frontier has been achieved with such precision on the screen, without the romantic appeal that John Ford has given such a place in his masterful Fort Apache. The fight sequences are large-scale and particularly violent, and particularly impressive if you have seen them in widescreen format. Good show and underrated movie, all around.
