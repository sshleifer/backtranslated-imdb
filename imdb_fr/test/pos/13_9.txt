I work in a movie theater and every Thursday night, an employee presents a film that comes out the next day ... Today was The Guardian. I saw the trailers and the commercials and I did not expect much from that, and I really did not expect to see this movie. It turns out that this movie was much more than I would have thought. It was a beautiful story first. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner have done incredible acting work in this movie. As a big fan of That 70's Show, I've always had a hard time thinking about Kutcher as anyone except Kelso, despite his remarkable acting role in The Butterfly Effect, but after seeing this movie, I think I could finally consider him a serious actor. <br /> <br /> It was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the US Coast Guard.
