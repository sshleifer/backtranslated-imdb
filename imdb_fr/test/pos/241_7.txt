Rita Hayworth illuminates the screen in this fun, elegant and delightful musical starring Gene Kelly. Rita plays club dancer Rusty Parker who dreams of becoming a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, his career is not going anywhere at Danny McGuire's Night Club. When one of her dancer colleagues says she is going to sign up for a Cover Girl contest, she decides to follow her dreams and comes in. She reminds the publisher of her grandmother, whom he was deeply in love with many years ago. But when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy. <br /> <br /> I had never seen Rita before and I'm so glad I did! She has such a presence on the stage and is a very good actress. There are some good numbers here, not the best of any music, but they are melodic and good to listen to. One thing I did not like was Gene Kelly's character. He should have supported his girlfriend! But anyway, this is perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie. Cover Girl is a glorious and fluffy movie - a perfect escape. The film is not ideal for everyone, but it is nevertheless a wonderful film, thanks to the power of Rita Hayworth. Excellent movie, really impressed.
