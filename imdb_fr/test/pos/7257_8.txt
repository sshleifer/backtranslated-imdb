I tend to like historical films and find new costume ideas for my historical group, and a friend recommended this one to me. I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor, so I thought it was worth it, and I was definitely rewarded !! His representation as a member of the English noble class was far more precise than what I saw in the past. The comic side hurt me, the costumes were not that great, and historically I did not really wince. I also noticed the fact that England did not have a proper sewage system until much later, but whoever would not delve into the details of England's past would not go account. Absolutely to see. I highly recommend this movie.
