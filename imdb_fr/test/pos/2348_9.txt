I liked this film, Naruto's second feature film. However, I enjoyed the one in the snow a bit better, because I found the story a bit incoherent because I did not really know where certain things were supposed to happen. However, like the first film, it also has a duration of an hour and a half, enough for a well-developed film with really nice fights. The story begins with a village ninja hidden in the sand fighting unknown assailants. He must then shit Naruto, Sakura and Shikumaru in search of a ferret for what they think is an easy task. They will quickly discover the opposite, because they are also attacked and Naruto is separated from his friends after fighting with a strange young warrior dressed in armor. They are both injured and cared for by a caravan. Soon after, Naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wants to create a utopia. Of course, everything is not what it seems and there are many fights to be done. My favorite was the one involving Garaa fighting this strange woman who takes it very lightly, which is a very big mistake. The final fight is pretty good, involving Naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than anyone in the previous movie.
