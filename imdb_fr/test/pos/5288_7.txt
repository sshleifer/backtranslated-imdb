Hayao Miyazaki captivated the imagination of a young and old audience from around the world. His most recent work is "Ponyo", a fairy tale for children borrowing elements from the story of The Little Mermaid. Of course, like other Miyazaki classics such as "Spirited Away" and his latest film, "Howl's Moving Castle", "Ponyo" is full of creativity that can only be appreciated by adults, but it is clearly a story for children rather than these recent efforts. It's a magical story that is said to be beautiful and adorable and that is about charm rather than conflict. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" is the story of a fish with the same name, childlike eyes and bug eyes, the daughter of an underwater wizard, who aspires to escape the sea and to become a little girl. When she does, she befriends a boy named Sosuke. In doing so, she gains powerful magic and, unconsciously, imbalances the world between land and sea, and a giant storm drowns most of the city atop a cliff where Sosuke lives with her mother, and threatens to end in the world. /> <br /> Like "Howl's Moving Castle", Walt Disney bought "Ponyo" for an American release and dubbed it with an impressive selection of Western voices, even choosing homemade products in the band's younger brother. Disney, the Jonas Brothers (Frankie Jonas) and Miley Cyrus (the little sister Noah) to express respectively Sosuke and Ponyo. Liam Neeson (Fujimoto, father of Ponyo), Tina Fey (Lisa, mother of Sosuke), Matt Damon (father of Sosuke), Cate Blanchett (mother of the goddess of the sea of ​​Ponyo) and a trio of hilarious elderly women are also interpreted by Betty White. Cloris Leachman and Lily Tomlin. The effort is there to make this film attractive to the American public and Disney is getting closer and closer. <br /> <br /> But the voices do not matter in a Miyazaki film, devoted to visual creativity. A follower of transformations and animation of liquid and fluid movements, creating a fairy tale unfolding partly underwater must have been a pleasure for Miyazaki and perhaps even all her motivation to choose this story. Highlights include water droplets sent by Fujimoto after Ponyo that move like living waves, as well as a variety of other beautiful sea creatures and breathtaking scenic scenes make "Ponyo" a movie as impressive as any other Miyazaki film. <br /> <br /> Like a children's story, "Ponyo" is focused on being adorable. The discovery of the true friendship and love between Sosuke and Ponyo is warm to the heart, although Noah Cyrus screaming childishly when Ponyo enthusiastically kisses human life can get a little boring. But as numerous as the imaginative elements and romantic relationships are, there is very little antagonism or danger. Miyazaki's previous films have villains, but the conflict in "Ponyo" diminishes as the story progresses. Sosuke thinks he lost his mother at some point. In the background, we see the world collapsing and that humans should be ashamed to pollute the sea, but "Ponyo" is usually stress free. Its climax is unequivocal, despite the general sympathy of all the characters. <br /> <br /> "Ponyo" will surely satisfy the fans of Miyazaki with his imagination, and newcomers will always be seduced by his simple and visual style. An ambitious narrative, but it is clearly a children's film, which is best for families and anyone who loves fantasy, whatever its form or target audience. This is not exactly what you expect from Miyazaki given his recent work, but he will surely be remembered as another of his beloved stories. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
