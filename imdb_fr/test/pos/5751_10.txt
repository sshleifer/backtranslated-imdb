I can not even begin to imagine why everyone hates this movie so much. I had literally cried laughing a few times ("I think you slept well?" "In fact, we had a restless night." "Ah, the dangers of adultery."). <br /> <br /> Of course, the end is a bit flat, but still has its moments (the fake spalsh obvious of the booger ball as it flew into the ocean, "parado beach house"). personally, I think it's the funniest. movie I have never seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
