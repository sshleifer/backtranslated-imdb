Betty is a lineup for the lead role in a production of Verdi's Macbeth. When a car mysteriously takes the lead, Betty is projected into the spotlight. The opening night is a great success and Betty decides to leave the after-party to celebrate privately with her boyfriend. But when the boyfriend leaves the room, Betty is caught behind by a masked unknown, with black gloves. The unknown assailant ties Betty to a pillar, stops her and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain if Betty closes them. The boyfriend comes back into the room and is stunned to see Betty in such a delicate situation. He is even more shocked when the killer grabs him and stuffs a knife into his lower jaw with such force, the tip of the knife is clearly visible in his mouth. And Betty had to watch all that. So begins Betty's terrifying ordeal with a murderer who is not only anxious to hurt her, but also to force her to watch him mutilate his friends. <br /> <br /> The opera is classified in the category of Giallo but, for me, it differs a lot of ways from the model. The focus is less on the mysterious elements of the story than in something like Tenebre d'Argento or The bird with the plumage of crystal. The black and masked glove killer may be ubiquitous, but the hints and red herrings normally associated with a good Giallo are absent. Instead, Opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and putting the audience uncomfortable. The focus is on gruesome death scenes, Betty's fear and the killer's obsession with Betty. <br /> <br /> The opera presents what I think are some of Argento's most artistic death scenes. When the killer catches Betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you're sure Betty got it. But the sadistic killer only wants to force Betty to look at him while he brutally stabs his sweetheart? the knife emerging in his mouth. It's a well-filmed and well-designed scene. And those needles in the eyes ?? gloss. Or, take the death of the seamstress. At first, his death looks like a banal and banal murder. But when the seamstress accidentally swallowed the killer's locket, what started out as a death scene again shatters the murderer. The killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girl's throat to get her chain. Finally, there is the most famous opera death scene that amazes me every time I see it? Mira was shot in the eye as she scanned a keyhole. This scene shows a lot of what I like about Argento. He has style to engrave. As implausible as it sounds, it's creative, memorable and awesome to watch. <br /> <br /> Argento was certainly not the first Italian director to focus on eye mutilation, but in Opera, he was traumatized in the eyes a new level. Needles holding open eyes, a bullet in the eye and crows pecking at an eye are all part of Argento's vision (pun intended). And these scenes have the effect that, I believe, what Argento wanted. The first time I saw the killer put those needles in Betty's eyes, I could not help but blink. It had a physical effect on me. How are the eyes what makes them so vulnerable to Italian films? <br /> <br /> To be fair (and not sound like a fanboy), there are problems with Opera that prevent me from considering it as the best of Argento. One of my problems is with the air duct system running through Betty's building. Although I do not doubt that there are air duct systems in the old buildings that connect the apartments, the ducts at Opera are huge. I am not an expert, but I sincerely doubt that a building like this movie would have had such gigantic ventilation ducts. It does not seem practical at all. And you do not think anyone would have done anything about them long ago to prevent criminals and curious neighbors from entering the other apartments? It's handy for the plot, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I guess my major problem with the movie comes from the finale. What's up with this end? He feels totally out of place, stuck, and like a bad idea after the fact. I do not know what else to say it's horrible.
