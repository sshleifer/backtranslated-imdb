"Pink Flamingos" was revolutionary for the time and even today it's still hard to watch. It's not that I did not like the movie, it's hilarious; but it's very disgusting and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as far as possible. The story is about Babs Johnson (Devine), she's the dirtiest woman there is. She lives in a caravan with her son Crackers and daughter Cotton. Not to mention Edie overweight, obsessed with eggs and sleeping in a cradle. Then there is Connie and Raymond Marble, two dirty perverts who are jealous of Babs. They aspire to surpass her by being the dirtiest person. This means that their caretaker imbibes the kidnapped women and sells the babies to lesbian couples, shows them stories in public and even sends Baba a baba in the mail. Babs is fighting to prove that she is the most disturbed person in the world. This includes incest, murder, and eating dog shit and other disgusting sexual acts. It's a fun movie for the whole family. (It depends where you live?) Look at "Pink Flamingos", but do not forget your bag. See also "Sweet Movie" for strange and strange sexual and body functions.
