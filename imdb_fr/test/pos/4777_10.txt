This 8-minute jewel is not only timeless, but it's a milestone in the field of comics. This is Mickey's third cartoon, and one of his best. It is a milestone in the cartoon because it was the first with his. And my God, even after more than 70 years, he's still good and gives extra weight to the story. The animation in black and white is excellent and the characteristics of the character are sufficiently convincing. The music is wonderful, I like the soundtrack, it adds to the pleasure of the cartoon, no matter the finesse of the story. And the cartoon is funny! So many memorable moments, such as the cow's teeth used as a xylophone and her bagpipe breasts. The characters are also appealing, Walt Disney and Mickey and Minnie, two historical characters from Disney, are well expressed, and Pete plays the role of "villain of the play". In the end, "Steamboat Willie" is a timeless jewel that everyone should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox
