I found this film very pleasant and quite entertaining. Good characters, good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout. The twists of the plot may have been a little larger, but overall, a decent thriller. If you liked this movie, I would recommend The Spanish prisoner, The House of the games and No Way Out.
