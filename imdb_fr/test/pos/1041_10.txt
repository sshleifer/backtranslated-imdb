It's the best job I've ever seen on TV. The story is convincing, especially since it is true. The editors have done their homework - the accuracy of the events is well documented. The acting game is great. It must be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had. And the black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available for purchase. A few years ago, I contacted a person involved in the production (with PBS or in England) and I was told that they did not plan to broadcast it on VHS (at the time). It was a BBC production broadcast in the United States on American Playhouse. There is such an interest in seeing this - it is hard to believe that no one can make it available.
