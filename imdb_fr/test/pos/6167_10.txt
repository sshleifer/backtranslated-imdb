If you want to see the true vile nature of communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodr√Ω Svet) He tells how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, Communists feared to have taken back dangerous Western ideas about freedom. Thus, these heroic Czech pilots were thrown into a nightmarish prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis as those who risked their lives to be defeated. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their films fall flat, they should compare the dramatic passages of "Pearl Harbor" with this film. In Dark Blue World, you establish a real connection with all the characters. At Pearl Harbor, everyone is like a well-drawn version of a real person. <br /> <br /> There are countless examples of brilliant writing in this film. A funny scene comes to my mind when Karel's character teaches English to a fairly formal English girl. When he can not utter a word, he ridicules the lesson. In a typically Stoic English way, the professor confronts Karel with force, but makes him ashamed to behave. <br /> <br /> The aerial combat sequences of this film are incredible and allow the film to stay alive. I read that it cost $ 11,000 an hour to rent the aircraft, but you got what you paid for. <br /> <br /> Ladies, you're supposed to cry in sad movies, but guys ... beware! This movie would make General Patton cry. And if you're a dog lover, you'll use half a box of Kleenex. Do not say I did not warn you.
