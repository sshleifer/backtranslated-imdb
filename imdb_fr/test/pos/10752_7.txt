For those of you who are looking for the crazy stunts that characterize Harold Lloyd's dumb comedy, this is not the movie for you. What The Cat's-Paw gives us is an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd who was trying to establish himself in sound. <br /> <br /> For me, the closest movie comparison of Lloyd's character is Peter Sellers's Being Being. Despite all the education he has received in the world, he could just as easily have been raised in isolation as Sellers. <br /> <br /> But he was raised as a missionary child in China and I do not know how much Christianity he and his family could teach the Chinese, but the young Harold learned the wisdom of the Chinese philosopher Lin Po he constantly quotes as a fortune cookie aphorism. It turns out that Lin Po turns out to be a wise guy. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Lloyd's father, Samuel S. Hinds, decided that his son needed to be educated in the modern world of the twentieth century American and he returned it to be the guest of the pastor of the original church who is sponsoring the mission. The pastor is the eternal candidate of the "reform" movement of this city of Stockport. But as soon as Lloyd arrives, the pastor dies. <br /> <br /> Now, the reform movement is a sham and the pastor piques-mingle political leaders who need a fierce opponent in every election. They decide that Lloyd might be better than the guy who just died. <br /> <br /> Of course, in this type of film, the proposal is less easy. In fact, Lloyd constantly quoting Lin Po, the way Charlie Chan dispensed wisdom was the opponent of the crooks who run Stockport. In addition, Lloyd wins the admiration of Una Merkel, as cynical as Jean Arthur in Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith. <br /> <br /> The Cat's-Paw is still a beautiful political satire although he did not establish Harold Lloyd as a comic name as in the silent movies. A fine selection of players has been selected by director Sam Taylor, dominated by George Barbier, who plays the role of a political leader who discovers Lloyd and proves that he shows great honesty.
