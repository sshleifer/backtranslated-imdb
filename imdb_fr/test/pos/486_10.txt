I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart that it is almost time for them to shoot a film about us as people and not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human lives that this story was perhaps a good thing will come out of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. Too often in films, First Nations people are seen as people other than ordinary citizens. We are always described as leaders or healers. Hey, we are like everyone else. And this movie showed that. We hurt when an injustice is committed and we can win in search of justice. It's a shame that big film companies do not see it. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD. Thanks to those who chose to show this story as it was.
