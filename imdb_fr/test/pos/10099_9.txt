Every glowing word fell well before the top of this movie. This film is the true example of what a psychological horror film should look like. <br /> <br /> The plot seems a little confusing at first viewing, but it will certainly explain a little what happens and you really want to see for the second time. But after the second viewing, you will begin to join the pieces and you will know how incredible a movie can be. <br /> <br /> A tip for slashers fans stay away from this movie. This is not your silent teen ass slasher movie, in which you simply turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b ** bs and a lot of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to reinforce the psychological horror factor of this movie, then watch it alone with a home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your Rude friends who make jokes about a really tense situation. And do not forget to turn off the light. <br /> <br /> My points on different aspects: - <br /> <br /> Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Its Effect = 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total = 9/10
