Everyone told me that this movie was downright bad, sick, etc., so I finally rented it and was amazed. I thought the torture was going to be a lot worse, but it was shocking towards the end, but that was about it. I would not call it a horror movie, maybe a mystery or something like Silence of the Lambs and / or Kiss the Girls. It was sometimes stupid, but the rest of the film kept me on the edge of my seat. 7/10 <br /> <br /> R-rated - for torture, violence, strong language and sexuality
