I remember seeing the movie trailer and I knew I had to watch this movie. It looked like something that would suit me perfectly. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a fantastic movie. It is not the one who will leave you a pleasant and pleasant end, but a feeling of sadness and emptiness. And when I say that it will leave you feeling "empty", I do not think it's a bad thing. I believe you are supposed to fill that void with your own thoughts about the characters and general motivations of humans and how they act as components of society. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling is perfectly interpreted as Leland. He is intelligent, but stoical. I like the way he tells the movie with his diary. The support cast is awesome too. Kevin Spacey is very good, as always, and Don Cheadle is amazing as a Leland teacher and mentor. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story, very intelligent and provoking thought. I highly recommend it.
