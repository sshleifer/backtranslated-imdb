I can not imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than that of Quentin Tarantino. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early '90s with cult classics such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then, it has been a disappointment for some. Well, I'm relieved to say that Tarantino has not lost his hand. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and, thankfully, <br /> <br /> We know the story, a story of the Second World War told only as Tarantino can. (Fiction of course) A war movie has never been done like that before. Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine heads the Basterds in Nazi-occupied France. Their goal - to kill the Nazis. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He is known as the "Jew Hunter" and conducts his business as ruthlessly as ever. The third sub-story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who is witnessing the murder of her family. And of course, she wants to take revenge on the Germans for her devastating loss. There are actually three stories that intertwine and come together. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is not new to him. <br /> <br /> The war has never been so fun. The Basterds haunt, but at the same time, very funny, sometimes even hilarious. Black comedy plays an important role in this film, as in many other Tarantino films. The animation and hilarity is directed by Brad Pitt. I found it extremely funny and fun. I could not wait to see him on the screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. MÃ©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz also made a good impression. The film was filled with remarkable performances. <br /> <br /> The story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to tell, but what? It's not supposed to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with it, as we should do. The department of cinematography deserves big accessories with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You really have to love the last line of the film ... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino is, among other things, an artist. The Second World War is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun movie, extremely entertaining, shocking, dramatic, overwhelming and fun at the same time. A film filled with everything you are looking for in a movie, made with this style in the Tarantino, is worth the detour. It's time to experience the war through Quentin Tarantino's eyes.
