Hal Hartley has been compared to William Shakespeare today, as he asks his actors to deliver their replicas in an iambic pentameter. He certainly knows how to cast a cast and once again, Martin Donovan is sensational, while Thomas Jay Ryan plays his role with an unforgettable intensity. Although the film lasts only one hour, the calendar works wonderfully and keeps the audience in an accelerated race until the very end. Hal Hartley is undoubtedly one of the best directors in America, in the last 20 years, with a unique, amusing and comforting vision.
