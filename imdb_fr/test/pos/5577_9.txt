I think FARSCAPE is the best science fiction since Babylon 5 and one of the best sci-fi TV shows of all time (with Dr Who, Blake 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and the aforementioned B5). I find that Farscape's characters and races are far more interesting and imaginative than the "birth spot humans" typical of many series. The effects are pretty good and the stories engaging. Despite the fact that I miss most of season 2 and some of season 1, I find the development of the character very well done.
