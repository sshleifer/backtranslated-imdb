When A Stranger Calls is actually a very good movie. I had never seen the original and when I looked at it, I thought it was unique. When the advertisement of When A Stranger Calls was announced on television, the trailer revealed the end. Well, I never saw the trailer and when I saw this movie, I was amazed at the quality of its film. One day I missed this movie and decided to buy it. I was fortunate to be able to do it because I thought it was a very pleasant and enjoyable film to own. There is a lot of unfair treatment, and if this movie interests you, do not listen to all the negativity. Camille Belle is not an actress as bad as everyone claims, and she did a great job in this movie. All those who hate are bored of yourself, lighten up and really try to enjoy this movie. A fun, Teeny Bopper, Popcorn Flick. If you have not seen it please do it, it's a lot nicer than many other recently made slashers ...
