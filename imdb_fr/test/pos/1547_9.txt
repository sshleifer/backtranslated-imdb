One of the best "kitchen sinks". Fantastic views of London and priceless footage of 60s working-class life. Loach's eyes seem to capture everything, without judgment - a foretaste of things to come. As for "Kes", "Riff-raff" and "Sweet Sixteen", it is a cinematic social history of Britain. Carol White is quite convincing: you love her, you love her, you want to take care of her, but hold your head against her self-destructive decisions and always follow her in vain hope. Well supported by Terence Stamp (recently released from the movie "The Collector", "The Hit" as well) and a plethora of English faces (all very young). Perfectly tuned to Donovan's dulcet tones. Stamp sings 'Yellow is the color', in a charming scene, ending with the message "Getting better, do not you, me?" (Song also used in "The rules of attraction" - I think) "go out and take a guy", putting his false eyelashes to the sound of "Rosie" on the radio - invaluable. A treasure for all those who were at the time and a reminder of the quality of life in England. Soderburgh has also used excerpts from "Poor Cow" in "The Limey".
