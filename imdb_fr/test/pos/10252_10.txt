Cooley High was actually a drama with moments of comedy. It was a reflection of high school life at the time. I attended Coolidge High in Washington, DC from 1976 to 1979, and much of what was in Cooley High was part of Coolidge's daily activities. In fact, after the release of the movie, everyone started calling Coolidge "Cooley High". Raising, throwing dice, chasing girls, partying in the basement and fighting, that sums up high school life for many Canadians at the end of the day. I can not forget Motown because Motown's music started and ended several days ago in the 70's. The hits kept coming. However, Cooley High adds a layer of humanity to madness because when everything was said and done like at Cooley High, my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the characters in Cooley High, there was life after high school, but nothing like waking up each morning and living every day at the peak of your seventh-period stay. Thirty years later, we are preparing to celebrate these good times. Cooley High is definitely a piece of time that only gets better with time because, whether we like it or not from this time, there are only memories, good and bad.
