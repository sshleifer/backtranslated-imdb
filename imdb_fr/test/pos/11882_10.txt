This film would have worked better if it was the first Critters movie, it's a low-budget movie with only two (2) Critters on the screen. Why does this sound like a failure, it's because it's Critters' latest film and its budget is so low that it seems the director has created the entire movie with his own pocket money. However, I liked this movie, I compare it especially to the third movie (which was bad). Critters 4 has a more serious tone, the first half of the film (even if you have not seen one yet), you have a frightening feeling to watch it, a pity they did not "track down" the Critters, I mean even if only two (2) puppets were still usable on the screen. The Critters also have different deaths in this movie, which made it a bit special, especially in the end with the Ice Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie that took me by surprise. Finally, I liked this one because it also allows to conclude the series. At least we will not see a Critters 5. Oh, one last thing, I missed a scene in this movie, we've never seen a Critter shoot a tip of his back, maybe these puppets do not did not have this feature, but I was very disappointed not to see that (in Critters 3, we see a lot of shots, which was the only good thing I liked in this movie).
