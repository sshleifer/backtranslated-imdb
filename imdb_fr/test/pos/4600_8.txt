Let me start by saying that if you expect subtle humor, you are in the wrong theater. He is low and hits hard. But he does not want to tickle your funny bone. He has the sledgehammer out and he shot a pearl on the side of your head. But do not worry. Over the movies, it's a pretty sweet education. Oh, too, swearing, but again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers. <br /> <br /> Is this film called "intelliocracy"? F *** no. The jewel, the essence of Mike Judge, is that he has the ability to make people laugh. Beavis and Butthead was particularly popular with teenage boys, the ones he was always having fun with. <br /> <br /> That's why I do not think that the humor of this film is intended for super intelligent. Maybe you are too smart to get it. But he is not aiming at you. It is aimed at your average Joe. And he has a message: get together and, for God's sake, study botany! It's a little disjointed and the narrator becomes a bit irritating after a while, but again, this movie is for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny. There is a message that he wants to make sure we all understand. <br /> <br /> I question the cast of Luke Wilson as a man with an IQ of 100. Sometimes he is not able to minimize (what did he , like a 104?) At the level of his character. Slightly forced sometimes. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Dax Shepard on this one. I remember seeing him in Zathura and thinking, "This guy looks like an idiot." In this film, he makes a big idiot. Maybe I'm psychic. <br /> <br /> It took a while to warm up with Maya Rudolph, but I gave her a little leeway. After all, she had to play the right man on an entire planet. But once she had a little time in front of the screen, she made a substantial contribution. <br /> <br /> Terry Crews played the same psychotic and aggressive character he had played several times before, but he is nevertheless a first class president. <br /> <br /> Another advantage is that the place was practically empty. Counting my girlfriend and I, there were literally six people in the theater. We could have had a barbecue and a group of mariachi. So, no annoying people talking, as seems to be the norm in the era of "talk-to-television". <br /> <br /> Overall, a good principle and a competent service, given the objective. <br /> <br /> This film was scary, it was that when we came out of the theater, it was as if the film was still being read. We saw a lot of idiocy in the people around us immediately, which is perhaps made more obvious by the dose we received at the theater .... <br /> <br /> They are all pods , all!
