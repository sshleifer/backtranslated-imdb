"... the pace is too strong ... we are deaf mutants now - like them", Rex Voorhas Ormine <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this film was uniformly castigated. Let me be the first to discuss the virtues of "The Beat" and why you MUST SEE THIS FILM NOW. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled, this film is corny and "bad" in the conventional sense of the term: The story is absurd, poetry is silly and the game of actors incoherent. <br /> <br /> But these are the CHARMS of the film - all these ingredients form the recipe of one of the most under-recorded CHEEZY MOVIES of the 80s. <br /> <br /> If the reference to "Deaf mutants" does not arouse your interest, so maybe this will: What kind of name is "Rex Voorhas Ormine", anyway? It's such an unusual name (for the North American public) that I thought, "Even the names of the characters in this friggin movie are stupid." <br /> <br /> Well, "The Beat" is so fabulously cheezy that the "meaning" and "symbolism" behind "Rex Voorhas Ormine" are revealed not too subtly by Bart Waxman (the misguided guidance counselor inspired that you like to hate). I will not spoil the revelation behind Rex's name, but please do not get upset, OK? <br /> <br /> Overall, the acting is incoherent (John Savage - who plays the "concerned teacher" Mr. Ellsworth is very good, just like the guy playing Bart Waxman, but the rest of the cast is little convincing). That said, the acting does not affect the film. Why? There is a SINCERE in each of the actors' performances that makes the characters they play endearing. So while the performance may be zero, you still feel that the players are really trying to do their best. As a result, the sincerity of the actors succeeds where their game fails (which is quite often). <br /> <br /> The tribute to "beat poetry" in this film is bad, bad, bad. But it's a good, good, good thing about entertainment. Would you really like a "better" or "more respectable" poem - especially in a film like this? <br /> <br /> It would be BORING (think of the funny thing they made us read in high school- -anitized to avoid "corrupting the youth", politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis, etc.) Even if you do not like poetry or "arty" movies (with all the "intellectual" posture that implies), you can certainly (and should) enjoy playful poetry in a WANNABE art movie !!!! How could you not enjoy the following? <br /> <br /> "Do you remember the roar of the dinosaur?" A woman shits on the floor Naughty wicked, oh the woman is so sad that she washes her hands and then she waits for the door today , yes - today! "<br /> <br /> Yes, it is an example of the remarkable poetry that has been generously spread in" The Beat ". But what about the story, ask yourself? <br /> <br /> Well, the story is ridiculous. But again, that's the beauty of this movie. Apart from certain clich√©s, stereotypes and predictable plot points, there are enough truly unique elements in the plot / story to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where did he come from? What the hell is he talking about? Deaf mutants? Angels illiterate? Do Billy and Kate really understand what Rex says? Is the audience supposed to understand Rex and his series of poems? (I have seen the movie many times and still have not understood everything.) Will the bad poetry and talent of high school students really end the gang violence? <br /> <br /> I guarantee that you have never seen anything like "The Beat" - a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, mediocre and yet sincere actors, and a scenario of "mythopoetic winner of gang violence "who has not yet been beaten. <br /> <br /> Bonus for fans of New York hardcore classic: Cro-Mags make a rare appearance in a movie under the title "Iron Skulls" and it's a pleasure to see them play several songs. I wish they included more concert sequences, but maybe it will be an "extra" included in the DVD "Collector's Edition" which I fantasize about. <br /> <br />
