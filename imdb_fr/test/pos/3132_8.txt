Travis and Sandy (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr.) are horse traders forced to sell their animals to a Mormon group and guide them to colonization. What they do not foresee is to meet the notorious assassins of Clegg, with their wounded leader, Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper). Ward Bond describes Elder Wiggs, the main voice of the Mormon group moving the wagon train to the Lord's destination. Along the way, they also meet the "Doctor" at Locksley Hall and his "Hoochey Koochey Wagon" and help them out. <br /> <br /> Led lovingly by Ford, who pays great attention to detail with realistic problems that any group would encounter during a rugged wagon track. The film has a wonderful cast of character actors with a real star in the film, which is a blessing to see, if not to change the pace. Young Johnson and Carey, Jr. are doing very well, but it's Bond's film that must shine because he has the best replicas. Johnson is the one who seems to understand bullies and bullies like Shiloh and will certainly be useful when some conflicts may arise when Clegg's boys accompany them by their side. <br /> <br /> I must say this. is one of his best and least favorite westerns and seems to flow very well.
