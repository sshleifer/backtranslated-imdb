In 1952, Hollywood decided to redo the first classic Al Jolson. <br /> <br /> This time, Cantor's son is played by Danny Thomas. When returning from the army, he should follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a cantor. However, the young Mr Golding is quite fond of the show. <br /> <br /> He then meets Peggy Lee, a future singer. She behaves very well and her rendition of her favorite song, Lover, is remarkable. The film's writers were smart not to connect the obvious relationship between a Jewish guy and a non-Jewish friend. If anything, this is ignored. In his anger, for having betrayed his promise to become a singer, his father makes the traditional Jewish sign indicating a loss in the family. This would not be done under circumstances where it would be broken promise, but if among the Orthodox, an interfaith marriage took place. <br /> <br /> Thomas does a very good job playing the cantor's son. His song is at the height since the film ends on a positive note. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the technical advisers did not realize that women did not wear booklets at the synagogue on or during the Sabbath.
