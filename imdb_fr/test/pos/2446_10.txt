I would like to know if "The Outsiders" (Australian TV series) will be released someday on DVD in the future? And is the music (theme title) available on CD? <br /> <br /> There has only been a series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone to at least three or four series in total. <Br /> <br /> The young German actor in the series also appeared in a German TV series called "Black Forest Clinic", broadcast here in the UK with a dialogue in English superimposed on lip sync. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the comments of the television industry staff on the above questions, thanks in advance.
