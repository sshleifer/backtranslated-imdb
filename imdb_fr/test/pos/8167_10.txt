It was truly a deeply moving film in every sense of the word. I myself was a Mormon missionary and I personally know the desire to finish my mission while hiding the fact that I was gay. Like the Aaron character, I was sent home for being discovered and excommunicated, but being the only Mormon in a Catholic family was not as shameful as for the main character. This film really reminded me of those years and helped me realize, years later, how lucky I was to have a family that accepted me and understood what I was going through. I found myself applauding the end of a film when Aaron and Christian found themselves again by chance at Lila's restaurant. I was really moved to tears. I highly recommend this film to anyone who reads this review and also declares it indispensable.
