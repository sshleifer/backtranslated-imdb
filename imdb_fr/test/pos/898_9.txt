I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X. Fortunately, my hopes have come true. You have plenty of action, comedy ... stupid comedy and surprises. I think newcomer Edison is really a hit in the movie, but I really find Sam's "Alien" stupidly boring with English. Although the film has flaws with the robot's graphics and silly dialogue, the action still remains strong. The configuration of the action is much stronger than that of the first. <br /> <br /> This film has more and more American atmosphere since 60% of the film is in English and Cantonese. This movie will not disappoint you. I recommended it to young people who are worried about pure pleasure and action. <br /> <br />
