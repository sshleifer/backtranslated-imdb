This film was filled with great actors, beautiful musical sounds that dazzle you completely. Larenz Tate, (Darius Lovehall), "Waist Deep", '06 was a sharp cat with the girls and he soon met his Waterloo with Nia Long, (Nina Mosley), "Big Momma's House", 2000. Nina put her heart and soul in this role and when she meets Darius, the sparks spring up at first, then there is a kind of hate relationship. The actors made this film a very entertaining film, with a lot of comedy, drama and a lot of love and cheating. It is a very down-to-earth film and at the same time shows how everyone finally has their destiny in life and is placed in their little corner of this big world. Great movie, enjoy!
