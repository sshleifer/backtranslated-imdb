As a great horror lover, I had abandoned the subgenre of vampires because, in most movies, the vampire became feminine and non-threatening, benign and fundamentally weak. That's the attitude I took when watching Soul's Midnight and I'm happy to say that the vampires in this movie are at least thirsty for killing old ladies and sacrificing babies! Armand Assante, one of my favorite actors of all time, was born to play the charming vampire with wild intensity. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interests me is the central location of Hotel Borgo. It's cool because (and I found my copy of high school to watch it) in Dracula, the Borgo pass is where Jonathan Harker must go to get to Dracula's castle. <br /> <br /> Finally, I tip my hat to anyone who made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a damn CGI! That's the big thing about a lot of low-budget movies, they can not afford the messy computer effects that pervade many Hollywood monstrosities. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it's better than Underworld, especially if you're a purest vampire. Sincerely, JA
