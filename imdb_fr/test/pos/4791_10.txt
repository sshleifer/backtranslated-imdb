The film "Nazarin" by Luis Bunuel will always be remembered as a great film because he is absolutely honest in his presentation of comic attack against religion. This is one of those exceptional films that must be shown to everyone, especially young children, to familiarize them with. notions of good and evil, sacred and evil.The most difficult question asked by "Nazarin" concerns the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion. It has been solved by involving many ordinary people who are not at all above little things in their mundane life. In particular sins. Bunuel marks a lot by showing us that various questions related to class differences deserve frank, honest and reliable answers. Nazarin seems credible because it was made in a light and comic vein. This is the only reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest appears absolutely true to the lives of all audiences. It's amazing how Bunuel approaches the quest for the real love issue in his film. This black and white gem has been wonderfully photographed by Gabriel Figueroa, one of Luis Bunuel's favorite camerams.Lilm critic Lalit Rao saw "Nazarin" in Trivandrum, India at the 13th Kerala International Film Festival 2009 "Nazarin" was presented by a prominent personality of Indian cinema Mr.PKNair as part of a special package entitled "50 Years Ago".
