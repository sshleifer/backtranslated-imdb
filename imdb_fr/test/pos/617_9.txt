This is one of the movies that we have to start looking at with an open mind. We know that there will be silence, we can hope or be afraid for many feelings. <br /> <br /> Well, forget that. The movie begins with a bit of dark humor, then begins. From that moment on, he takes you on an always scary ride through the dark centers of Moscow. All right, it must be said: unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is mainly used as a tool of conspiracy or builder of fear. But this movie does not let you go. <br /> <br /> It's like in old gangster movies, but without any mirage and in Russia. And this is one of the most important aspects of this film: it is located in Russia. This has a big impact on the film, I think it makes it better. Everything becomes simple and fundamental, life is meaningless. This could be a great potential for more movies in the future, gangster movies on the Russian Mafia. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful and terrifying film. It's horror, but you can only feel sympathy for the little dumb. One last tip: do not look too late in the evening if you want to sleep well.
