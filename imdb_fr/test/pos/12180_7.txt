In Queen of the Damned, Akasha (Aaliyah) was more sexy and had a bigger and more demanding presence. She just caught your attention and your attention. now, the film had flaws, like the lack of explanation of Akasha's past. What I did not like was that the movie did not really explain the relationship between Lestat and Akasha. The role of Akasha (Aaliyah) was rather limited in the film and she did not do it. Appear until the second half of the film, then to top it off, his death (that of Akasha) came quickly2. But I liked how Akasha fought back when the elders tried to kill her, because in the book the last fight between Akasha and The Elders was rather boring (they killed Akasha in just two seconds). Akasha's head was knocked down in 1 second and Lestat became the biggest punk in the world. <br /> <br /> Aaliyah played very well at Akasha and Stuart was perfect as Lestat, they could not have chosen a better Akasha or Lestat. "REST IN PEACE AALIYAH"
