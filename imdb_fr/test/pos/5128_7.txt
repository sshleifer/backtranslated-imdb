It's a good family film with some laughs. I wish there were not too many things in school like the bully to fill the film. In addition, it seems a little too easy to save a building land. I mean, it sank too easily. This makes you aware of the wildlife. There was a cute way to introduce the piece of land that the runner fast but a bit too slow for me. A little too hokey for me and it reminded me to go back to school. Oh, the DVD is packed, so do not miss this opportunity. 7 out of 10 for the 10 out of 10 movie for the DVD with the extras that are definitely worth watching. It's worth the time to see that!
