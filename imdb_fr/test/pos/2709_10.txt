I saw this movie for the first time in 1994 or 1995 when I was in my first year in high school, when it was on Lifetime. After seeing it for the first time, I thought it was wonderful. Of course, this may not last longer, but it is as accurate as possible in my opinion (no matter what others may think). Cynthia Gibb was perfect for singing Karen and Mitchell Anderson for Richard. Louise Fletcher (yes, who played Nurse Ratched in "Flight over a Cuckoo's Nest" in 1975) was also fine, but I found her version of Agnes (Karen and Richard's mother) ) was a bit of a control freak. I am an EXTREMELY HUGE fan of the Carpenters and I believe that Karen's voice was and still is wonderful. I am really saddened by the fact that she left and left this land too soon, but thanks to the endless popularity of her music and her angelic voice, the music will continue to live. Anyway, back on track for this movie, it's really a mystery to me and maybe to other people (fans and non-Carpenters fans) as to what brought Karen to have this health problem. Was it the media that was responsible or was it just Karen's decision? I would not believe it was his decision. This could have been the media of an article that was published about it somewhere in 1970, when their hit "Close to You" came out (from what was shown in the movie). There are also other moments in the film. Richard's fight against drugs and Karen's brief marriage. I did not hear about his loss in February 1983 because I was not interested in the news yet. I had discovered it years later. I do not know if there will be another film about Carpenters or Karen in the future, but until then, this movie will be fine. I will say this though: if Karen had not taken into account the false details of this article or any future article that could have been published with similar content, the appellant "chubby" (which was to be a real insult), she would always be there. the earth today. I know she's in heaven and she's probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen !!
