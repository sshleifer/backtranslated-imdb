I do not know why everyone hates this movie and call it sarcastic: an unassailable sequel is unfair. I mean what else could they have created for a sequel? Because seriously, I think there should have been a sequel (Rodney Dangerfield) said: Hey, everyone was going to get fucked, then a little dance and that's the end of Caddyshack, even if the first movie was was rated (R) and the second was (PG), it was always very fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
