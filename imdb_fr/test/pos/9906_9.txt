This wonderfully witty dramatic comedy seduced the crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival, applauding them with a thunderous applause at its conclusion. Backed by the smooth performances of a nuanced cast, director Jeff Hare's stout performance, steady pace and one of Peter Falk's best performances in years, the film appears as a loving tribute to the high and the sad problems of family life. <br /> <br /> Falk excels in Jewish youth Morris Applebaum, a wildly eccentric Shakespearian thespian who decides to end his life, but not before gathering his three grown children and launching a "big Jewish suicide festival" ". The film is full of indelible delights. There is the "tushy room" of Morris; Laura San Giacomo's passionate interpretation of Morris's cynical daughter; quick humorous dialogue that recalls the work of Neil Simon and Woody Allen; the ironic timing of David Paymer, who plays the son of Morris's tightly wrapped psychotherapist; and Morris patented egg creams (but be careful, consuming them too quickly will cause an uncomfortable brain gel). Everything is immersed in an atmosphere of well-being and intimate in New York. <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare turns out to be a master craftsman, drawing memorable performances from his cast and giving the film a humanity full of honor. I was lucky enough to see a previous film by Hare: the dark and powerful "Perfect Little Man" starring Neal McDonough ("Minority Report") as a Los Angeles man sinking into madness . The visceral grain of "Perfect" and the nostalgic breeze of "Checking Out" testify to the eclecticism and talent of Hare. I can not wait to see his future work. <br /> <br /> I heard that "Checking Out" lacked distributor at this stage. A wise business would do well to acquire this jewel that will please the crowd, because it is a potential titan at the box office in the spirit of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding". No longer, it would give people around the world the chance to experience the joys of this film.
