Jeff Garlin's movie is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his on-screen character is hilarious; but in addition, we see both warmth and a feeling of emotional vulnerability that makes history universal. The film tells the dreams of love, success and weight loss of his character, but it will appeal to all those who dream of a better life. The support troupe displays the frustrations and joys of their life on the screen in a fun and heartbreaking way. The simple joys of food, friendship and trying again once life has disappointed us are all themes. The use of music is creative and adds to the many pleasures of this film. Any fan of Jeff Garlin's television appearances must see it!
