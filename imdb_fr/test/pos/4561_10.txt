Humorous and humorous rescue scenes help me make this film one of my favorites in the 14-part series. Wonderful acting, super casting. And this film contains one of the few facts often noted about Sean Bean's career. The part where Alice Krige and he fell off the horse in the water was not scheduled but was left because they both went into action after it happened. <br /> <br /> This is a good follow-up of the intense end of Sharpe's enemy.
