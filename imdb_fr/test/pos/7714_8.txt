I saw three episodes of Animatrix, and it's my favorite among them. The second renaissance provided a fragile return story to the already fragile universe. Program was a stylistically impressive number, it just felt a little ridiculous. I guess what gives a special touch to this one is the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe, director of the incredibly popular series (and for good reason) of the Cowboy Bebop. It contains some of the best elements of Bebop: a glamorous adventure, a sci-fi adventure, a realistic, slightly apathetic hero, who works for hire, a premium head (more or less) and a black film hunting scene . The tarantine sweetness of Watanabe goes to full speed.
