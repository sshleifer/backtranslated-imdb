A family travels in the central-west. There is the widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his friend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and the little daughter of Ben, K.T. (Geri Reischl). Then hits a city called Hillsboro where everyone acts strangely. Their car breaks down and they have to stay. They soon discover that a coven of witches has a spell on the city and is doing incredible harm. <br /> <br /> The story is not so good. People discover things from scratch and find out where the witches are at the end. In addition, many loopholes are left unresolved at the end. The acting game is pretty poor too. Bateman and Capri are bland and everyone is pretty much the same. Only the old pros Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones give good performances. Yet this movie works. He renounces blood and gore (there are some, but it is PG) and does not allow to work with images and a very scary atmosphere. The game annoys a lot, but it still works. Martin particularly chews the decor in his role. I can not explain exactly why I like (somehow) this movie, but it worked for me. It is a kind of silent horror that is no longer done. Hardly a masterpiece, but it deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.
