Skenbart takes place in the 1940s, just after the Second World War. The main character Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten) leaves his job to have the chance to "make a difference" in the Europe of the post-war bombardment. He prepares a book by his favorite philosopher, Ludwig Witgenstein, and embarks on a journey that will prove the veracity of Witgenstein's famous statement: Nothing is as it seems. <br /> <br /> There are two main intrigues and several secondary intrigues. to this movie that takes place on a train to Berlin. Screenwriter / director Peter Dalle (who also plays the role of conductor) has assembled an impressive cast including Swedish legends Lena Nyman, Gösta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. Overall, the acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> Skenbart offers a pretty twisted comedy combined with a more subtle black humor (like the nun who loses her faith and begins to swear violently). It's as if Killinggänget met Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) on Schindler's list. I laughed for most of the movie and when I woke up the next morning, I laughed even more. A smart movie for Swedish comedy fans.
