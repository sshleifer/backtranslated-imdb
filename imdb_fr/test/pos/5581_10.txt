In one way or another, I missed many of the first episodes of Farscape, so I see them in all sorts of orders, as they are repeated on various channels. I first caught him - quite by accident - while basking in a hotel room. The first 10 seconds had completely hooked me - that's what SF is all about. <br /> <br /> The characters are strong; and Moya / Pilot, the living ship is what Lexx should have been. The quality of the plots varies, but none falls below excellent in my opinion. And I must mention Rygel - what a gloriously irreverent person! None of your sugar-coated Star Trek extraterrestrials here is the real deal - cynical, interested and overflowing with disgusting personal habits, Rygel is creating a genius. <br /> <br /> Last week, the SciFi channel showed "Out of the minds". A real classic, I could not help laughing from start to finish ... <br /> <br /> Long live our screens with Farscape!
