I'm a big fan of Cky, Jackass and Viva La Bam videos for a long time. They had a good race and I was expecting my laugh to end, finally. But this is not yet the case. This movie kept my mouth open all the time. I still laugh, randomly. I went to the theater with low expectations, thinking it would not be better than the first. Oh, I'm terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> There have been many great moments in the film. If you're naive, do not like raw random humor, or if you do not like the first movie, you probably will not like it. But with that said, I almost wet my pants so loudly. There were all kinds of different pranks, masochistic humor, toilet humor, vomiting, laughter, great falls and huge damage to all the actors. Ryan Dunn even gave the back of Bam an image that would remain there a long time. I'm sure you can only imagine how crude this movie is. <br /> <br /> No pain, no gain? Right? This movie has already worked well, provoking the laughter of theaters all over America, they would like it to last longer. I know I did. This film was not at all short, especially with the credits that continue the sequence. But, I still wish it could have lasted forever. Now, wait to see when they will release Jackass Number 3! All in all, it's a great movie, if you can go beyond male nudity and some nauseating images. Keep your kids out of this movie. They do not need to see this, at least until they are older. Support the team and buy it when it comes out on DVD! I know I'm going.
