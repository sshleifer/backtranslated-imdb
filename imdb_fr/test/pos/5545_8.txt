It's a fun movie with a subtle intention. His quirky comedy is hilarious for me, not funny for my friends. The soundtrack is perfect. <br /> <br /> I own it on VHS and I've watched it over and over again, because it's just a fun and fun love story with great performances from all directors ( using Joan Cusack a pole for big hair was a loss of her talent, I know, I know, she was still young ...). <br /> <br /> On a sad note, I decided to watch the DVD last night. (instead of watching my VHS tape), and was shocked to find many crucial scenes cut off. And on the copy I watched, there was no particularity of deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes had never existed !! I'm delighted to have bought this used videocassette at a flea market. <br /> <br /> It is clear that there was a lot of choreography in this room, which is another reason why I love it so much. It takes a lot of talent, talent and genius to move in scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine (note of the scene when shopping carts converge, rolling on the floor during the shooting). Miami, the chicken lickin 'debacle, the foot massage, the hair salon.) This film has a very "theatrical" feel, which can be the trigger for many people whose bad reviews follow: I know some viewers those who do not quite understand this style confuse exaggerations and exaggerated performances with bad acting and poor leadership. Not so. Jonathan Demme does a great job in highlighting the whole of society and its respective roles. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and the first scene are also among my favorites of all time (another opening credits / first favorite scene: Fly Away Home). <br /> <br /> Too bad that Matthew Modine has so ardently removed from the eyes of the public; I really like him and I found his perfect cast as Mike Smith. In fact, this film is well turned nut soup: everyone is credible and faithful to his role. As for the question of whether the public would accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians, why not? I thought they were doing fine. <br /> <br /> Charming, fun, exciting ... what's wrong? If you want to have a little fun, watch this story of adventure, love-in-group, colorful and offbeat. If you want to know more about organized crime and its families, go for The Sopranos from HBO.
