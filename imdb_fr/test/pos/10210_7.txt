Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), an outlaw, helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Western Union's chief engineer who oversees the Wild West and has an accident with a horse. In 1861, Vance regenerated and was hired to work for Western Union with the team that installs the Omaha poles and cable in Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard engineer Richard Blake (Robert Young) flirt with Edward's beautiful sister, Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore), who chooses Vance. However, his past haunts him when outlaw Jack Slade (Barton MacLane) steals Western Union cattle disguised as Indians. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" is a good but predictable western directed by Fritz Lang. The story shows the hardships of the brave and idealistic men responsible for telegraphing across the West, facing thieves and Indians. The entertaining story has action, drama, romance, and fun situations, but with the exception of Jack Slade's identity, there is no surprise in the story. Randolph Scott gives another magnificent performance with a large distribution. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("The Conquerors")
