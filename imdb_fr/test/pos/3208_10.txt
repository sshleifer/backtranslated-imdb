Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, smarter, harder, more sarcastic and comforting TV shows I've ever watched (second after my most favorite TV show of all time, F * R * I * E * N * D * S). The fast pace and many references to pop culture can confuse viewers, but once you understand the lifestyle of Gilmore, you will be hooked for life. Just a few random comments, I recently (finally) started watching season 6 and wow! This is one of my favorite seasons so far. I like the Luke-Lorelai thing and all the drama of the different episodes is (as always) exhilarating. The only thing I do not like so much is the surprisingly bad attitude and the rash actions that Rory suddenly "adopted". Unfortunately, I do not find this very realistic and I hope it is not just a way to create even more drama for the season to continue. All in all, it's a good season and I can not wait to see you again !!! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashly a.k.a. "Tookie Clothespin"
