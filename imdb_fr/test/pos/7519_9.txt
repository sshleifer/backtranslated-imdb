If you liked Paddy Chayevsky's "Network", you'll probably also like this dark comedy, because it's another brilliant scenario from Chayevsky, a great satire about big city hospitals and an ideal vehicle for Geo. C. Scott. He plays the role of exhausted medicine chief during the most chaotic day he or his hospital has ever seen. His personal crisis is approaching and his hospital is collapsing around him, as local residents protest against the hospital and patients and doctors are dying at an alarming rate, thanks to a biblical and deadly saboteur. The latter, who declares himself theatrically "mad for Christ", "Parakleet of Kaborka", "Anger of the Lamb" and "Angel of the Unbearable Bottom", overthrows the doctors, administers lethal injections and exchanges the identity of the patients . , resulting in treatments and operations on the wrong people. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, because such lethal errors happen (hopefully less often, not so often and if you're not in the same place) and at the same time makes you laugh at portraits of priceless characters. One of them is Richard Dysart ("LA Law") as Dr. Wellbeck, a kind of celebrity surgeon who spends much more time worrying about his investments and his publicly traded shares than of his patients, who suffer from his immense indifference and negligence. There is Diana Rigg, Barbara Drummond, free spirit and hippie, who seduces the beleaguered Chief of Medicine (Scott) and tries to scare her away. Then there is the deceived murderer, who is Barbara's father and who "works pretty well" on the Indian reserve where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic, but who is driven to madness simply by being relocated to civilization. The strongest portrait by far is Scott's Dr. Bock, who shows his soul as a former genius, father and husband fail, brilliant doctor and responsible administrator, who constantly dreams of committing suicide but must endure the demands of his work. Scott is exceptional in this demanding role. <br /> <br /> Until the last scene, we do not know if Bock will leave the hospital for the Barbara Indian Reserve and lead a calmer and simpler life, if his murderous father will be caught or if Protestant and riotous locals will take control and put the hospital on their knees. Looking at the crazy killer at work, Chayevsky is suspected of telling us that our whimsical society makes him do these things because we are told that he is different from cities and people. <br /> <br /> Since my own father was chief executive of several large hospitals over the years, I had an idea of ​​the demands of his job and the enormous responsibility he was assuming. This story makes this responsibility the backbone of Scott's crisis. It's a funny and scary film, with the actors living up to the considerable demands of Chayevsky's screenplay. It's also a film that I get the most out of every time I watch it.
