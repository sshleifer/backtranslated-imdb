I watched this film for the first time around 1990 as a young child and it scared Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it. <br /> <br /> In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I did not know what it was called, so I went to I The section Need to know about IMDb explains the content of the film and tries to get his name. Anyway, finally someone on IMDb told me, so I did some research and tried to buy the movie. So, finally, I got it on DVD, and I now keep this movie as one of my most treasured horror movies. I love it and I think everyone who looks at it will be very scared in the woods next time. 9/10.
