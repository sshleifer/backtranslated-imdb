What a beautiful movie !! It's a touching story of four high school friends who grew up in the 1960s. Throughout the decade, friends are a bit apart, but they see each other from time to time. There are many tragedies, but there are also many happy moments that make you laugh and smile. It's a story full of heart of life, love and friendship. Must-see for theater fans.
