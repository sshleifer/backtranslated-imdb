This film was the introduction for many of us of K Gordon Murray's works. It's because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain label at the time of the VHS, and before that, a late-night movie. classic worship, double knee slaper thigh. In addition, HOW do you resist the title? <br /> <br /> For latecomers, a brief explanation of its merit: Florida Wheeler dealer, K. Gordon Murray, imported Mexican horror movies, dubbed them in English, then went to the entrance . The Mexican ORIGINALS were strange enough to start; American borders and accepted conventions on horror films have been happily ignored. Beautiful scenery and superb lighting have been placed next to strange or laughable special effects. Nothing in Hollywood was so close that it was strange. Now, mix social conventions of Catholic influence with Mexican folk traditions, and we are no longer in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Add to that the English scripts in which they were dubbed. Most were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted the words to match the movements of the actors on the lips on the screen, not the literal translation. As a result, American soundtracks tend to go from oversized to bass. There is even a fan website for Murray that prints the best, most above top lines of each movie. Viewers of films seen for the first time complain about rhythm, purple prose, production values ​​and are told that it is SUPPOSED, while people laugh at things that are normally considered like fatal defects of the film. All this must be very confusing if you do not have the taste of the game. <br /> <br /> This one was shot after in 1957 with the two previous films of the series; THE AZTEC MOMIE AND THE MALLE OF THE AZTEC MOMIE. All three are now available on the AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) 3 disc disc and time is of the essence. There is the K Gordon Murray version on one side, the original Mexican production on the other side. The contrast between the two is fascinating. Most of the time, the original Spanish is not much healthier. <br /> <br /> ROBOT / MUMMY begins with a long flashback reminding you of previous episodes, in a way. Continuity was launched window at number two, and its descent from there, wise logical. You do not even get The Angel, nor any mention of him in this final episode. Names, places and even family trees allow you to switch between movies. After a while, you begin to SEE changes in continuity. <br /> <br /> To this day, Doc Krupp, the villain of the series, is completely crazy about pig, drools almost of madness and ALWAYS wants to steal the pectoral Aztec. Rosita Arenas is returned in the past with another interesting montage of AZTEC MUMMY's floor show, and walks in the darkness in her nightgown to help her find her breastplate. The mummy is not happier than that when it was last time. <br /> <br /> The robot has a production credit. It was manufactured by 'Viana & Co S.A.'. I mention it, because it seems that the handles were raised between two shots after a slow afternoon, when the real costume made its way. No. <br /> <br /> It was planned. <br /> <br /> Wait to see the controller from which it is running. X box, where were you when Krupp NEEDED you ??? The LOOKS robot is crushed at the end, but came back in two other Mexican-made films..It had a FAN BASE .. <br /> <br /> In the end, a funny bizarre finish in a series of three movies . Sit down and enjoy.
