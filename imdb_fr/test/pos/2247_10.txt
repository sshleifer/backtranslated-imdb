When I first saw this film, I thought that the director for the first time, Liev Schrieber, was going to be very upset. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and completely changed my mind. Everything is Illuminated, based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel, tells the story of a young American-Jewish collector (masterfully played by Elijah Wood) who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis during World War II World. He goes to Germany and engages in the help of a translator hitting his twenties and his grandfather. This translates into a rigid search across the country and they are determined to find what they are looking for. Filmed in one of the most beautiful countryside in the world, Everything Is Illuminated creates tension between the translator and his grandfather, as well as the help Jonathan needs to find his career. There are also many religious problems, since the grandfather calls Jonathan "the Jew". All in all, it's a film about getting together and loving your family. I give this wonderful film, if not illuminated, a 10 out of 10.-Arjun
