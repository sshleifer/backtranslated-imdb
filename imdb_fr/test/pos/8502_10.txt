Do not forget the lover on the side !! She is a 'hottie', Karen Parsons is delicious, she is wonderful in acting, beauty and style. It's just his job! HO, well here is a show that writing puts you in the belly and while you double, you kick in the butt! In quoting Peter's wife (the associate, scriptwriter and producer), she stated that when they watched the "previews" for "new" upcoming shows at a party on the ABC network she looked at her husband after the presentation of "The Job" and said, "It's like nothing on this network, you're in trouble, guys." Which means "it looks" very good! But this does not look like the usual "happy people" sitcom rate or a stylish drama on which they (ABC) regularly feel comfortable putting "the Air". I saw that, at the end of the first episode, I immediately became addicted to "The Job" because of his quick wit and cynicism, his outrageous situations and his laughing writers who make this series a success !! <br /> <br /> Then, I felt anger and a feeling of abandonment, the show had just left the airwaves I wondered which executive had made the decision to demolish a cornerstone comedy for its network? <br /> <br /> I talked Some know, others do not, but I know the silly network did not promote it loud enough, or should I to say quite visually, if they had had at least three to five seasons, maybe even six I just think that, knowing the Because of the network's loopholes, and over-subscribing to one "formula" or another, they missed it. There was so much room for expansion that it had just begun. The situations were funny and serious, fast and sometimes slow, even if they kept a good pace. A few years later, I finally found it on a new DVD for $ 50.00. For me, it would be worth it to spend $ 1,000 to have it in my entertainment library. I watched in astonishment as I went through both seasons for the third time on DVD and the final episode "Betrayal" went into a rather serious dramatic segment with them, discovering a victim of the murder, it was better than most victims of the drama "Unit" and "cop" shows are on air now !!! They went into scenes as serious as a heart attack and as credible, they did as if they were not even skipping a beat. As if it were meant to be serious, I am so impressed by the "versatile ways" that Tolan and Leary shared in the scripts and scripts. <br /> <br /> In another scandal of the "week of entertainment" I learned that the beautiful wardrobe, silk ties and expensive suits with pressed shirts and ultra stylish shoes ... was sold to the film made for the cable "In the cut" (2003) for only four hundred dollars, that's all !!! ! I am sick. Have you seen what they all wear for each show? A good coat alone could run as much. <br /> <br /> It was Denis Leary among the best. I recommend this great policeman "dramedy" for the people of the east coast or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that some Irish people joked with Leary about the "Bathroom" episode, telling him replicas, because they had seen him there. (****) New York Leary / Tolan police show extremely intuitive and comical.
