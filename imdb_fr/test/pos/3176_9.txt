This is one of those films that was never announced and was omitted when it was presented in theaters. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon him when I switched channels and immediately became engrossed in the story of an old rodeo whose carelessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I often wanted to see the film but I did not even remember its name and I had never seen it in rental shops. <br /> <br /> James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles. Rodeo footage was first class. While being an action movie and having a Western setting and theme, it could please everyone, whatever their tastes.
