If the end had not been so fantastically unexpected, I do not think I could rate this film as well. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of interactions between the character that are uncomfortable and painful. This kind of thing is not my kind of drama, so the pace seemed to choke for me. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main characters are difficult to understand and are therefore very interested - the husband (Alan Rickman) is rather bitter and grumpy and his wife (Polly Walker) is distant and a little haughty. The acting was perfect (Norman Reedus was very seductive), but the characters themselves were perhaps a bit too realistic (for me). <br /> <br /> The setting was nice and properly insulated and a bit grim. Cinematography had something that seemed a little old-fashioned to me. <br /> <br /> But the last 5-15 minutes of this movie are so ingenious that every uncomfortable scene, embarrassing conversation and inexplicable character behavior is absolutely worth it. I guessed each typical twist of the plot, except the one that occurred. <br /> <br /> The end makes this film interesting to watch. The plot and the drama, not so much.
