Peter Coyote was the only name I recognized in the list of actors, so I did not really like watching this movie. The only comment on IMDb was positive, so I watched it late at night. I would recommend this film as a good late night show. It's better than many of this kind. The plot is excellent, the acting is not brilliant, but it's not bad. Usually, I do not like flashbacks, but in this movie, they work. As I said, I did not identify the name of the cast, but I recognized Michele Lee, who gave a decent and hard-working performance, as a woman wanting to be beside her man, who was lying to her . (Was it Knots Landing?) Anyway, she's wearing very well. Note: You can enjoy more if you miss the first few seconds of the credits. I did it and it helped me. When you see the end credits, you get what I mean. The character of Wayne Kennedy, who is really weird, takes this to 7 instead of 6.
