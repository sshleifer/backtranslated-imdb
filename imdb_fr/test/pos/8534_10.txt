(Spoiler warning) I can not say enough good things about this movie. It's a great horror / parody comedy that does everything for a change. The humor is great and goes from funny to very funny. In one scene, Ed goes into edit mode and deletes a large scene. When his boss looks at Ed's editing, he shouts, "Where is my beaver rape scene?" Hysterical. There are also many other memorable, humorous and memorable quotes and moments: Ed shouts, "Do not look at me like that !!!" while hitting a poor fool over and over in the face. Very funny things. The plot of the film itself is so ridiculous that it is priceless: Ed is an ordinary guy with the sweetness of life, who is transferred to the horror film editing service. the films he edited. This film has it all and is simply hilarious. The DVD only costs about $ 7 and is a good deal because it is the unrated widescreen cut. I have a lot of DVDs, most of them cost a lot more than this one, but few are as good as this movie. My DVD Evil Ed is one of the highlights of my collection and I would beat someone with a telephone receiver if he tried to steal it. Evil Ed is full of style and quality, which Hollywood filmmakers must learn to learn. Evil Ed is a rare jewel and I want to thank everyone who contributed to the making of this wonderful film. You did everything right and I love Evil Ed! 10 of 10!!!
