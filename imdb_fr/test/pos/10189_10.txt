I recently visited the magical kingdom as an adult with my mother, best friend and adult sister. Disney World is often misunderstood as a place for kids, but when you see quality shows like Mickey's Philharmagic, you realize Disney's magic is for everyone! It was such a spectacle that we left the theater and turned around to queue again. And then a third time. It was breathtaking. I encourage everyone who comes to Disney World to discover this show, which is not just a show but a wind of the world and a fun walk with Donald while he lets his mood again get him into trouble!
