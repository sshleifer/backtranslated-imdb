I first saw this movie at the movies in the 40s, when I was a child, and I always remembered the end. There is nothing like the first impression, but some movies are always a treat every time they are viewed. Something only resonates with them. This is one of those films and I agree with another critic who said that Fritz Lang should have directed more westerns. To add to that, I have always loved Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young plays in what I consider my favorite film if I have to name one, which is not easy. This film is the Northwest Passage. That led me to Kenneth Roberts' great historical novels. Similarly, Western Union led me to read Zane Gray's novel, which in this case turned out to be one of the few instances where I like the film better than the novel. This Gray novel is not bad; I just like the movie story better. The film is nothing like the novel. It's a completely different story, one of the biggest deviations from a book I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can not add much to other critics except to say that I agree with many of them. I too would like it to be published on DVD. "All that has happened to Randolph Scott has arrived at the best of me."
