I have read a lot of opinions and reviews of this film, and I understand why many people have mixed feelings about Ponyo, be it the script, the animation, the dialogue, and so on. And I think the easiest way to answer that question is that it's a movie for a much younger age group. A much younger age group than Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro). <br /> <br /> Being a fan of Miyazaki, like most surfers on this site, I was expecting a wonderful animation, musical composition, complex narrative, the constant great development of the characters, the how history mixes with current society, etc., etc., of a typical Miyazaki film with which we grew up. And to tell you the truth, I did not really understand how this story was supposed to be told or what was going on until one hour and twenty minutes (there are 20 minutes left in the movie), that this movie is NOT for deep thinkers and hardened ghibliists, but for toddlers, lucky youngsters and lucky Japanese. In addition, I believe this film is based on simplicity and creative animation; The style of Ghibli studios. <br /> <br /> The fact that a villain is not present really surprised me, except for the father and maybe this crazy typhoon. But other than that, this movie is just fun. to stimulate young people's minds and make you feel good. That's all. <br /> <br /> The animation dates back to the time of Miyazaki films in the mid-80s and early 90s, where the very specific details were not very important, unlike Mononoke Hime (the Princess Mononoke) and to the latter. I admire the simplicity that somehow created a little nostalgia when I first watched Ghibli films like Tonarino Totoro as a child. The reaction and the movements of the children are all very similar to those of the children and the body language of Studio Ghibli is very perceptible. The Ghibli studio has added creative moments and sets that it can only do with its wonderful animators, but it will probably not fear the Ghibli ritual. <br /> <br /> The Japanese dialogue also seemed very friendly to the children and many scenes and dialogues are very, very relative to what the Japanese children and mothers would say and act. The music so hoppy and "mellow" I suppose you could say (similar to Totoro) from beginning to end. Even the darkest scenes did not seem convincing. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is one of a kind. Just about every aspect of this film is for kids. And I waited 80 minutes to realize it. Frankly, I have never seen a movie told or shown as Miyazaki did. It is comforting to see that Studio Ghibli can always tell a story to a wider and very different audience, while retaining this Ghibli brand imprint.
