The BBC and HBO have teamed up to create "Dirty War," a 90-minute TV movie about a terrorist bombing in London of "a dirty bomb." The film gets to work quickly as it integrates the government's terrorist and anti-terrorist efforts, leaving little room for human subplots. On the terrorist side, we track the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive material to assembly and deployment until the detonation. On the government side, we are seeing public relations and training exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation reaction and follow-up. The film also gives an idea of ​​how Al-Qaida-type terrorist cells are organized, the radical Islamist terrorist mentality and terrorist strategies. A sort of anatomy of a "dirty bomb incident", "Dirty War" will answer many questions that hide in the minds of an audience increasingly aware of this insidious threat. (B)
