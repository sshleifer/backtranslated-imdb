A magnificent cast cast in modern mystical novels for intellectual adults. Yes, they also need a love story to spark those hidden impulses without Hollywood fluff. All under the masterful guidance of Antonioni and Wenders, who love to pin characters in exotic places and let them be denied by their environment through long, wide shots. It is good to see that there is lust in the sector of crises in mid-life.
