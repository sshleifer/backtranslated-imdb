This is the superbly crafted Washington-made thriller directed by the talented Wolfgang Petersen with renowned screenwriter Jeff Maguire (who seems to have done very little over the years, so maybe he keeps his roses) . The film has Clint Eastwood as an aging secret service agent and John Malkovich as a revenge-killer killer standing against each other in a massive test of will and ingenuity involving the president's life. The unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost condemn the president, which is a genuine touch. This film was shot while Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. Eastwood probably never did as good a job as it does here, and it's so easy for the old pro. He has wonderful sound effects when he rolls beside the president's car as a bodyguard, for which he is too old. I wonder if anyone else has noticed the humor of these noises after being added. My "guardian angel", whose name is Vigil, enjoyed this movie even more than me, but bodyguard movies are really his thing. Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the agent woman who is crazy for Eastwood, she is so unobtrusive but very talented, and she shines. Tension is stretched every inch in this story, and Eastwood's psychological struggles to save himself from a previous failure of protection are magnificently exemplified by his typical understated acting. With Eastwood, if he raises an eyebrow a millimeter, pay attention! Of course, he is the master of the super cool. Malkovich has the opportunity to indulge in all the goosebumps he might wish in the paranoid character he represents, and he perfectly captures the central vanity of man. What a good one.
