I must say that every time I see this film, I am deeply touched, not only by the four most painful years of Hongsheng's life, but also by the way his family manages his addiction. It is also true that becoming dependent on something, such as drugs, alcohol or pornography, can not only hurt you, but also your loved ones, your family. Since the family is the No. 1 priority of Asian culture, it takes courage for the circle to come together and show a person how much his family loves him. This is actually the first Chinese movie that I really enjoy, not for fun, but the elements around it (superb acting, touching story, beautiful direction) make this film worthy of interest. What stands out most is that Hongsheng and his family play the story themselves instead of having a B movie actor trying to emulate the real person. This shows the authenticity of the film.
