A few years ago, I saw this remake of the Sixties classic with the Mini Coopers and I remember very much enjoying it. About two years later, it was broadcast on television and I just wanted to know if I would like it as much as when I saw it in the movies. Well, the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> The film is about a team of robbers who will do one last job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. They escape and will not have to work all their lives. But there is a problem they have not taken into account: someone in their own ranks does not like to share the loot, but wants to keep it for himself, even if it means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. . But all but one survive and want revenge. A year later, in Los Angeles, the surviving team is developing a clever and devious plan to recover the gold and get revenge on the traitor ... <br /> <br /> The story itself is good sure This is not very original because it is a remake of the original 1969 film, but it has a lot to offer to make you forget that. It's a typical heist / action movie, but it's certainly one of the best of its kind. The action is very pleasant, the landscapes and Venice are a real treat for the eyes, the story is OK and the special effects are superb. Even the acting is very good, which you will not see often in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this film a well deserved note of 7.5 / 10.
