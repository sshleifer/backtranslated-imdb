Anatole Litvak directed the film "The Journey" of 1959, with Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson and Jason Robards. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and concerns a group of travelers who have difficulty leaving Budapest because of political problems in this part of the world. They boarded a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner), confiscate their passports and keep them for interrogation. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards), who introduces himself as an American but actually a Hungarian freedom fighter, who, according to the major, has been smuggled out of Hungary. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding it. She becomes the center of the major's romantic attentions. <br /> <br /> Very good film that evokes the tension and the hassles of the cold war, and all the shows are wonderful. Brynner is particularly good as a passionate major who is not so mean. Anne Jackson gives a realistic and powerful performance as a pregnant woman who does not want her child to be born in a communist country. <br /> <br /> Well scenario, good director, good casting - there should be more movies like this one. Highly recommended.
