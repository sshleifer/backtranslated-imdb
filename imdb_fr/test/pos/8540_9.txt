The box of my video store is the reason why I rented this one. He looked cool considering the guy's face in two, so of course I had to try it. I was pleasantly surprised to see that he was a fan of "Evil Dead". The Swedish manufacturers had to be fans and they included many references in this masterpiece. A criminal trying to break into the house Evil Ed was putting up the movies that drove him crazy and declared "groovy" while looking at his weapon, just as Bruce Campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in Evil Dead 2. also has many posters of this film scattered around the house and office in the film. They do not just falsify Evil Dead, because there's a puppet monster at the Gremlin who's going to Ed's place in his fridge. My favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says "I'm coming for Barbra", which, in case you do not know, is the main line of Barbra's brothers in "Night of the Living Dead". This movie has a lot of good intrigues, cool characters, funny stuff (Gremlin puppets), scary stuff (demon doctor), great effects (exploded head) and a good amount of female nudity. I only gave him a 9 because it's pretty slow before Ed goes crazy, but it's worth the wait. So, if you like "Evil Dead 2" or any of the other movies I mentioned above, you have to rent it and watch it with a friend, and when you're done, try "Brain Dead" because I hear that he looks like this masterpiece. <br /> <br />
