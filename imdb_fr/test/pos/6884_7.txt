"Yong-ki Jeong's only puppet master with scary parts" is the latest Korean horror film I had the pleasure to watch. With the title "Inhyeongsa" in Asia, this film hit me right away when I saw it reviewed online, with images that made me think of Puppet Master, Childs Play and other horror movies based on toys / dolls. But for some reason, I did not think ... "Good God, it's going to be sticky," I imagined it would be scary and fun. The horror of the toy is almost good. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly, but I like it, so it was good. The score, almost as I found it with Acacia, was beautiful and reminded me a lot of the classical horror scores of the past. I will not give much, but the story has been strong in this one, and I highly recommend it to any Asian HORROR fan. It's not extreme, it should not be taken seriously, but it's really good.
