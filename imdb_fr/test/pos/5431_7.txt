It was an interesting film ... half-comedy, half-political thriller. There were a lot of good things, although it was a bit predictable. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays the role of Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian in a successful show in which he comments on politics. Think Daily Show with John Stuart. When recording one of her shows, a woman in the audience told her that he should be a candidate for the presidency. These, followed by some serious jokes, were all that was needed to get things done and kick off Dobbs' political career. <br /> <br /> He is independent and opposes Democrats and Republicans equally. He is frank and honest, and is becoming more and more popular - but maybe not enough to win. He is clearly the underdog in this election. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program that allows people to vote much faster and easier - but there is a problem. The problem is discovered by a young woman named Elanor (Linnley) who is appeased by the software developer with a lie that he solved the problem before the next election. <br /> <br /> Election day is approaching and Dobbs is declared the winner. (Great surprise!) Elanor knows that he is not really the president - he did not win legitimately - She decides to inform the president ... but complications arise. His company went so far as to poison her to silence her. On top of that, she quickly takes a liking to Dobbs. <br /> <br /> The plot takes a few twists before reaching a slightly predictable conclusion. But it never became boring. Robin was great, as usual, and Christopher Walken often stole the limelight as director turned political advisor and best friend of Dobbs. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining film that carries a good message. I recommend it if you want a dark satire or something that makes you think. Overall, I give him a 7/10.
