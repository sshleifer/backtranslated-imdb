"The Planet" is an amazing movie. For just Â£ 8,000, Stirton Production has long been one of the most original science fiction movies. <br /> <br /> Featuring the intimidating physicist Mike Mitchell, the film combines stunning special effects, narration effects and well-planned action. From the opening battle to the final, everything about this film appears well above its budget. <br /> <br /> For starters, the special effects are certainly not the standard "Revenge Of The Sith", they are in fashion. level, if not superior, to Babylon 5 and Farscape. And for a little price too. The details and movement are superb and captivate the imagination. The design of everything, ships, weapons, entities is unparalleled. The imagination and creativity involved are a real surprise for a film from this budget. <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the strength of the story and its bow. There are some twists, most of which are well written in the script, surprising and well played. I was surprised by the fact that, two years later and first imagined 15 years ago, certain aspects of history are relevant to today's society. With events taking place around the world, there may be some resonance in the efforts that mercenaries must make to survive. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects are perfect, as is the atmospheric music. The use of light and costume adds to the professional look. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen seems deserted and isolated. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, this film appears 10 times, even 100 times the budget spent, and reflects the creative talent of his team director, actors, effects via the producer and the sound team. Wonderful effort, I recommend you get your hands on a copy as soon as possible
