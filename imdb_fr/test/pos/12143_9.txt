"All Hazards Class" looks like the grandfather of "Sopranos" who mixes the criminal and the domestic, and the movie boyfriend to feel as contemporary as "Reservoir Dogs". <br /> <br /> Even though these gangsters are entwined affectionately with women, children, lovers and parents, they are coldly ruthless and we are constantly reminded of it, no matter how warmly we see them too. They can ruffle a child's hair - then pull a threat of self-control. . The key is loyalty, and male camaraderie is admirably conveyed, without ethnic or class stereotypes, even as the canvas of their past obligations and repayments is reduced to suspicion and paranoia, while the old gang is at various stages of parole, retirement, bail or in new, less profitable businesses. An intense accusation is to send a stranger perform an old escape scenario. This is the most moving point when you tell your wife that she is not the one the gangster is friends with, whereas the only time we hear music on the soundtrack is when he remembers his wife. <br /> <br /> Street landscapes in Italy and France are wonderfully used, in the light of day, through dark waters and highways, from the setting up of a pair of robbers brazen - traveling with his wife and two children. Lino Ventura, rugged and steep, immediately captures the screen as a criminal father. And the second thug is clearly an accidental presence in their lives, as they smoothly coordinate the flight and escape, in cars, buses, boats and motorcycles, in easy tandem. It's not the crusty old man with softened clich√© with the big-eyed orphan; It's their jobs and their families, and they cross each other horribly. <br /> <br /> The film does nothing to unexpectedly kill characters, directly or as collateral damage, and defies all our sympathy for them, even end without resentment, which probably explains why there never was American remake. <br /> <br /> It seems so cool that it is only Jean-Paul Belmondo enters the film almost to the third, with a look so carefree as a young punk, that one realizes that is from 1960. Sultry Sandra Milo has an intelligent and formidable chemistry with him, from an ambulance to a lift to a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> The Forum Film showed a new 35mm copy with new translated subtitles, but it was not blank. The program notes explained that the title refers to some kind of insurance policy and is a "tourist class game".
