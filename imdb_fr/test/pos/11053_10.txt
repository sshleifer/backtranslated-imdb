The first words Garbo uttered in this 1930 film electrified the public and became part of the Hollywood legend. Garbo had become a star in his first American film, The Torrent, in 1926. And the audience waited until this film to see if Garbo could switch to talkies. She did it. And while Pola Negri, Vilma Banky and Renee Adoree were sidelined because of their accents, Garbo continued his journey for another decade. Despite the quirky character of this film, Garbo is really excellent, especially in the opening scene with the equally great Marie Dressler than Marthy. The two big stars exchange dirty looks and sharp words as they take a few drinks and set the tone for the rest of the film. Garbo was 25 years old; Dressler was 60 years old. Charles Bickford is good like Matt and George F. Marion is good like Old Chris. Marion created this role on Broadway in 1922 and also played it in the 1923 silent version with Blanche Sweet. This piece by Eugene O'Neill is a real classic, but curiously, it was never filmed again. Anna Christie is one of Garbo's greatest performances. And despite the quirky character of the film and the sadness of the story, she is truly a marvel. See this one for Garbo and Dressler!
