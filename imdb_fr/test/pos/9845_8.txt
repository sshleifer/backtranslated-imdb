It is an entertaining film typical of the early 1930s, which is changing rapidly. When you have James Cagney in mind, these "pre-code" movies are even better: nothing more fun to watch. Usually, when the films are "dated", it's negative, but that's not the case for the 1930-1934 movies. Yes, with slang and attitudes, clothes, hairstyles, etc., they are old-fashioned, but that's a big part of the fun. These films have an aspect that makes them almost always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> They also have a seductive and fascinating appearance. You see people - like the young offenders portrayed in this film and their wacky parents - whom you never see in any period other than this (early 30's). At the beginning of this film, the children go to the judge and sit down to laugh at these zany characters who appear in court on behalf of their children. Yes, we have the Italian stereotypical emotional father; the Jewish father; the Anglo-Saxon mother and some other moms who all plead, in a dramatic form, as a "good boy". Although things are predictable in some cases, it does not bother you because everyone here is so much fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It also teaches you that kids were punks 75 years ago too, steal, steal, assault, lie - hey, it's the human condition. This film refutes the theory that "people were kinder at the time". No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was helped by their environment, their parents, their financial situation and other things. Here we receive a group of "Dead End" children who end up in the reform school. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous and stupid-liberal story shows that children act immediately as angels once they direct representation to the reform school; not punished in the least for causing the death of a man and setting fire to the institution (the explanation: he was a villain and deserved it, that is for real justice and reform); and "Patsy" shooting a guy, never having to be questioned by the police because he's the good guy! Note the subtle anti-religious excavations in which the only perverse "guardian" seen praying is. It's not a coincidence, not an accident. This kind of negative association has existed since the Hays code was canned at the end of the 1960s and was observed, as you can see, in the pre-code of the early 1930s. <br /> < Ducks Digges, by the way, is remarkable in his role as "villain" of "Mr. Thomson". In particular, his voice was very effective and I could imagine him playing one of those such perverse roles as an institution leader in a film adaptation of Charles Dickens. Cagney played her usual role, the tough guy holding the pretty girl, "Dorothy Griffith", played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro has also been effective as a boys' leader, "Jimmy Smith". Only the looks on Darro's face made his character credible. Something he was the real star of the movie, but I will always go with Cagney. The other students in the Reform schools were not very credible and were true ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to watch. <br /> <br /> I thought the most interesting part of the movie was the first 20 minutes we saw how bad these kids were and witnessed the good and bad and stereotypical parents present in court after their arrest. These scenes are pure music of the 1930s, Dead End Kids. They always showed the children that they were bad news at the beginning of the film, but at the end of the story, they all seemed to behave more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - barely rough "delinquents" . It is very farfetched but it works, as far as entertainment is concerned. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a hokey movie but very funny, typical of the Cagney and early thirties films. Almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value.
