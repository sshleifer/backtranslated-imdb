I did it too. When I saw the group for the first time, I immediately dismissed them without even listening to music. Then one day, out of sheer curiosity, I bought the CD and fell in love with it. So I bought the video. hold your children for lunch, it's not going to be pretty! the video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music, view some of the promotional videos and meet the band ... although I still do not know how they can handle the wearing of these masks all the time! a must for all fans of the band, and fans of alternative music in general
