A new guy in an armored car company is being persuaded to get involved in armored carjacking by his teammates to make quick money. The problem is that they do not really have a plan and when complications arise the situation turns to death. <br /> <br /> The fast-moving popcorn action movie has a lot to offer. First, the film lasts less than 90 minutes, so the film does not have time to stop in the plot. Everything starts up and it goes on. Then the movie contains some great action sequences, so we head for the edge of the seat. Finally, the film has an exceptional cast including Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishburne. It's a first-rate distribution that sells and covers stories of lack. <br /> <br /> This is not a brain operation, it's a film about popcorn and at this level it scores a lot. Well worth a look.
