One night, goalkeeper Randy (Matt Dillon) rescues Jewel (Liv Tyler) from his jealous boyfriend, Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). He takes Jewel home. But Utah comes back and wants Randy to open Mc Cool's safe. Suddenly, a shot - Utah's dead. So ... ... I'd better stop here to tell the plot. It's like explaining the story of "Wild things". What I found so interesting is the fact that the plot (written by Stan Seidel, his first and last book - he died in July of last year ...) was told under 3 perspectives - the 3 men who fall for Jewel. Everyone sees it under different eyes - like John Goodman as a detective, who falls in love with her tenderly because we remember his dead wife ... <br /> <br /> No wonder guys fall in love with her! Liv Tyler - she is a real gem. She made the big screen shine! She played her role as if she were in a black thriller of the '40s. Sweet - but at the same time she was the cool vampire who walked on corpses and used men for her needs. And of course, Michael Douglas. How could I forget it? Mr Burmeister, the killer who plays bingo - he was pretty cool! <br /> <br /> But in the last 10 minutes, there was a bit too much burlesque for my taste - it weakened the atmosphere. This part started when Paul Reiser (as Carl's cousin of Randys) put on his leather dress for Jewel. The song "YMCA" did not suit so much here ... ... but overall, "One night at Mc Cool's" is a pretty parody of COOL! <br /> <br />
