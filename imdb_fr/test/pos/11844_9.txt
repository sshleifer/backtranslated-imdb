I watched this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and I have not laughed so much in a long time. This movie was so funny that I went out and bought the next day. I like this type of comedy. It seemed so real in the way actors react to different situations here. I was Rollin. I had never heard of it and I was just starting to watch because of the title "See others". The title made me try it and I'm happy to have done it. I laughed so much that it hurt me. It's now part of my collection. I really recommend it to anyone who likes the kind of smart comedy. I will look at this one again and again.
