Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Watson (Nigel Bruce) were hired by the British government to protect a Swiss scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately, the evil Dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) works with the Nazis and will stop at nothing to get the doctor - and his invention. <br /> <br /> Moving Sherlock Holmes in the 1940s seemed like a stupid idea, but it works for a reason - Basil Rathbone. It can be said that he is the best Sherlock Holmes ever put on the screen. He plays the character so well (and accurately) that it does not matter at what time he resolves crimes. Regarding Nigel Bruce as Watson ... everyone has problems with that. He plays Watson like an old fool ... This is NOT the Watson books. You seriously wonder why Holmes supports it. Yet he grows up on you (in a way). Then Atwill has fun with Moriarty. The discussions and the intelligence fights between him and Holmes are just great! I never liked Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade - he's an idiot. Watson looks like a genius. And Post Jr. is pretty good as Tobel (although his accent does not stop changing fun!). <br /> <br /> This film is very elaborate and only takes a little over an hour. Still, he has his points slow and I never understood the secret code section. <br /> <br /> Still, it's worth it to catch if only for Rathbone and Atwill.
