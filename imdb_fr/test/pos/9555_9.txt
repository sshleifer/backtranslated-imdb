<br /> <br /> This is the best fictional documentary of a dog show I've seen for a long time. A very long time. Well, let's face it, never. Is not that part of the charm? The idea of ​​bothering to make a film mocking a documentary about an event that most people would find odd at first. Even if there was no laughter, we would always be smiling at this thought. Anything that tries something new is important in my proverbial book. I also liked dogs!
