Writing about something so wonderful is completely difficult. In fact, it is almost impossible to describe the particularities of this film. It's a wonderful story about sex and gender, and it's almost unbelievable not to have to deal with obscene sex scenes. Feeling, this movie was designed for people who like to feel, and simply feel, life in all its complexity in a simple and sublime way. We look at it and something begins to grow in our minds, even our hearts: it's a pure poem. I watched "gay" movies and I'm almost always very dissatisfied with unnecessary sex scenes, not because I do not like sex scenes, but they're usually so pornographic that I'm forced to think that the director or producers or writer of the scripture think that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from these. Three are the main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a particular love triangle. Ito loves his best friend Yoshida, Yoshida loves Aihara and Aihara loves Ito. Imagine what it could turn into unprepared hands? On the contrary, Hashiguchi makes a wonderful story that goes deep into the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me think, astonished, at the end of the film: Why? And this why developed in multiple questions inside my brain and inside my heart. In reality, the scenes sometimes tend to be boring; they are the moments of the most delicious poem that we can feel, but totally incapable of writing with words. And maybe because of that, we are unable to understand the question at the end of the film. I'm sure this movie was not designed so that we can discuss each piece ?? Some people want to understand a movie by almost dissecting it. Others are so used to popular "American gay" movies that can not appreciate the true value of this masterpiece. Look at her, close your eyes in the credits and feel everything, feel, feel the wonderful song. For all this and much, much more, I give a new one. And I do not just give ten, because ten out of ten is perfection. But I admit that I almost did it.
