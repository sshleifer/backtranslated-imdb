For me it's a good series. I'm a little disappointed with the deaths of Ana Lucia and Libby, but more angry that Micheal lied to all those who killed them. And if anyone can answer that, what is the name of this guy who was supposed to be "Henry Gale", he was like the leader of others (or was it Mrs. Clue ??) anyway if you know his name, it's cool Well try to think of what may possibly happen after they finally have not pressed the button. Did that ruin the entire DARMA project and I personally thought it was cool to see how they held the secret that Desmond used to close the magnet, yes, and what was the purpose of that? I'm just glad they did not press the button, but what happens to people in the hatch? Like Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and Desmond are probably dead, but what about the others? I think they survived, I forget? Well it's just my little thing about what I thought of this season finale!
