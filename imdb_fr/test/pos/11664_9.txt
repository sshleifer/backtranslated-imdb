"Dead Man Walking" is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I can not believe that anyone who has seen the movie may be indifferent to the film or its message. Tim Robbins does not try to impose his ideas and convictions on viewers, but manages to make a film that is mostly sympathetic to both conceptions of the death penalty - whether it's just murdering a murderer or not . I always knew where I was in this issue, even as a child, and this film - despite the fact that it really takes no bias - made me even more certain of my belief that could never be murder *. any any *. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet, his Academy Award nomination was well deserved. Even though Nicolas Cage did a great job in "Leaving Las Vegas", I would have been happier if Penn had won the award. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the Oscar she won. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the vote I gave to this film: 9/10!
