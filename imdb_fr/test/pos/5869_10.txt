I was recently offered this film on DVD, and I did not know at first if this film could please (even if one of my favorite actors plays a main role). In fact, he is fast becoming a favorite. <br /> <br /> First of all: fortunately, it is * not * the same as the book, whose end is, in my opinion, excessively melodramatic. Secondly, it's one of the best movies I've seen on the First World War. "What?" you can ask. "It's not a war movie!" True: we do not see any battles or shelling, no trenches, no gas. But it shows the cost of the war, the damage done to the lives of the men who fought there, and the impact it has had on their loved ones. <br /> <br /> We first see Helen (Sarah Miles), the widow of a baronet, waiting for her exit from a psychiatric hospital. All the women in the film seem to be widows: some of the war, but Sir Thomas, her much older husband, (we'll see her later in a photo) fell ill and died while at a party, hence his guilt. failure hit. She is lost and alone. The wire around the hospital grounds evokes POW camps and trenches: like many men from the outside world, Helen suffers from some sort of electric shock. <br /> <br /> Outside the hospital, she must find her feet in the outside world again: a world we feel through her eyes as dark, desolate and hostile. His mother is unable to give him real support. As a widow herself, she has set up her own emotional defenses, behind which she hides so as not to have to deal with her daughter's distress. (Like many people, especially at this time, she seems to find the mental illness embarrassing.) <br /> <br /> Ledbetter, the committed driver, becomes an encouraging presence and helps Helen to begin to adapt to life but she does not realize that he is becoming dangerously obsessed with her. It's a superb performance by Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a former regular soldier, a former sergeant major who runs a boxing club and has created his own car rental business. At first glance, it seems hard and strong, reliable, but there are cracks below the surface: it has not really adapted to civilian life. He invents (for reasons that he explains later) a family life and family life that he does not have; he has brutal crises with his colleagues and sex without affection. Getting closer to Helen ?? a woman with whom, even with the greatest social freedom after the war, he could not have hoped to marry realistically? exposes psychological fault lines that tear it apart. Today, we could diagnose PTSD. <br /> <br /> The same goes for the other man in Helen's life, Captain Hugh Cantrip (Peter Egan), a budding politician. He is ambitious, beautiful but also very young. What is revealing is his girlfriend, Connie (Caroline Mortimer), who wears his hair and makes sure he has a clean handkerchief before going out. Ledbetter and Helen are well acquainted with him: the first had served under him during the war and Helen had met him in political circles and considered him a "popinjay". However, Helen and he are now starting a relationship, with Helen intending to support his political career, financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, fresh out of his success on stage as Stanhope in R C Sheriff's "Journey's End," makes Hugh more than an immature young man. There is a revealing and discreet scene at the back of the car between Helen and Hugh, in which they quote Brooke, "The Old Vicarage at Grantchester." She asks, from her war experience, "Was it very bad?" He can not answer. She says, "Well, you're back now." But his answer in a whisper ?? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?" ?? is the key to his character. As light and shadows flash on her face, we know that some horrors can not be expressed in words. The disproportionate losses suffered by junior officers of its kind ?? straight out of school or university and should lead forward ?? are well known. In a nervous speech (during which Helen reassures him) to local politicians at a dinner, he reveals that he will run as an independent, and no longer as a liberal (the party that brought the country into the war). His emotional life is as bad as Ledbetter's. He can not easily get away from Connie, who depends on him emotionally and financially: reading between the lines, she is probably a widow of war (maybe an old friend?) With a child, whose children we see. drawings on the wall of his house. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The crisis between the three people settles slowly, with a scary scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car and Ledbetter listening to Hugh and Connie when he drives them, Hugh trying to persuade Connie that, even as her relationship with Helen develops, they can continue their relationship; that he will continue, at least, to support it. Jealousy, obsession and his belief that he must protect Helen from a duplicate gold digger lead Ledbetter to confront her violently at home and Hugh. <br /> <br /> The end is quite different from that of the novel. better for that: it is dramatic, but less melodramatic, and maintains a little sentimental tone. We started with a recovering character; we end up with another suffering. Alas, it is felt, is now wiser and stronger than the two men, who have been unable to fully adapt to the so-called "land worthy of heroes" into which they have returned from the nightmare of total war. The new end is open: we feel at least that it will be able to face all that awaits us, without illusion. In this, it reflects the reality of time, in which women (Helen, Connie and many others) had to pick up pieces of a world in which too many men had died or had come home with degrees various mentalities. and physical damage. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back now." ?? "Am I? Sometimes I wonder?"
