Gore Hounds, beware ... it's not your movie. This little bitter nail has very little blood and guts. It's basically an effective and useful version of Open Water. But what sets it apart is that we actually love the three channels (unlike Open Water) that end up at the top of a tree when a crocodile spills his fishing boat and rides his guide. We do not want any harm coming to any of them. So when they start to end up in dangerous situations, we care. <br /> <br /> Now, I love killer animal movies, but I was not too impressed with Lake Placid until Primeval (although I'm still waiting to see Snape and hope this will be somewhere as good as this one!) but this little guy did the job and did the job well. His fears are creative and he only glides in the thick of things. Frantic sobs and tears fight over brief periods of realism, so I never got bored. <br /> <br /> I remember reading the real story that inspired it: three guys went fishing and two found themselves in a tree while their boyfriend was killed by the crocodile. But what always touched me and that is omitted from the film is that the crocodile did not eat the boyfriend. No. For hours and hours, he swam around the tree and shook the corpse still in his mouth against the friends of the tree. Seeming to stay, if you come here, that's what will happen to you.
