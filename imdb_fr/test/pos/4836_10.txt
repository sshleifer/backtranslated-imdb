I saw this movie for the first time about 3 years ago. I was shocked to see how stupid the FBI was to not prevent such a tragedy. It could easily have been avoided. This movie was simply amazing. <br /> <br /> Seeing him now after September 11, I'm shocked and I can say that it could have been avoided more easily than most people would want to know. <br /> <br /> This film is 100% true <br /> <br /> In the last scene of the film, when the brain of the first attack is taken to prison by helicopter and flies over the towers, it makes a frightful remark, they made fun of him when he said it. "Next time, we'll bring them * TWO * down." This is what Ramzi Yousef said after his arrest. <br /> <br /> This film reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were perpetrated under the nose of the FBI and the New York police. This shows how the first and fourth changes are partly responsible for the attacks. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie now and I know that both attacks could have been avoided.
