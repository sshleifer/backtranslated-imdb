This is one of the best movies I've seen this year! I do not agree with the person who said it was boring. Of course, some people may find this film scary, but personally, I had a great time. This film alternates very well sex scenes with scary scenes. There is also a nice touch of humor. For example, when the woman tells her husband that in her childhood her father mistreated her, her husband asked her "How can someone mistreat someone like you?" And then he tried to tie him to bed for sex games: D Very funny! I recommend this movie to everyone and, by the way, sorry for my mediocre English (I'm from France).
