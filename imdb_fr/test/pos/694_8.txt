The submarine used was NOT Varangian! "It's actually two boats, the P614 and the P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept under the control of the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. The P615 was sunk but the P614 was finally delivered in 1945. <br /> <br /> The confusion probably occurred because someone looked up at P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! In fact, the last digit of the numbers P614 and P615 has just been traced .... <br /> <br /> The film contains extremely realistic moments. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S class. As no class S submarines survive, the plans of them (like P61) and the ship-deposit "Forth" are now part of an interesting record, as well than an excellent movie.
