"In 1927, a young man, alone in a single-engine plane, flew nonstop from Roosevelt Field in New York across the North Atlantic Ocean to Paris Le Bourget Airport, a distance of 3,600 A triumph of spirit, body and spirit, Charles A. Lindbergh has influenced the lives of all the inhabitants of the planet and in 33 hours and 30 minutes of his flight, the air age was became a reality, this is the story of this flight ". <br /> <br /> Billy Wilder is inspired by Charles A. Lindbergh's eponymous Pulitzer Prize to reconstruct Lindberg's historic solo flight in 1927. Stimulated by a strong performance by James Stewart (himself a pilot) in Lindberg's leading role, containing a witty scenario by Wilder and Wendell Mayes, Spirit Of St. Louis, is a story that is sincerely told. <br /> <br /> which sometimes runs the risk of becoming a monotonous film, Wilder continues to shoot using flashbacks in Lindbergh's life. After the well-prepared introduction of the event, such as the danger of Nungesser and Coli disappearing {never found} while attempting the same journey in the opposite direction, we learn how he bought his first plane and his work with the flying circus. All this is relative to the understanding of man and his obvious passion for aviation.
