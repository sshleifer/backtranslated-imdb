Compared to the competition, soul calibur 3 is a god among the games, a true work of art. However, compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the latest series of the upper namcos series slash em up is too ambitious. His attempts to improve perfection are not quite successful. <br /> <br /> There are new modes and game changes I congratulate him for trying to raise the series to new heights - but that only complicates things. Examples? Well, the character creation mode is a great idea in theory, but in reality it is full of restrictions and is not as customizable as the one found in Wwe games, for example. The sword mode chronicles are fun and provoke thought for a little while but end up dropping out and look like a chore to make money rather than a really fun game. In addition, the Tale of Souls mode, which is essentially the arcade mode with small fragments of unimportant history and QTR bits of shenmue style, is really slow. <br /> <br /> "OMG !!! you do not know what you are SeYiGer" is probably what the most zealous people think, but do not twist it - I do not hate this game - this game is awesome ! It still has this classic game (although some character movements have been changed unnecessarily), absolutely stunning graphics and this epic soundtrack that is the reputation of games. And also on the bright side, it's the new characters (especially zasalamel), who are all cool in their own way (apart from setsuka-yes, I know I'm poking a lead). <br /> for soul calibers 1 and 2, it feels like you're trying to be a lot more than it really is. This does not mean that it is not a classic, it simply means that, compared to its own standards, it remains a little short, despite the growing number of characters, scenes and graphics of better quality than ever before. <br /> <br /> Yet soul calibur 3 wipes the ground with 95% of the games available - and that counts for something! Oh, and all those who call this review "unhelpful" feel clearly hurt for insulting their darling setuka. Well, listen fan / girl: she is not true! And even if she were, she would not be trapped with you.
