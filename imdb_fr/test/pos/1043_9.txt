Although it's not "perfect", it's close. I love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (the Superman police chief), the housekeeper, the Felix restaurant waiter and the judge ... I can go on and on. This movie is part of my family's holiday tradition since I was young and my kids grew up with him too! "The baby has swallowed the watch" has always been my son's favorite line. <br /> <br /> The sexy Barbara Stanwyck, dressed in pants and dresses, stole the show with the charming and friendly S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has some good songs. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake (blah).
