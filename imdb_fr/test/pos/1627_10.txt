I was excited at the opening to hear some of "Knights Of Sangreal" but wanted more, so I bought the piece said Hans Zimmer. Probably the 4 minutes of the most inspiring and beautiful music ever written! This film is an exciting masterpiece, even without religious considerations. You get to visit the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN where the "Divine Particle" or the largest amount of antimatter is created with amazing images is an immediate clue that predicts the excellence of this film. Who does not like Hanks? The storyline and twists in this movie are simply stunning and well drawn up to the surprisingly twisted climax. This film suggests a satisfactory compromise between Science and Religion although many closed heads will persist on both sides. "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind."
