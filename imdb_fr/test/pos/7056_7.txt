... The reason I love this film so much is because of its spirit. It's an awesome summer camp movie, so the jokes are not flawed in a lasting way that makes a character the permanent goal of ridicule. There are pranks, but you have the feeling that the guys from the respective fall would be able to look back and laugh, after having spiked enough to fall under their spell. the end! <br /> <br /> This is a very special bonus when the master of these jolly rings is Bill Murray. For me, he is still considered the god of unparalleled comedy when he has the chance to run wild. Nobody knows how to create a feeling of crazy anarchy without hurting anyone. The tone of the whole film has the same style as that of his main character, set with a grand opening scene showing how Murray prepares for the day. Everything is stupid, yes, but it's more important than behaving like an adult, it's fun fun. "Meatballs" promises such and finally offers a nourishing watch.
