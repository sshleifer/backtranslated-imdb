Although this film is 11, I rented it yesterday and I found the film very touching. The story of true friendship against a very real monster is a very touching inspiration. <br /> <br /> While I mocked the amount of language used by some young actors - especially Renfro - I understand that art mimics life. Renfro once again does a wonderful job as a respondent (and her role in The Client), and Mazzello does a wonderful job of Dexter - a child who realizes that his life has to end too early. <br /> <br /> Although there are so many touching and entertaining moments in the film, I must say that my favorite was when the boys were stuck by Pony in the abandoned church, and Dexter (Mazzello) cut himself off by saying that his blood was a poison. Although very ingenious and somewhat amusing to see an adult man fleeing two young children, this is one of the most difficult scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Discover it well, but prepared with your Kleenex - you'll need it!
