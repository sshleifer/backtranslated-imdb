Spike Feresten is a comic book genius. 'Talkshow' presents a new look at the kind of strange irreverence that has made the success of series like Letterman and The Daily Show. His sympathy is palpable. He seems to find the unique angle of the joke, not the way of predictable sitcom ... Thank God. His comedy recalls the award-winning development Arrested Development (cross your fingers to indicate that 'Talkshow' has a longer life). The topics he insists on tend to be things that go unnoticed by everyone else. Yet when he creates a joke around you, you wonder how you missed him the first time. I particularly liked the sketches ... "Unfair Target" will be a cult classic in a short time. Define the people of your Tivo ... it's a show not to be missed.
