This independent film is worth the detour because of the tremendous talent of its creators, Wallace Wolodarsky and Marsha Forbes. Mr. Wolodarsky led the young cast, and he must be commended for this effort. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is a warning about the danger of wanting something you can not have. What is the story of Alice and Ed? After living together for a while, Alice suddenly becomes agitated because she says she lacks experience in sex. The relationship between Alice and Ed, although not an example of ideal happiness, is a comfortable way to share their life. Until Alice and Claire, his sister, have met a sexual relationship of another couple who has no idea what he would have seen. <br /> <br /> This incident leads Alice to reevaluate her own sex life with Ed. she finds that she lacks substance. When she proposes to "see the others," Ed is shocked, but does not want to contradict Alice, he decides to follow. Then Alice and Ed enter a world they do not know. The people they meet are not worth the trouble. They realize unfortunately that in the end, they were made for each other. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be watched to see the incredible Julianne Nicholson, whom we loved in another independent film, "Tully". . Mrs. Nicholson reminds us of a young Shirley McLaine; she projects on her a quality so luminous that it is difficult to leave her eyes every time she is in a scene. This young actress proves that she is an accomplished interpreter who improves with each new appearance. Basically, she's wearing the movie. His Alice is a study of contrasts. Alice is an honest woman who thinks she can not please Ed because of her inexperience. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr is an excellent partner for Ms. Nicholson. Both do wonders together. His Ed is perfectly credible. We have known people like him. Deep down, he is a good person who suddenly finds himself in a situation he has not asked for. Yet he is just taking action to find out he's too decent and he's not ready for a free sex life with willing women. who does not have a problem with a fall in the hay, just for fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is wonderful. Lauren Graham does an amazing job as Claire, Alice's yuppie sister. Andy Ritcher is also wonderful as Carl, the nerdy friend who finally finds his fulfillment when he meets Penelope, a single mother. Helen Slater, from Penelope, makes a happy appearance in the film. <br /> <br /> The director is extremely talented, he will probably go to the place because he shows that he is well done for the job. .
