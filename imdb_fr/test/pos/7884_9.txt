Although I saw this film about 4 years ago, well before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to review it now, which is unusual for me since I've often reviewed some just after seeing it. What can I say? Well, the best performance is that of the late Peter Boyle as the main character who, after learning that a man had killed his daughter's drug-smuggling boyfriend, wants to bond with him, even though he is a Madison Avenue executive who has nothing to do. common with the very conservative Joe. In fact, there are a lot of funny scenes from Joe at the party of this guy, who makes vain remarks. Oh, and note that the actress who plays the girl they are looking for after she disappears from the hospital after a drug overdose is none other than Susan Sarandon who is making her film debut! It was a pretty punchy film for the moment it was shot (late 60's and early 70's). It was a convincing piece of work by screenwriter Norman Wexler (later Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen (later to make Save the Tiger, Rocky and The Karate Kid). Admittedly, the end is a hell of a punch, even today, after all these years! Highly recommended to anyone who is curious about the counterculture of that time. PS Among the cultural objects we see here are a Raggedy Ann doll, a box of Ritz crackers, a bottle of Heinz ketchup and, unique at the time, a Nixon poster asking: "Would you buy a car from opportunity to this man? "
