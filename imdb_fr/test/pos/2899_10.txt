Personally, I consider "Egyptian" in an extremely favorable light. <br /> <br /> It was introduced to me by a renowned Australian commentator and film critic, Bill, renowned for his insight and broad view of people. & places & especially movies. This film fits perfectly with the bill and I came to appreciate his comment and his enthusiasm for this film which appeared more and more as I watched it. years ago. <br /> <br /> For me, it was propelled, layer after layer, in half an hour, in a fascinating and fascinating production! Yes, I am aware of its flaws! But it was so appealing ?? the young man of idealism learning from & inspired by his father ?? the peasant treated as garbage in his suffering ?? the opportunist friend however imperfect but nevertheless loved by his friend, the central character Sinute ?? and to be sure, an imperfect hero too, like many others in the humanity of all societies and through all times - but adorable and worthy of love too! Yes, I believe in a Christian God, but also, I recognize the rights and respect that should be due to ALL human being with good heart, who would not fail or respect the rights of his neighbor without just cause. As such, I endorse this film and its presentation of a man of good heart and conviction of his belief in the sun god to which he was devoted. These people will always be welcome in my vision of the world and, hopefully, in many others beyond. <br /> <br /> Likewise, the drama I saw in the film that followed me has often looked at me as surely as it has touched my heart and soul, as surely as it seems to have angered critics in his day. It is captivating to watch the struggles, mourning and loves of Sinute, the doctor! When I look at it again, I always remember my dear friend, Bill, the movie critic, who dared to oppose ALL the critics who destroyed it a long time ago. He added criticism of too many critics ?? whether they make statues to honor stars, on screen or in history, but they do not make statues to honor critics! And beyond that, I remember every time I saw a SUPERB & TOUCHING show, a beautiful and well-presented drama that was not just about the 1950s or a bygone era. It was intended for YOU & ME, through time and place, to every man, woman, child and their personal aspirations of love and freedom and to overcome the obstacles to misunderstanding and gross injustice and tragedy. appeal to those who seem to think that too many people consider war as a cause! Take a party on invitations or unjust violence, bigotry and judgmental attacks on unjustly executed people and consider the merits of this offering. Not to the sun god, nor to a power that turns out to be so transcendent over and over again. Let this EXCEPTIONAL film overwhelm you, like waves on a beach, like time passing ?? as if life was meant to be. And maybe you will find yourself swept into his world of possibilities! No more lost offers! 9.9 out of 10!
