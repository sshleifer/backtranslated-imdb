I caught up with this movie on TV after 30 years or so. Several aspects of the film stood out even after shooting it many years after it was shot. <br /> <br /> The story of C Virgil Georghiu, a little-known character, is remarkable and almost like the story of a man jostled by a cosmic scheme he can not understand. Compare this film with more well-known contemporary works such as Spelberg's "The Schindler List" and you begin to understand that the trauma of the Second World War should be seen against the larger picture of racism, beyond the simple conception Nazi Aryans vs. Jews. This film evokes the disgust of Hungarians towards Romanians, Romanians hate Russians, and so on. The dubious relations of the Jews with their Romanian Christian friends are also tense. <br /> <br /> Like me not having read the book, it's hard to see how much the director and the writers have changed. For example, it is interesting to study the point of view of the Romanian peasant emigrated to the United States in order to earn money only to return to Romania and invest his income there. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the character of Johann Moritz was probably one of the most beautiful roles played by Anthony Quinn, alongside his work in "La Strada", "Zorba the Greek" and " Barabbas ". <br /> <br /> The most memorable and memorable sequence of the film is the last. Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi try to smile. The father who carries a girl born of the rape of his wife by the Russians is a story in itself, but the director is able to show the reconciliation with a simple gesture: the fact of carrying the child without sliding into melodramatic sequences. <br /> <br /> Today, after the death of Princess Diana, we often notice the insensitivity of the paparazzi. The final sequence is an impeachment of the paparazzi and insensitive media (the director Verneuil also makes a similar comment during the judicial scene, at the moment when the cameramen are about to jump on Moritz). <br /> <br /> The interaction between church and state has been summed up so well in the terse statement of the Orthodox priest, "I pray to God that he guides those who have the power to use them well." <br /> <br /> A few snapshots, like those of a scribbling minister's secretary listening to a petition - have said so much in so few sequences. The management was so impressive that editing was relegated to the background. <br /> <br /> Finally, what struck me most was the excellent color-rich texture provided by cameraman Andreas Winding - from the brilliant credits to the end. I remembered he was the cameraman of another of my favorite French films, "Remparts of Clay", directed by Jean-Louis Bertucelli. It's been a long time since I've seen such use of colors, with the exception of David Lean's epics. <br /> <br /> There were flaws: I would like the character of Virna Lisi to be more fleshed out. I never understood the character of Serge Reggiani, the only intellectual of the whole film. The scene of the train station at the end seems to be lifted from Sergio Leone's westerns. Finally, the film was essentially built around a love story, which unfortunately passes in the background. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film impressed me in more than one department. History is relevant today as it was when it was made.
