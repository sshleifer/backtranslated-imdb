The people of my generation and the older ones know about the Second World War (or as it is called in Russia - the Great Patriotic War) not only from textbooks, but also from witnesses and participants in the event. My grandfather was a soldier in Stalingrad and when I was little, I listened to his stories about the defeat of the Germans. He also told me anecdotes, all he told me was not dark. But it was a long time ago, and not when I have a conscious interest in what happened there in the Battle of Stalingrad, I have to turn to books and movies for information. In one way or another, most of the films I saw were made in the Soviet Union, only a few in present-day Russia. And "Stalingrad" is an exception. In the film, the war is described on the opposite side and the fact is interesting. All that is shown in the film is quite different from what I'm used to. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me a lot of the movie "The world and the world" of Note, because the war is shown. through a perception of ordinary German soldier. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed with repeating that he is in no way a fascist. The heroes of the film, coming from the beautiful and enthusiastic Europe, from the Italian coast arrive in the hungry and snowy Soviet Union. They are doomed to die. it's clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> After the elite detachment took part in its first fight in Stalingrad, one of the soldiers uttered the phrase that reflected my whole idea; he said, "If you start thinking, you'll go crazy." And in my opinion, this also applies to the spectators. On the one hand, you might think, all right, I'm just going to watch this movie and it will not get rid of me, I do not need to feel sorry for the people on the screen, as if they had attacked my country and not the other way around. . However sooner or later, but inevitably, we start to sympathize with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant stifles his tears when he sees Kolya's execution. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is hard to watch, all those frozen legs, dirt, executions, snow, starvation, illusions destroyed. <br /> <As far as I know, Lieutenant Hans von Witzland is one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his main roles. I watched a lot of Hollywood movies where he received unimportant little fries, such as "Next" or "Transsiberian" (why did he ?!). And after watching "Stalingrad", I can not distinguish the desire of European actors to appear in American films, even at all costs. It annoys me deeply. I think Thomas Kretschmann deserves better roles and better scenarios than those presented to him in Hollywood. And from what I saw with him, "Stalingrad" is the best, without a doubt. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the worst drawback of "Stalingrad" is the way they speak Russian in the film. I mean of course those who are supposed to be Russian. Say, the boy who spent time with the Germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape. Was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a few sentences without this horrible accent? At first, I sat down to watch "Stalingrad", just to listen to native German speakers, as I am studying the language. I did not expect anything extraordinary from the movie. But it impressed me, it made me cry when I was not going at all. I know I'm 15 years behind to watch it, but "Stalingrad" is not a trivial film, and after 15 years, it's still watchable and shocking.
