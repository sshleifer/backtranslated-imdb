The first time I saw this movie, it did not seem to go anywhere. When I looked at it a second time, it seemed a lot more logical. Give it a chance, look at it more than once, there are many key elements shaping the story that could be missed first and even the second time. The Cohen brothers brilliantly weave the events of the early twentieth century into this story to create a credible framework and story. The combination of Clooney's leading role goes well with the Turturro and Nelson support numbers. The appearance of John Goodman in the film is hilarious. The soundtrack is excellent too. This film has become a household favorite for my family. 10/10, of course.
