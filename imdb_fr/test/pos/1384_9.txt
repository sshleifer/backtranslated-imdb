From time to time, you come across a movie that surprises you and is one of them. On a surprise scale, this would be like sharing a hot tub with Jessica Alba, while a group of Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Lynott and Keith Moon will be playing your music for the night. The reason this movie will surprise you is that, for the meager budget they had (Â£ 8,000) and that it was done by a group of friends who just wanted to try, they produced something very slippery and easily looks like 100 times more than his budget. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple: a team of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner into space is attacked and forced to collapse on a nearby desolate planet. After some checks, not only does the planet not exist according to the star chart, but they are not the only ones, and something very hostile begins to choose them one by one. This sounds like very classic elements of Aliens science fiction mix. Predator and Pitch Black, but they take it all and make it fresh and original. <br /> <br /> The filming is fantastic, make the most of Balmeddie Beach in Aberdeen and you really feel like a foreign world. The seemingly endless sand dunes and the intelligent lighting effects give it a very dark feel. You really think that the crew is stuck in an extraterrestrial world. The action sequences are also superb, the opening assault on the freighter, a superb showcase of the special effects that can be achieved on a limited budget and fierce battles, as well as the breathtaking finale testify to the inventiveness of the film. <br /> <br /> As far as the team of mercenaries is concerned, the actors outdo themselves. For a low-budget independent film, the cast was made here via the local media and they seem to have chosen possible stars for the future. Although not a natural actor, local bodybuilder Mike Mitchell plays the role of mercenary leader at Arnie-Esq. Among the rest of the cast, there are two outstanding performances: Patrick Wright as second-in-command McNeal and Scott Ironside as Vince crude engineer and loaner. Both have the best replicas of the film and Scott adds a little humor to the film with his performance. Patrick gives a complete performance as the cool and iced second in command. <br /> <br /> Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has done and shows that Scottish cinema does not have to be 'Kilts and Ceilidhs' or 'Slums and Scottish films' Drugs can be fresh, inventive and above all fun. This film is Scottish (with a north-east twist) and praises the actors and directors for maintaining the accents intact, which adds to the charm of the room. Although budget limits indicate from time to time (the only fault I can find), it is to be expected. This film, its cast and its team deserve all the success they get and more. I wish Mark and his team all the best. Their career is a career to watch closely. <br /> <br /> Note - 9/10 The first sci-fi sci-fi is audacious, fresh and inventive, a true triumph. <br /> <br /> Movie reviews, news and unique opinions, as well as bi-weekly podcast photos. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> Contact@fightrunner.co.uk
