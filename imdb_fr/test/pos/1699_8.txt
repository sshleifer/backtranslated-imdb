this film is not as bad as some say it's actually I think it's more enjoyable than the original. it may be for this reason that some people hate it so much because they do not want to admit it's a good movie (not great). <br /> <br /> Most if not all personal belongings were created by CGI, which did not bother me. in any case it was a nice film. Phil Buckman - (Chris) was in my opinion the best guy in the movie Julie Delpy was pretty seductive, she brought sensuality to the movie. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of sarcasm in the movie that I thought was good. this film is in my collection but the original is not because I do not like it as much as this one. I did not get bored when I watched this movie, it kept me from watching unlike some horror movies that I could mention like oh say = driller killer & suspiria (dario argento movie) that's for to name only two. <br /> <br /> this is a good werewolf movie, it should be part of the collection if people like wolf movies, maybe i'll get the original one at one given moment. I only have one complaint and it's Phil Buckman - (Chris) should have been more than him, but other than that, the movie was fine. <br /> <br /> Rating for this movie 8/10 a werewolf ok the movie is not the worst. <br /> <br />
