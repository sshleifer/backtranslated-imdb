"Idiocracy" is Mike's latest movie "Office Space" Judge, which follows a theme similar to that of the film: the observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity ... relatively speaking. This is a story of Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is literally the most average guy in the world. Joe and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph) become test subjects for a hibernation chamber military project. They had to stay suspended for a year only, but for lack of supervision, Joe and Rita are forgotten and accidentally wake up for 500 years in the future. <br /> <br /> Here is the frightening part: This film explains, in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 has become totally retarded. In the absence of natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the fastest, most intelligent and strongest people for gene progression ... but only the people who reproduce the most. Unfortunately, these people are fools who breed like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of stupid people has had a detrimental effect on the growth of society and Joe and Rita are now the two most intelligent human beings on the planet. If that helps, imagine the entire population as a hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. Seeing this nightmarish dystopia, Joe learns and tries to locate a time machine to see if he and Rita can return to the date of their departure, and that's basically the plot. <br /> <br /> But despite -dimensional I can make it look, this movie is the highest front you can imagine. The shades are ubiquitous and everyone can see (warning signs, if you will) the modern stupidity that permeates the facets of everyday life and turns it into a train wreck exposed in "Idiocracy". The film presents truly impressive examples of realistic mental retardation placed on a pedestal. I do not want to reveal anything and make you lose jokes, but let's just say it's pretty thorough. I can see how some would say it's a lot of toilet humor, but that, strange as it may seem, has a purpose; to show how stupid and rude these people are. <br /> <br /> This film, unfortunately, is destined to know the same fate as its predecessor, "Office Space"; no one will see it in theaters, but everyone will boast about this awesome / funny movie when it comes out on video. The only complaint I would make to the film would be that the narrative thread is sometimes interrupted to be able to do a Hitchhiker's Guide-type show on how things have happened where they are, but it's a badly needed and is better implemented here. Apart from that, good characters, fun jokes, and above-average social commentary come together in a funny bow. <br /> <br /> Final Note: If we see our young people becoming gangbangers, act like Redneck / ghetto trash and be proud ... if you are educated and cultivated anyway and can see how our country lose control of his control in an abyss of stupidity, for God's sake, watch this movie.
