Critics who have complained that this film lacks plausibility or has construction problems miss the point. It's a wonderful camp romance, with lots of games, gypsies! Dance, gypsies! music, which sends exotic love stories and celebrates them. Ray Milland, buttoned, is a fun leaf for Dietrich, with black hair, ragged scarves and tons of jewelry. The character's eagerness to feed and care for Milland is more like good German hausfrau Dietrich was off the scene as a vampire. Censorship being in force, it is clear that they share a caravan on purely platonic terms, Milland opposing Dietrich's advances with a remarkable determination for a single heterosexual who could be killed on any day. His only excuse is his smell. So maybe a tedious and tedious Englishman might be put off. <br /> <br /> In the small role of Milland's young companion on a secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a camp note of a different kind. We are told at the beginning that he venerates Milland, and prefers to believe him. When, after their separation, he meets Milland, become a brown-skinned Gypsy with a shirt open at the waist, his radiant appreciation of disguise still suggests that Dietrich is not the only loving love of Milland. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters and sequence of incredibly improbable events, Milland's growing love for Dietrich and his acceptance of the non-rational aspects of life are rather touching. And when, on their last night just before he escapes, he says that each of them now contains half of the other, the two became one, then the darkness falls, I think we We can assume that the censor has decided to give them a break. ! A blunder - in the beginning, Milland, who is supposed to be English, refers to a lieutenant, using American pronunciation. (The English say "now.") As Milland was British, he had to say so because American filmmakers feared that the American public would be distracted and confused by the British style.
