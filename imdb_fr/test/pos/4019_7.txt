Like the first film in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake to simply call this movie a "film of blaxsploitation". Of course, Slaughter is a tough black man armed, but it's more like an action shot, regardless of the color of his main character or his villains - and a very good action shot . <br /> <br /> For the second and last time, Jim Brown plays the main character. The film begins with one of the craziest scenes I can remember in a movie. While Slaughter and his friends participate in an outdoor party, arrive a biplane and start to spray the group with machine guns! No, Slaughter is not so difficult that he then shoots the plane with his .357! But Slaughter is ticked off and no one really knows why this success happened. However, Slaughter will get to the bottom of things! Well, it turns out that the hit was attempted in retaliation for the latest movie. In this film, Slaughter attacks the mafia and hits hard in Mexico. Now, in a horribly botched and clumsy attempt, the guys on the plane kill and wound several people but miss Slaughter. And, because the job was so badly spoiled, the mafia boss (Ed MacMahon !!) orders the pilot and shooter killed by his brutal assassin (Don Stroud - in a very typical role for him). Stroud is awesome - scary and nasty at the base, but Ed MacMahon as a boss ?! Wow, that's an interesting twist! <br /> <br /> The slaughter is now perplexed. He found out who the two guys were on the plane but by the time he found them, they were dead. So, to help him in his own private vendetta, Brock Peters (who plays the role of a cop) tells him who the gangsters who ordered the hit and asked Slaughter to agree to help him by doing work Illegal illegal immigrants. So, Slaughter and his pimp friend enter the gangster mansion and steal a list of winnings from key government and police officials. And, of course, there are a lot of gunshots and bloodshed in the process. <br /> <br /> Stroud is not about to let Slaughter get away with this and kidnap Slaughter's girlfriend. Now it's an impasse - Slaughter has the list, but if he does not make it, the lady is dead. Being a hard but gallant man, you may be able to guess much of what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The action is very good in the film and Jim Brown is threatening and tough. The only bad thing I noticed was that while MacMahon played this nasty boss, he just ended up going to bed - and much too quickly. When Slaughter catches up, MacMahon turns into wimp and all the previous nasty things disappear - which is too much of a clich√© and a lack of coherence. Nevertheless, despite this little criticism, it is an engaging film that is NOT intended for children because of violence and breasts.
