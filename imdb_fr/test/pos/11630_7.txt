OKAY. Is Barney the best children's show of all time? Of course not. But in some of the comments left by other members of IMDb, one would think that it is a multi-million dollar production with leading actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. Well guess what? It's Barney for God's sake. It shows kids good behavior, good manors and being who you are. For those of you who find it boring, it's because you are not five years old and the show was not for you. For the IMDb member who wrote the review on the front page, I think you may have gone a bit too far. Have you described a Sesame Street character as "down-to-earth"? Growing up everyone is a great show for preschoolers and really helps kids learn in a fun and creative way.
