This film is good in its genre and this genre is naturally action with a small / medium budget. It looks like Van Damme offers much better performances when a good director guides him. There is your basic fight, your alley scene and especially a lot of gun fighting. Some basic dramas, but nothing too deep Isaac Florentine directs an action movie OK if you ignore the weak scenario and its holes. But the person who steals the show is: <br /> <br /> Scott Adkins. How is it that this guy is not a big Arnold Schwarzenegger action star that I do not know. Director Isaac Florentine has already made a film with Scott Adkins entitled Special Forces (2003), which has an incredible talent in martial arts that will satisfy the most demanding enthusiasts of kungfu. Undisputed 2 is another amazing feature of Scott Adkins. Find out and make noise, this guy needs to get super actor status and he has to get it now! <br /> <br /> What more can I say about the film? Van Damme goes into high gear in some of his most recent works. No Oscars here for sure, but you already knew it. But the fact remains that the atmosphere is nice and that I could find better ways to spend my time. So, I give it a solid 7 out of 10 of its kind.
