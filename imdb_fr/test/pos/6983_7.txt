They already have a problem in that one of the passengers is the intense criminal Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel, in his first role high placed); however, they are soon prey to a strange predator species that thrives in darkness - and a rare solar eclipse will soon occur. <br /> <br /> While the scenario of this film is finally on the side of the routine, it is decently acting and it is particularly well done technically.
