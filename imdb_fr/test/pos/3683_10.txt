Unconditional love is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's an emotional roller coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he does not want to go to the pub because the villagers do not like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman lifted her glass and said, "In memory of Victor Fox and all the pub that followed," I felt like crying. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor. Grace is one of the best roles of Kathy Bates. Meredith Eaton flies just about every scene in which she is. Rupert Everett does some of his best work in Unconditional as Dirk. The kiss between Rupert and Meredith led me to another nervous breakdown. In this period of questioning the rights of homosexuals, I think this film should be seen by all. As a gay man in his late forties, I've seen people lose everything when a loved one dies. Congratulations to all who participated in the making of this film.
