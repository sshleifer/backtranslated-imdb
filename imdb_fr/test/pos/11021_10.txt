This film is definitely worth seeing - Robin Tunney excels and Henry Thomas proves that he is one of those rarities, this "actor" of a child who has grown to become a real actor. The characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth, they could have been unconvincing - but all the actors are just amazing. The distribution of this film must rank above that of "Girl, Interrupted" (the two films coincide coincidentally with the brilliant Clea Duvall). The selections of sheet music and music match perfectly, and many actions are taken to prevent the film from becoming a character study. If you want the story, you will not find it in this article, but I will say that the climax will haunt you for a long time.
