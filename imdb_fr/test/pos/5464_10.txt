Captivating story of stabbing behind the curtains. The film follows the difficult situation of David Letterman and Jay Leno as they fight for the elusive Tonight Show. Letterman leads by his desire to win the coveted niche and Leno is led by his agent and little demon, Helen Kushnick. <br /> <br /> Kathy Bates (Kushnick) is excellent in this film, alienating. big dogs like Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield and Howard Stringer. Towards the end of the film, you are so fascinated by the way it handles all situations, from guest bookings to delayed recording, that you find yourself wanting more. <br /> <br /> John Michael Higgins (Letterman) plays his role in the t-shirt. I sometimes wondered if he was in relation to the real Letterman. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of business negotiations.
