Several years ago, I saw this film, without subtitles, on television. Despite the fact that I did not understand what the characters said, I always had the general idea and the atmosphere of the film fascinated me endlessly. Finally, I saw him a few weeks ago. My heart stopped laughing when I saw the picture in the TV guide. For 8 days, the movie was shown to everyone. I told everyone I knew I was going to see him. the story reminded me a bit of Alfred Hitchcock's dizziness. a slow, dark film about a guy who believes one day to see the girlfriend who disappeared years ago. What follows is a roller coaster ride full of backtracking, changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot, and at the end of the film, I was out of breath. I really did not get what I expected (and I had already seen the movie!). to be ready to be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
