There are a few things in life that we can not live more than once and the college experience is one. Especially if we live in a foreign country and in an apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his well-ordered life in Paris, his hippie ex-mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study Spanish to find a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a French doctor and makes friends that make him look at things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the roommates) comes from England, the movie starts to get a lot more funny. Anyway, Xavier starts to see things differently with all his new friends and he probably lives something he will never forget and change his life forever. Overall, it is a very beautiful nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational cast. I found it very interesting to see all these children from different countries, all speaking a language and having different cultures that get along well and have fun. I gave him a 9 out of 10 because I was leaving the room with a smile on my face and thinking about things I had not done while still in university and would like to do before it is too late.
