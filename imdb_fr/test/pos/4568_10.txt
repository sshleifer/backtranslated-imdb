I LOVE this movie .... one of my favorites of all time !!! It was the first big screen movie that my mother had taken me to see at the age of 9. I highly recommend it to all African-Americans. This story is about the love, confidence, challenges and daily life of a black family. All the actors worked well together. I wish it was in video, but for the moment, it is not available to my knowledge. I saw it on TV a few years ago and I recorded it, so every time I want to watch it ... I have it! The soundtrack is great too! A must see!
