I'm so excited that the Greek is back! This season is really hectic. I'm glad Casey is trying to become serious about school, but he's still involved in sorority. It's really funny that she wants to play politics and show off her "intriguing talent". I loved Calvin's new haircut! It makes him look more mature. They should also shave Cappy's head. All guys are hot but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I can not wait to see more of him! I'm particularly interested in what's going on between Calvin, Adam and Rusty! I love Rebecca too. She's really pretty I actually think Rebecca and Calvin should connect. go ahead, Calvin! Join my team!
