I saw this film when I was a lot younger but he captured me. I really liked the relationship between Orry and George. I was so captivated by the love story of Orry and Madenline. I am a hopeless romantic, so it really touched me. I especially liked when he met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So, you know that in book three, I was so hurt that he died. I did not really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie. I just bought the three books together and I can not help but watch them. My 12 year old son is stuck on it. He likes fighting in the war. I cry every time. I wish I could meet Patrick and Madeline in person! It was a wonderful movie and casting!
