I saw several movies by Yul Brynner. Still, this is his best performance, as the camera captures his emotions closely as he scolds, smiles and laughs. Brynner might have been equally striking in Ten Commandments: Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, Brother Karamazov and The Mad of Chaillot, but none of these films captured his talent in close-up as in this one. Deborah Kerr is also fascinating and sexy without undressing, but she is also fascinating and sexy to look at every shot. <br /> <br /> The scenario allows her to breathe a sensuality both visual and suggestive: she takes this kind of role years later in La Nuit de l'Iguane. The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help liberate the group from the claws of the Russians. It is actually seen as fleeing the Russian major (unlike the story of Maupassant or Isak Denisen). Yet, the film bursts with a suggested but real physical appearance of Kerr's character. <br /> <br /> Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my eyes, but she is a superb actress. She strives to dignify the characters she represents, which often runs up against the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes his roles in The journey, Quo Vadis and The Night of Iguana memorable. <br /> <br /> Why is this an unusual movie? It's not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters presented as good people - Dr. Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's novel "A Horse Thief" was once again a great film by Abraham Polonsky, but was never recognized as such because of the intolerance of leftists in the post-McCarthy era. <br /> <br /> The film is also unusual in its distribution French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr. and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways, the film is more international than American. All four are great actors and add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Those who have read the works of Maupassant and Denisen will discover that the film is not faithful to any of these works. Yet the film can handle itself since its clean version (censored?) Has a dignified charm - provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think that Litvak deserves the last laugh by bringing an interesting and plausible twist to the stories that led to the making of the film, while mixing fragments of the two written stories (for example, the last bus ride and the last kiss). <br /> <br /> But I have one grouse - why does not Hollywood ever recognize the sources that inspire stories? It is only recently (eg, Insomnia) that the original works began to be prominently featured in the credits.
