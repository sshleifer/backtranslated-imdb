Rowan Atkinson, Mr. Bean, ranks among the best with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other great comedians. I have never seen people laugh so loudly and literally fall out of their chairs than when I introduced them to Mr. Bean via my videos and now my DVDs. I will never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was at home for a visit and I asked him if he had ever seen Mr. Bean? "Who?" he said. So I took out my video and showed him where Mr. Bean is at church and starts to doze. My brother laughed so hard that he fell off the chair and held his stomach to laugh so loudly. He became an instant fan of Mr. Bean. We all know how hilarious these episodes are, but the pleasure is to share them with others. I have seen so many people laugh until it hurts! The favorite episodes are: the Queen's visit, the hotel room, the dentist's appointment, the Christmas episode (a classic ... and the children love it!) And the New Year's party Rowan Atkinson is a comic book genius!
