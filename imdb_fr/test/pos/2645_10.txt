It was such a good movie. It was done with such a beautiful design, such symmetry. I like the way classical music is linked to the classical art of earth, space and beyond. It was a masterpiece so fluid and thinking. I liked how monoliths have never changed, although primates, earth, and space have changed it. I loved the question "Do you need me / us now"? The film expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more can you ask for a simple movie? Maybe a complementary film. Followers of 2001: A space odyssey will find the 2010 movie is the complementary film of 2001. 2010 is more story-oriented than 2001.
