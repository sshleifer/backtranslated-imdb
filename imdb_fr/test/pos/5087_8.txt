Although short-lived, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is one of the best cartoon hero movies for television. Only "Wonder Woman" (Lynda Carter) (the best of the genre and "The incredible Hulk" (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno) were better. <br /> <br /> "The incredible Spider-Man" surpasses the years 1966-1968 "Batman" because the elements of the camp often ruin the adventure "Spider-Man" outperforms the three televised performances of "Superman" - "Lois and Clark", "Smallville" and of course the George Reeves "Superman" who closes the march. <br /> <br /> "Amazing Amazing Spider-Man" was an action drama, in the late 1970s, before the appearance of CGI, when stunts were to be performed by stuntmen, "Spider-Man" had his own very talented stuntman to perform the puzzle puzzles that challenged death.His name was Fred Waugh, who wore the spidy combination of action sequences. Nicholas Hammond, better known as one of Julie Andrew's children in the classic movie "The Sound of Music" was Spid er-Man during dialogue scenes. Hammond's Spider-Man also had his own secret identity of Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve - Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West-Batman / Bruce Wayne and, of course, Lynda Carter in Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the series did not have thirteen episodes. Because when the first episode was aired in November 1977, the whole country was watching it on CBS this Wednesday night. In all fairness, CBS should publish this pilot episode soon as well as "The Deadly Dust", "Captive Tower", etc. "Spider-Man" was short-lived, but had a cult, and in my opinion was far better than the movie interpretation of the famous cartoon hero starring Toby McGuire. <br /> <br /> CBS could be reluctant to release these episodes for two reasons. (A) The market may not be large due to the longevity of the series and a generation of children and youth who were not born when the series was released in the 1970s (B) One of the first episodes of "Spider-Man" concerned a terrorist designed for the World Trade Center, attacked twice many years after the disappearance of this program, in 1993, and of course the devastating attack against this one. country on 9/11/01 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost. <br /> <br /> However, I do not think it would be bad taste to publish this episode of "Spider-Man" even if the show was adventure, drawn from a comic, and camp in nature. The live action "Amazing Spider-Man" does not have a large audience but a cult. If and when CBS releases it on DVD, this cult could be explained with the episode in which Spiderman saved the towers in 1978, but how, in September 2001, real life turned out to be different from cinema. I like to follow the news, but I also like science fiction / fantasy. I look forward to the release of "The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD".
