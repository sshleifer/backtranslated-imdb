It has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns I have ever seen. Having a weakness for the genre (westerns are or have been, since they are not very often done, pieces of morality that have too often been denigrated by intellectual critics), I bought the DVD, to first sight, because I had read enough about the work of William S. Hart (of whom he wrote and directed a lot) to arouse my interest and I thought I would need at least one of his films in my collection of videos. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I approached the actual viewing with a certain apprehension. My previous experiences with the "classics" of silent film had left me depressed. The Phantom of Chaney's Opera, The Birth of a Griffith Nation and The Fairbanks Zorro Mark are going well, but not as much as their reputation suggests. They were either too long, too theatrical, or both. <br /> <br /> The toll gate, however, appeared as a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> It's a story told in a simple and direct way. Black Deering (played by Hart), leader of a notoriously popular outlaw gang, thinks the time has come for the band to dissolve before its luck runs out. His chief lieutenant, Jordan, opposes him, pushing them all into one last fight by promising them great wealth, but leading them into a trap in which he is an accomplice. Everyone is killed except Deering, who is taken prisoner. When his captors recognize him as the man who has already saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an imminent attack by the Indians, they allow him to escape. Free, he tries to find an honest job, but he is snubbed and ridiculed and must eventually fly again to survive. Soon, he is pursued not only by the sheriff's sheriff, but also by Jordan (who is now prospering thanks to the reward he has collected) and by his henchmen. His flight takes him to an isolated cabin inhabited by a single mother and her grandson. After some initial fears, they take it into their hearts. Deering sees a chance for a new life but, with the detachment and Jordan coming closer, realizes that this might not be possible. <br /> <br /> Hart was the first big western star and the first to give realism to the genre. As one of the pioneers of cinema, he has created many characters and situations that have become clichés in westerns for more than ninety years. However, what makes his films interesting is his ability to go beyond the cliché (maybe his imitators did not go far enough) to make the material seem fresh and innovative, even now. Three examples of this kind in The Toll Gate illustrate this: <br /> <br /> 1) In one scene, his character sinks into a crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan, and instead kills a passerby. A close-up view shows that he is clearly frustrated. The frustration, however, does not come from the fact that he shot a man who until now had not hurt him but missed the target. <br /> <br /> 2) In another, as he flees the detachment, his "borrowed" horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg. Hart pulls out his weapon to put the animal out of his misery but, before pulling the trigger, gives his head a sad and affectionate pat, like saying goodbye to an old friend. <br /> <br /> 3) Finally, after strangling Jordan and throwing his body on a cliff, he returns to collect his weapons and spots his opponent's pistol lying on the ground nearby. He stepped forward and kicked quickly before getting on his horse. It's a simple gesture, but it highlights the deep hatred he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades. <br /> <br /> And I love the title, The Toll Gate. It is allegorical in his implication that a man can not start a new life until he has paid for his former sins. The payment of Deering comes in the form of a sacrifice. The most sophisticated audience today may not share this feeling, but it can still interest you if you let it. <br /> <br /> Viewers who enjoy their videos in perfect condition will undoubtedly oppose the image quality of the DVD, especially the final deteriorated seed. It does not bother me at all. That a copy of this 1920 film even exists is a miracle since copies of so many other silent films have been lost. If you keep this in mind and consider the film as a piece of history, its visual flaws are not so hard to accept. <br /> <br /> William S. Hart was born in 1870 in New York but grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian sign language. He counted Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected Remington's paintings. His knowledge of the West was therefore first-hand. If his vision seems too romantic compared to current standards, it is nevertheless much closer to reality than spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and the revisionist works that followed. The star and his films are late in their re-evaluation.
