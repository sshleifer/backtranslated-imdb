I remember seeing this film during a C4 screening a year ago and I was completely blown away. I thought that the film managed to represent such a diversity of genres; the supernatural, a love story, the plot of crime and many more. <br /> <br /> I was hooked at all after a minute or two and I was really concerned about the characters. I felt terrified at the second for Jimmy, then I laughed at the gangsters later ... and all the time I crossed my fingers so that things went well for Jimbo! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are superb, Bryan Brown is of absolute quality and made me climb, with David Field, who was funny and who is also a devilish demon. managed to order it on DVD and, therefore, every person to whom I show it was hung in the same way. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a quiet evening, and you can really enjoy with your friends.
