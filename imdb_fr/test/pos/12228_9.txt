I came across this movie while surfing the channels one day; and decided to give a chance. To my surprise, I enjoyed this darkhorse movie. I felt a real chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was a film so light and warm that I felt optimistic when it was finished. Of course, this film was predictable from the beginning, but I appreciate it a lot for what it made me feel when finished. I must admit that I have never seen Challen Cates before, but I have the impression that she can really act. When you combine his acting with his cute face and attractive figure. She has at least the makings of becoming a well-known star.
