This extremely scary southern Gothic melodrama features Clint Eastwood as a Confederate officer wounded in the American Civil War, cared for by a rural girls' school and recovering health. A strange clash of genres ensues, the so-called "dangerous" man falling prey to a group of seemingly harmless women, who are as brutal as the men who are waging war on the front. It's a classic spider and a fly story, but here there is an isolated fly and many spiders. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page plays the principal of the school and gives a sensational performance. Page has been trained as a theater actress and it shows in all her performances. No matter what role she played, she has always been 100% committed to it and never let herself be seduced. So, it is here, with this old mortal girl, who takes her sexual repression on this helpless man. Each of the other girls also responds to him in his own way. The two most prominent people are the slutty girl who is eager to throw herself at him, and the virginal girl (played by who else besides the elegant Elizabeth Hartman?) Who acts as if she would fall into a dead fainting if someone did as much as the word "penis" says for her. Madonna and the whore's story would seem heavy if the movie did not hold you so far and so completely unsure of what would happen next. <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene in The Movie for Me occurred when the women's group amputated Eastwood's leg, infected with gangrene. Once again, the spider / fly allusion is clear: they prevent him from breaking his web so that he escapes his pain. <br /> <br /> A classic cooler. Not a good movie, but a morbid and entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Note: A-
