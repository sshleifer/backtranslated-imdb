John Wayne is one of the few actors in the history of cinema to have failed in his first big exit and to have succeeded the second time. Of course, everyone knows that the second time was the classic Stagecoach with John Ford at the helm. <br /> <br /> But we are here to talk about The Big Trail. John Ford co-director Raoul Walsh spotted this big boy on the set of one of Ford's films and thought he had potential. He wanted to make him the leader in a big-budget western western that Fox was planning to do. The film, as planned, would be a tribute to the classic silent Western classic The Covered Wagon. <br /> <br /> Watching The Big Trail, I'm struck by the similarity of Wayne's character Breck Coleman to Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. . Both characters were friendly young cowboys, but they were also on a revenge mission. And of course, both films were made on site and show the cost of their manufacture. No studio products here with a western set of backlot. <br /> <br /> I also do not think it's an accident if Wayne had this interruption at the beginning of the sound era. Raoul Walsh, I guess, looked around Hollywood and probably did not think that a lot of movie cowboys would have a lasting power in the sound. It's something else that Walsh spotted in Wayne. <br /> <br /> According to what I read, The Big Trail is a failure, because after spending all that money to make the film at the beginning of the film, a genius of Fox realized their theaters were not equipped with the big screen to show it. And when the Great Depression hit, there would be more money to expand these screens in Fox theaters. So, The Big Trail had a limited release, even in what we would call a formatted version, and a big loss of money for Fox movies. <br /> <br /> Marguerite Churchill is well like the crinoline heroine who Duke wins, loses and wins Again from Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of villains Wayne faces. <br /> <br /> F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous movie legend Tyrone Power. He was a beefy man with great experience in classic roles on screen and on stage. I would not be surprised if his son who was 15 at the time would not have been around the set. <br /> <br /> Also look for Ward Bond even if you have trouble finding it under a big beard. <br /> <br /> Watch The Big Trail Now, it's interesting to speculate on the fate of John Wayne's career if the Big Trail had been a big hit.
