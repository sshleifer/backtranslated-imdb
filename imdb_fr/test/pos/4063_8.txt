"Showtime" is somewhere north of what some critics said, and a little south of what I was expecting months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and from Robert Di Niro who were teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As a "real" crime or that the cops go - and plot, by the way - it's pretty illogical, but DUH --- it's a comedy. In addition, while the special effects, lawsuits, aerial shots and skyscrapers that exploded were present, but less important than a Schwartzenegger film, I found it a little tedious and exaggerated. The sensitivity of September 11, except for me, all this thing hyper-effect pyro-techno had really aged in recent years. It seemed like a lame substitute for characterization, story and engaging emotions. I hope the least amount of "Showtime" is an indicator of a Hollywood trend. A downward trend, which is to use less stupid, less to use the building that explodes. <br /> <br /> Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Their presence on the screen and their charisma - and even the depth of their character - have been "a joy to see" for many years. This can not be dismissed here - they engage actors, are entertaining and attractive in this film. I can not put my finger on it, but maybe the explosions, the excessive currency effects and all that have diminished the final product ??? Perhaps, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination of factors that makes the impression that the film does not reach its highest potential. Anyway, "Showtime" was fun - I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out - but I thought it was not all that it could have been. At least not everything I had hoped for. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, but not a good movie. I gave him an 8 out of 10.
