When I started watching this DVD, I never imagined that I would be totally fascinated by it in minutes. The story was completely absorbing and fun. The acting was superb. The biggest surprise of all was the way I would be so completely enchanted by the love of these two young women. Their initial physical encounter for me was by far the most tender, romantic, delightful and captivating love scene I have ever seen on film. I literally stopped breathing. I could not believe the chemistry between the two actresses. Without nudity or graphic sex, they conveyed more passion and titillation than any American production could ever hope to prove. Congratulations to the author, screenwriter, director and cast.
