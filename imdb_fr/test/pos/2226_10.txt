I saw this film in a cinema during my vacation in Pablo, CO. I had just left my job as a biomedical engineer in a hospital. I regard the script as an exaggeration of the kind of things that happen in hospitals. <br /> <br /> Idiots who attribute the value of production do not understand the problem and have probably never been hospitalized. And never worked in one for sure. Billy Jack (same era) was very badly produced but had a meaningful social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message. <br /> <br /> Since then, I'm looking for this movie. This is the first website I found where it is mentioned.
