It's funny to see a young James Cagney doing his thing. He embodies the kind of weights and measures of stubborn who takes his job very seriously, walking on the feet of a group of dishonest politicians. He is offered the world, but keeps his integrity. He is beaten and prepared, but that's the problem. You never know if he's really in danger. They say he is in a position, but he still seems to have carte blanche to move and do what he has to do. Sometimes he is so arrogant that he does not do much to protect himself. His allies are in the police department but just about everything else is pretty corrupt. He perseveres (almost too good to be true), of course, and we shoot for him. The problem for me is a lack of sustained suspense. It would have been a lot better if he had had to erase his name. He never falls into the depths, even when he is rejected by his wife. It's always fun with the type of implosion of the bad guys. Just see it to watch Cagney stand firm.
