This film, Blade Master, may be cheap, seemingly clumsy and sometimes, but it does reflect thoughts on issues well beyond the time in which this film unfolds. Ator is the chosen one who must protect the Earth against a terrible weapon, which is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon. He crosses obstacles like a witty character who is just more than muscular strength, although he has many. I would say that this aspect of the film makes him surpass a film like Conan the barbarian, which is the least I can say, without brains. It does not diminish the big adventure film Conan, but gives Ator a health he does not share with the barbarian. For a low-budget film, this film is good in terms of scenery and the fights are mostly credible. Zor, the villain, trapped throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontations that feeds the film into tension, although Ator seems too fit for the task. <br /> <br /> What gives this film a little more, it is these scenes which may seem odd, but which deserve to be mentioned. The fight with the serpent god, even if it is a gigantic puppet, is well managed since the snake, with good lightning, remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The film culminates in a very unusual way, rather anachronistic, but breathtaking: the sequence of hang-gliding. The scene itself is not correctly introduced, not at all, where Ator had this machine, it's unconvincing, but it leads to a poetic and beautiful outdoor scene, which is the highlight of the film, elevating Ator to a place where few human fantasy heroes have been. <br /> <br /> If Blade Master is not one of the great fantasy films of all time, it's not surprising because of its shortcomings, it's a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way that he chooses to confront the good and the bad, the truth it speaks and the heart shows, that this film is so unthought. I suggest it to all fans of the genre and try to take it seriously, as a smart movie to take more seriously than it seems.
