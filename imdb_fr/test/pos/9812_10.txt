Simply a bittersweet amazing film that portrays an aspect of life often ignored in good movies. I saw this as a child, I returned very recently and fell in love again. <br /> <br /> As a child, this has aroused my interest only for the construction of an airplane; dark world and a young man escape this world. <br /> <br /> The king's performance was excellent, the camera style chosen with low shots and shots focused on the actions and movements of the hands was considered well done. for the character and portrays him as an almost non-human force (which may not be too far from reality), this gives rise to interesting developments <br /> <br /> It's worth the detour all day long
