Most of Kieslowski's films seem to me to be puzzles designed to develop the mind and soul. The characters are not very credible, are idealized, are schematic. Nevertheless, the way Kieslowski presents their sinuous paths through life, their complex interaction with others, with the universe, with chance or destiny, makes me understand faith, makes me (want) to believe in God. At some point, it makes sense, if not for me, but certainly for someone. <br /> <br /> Three colors and especially "Red" come closer to make me feel, feel, experience the "truth", the "meaning" that perhaps no other of his films. The only problem is that the paths of the "riddles" explored are a little too similar to those of his other films and that at some point, they become somewhat predictable. There is still a lot of joy to have here. It looks like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect and will deliver, sometimes with a new bouquet that could come from aging - either wine or yourself.
