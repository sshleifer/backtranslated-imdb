The man who knew too much {1956} is a remake of an Alfred Hitchcock film made in 1934 in England under the same name. In my opinion, his subsequent efforts are far superior. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock will say that the remake is mediocre and does not have the thrilling suspense of the original with Peter Lorre. In both films, the plot is essentially the same, with the exception of the original happening in Switzerland and the remake in Marrakech. It tells the story of a married couple {James Stewart and Doris Day} on vacation with their young son and meet a suspicious man, very curious about their past. It turns out he's an agent looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader. He is then stabbed in a Marrakeck market because he was discovered to be a spy and he fell into Stewart's arms. In the process of dying, he tells her the whole story of the assassination plot. Steve and Day later discover that another couple they met was the one the officer was looking for and that they had kidnapped their son. The film contains excellent performances of Stewart and Day, in a film that has proved that Doris Day could play in suspense dramas as well as in carefree musicals. The management of Alfred Hitchcock is excellent. The film allows you to stay on the edge of your seat every minute. The scene at Albert Hall is a classic.The original is so slow and dull.I do not know how people can compare both.Just watch the remake and you will enjoy it.I give the movie a 9 out of ten.
