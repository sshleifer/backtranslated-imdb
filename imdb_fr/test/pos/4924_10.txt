Although it was not the first movie I bought for me, it's certainly the one I watched the most. The animation is well designed by the Tokyo Movie Shinsa experts, and the animators have often used clever techniques such as causing a "parasitic light" from the sun, soaking the camera (and leaving the camera behind). Operator's hand "get clean lens!) etc. While the film avoided becoming a "festival of gadgets for animators", the judicious but generous application of such techniques gave the film a sensation much more "realistic" than the typical drawing. <br /> <br /> The story has many interlaced intrigues that do not seem to have much to do with each other until everything ends in the end, in a way that even writers admit erased way is artificial. Each of the main lines of the plot has its own musical theme, ranging from "Pop goes the Weasel" [Hamton & Plucky] to the theme of the love of "Romeo and Juliet" [Fifi & Johnny]. Transitions between intrigues are slightly different, but consistent. <br /> <br /> Really a beautiful movie. there is not much original music, although the new lyrics of "Spinning Song" are intelligent and enjoyable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
