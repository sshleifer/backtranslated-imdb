I was not surprised to read a comment by the director that she made the film an antidote to all those "making of" DVDs, as it certainly struck me. I confess that I have a penchant for "meta", but I found this film very accessible and entertaining, and not even laborious and cleverly intelligent, which is certainly a bit like what you expect in a movie. about making movies. It's very "French" in that there are a lot of strange but sometimes convincing theories about the "work" of the film (and even about sexuality), but since the director does not play her (even using an avatar), we still have a lot of choices (since I'm pretty sure it's constantly contradicting itself). Apparently, Catherine Breillat specializes in movies that are difficult to watch, but I would certainly say that this one is not eligible. I really enjoyed the dialogue, the balance between cinematic and natural, the relationship between the director and her assistant and actor, etc. Highly recommended.
