"Tesis", "Open Eyes" and "Others" are proof of Amenabar's talent and skill as a filmmaker, but (IMHO) are also imperfect films in their attempt to thwart public, always offering a twist of screw too much, favoring thrills, twists and resonance. Fortunately for all, Amenabar chose for his new film a subject that would not allow a surprise ending, focusing on the characters and the emotional ties that unite them. <br /> <br /> The result is a small miracle of a film beautifully written, photographed, marked, interpreted and realized. Everyone involved in this film offers a high-level performance, behind and in front of the cameras, of the superb cast (Bardem shines, but Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Due√±as give the film an astonishing authenticity) to the exquisite lens. <br /> <br /> The film effectively tackles many of the relevant issues and emotions, addresses the heart and mind with the same power and offers a final punch that will follow you long after the credits. It is a brilliantly executed film that will not only be a reference in Spanish cinema, but will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens abroad (Sony Classics has disbursed a record $ 6 million to distribute it ) Do not be surprised If she succeeds in entering the Oscar race ... Amenabar does not stop ... <br /> <br /> Buen trabajo, Alejandro!
