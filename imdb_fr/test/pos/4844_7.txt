A very good movie about anti-Semitism towards the end of the second world war. The scene that speaks loudly of the ignorance of these people is the meeting at the church when the priest delivers his speech against "the international silver traders and the communists". This is strikingly similar to the speeches that Adolph Hitler used to force the throats of his people, yet none of the participants in the meeting seem to make that comparison.
