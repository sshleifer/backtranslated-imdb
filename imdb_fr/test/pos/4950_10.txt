Not too high is the classic "top gun" or "independence day" when it comes to the excitement of fighter planes. Yes, the film from top to bottom is based on a truly fictional example of how anyone can make a successful rescue, but it's cool because it breaks all the traditional rules. The kid does what he wants to do in a roll as he wants. <br /> <br /> I can not really put my finger on what I like in this film but others that I know who saw the I feel the same for the film. I think it's basically a lot of fun, but maybe a bit too unrealistic for some to buy it. Again, no matter, I loved it, the people I know have seen, loved it, so it's definitely worth seeing to make your own decisions about it. In other words, I thought Top Gun was one of the best fighter pilot movies of all time and I like this movie just as much, if not more, than Top Gun. Do not miss, see it, a really inspiring movie.
