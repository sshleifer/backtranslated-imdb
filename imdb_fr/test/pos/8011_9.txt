I watched this program until I was puberty, but I still found that it was the cause of many situations that worried us when we were teenagers, even if it was a family-oriented show . Until the mid-1990s, it was more focused on young adults and their situations. <br /> <br /> That's why I loved "Step by Step". I mean, this has offered situations for all ages and unlike many shows like this, it has met expectations. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest; it was not an extremely funny show, no, but there were a few situations with which you could feel connected but only more funny. <br /> <br /> There was a very good charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy rocked! Sommers was tender and really funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was extremely sexy (loved her legs) and spiritual. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with her character Cody. He was the man in the day! Oh, memories. Nowadays, this show has not been able to adapt properly to new generations and that is why it should stay in the safe of memory. That's all, only memories. <br /> <br /> Thank you, step by step, for making my puberty more fun.
