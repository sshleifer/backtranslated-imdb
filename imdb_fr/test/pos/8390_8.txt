This shows how much you can go wrong. I did not expect to like this movie. I was disappointed both by the movies of Kill Bill (though I preferred the latter) and by Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter version of the double bill version). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and I think Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most successful film - technically its most superior - including the latest big show spawned by Robert De Niro. Since then, it seems to me that his films went well (I did not hate them), but he walked in the juvenile water of reference, reverence and indulgence. <br /> <br /> Then I read last year's script for Inglourious Basterds - and I hated it! Of course, there were some typical QT frills and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were two or three great characters. But on the page, it was more juvenile rubbish, largely spoiled by the largesse of the uninteresting title of Basterds. This made me seriously consider not seeing the movie. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed my mind when I had the opportunity to see the film with a group of Tarantino questions and answers in London. I thought it was worthwhile to hear him in a question and answer session because, according to the interviews, he could be entertaining in person. <br /> <br /> I was preparing so little for the exuberant entertainment and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds. Easily Mr. Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown is a triumph. <br /> <br /> Yes, the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes, Eli Roth is a stuntman, but he works very well. He only looks aggressive and does nothing to hurt the film as I feared. While I admired Mr. Tarantino for using the Zoe Bell stunt in Death Proof to intensify the excitement of the major stunt scene, his lack of acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's appearances in several films, especially From Dusk Till Dawn by Robert Rodriguez, written by Tarantino. <br /> <br /> What really makes this job is its greatness. The western atmosphere of spaghetti in style, dialogue and performance is wonderfully exaggerated without going too far in the quality of the cartoon Kill Bill. The violence is so great. Audacity so great. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers, Hitler's moment and Pitt's performance bothered me, but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is really brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is the bluffing samurai from Mifune to Yojimbo, he is Cheyenne Robards of Once Upon a Time in the West, he has a very James Coburn atmosphere, and of course an appropriate touch of Lee Marvin. <br /> <br /> Christoph Waltz (whom I did not know before) and Melanie Laurent (whom I noticed for the first time in a brilliant British short film by Sean Ellis in French) are sensational and I 'm expect that they will be used much more in the future. Tarantino clearly did not lose his eye for casting, which seemed to abandon him in Death Prof. The waltz is just as big in his performance. Cold, but theatrical. He is Fonda de OUATITW, Van Cleef of Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably innocent Cardinale but tough, a fighter. Both are dazzled. <br /> <br /> That every member of the cast is enjoying what he does, without letting himself have fun and trying to laugh, it helps a lot. The laughs - and there are many - come in an organic way. Only Mike Myers is about to tip the wink and push it too far, but his scene is sufficiently regularized, with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender that seems straight from the mold of the leader of the great escape from Attenborough. <br /> <br /> All the actors shine and Tarantino throws magnificent marvels, but that walk with history. The introduction of Hugo Stiglitz of Schweiger is a riot. After a sensational opening to slow combustion and a glorious introduction to these greedy Basterds, the rhythm never stops and more than two and a half hours pass. <br /> <br /> It is also beautiful, marking the return to the real movie-Making rather than self-indulgent stupidity. The musical choices, as always, are inspired by Morricone. <br /> <br /> The film is bold and hilarious. After a summer when almost all the films disappointed me, I was very surprised to see that the most entertaining and entertaining film, but also engaging and impressive, should be this one, when I would never have believed from a scenario. Welcome to QT.
