This film has recently been shown subtitled, not dubbed, on the special broadcast service in Australia. I thought I read here that it is sometimes supposed that * The revenge of the rats * is a sequel. In fact, rats get revenge for something that is done in this film or in human history. As far as I know, there is no prequel. <br /> <br /> Now, let's get the flute player out. This story may have crossed my mind when I watched the movie, but that's it. There was the use of the word "chests" at the end of the movie. A dazed mayor tries to justify his actions by saying that "the chests were empty". "Chests" is not a word you hear a lot these days, unless you read folk tales to your kids, as I do. Since I saw * Revenge of the Rats *, I read two versions of the Piper Pied of Hamelin. Now I see the comparison. A metaphorical but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford, to get rid of the rats. It's about as far as I can follow the analogy. Children are not driven to a door in a mountain, with a lame boy left behind to tell a country of winged horses and fountains, where it is always springtime and everyone is always happy. <br /> <br /> There is one that is quite common in this movie. Romance and resolution in particular. Female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are actually quite helpless. Where this film is quite rebellious (compared to American cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian. The mayor dismissed the helicopter pilot for "doing good". The mayor and the local government are portrayed as corrupt and are trying to make a lot of money. Finally, it is up to a doctor in Frankfurt to solve an epidemic of deadly and contagious disease. Apparently, there is no national infectious disease authority to coordinate things or send back-ups. <br /> <br /> I'm not a horror fanatic, so any horror I see is usually mixed with humor. From the rat into the blood bank, you can see that this will provide the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers; the large number of rats is impressive and the horror fans also seem satisfied.
