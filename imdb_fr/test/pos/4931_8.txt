According to him, the best time to be a child was in the 1990s, a time when cartoons were not heavily censored and where talented and creative minds were at the root of the best family entertainment to be featured on the radio . The best animation producers on Saturday morning were at Warner Brothers Television, which had a great golden age with the dream team of Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger and Paul Dini. With serious and dark series like Batman, they also revived the wacky and strange cartoons made famous by the Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humor and celluloid tributes of yesteryear and today, but Tiny Toon Adventures was also popular in reinventing the Looney Tunes for a new generation, while still maintaining that cartoon violence. crazy and this smart comedy. can keep any age group, regardless of age. Even when Tiny Toons movies were stretched in a feature film How I Spent My Vacation, it did not look like a longer episode of the TV series, a curse that so often poisons other feature film adaptations popular animated series. /> <br /> The Tiny Toon Gang are young descendants of classic cartoon characters who made the audience laugh in the 1940s and 1950s and are currently learning comedy cartoons to "earn their Toon degree." Summer Vacation has started and every character has their own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babs Bunny (Tress MacNeille) engage in a water pistol fight that results in the Acme Acres flood and their descent into Mississippi. Plucky Duck (Joe Alaskey) joins Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on a road trip across the country to Happiest theme park, but Hamton's family is proving harder than he imagined. Meanwhile, in other scattered stories, Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) tries to find a cat to hug, Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) tries to go out with her favorite skunk star and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) goes to the movies with a big mouth Fowlmouth (Rob Paulen). <br /> <br /> Even if the scenario seems thin for a feature film, the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together. The best of these is the unfortunate journey on the road to Plucky, who uses a golden comic opportunity very well: to feel pity for someone, while laughing at his situation. Plucky's bored reaction to all the bad things that happen to him is a perfect mix of script and animation, all within the confines of a little car stuffed with pork. Elmyra's story definitely takes second place, just to see how an almost innocent little girl can scare many jungle animals. The story of Buster and Babs is clearly highlighted by the violence of cartoons, which makes us smile, not only because of the hilarity of results, but also with nostalgia, since Ruegger and his company would probably not allowed to show half of what they do in this segment. Virtually half of this segment plays like a parody and a tribute to Deliverance, including an intelligent modification of the banjo dueling scene, featuring the unforgettable Tiny Toon Adventures theme song. <br /> Part of the universal appeal of the Tiny Toons is that the humor is very intelligent because it targets the subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not deserve the title of "children's food" at all. with which people seem to slap him. An entire segment featuring Fowlmouth's bad film etiquette makes fun of the horns with a note to perfection, as well as an extra shot at Lucasfilm's THX logo. This scene is so well done that it should be presented before each movie shoot. There are also some moments that make fun of Disney World, holes in the movie plot and even Warner's legal department. The fact that today's cartoons are bland and not creative makes these smart moments even more valuable, as there will probably be no other animated series that will come closer. <br /> <br /> After watching How I spent my vacation for the first time In many years, I can say with certainty that they do not do cartoons as before. With the permanent censorship of current family entertainment, one may wonder if such a thing will ever be done. This opinion is not only a recommendation of a truly intelligent film, but also a call to Spielberg, Ruegger and Dini to join together again and to bring back to life a magical creation. God knows that twenty-first century children need something that has the intelligence of Tiny Toon Adventures. It's not a simple money game, it's a wonderful movie full of wit, heckling and hilarity.
