I love that movie. he focuses on the two issues: reality and fantasy. the reality because, we all wanted a date from this popular Billy guy. and some of us have not been kissed yet, right? be honest! <br /> <br /> Another real problem is the pain people get from teasing. and whoa, high school life. Remember? the fantasy is to find your true love, when you are 25 years old and still in high school. not really fantastic, but close enough! <br /> <br /> Although some parts are incredible, it was a good movie. there are no other words to describe such incredible work. and the story was wonderful. Drew Barrymore did a lovely job, as did the hilarious David Arquette. the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful. Did not I just repeat that? <br /> <br /> Never Been Kissed is one of the movies that future generations should watch. it shows the reality and some problems for people like you and me.
