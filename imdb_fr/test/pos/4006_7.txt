I can not hate on the show. When the old (and best) technological TV channel had to do its work, the channel was reformatted and new programs were added. "Attack of the Show" replaces screensavers, with 3 co-hosts at the beginning. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran has become a little co-host, but he mostly composed pre-recorded plays for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the series and a contest finally took place to determine who would be the third host, but it did not work for any reason. <br /> <br /> Eventually (I just learned that from this very IMDb message board) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran are gone because (hey, that's what I read) the two got married. It was a big secret for me! Now, there is a new co-host, Olivia Munn, not very hot (in my opinion). She hides something in her highs that she wears, while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she was not afraid to show it. <br /> <br /> AHEM! Sorry. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the show" deals with everything young people want to know. It's music, movies, comics, internet and television. That's what's great in the show. If you do not want to worry about scouring the net or wasting your time watching MTV, you can get everything you want on AOTS. Some segments and tracks are funny. They have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry, as well as guests ranging from insignificant internet stars to current big names. <br /> <br /> Even though the hosts are not as geeky as I would like them to be, I have always found "Attack of the Show" to be entertaining, even with its latest lineup.
