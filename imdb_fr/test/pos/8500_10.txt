This type of broadcast is not supposed to happen on television. This is the type of nervousness usually reserved for independent film. This is what only HBO is supposed to do. The fact is that Denis Leary has managed to create one of the best television series in his history, easily joining the ranks of THE SOPRANOS, OZ, ED, etc. Mr. Leary and his band for creating a truly unique viewing experience. The only complaint I would make is that the show is not long enough ... an hour would make it better, but I can not wait for the next episode!
