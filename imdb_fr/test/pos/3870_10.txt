The animation is still the slightly rougher style of the first episode, Simpsons Roasting on Open Fire, but already, with this first regular episode, Bart the Genius, the humor begins to be more "stratified", faster and more deep. is already appearing. <br /> <br /> This episode firmly establishes Bart's "slacker" personality, and more subtly, Lisa's intellectual superiority over the entire family. Although this is the main theme of the whole episode (there is also a nice secondary theme of the father / son relationship of Bart and Homer), it was introduced to us for the first time at the beginning of the episode when the Simpsons play Scrabble. Lisa says "id" for her word - short, but you have to be well educated to know it. She has to read the definition from the family dictionary for the rest of the family, which has allowed her to go back to bed. Marge can only find "he". Homer has "oxidized" already sitting on his platter in order, but does not recognize that it's a word, so he presents "do" instead. Bart arrives with "kwyjibo", which, he insists, is a word. Similarly, in the main plot of the episode, Bart cheats on his IQ test, which leads him to be sent to a specialized school filled with gifted children. We know that it will probably not last long. <br /> <br /> "The Simpsons" has always had a lot of fun playing with more or less intellectual abilities among his characters, and more importantly, their way of varying degrees of intellectual abilities are integrating (or no), are accepted (or not) and are collected in the company. In addition to beginning to present the place of Bart, Lisa, Homer and Marge in this context, this episode already begins to mock respectfully nerds and geeks outside the family of the Simpson. Through some dialogues of the students of the specialized school, as well as other references, including purely visual ones, this episode also shows that "The Simpsons" will not be punched while writing or speaking. to his audience. It may be just a cartoon, but it's a design that intellectuals, geeks and nerds will understand more than anyone else. And this fact, aside from the fact that it is a very funny show, is the key to its longevity.
