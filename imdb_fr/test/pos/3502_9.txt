Ali G has gained fame on the small screen - although the big screen has not been congratulated. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laughing festival of a second - like on a small screen. He has lost none of his character or his stupidity, and behind all that, no film contains brainless fluff. A human side of Ali is revealed during the movie, the idea of ​​running for PM is a bright, fresh and fun idea - and the incessant stupidity of the Staines gangster man mixes well with the stern and harsh world that is politics. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of interview after interview, we get a comic movie that is never repetitive or boring. So why did not I give him ten stars? Well, the end was funny, but also missed and missed - that makes no sense. And in some passages, the film has become offensive by trying to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if it's not offensive, it's not himself and he's totally and completely ruined. Ali G's big-screen debut was a success, and should have been in the range of 6 to 7 average ratings on IMDb. But that could have been worse, and people will inevitably have mixed opinions, especially on a film like this. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious British comedy at its best - and the funniest and most intelligent. Great work! 9/10
