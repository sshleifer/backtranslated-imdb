Good Movie, the acting was fantastic, especially Eriq Ebouaney (Lumumba) and very well done. <br /> <br /> It also shows how Lumumba was stuck by the Belgians, the United States and the United Nations and how they called him a "communist". to frighten people as they did to all honest, true African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. This shows how Western countries preach democracy while they have something else in mind. It is a story of injustice, struggle and brutality. <br /> <br /> This shows that Lumumba could not control his people, that's right, it was his people, but before blaming him, did he have enough? Among the people he named in his government, like Mobutu? Or his colleague had something else in mind to discover, go see the movie! Admittedly, Mobutu looted the country for the next 35 years, before being overthrown and fleeing the country. Death of a billionaire. <br /> <br /> Some flaws: There was too little explanation about how the man (Lumumba) managed to rise in the first place. There should also have been more explanations about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire, under Mobutu. He should have explained why he (Lumumba) could not keep the second largest country in Africa in one piece. And also what was happening with Tshombe and Katanga. If you watch the movie, go to the top. Tshombe controlled the Katanga region, which (if I'm not mistaken) is the world's largest copper producer. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good movie to watch. . You will learn something new about Africa, its leaders and its inhabitants, and you will probably open your eyes to the reasons for the war on this continent.
