Continuing his comeback, John Travolta played a slightly crooked angel in "Michael". He may be a messenger of God, but he is not the kindest guy, as journalists Andie MacDowell and William Hurt have discovered. When I saw this film for the first time, it was before I started to watch "All in the Family", so I did not recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her like that, I try to imagine Archie reproaching her for harboring an angel (which he would probably classify among Blacks, Jews, etc.). to relate to the film. But I like to associate things this way. Anyway, it's a very interesting movie. Also with Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. <br /> <br /> What John and Paul said ...
