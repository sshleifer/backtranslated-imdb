Well ... it's time! Van Damme is back in this action thriller which is his best film of recent years. The plot is not very inventive, but the theme of the border patrol is interesting and the ex-Marines as drug traffickers are cool. But what makes this movie awesome is the fact that Van Damme is back to the martial arts. His latest films have been more geared to acting, but in "The Shepard", JCVD ​​is again dropping the bad guys and seems to be in excellent shape. There are some impressive fighting scenes and Van Damme shows that he can still shoot the famous old 360 degree heel kick. To be a low-budget action movie, it has good scenery and great stunts. Van Damme says a few humorous lines and shows that he is improving as an actor. I'm glad he came back to the Van Damage cast ... I'm disappointed by the lack of fighting in his recent movies. Scott Adkins is awesome in his role and Van Damme and he have a showdown at the end. Overall, it's one of Van Damme's best movies and will entertain you. A must for JCVD ​​fans. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like "Bloodsport" or "Kickboxer". Nok Su Kow!
