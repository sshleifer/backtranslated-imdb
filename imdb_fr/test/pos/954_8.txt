Ghillie, a remake of "okkadu" in Telugu, is fortunately a clarified version of the original. It retains the same punch, while Dharani, true to his cinematic talent, delivers it with style and panache. Vikram in the fray has achieved the emergence of the long-awaited rebellion with this film, which may well prove to be the best movie of all time for Vijay, given the choices he has made since. This actor seems to have lost all its value. That talented new entrants are accepted by both industry and the public. <br /> <br /> The very tight scenario, which runs at the speed of the neck, revolves around Velu, a young volunteer wanting to make his mark the game of Kabaddi (a popular game among boys in India). The events that followed the chance encounter with Muthupandi, his rescue of the girl in distress and the way he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his own forms the pivot and the end of the film. Vijay agrees as a 'T' in the role and tries a moderate and credible representation of the boy next door. <br /> <br /> Trisha has more than a cloak of Tamil heroine stereotyped to play. The role is much more complex than a simple girl in trouble. With limited dialogues, Trisha exploits her occasional dumb expressions and her subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is the classic case of a front page girl in the process of being a professional actress. Trisha became my favorite after this movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends on a predictable basis, although we must thank the director for letting the audience guess at many things, including Trisha's decision to leave the country . Prakash Raj deserves praise for providing the perfect counterweight to Vijay's role. His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent flaws in the hero's armor form a perfect ploy to let the audience guess. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great movie that deserves at least a viewing. I give it a 8 out of 10.
