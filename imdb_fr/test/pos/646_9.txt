I love this little film, which reminds me a bit of the Japanese jewel of origin, DO WE DANCE? (Not the exaggerated remake of Gere / Jlo ...) Fortunately, I found it and I filmed it when it was broadcast on a STARZ Promo Weekend, because, as far as I know, it is not available on DVD. I'll watch just about anything with Yancy Butler (we remember the ephemeral TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???), and she shines positively in all of this. She does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT !! I loved all the other characters, especially those played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where did she go all these years?). It's one of those movies I go out from time to time and I always come back smiling after seeing it. Strongly recommended !!!
