Gulliver's Travels is, in the beginning, a satirical novel written by a great misanthrope, Jonathan Swift. So, it is not recommended to judge this film, just by itself. We must go further in the consciousness of man to get to the point where Swift would have led us. Gulliver lived a journey of truth, loneliness, apprehension of what could be his true life. We can not just watch this movie saying it's so cute or so boring. The question is far beyond that and I would like everyone to expect it. It's the greatest film of all time, as you can feel the truths of Ted Danson's character: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver.
