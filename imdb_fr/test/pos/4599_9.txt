Shame on Fox for emptying this movie. It was a total riot and I only hope he will find a second life on DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> It's a hilarious satire. He takes the situation "What if" to the extreme and he does not fist (or kicks his groin). It makes you think ... what will become of this empire once we become completely lazy and stupid? Everyone is touched in this one esp. A number of big companies, and even Fox News, have made up their minds (that's probably why the movie never had a real release - with the exception of the marketing department who thought about the campaign and not knowing how to market it ", so we're going to give up!") Some people may find the film to be sophomoric because of kicks in the groin and crackling, but the film is much more than that. You get either what Mike Judge says or you do not understand. Most of the negative reviews I read seem to come from people who do not get it or who are movie snobs. <br /> <br /> He will probably play for a week in the selected markets. Keep an eye on the DVD, it will be worth the rental and I will eventually have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> Good job Mike Judge, it's a shame that you got fooled, but you made me laugh and I can not wait to see your next movie.
