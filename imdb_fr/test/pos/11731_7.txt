Sharky's Machine finds Burt Reynolds as a narcotics policeman who, after a failure of his buy-and-sell strategy, was not his fault, but some people died there, he finds himself demoted to the vice-brigade team from Atlanta. <br /> <br /> The prestige is hardly as good as the narcotic beats, but it has its marginal benefits. One night after a roundup of workers where one of their books falls into their hands, the guys ask Rachel Ward for surveillance. It is an expensive product, serving both the infamous gangster Vittorio Gassman and the lawmaker candidate Earl Holliman. <br /> <br /> Their surveillance however records a murder and the rest of the film is Sharky and his new vice colleagues who try to solve this case of prestige. <br /> <br /> Although this is a Burt Reynolds film and they have a bit of humor, the comedy is mastered while the film becomes as serious as Dirty Harry. This film would have been offered to Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> The good directors Bernie Casey and Brian Keith as well as Henry Silva, the fool brother of Gassman, perform well. of the organization and loves his work. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie, a mix of Dirty Harry and Laura. Why Laura? You will have to see Sharky's machine for this answer.
