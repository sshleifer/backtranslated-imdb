The original, the man who knew too much, won Alfred Hitchcock's first acclaim outside the UK. Of course, part of the reason for this acclaim was that people marveled at how Hitchcock, with such a lean budget, compared to lavish Hollywood products, was able to provide so much on the screen. The original film was shot in a studio. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he chose to redo all his films, Hitchcock, which enjoyed an international reputation, and behind which a large Hollywood studio (Paramount) decided to The man who in knew too much would be like with a sumptuous budget. It's shot on location in Marrakech and London and has two big international names for the box office. It was James Stewart's third on four Hitchcock films and his only association with Doris Day and his only Hitchcock film. <br /> <br /> I really wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance, it matched the profile of the tall blond ladies that Hitchcock favored. Maybe because his good screen image was in contradiction with the refinement that Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. <br /> <br /> Doris plays some of her best acting roles in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Her best scene is when her husband, Dr. James Stewart, gives him a sedative before announcing that their son was kidnapped by an English couple who treated them with friendship in Morocco. Stewart and Day play beautifully in this scene. But mostly because it records about four different emotions at a time. <br /> <br /> Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they meet Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the aforementioned English couple, Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back on a market square in Marrakech and murmurs some morbid words to Stewart about an assassination taking place at Albert Hall in London. Their child is abducted to ensure their silence. <br /> <br /> For the only time I can think of a hit song is out of a Hitchcock movie. In fact, Doris plays a famous singer who has retired from the scene to be his wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it very well when I was 9 years old. One could not go anywhere without hearing it in 1956, she even competed with Elvis Presley's rapid rise that year. Que Sera Sera won the Oscar for best song by defeating titles such as High Society's True Love and the title song Around the World in 80 Days. She has become the theme song of Doris Day for the rest of her life and should be if she ever wants to come back. <br /> <br /> In fact, the song fits quite well in the plot, as Doris sings at a party at the Embassy. at the highest point. <br /> <br /> Instead of mirroring it, Hitchcock filmed the assassination scene of the real Albert Hall and, as another critic has said, it's not realized, it's choreography. You will be suspended in your place at that time. <br /> <br /> This has been well done.
