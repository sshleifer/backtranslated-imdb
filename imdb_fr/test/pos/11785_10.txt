So funny is the perfect way to describe this parody of 12 minutes of the original Star Wars. Hardware Wars is incredibly funny. It is presented as the trailer for the epic Space Hardware Wars. The joke is this: imagine Star Wars played by bad actors and incredibly bad special effects. Among the characters are Fluke Starbucker, the "intergalactic prodigy", the "mercenary and intergalactic wise" salad bowl, Salad Ham, Darph Nader, "the wicked" and many other fantastic characters. It's impossible not to laugh watching this 12-minute treasure. It's stupid but it's fun. You'll laugh from beginning to end, and you'll feel the need to watch it again, and again, and again, and again ... And you'll laugh every time you'll see it !!! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. The funniest 12 minutes ever. You will believe that it lasted a minute!
