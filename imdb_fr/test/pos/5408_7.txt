Looking at "Imaginary Heroes", I thought that any screenwriter who tries to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing a child or two in the first part so that his characters open up and unveil themselves. There must be something in this plot, as it seems that all the family dramas that occur in the Spades use this device in one form or another ("Paradise" and "Moonlight Mile" are just two of the most recent examples I think, although we can go back to an old golden age like "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?" It's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious movies Far from it, it's just that, like any subject, it can be so overused that it only becomes a cliché of film, a shorthand narration to set the tone of the ball and give the characters a topic of battle for the rest of the time we spend with them. <br /> <br /> The latest book of this kind is "Imaginary Heroes", a film that borrows heavily from what is one of oldest examples and perhaps the best known of the "family facing the death of "a child", the "ordinary people" awarded at the Oscars. Like the characters in this previous film, the Travis seem at first sight to be the ideal suburban family, until the fateful day when their eldest son, Matt, the "golden boy" athlete and, hence, the potato his father's eye kills himself without explanation (a minor difference is that the son of "Ordinary People" dies as a result of an accident and not a suicide). Matt's younger brother, Tim, eventually finds the body and takes on the protagonist role in the film. Each of the remaining family members faces tragedy in their own way. Matt, who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, is moving away from the father who has practically ignored him all his life and is starting to turn to drugs for excess. Ben, the father, is engulfed by remorse and guilt, turning away from work and family. His wife, Sandy, is the most complex character in the film. He is a free-spirited child of the 1960s who feels strangely adrift in the role of mother and wife as she undergoes a loveless marriage in a barren suburb. After the tragedy, she spends most of her time trying to reconnect with her past as a pot smoker. <br /> <br /> The writing and direction of Dan Harris makes "Imaginary Heroes" an extremely irregular film. For each scene that feels real and authentic, there is another that appears as arbitrary and unauthentic. One sometimes has the feeling that Harris would like to include in his scenario all possible situations of life, an admirable objective perhaps, but which makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic. Instead of identifying with the characters and being caught in their difficult situation, we often find ourselves saying, "Oh, come now, and after?" For adolescents, suicide is only the tip of the iceberg for the hot topics covered in this film; the scenario also deals with drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, gender identity conflict, life-threatening illness, and even inadvertent gay incest. It is this mentality in writing that deprives the film of much of the credibility it needs for us to truly care about ourselves. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that "Imaginary Heroes" is a bad movie or no reward. Much of what she says about 21st century family relationships and values ​​is insightful, original, sharp, and profound. The main merit of its success goes to the actors, Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who offer incisive and sensitive performances in their respective roles. They are the ones who triumph over narrative excesses to stimulate our brain and touch our hearts. Moreover, Harris, in his direction, achieves a truly melancholy tone, but is often completed by flashes of daring black comedy that are sorely needed. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary Heroes" may seem fuzzy and drifting at times, but its beautiful performances and subtle mood changes make it a must-see movie.
