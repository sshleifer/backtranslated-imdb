I work in a nuclear power station, so I enjoy these answers. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I do it. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station and you will see where I work. <br /> <br /> I could not think of a safer industry in which to work. The procedures require us to report minor events as well as paper clippings. Any problem identified as a potential problem for nuclear, radiological or industrial security is immediately reported in the corrective action process. <br /> <br /> In summary, nuclear power plants in the United States operate securely at the forefront of their minds.
