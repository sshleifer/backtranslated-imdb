Now I like Victor Herbert. And I like Mary Martin and Allan Jones. But it would have been nice to see a real biography of Victor Herbert. Walter Connolly as Herbert has a decent resemblance to him in his later years. <br /> <br /> Jones and Martin, however, sing beautifully. The Herbert music is just there to adorn the plot of the plot regarding these two musical performers. John Ramsay Jones is a fragile character, very similar to Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat, Jones also played. <br /> <br /> As for Mary Martin, the reason she has never had a great career in Hollywood is. She made movies with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell as well as this one. She played well, but moviegoers did not take it. The best musical moment of the film is Jones and Martin in a duet of Thine Alone. The recordings of this song are individual and have been written in duet. There is also a nice scene with Jones and Martin riding a bicycle exchanging Herbert's songs. <br /> <br /> The real Victor Herbert with his Irish patriotic career and musical training in Germany where he developed a love for all things in German would have been a fascinating study. He was also a cello virtuoso before devoting himself to full-time composition. I must take the strong exception to the criticism that said Cuddles Sakall would have been a good Victor Herbert. Sakall as Irish, HELLO. <br /> <br /> Nice movie, but the real Vic would have been so much better.
