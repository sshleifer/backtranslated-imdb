I watched this film during a screening of the OutFest in Los Angeles in July 2006. It's rough on the edges (sound recording in particular is staggering) and often very funny. The screenplay is rather episodic and ends abruptly, but Ash Christian brings a lot of heart to the film. Having a gay movie that does not feature underwear models obsessed with the party and hunting heterosexuals is also a refreshing change of pace. Accessories for Jonathan Caouette, a compassionate sympathizer, in the role of Mr. Cox, a close friend of Rodney (Ash Christian), Ashley Finke, lively and dynamic, as best friend of Rodney and Deborah Theaker as mother of Rodney, to whom the best script and he steals every scene. The film is like his screenwriter / director / star? Lumpy and a bit strange, but also very sweet.
