I've been a big fan of Errol Morris since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard that he saved a life. To this day, this film is his best work. <br /> <br /> The plot is a mixture of Stephen Hawking's book of the same title, closely related to the life of man. The story is told through interviews with family, friends and Hawkings himself. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled; This sounds totally boring, but the whole thing is dynamic and inspiring. The mixture of life and theories is homogeneous and completely entertaining. I was particularly touched to see how much they humanize this genius and this omniscient man. Although physically helpless, Hawking's shear size and brilliance are summed up in a real human being that allows us to laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. Watch it and enjoy it. And if the studio that owns this image reads this, a 15-year anniversary edition would be perfect NOW ...
