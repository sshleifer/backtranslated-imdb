A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on Broadway, which means she should leave the small theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a bar in the neighborhood where they buy oysters to find a pearl (they never eat them). The story offers many opportunities for singing and dancing. The film has two questions that Rusty must answer: is glory all that is blamed on him? and is it really less if you are happy? Answering these questions makes the movie. The film also showcases the talents of the three directors. Never a boring moment!
