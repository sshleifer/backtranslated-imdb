These are the kinds of films that I liked and that I still love to grow. Unlike big-budget movies that create huge holes of intrigue and never recognize them. This movie sums it all up and does something you can sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> A film student complained earlier that it was not a list topic. But that's not the subject. The goal of this movie is that not everyone likes huge movies filled with CGI Clich√©. Many people like movies to entertain you and not to make as much money as they can. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is also good to know that this good old Bruce is not dead yet.
