This is a novelty in the Danish film. The atmosphere is not unlike that of Blinkende Lygter, also of Anders Thomas Jensen, but with an innovative twist. One difference is the reduced number of characters, which leaves a lot more room to occupy them. And what characters ?! Both butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is a deranged dominant parody, while Nikolaj Lie Kaas is an indifferent loser with a twin brother more or less imbecile.
