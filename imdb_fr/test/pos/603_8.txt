It's very interesting to watch this ... Half of the people involved are now dead ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's been a long time since I've seen anything Muppet relates, but things are pure gold. I'm a big fan of word games, and this movie has them well, but one of the amazing aspects of this film is its pace: it's not really a high-speed pace for kids, where filmmakers just decide to move the story without wanting to. Give the depth of the character, it's just a little movement with the characters where they want to go. <br /> <br /> Kermit the frog is just a great character. His voice and the expressions on his puppet face are fantastic. But most of all, he explains why he's popular - "he can also sing and make jokes!" - but more specifically why he is so endearing - it effortlessly encourages everyone to seek his dreams. In the meantime, he must also take charge, which is an unusual theme in family films. <br /> <br /> It also contains a whole set of comedians making appearances here and there, some with great effect, others with a little less (I think Mel Brook's part was just a little exaggerated , is not it?). Some parts of the movie are rather weird. But she has a lot of imagination and is heading to the same destination from a very different angle. <br /> <br /> Continuing to follow ... <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
