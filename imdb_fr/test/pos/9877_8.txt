Halloween 666 (1995) Producer review! <br /> <br /> Halloween 666 begins with a recap of the horrible end of the fifth part. If you thought the last chapter was dark, this one would really surprise you. A mysterious "Man in Black" raided the Haddonfield Police Station, releasing Micheal Myers. During the process, poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. What do they want with her? Who knows, but let's just say that his long suffering will end soon. Dr. Loomis spends his last years trying to prevent Michael Myers from killing other innocent people (good luck). A friend of Loomis, Dr. Wynn returns after a break of four suites to help the good doctor. Another old star face of the first part too. <br /> <br /> This dark and sad sequel was dismantled during post-production editing. For some reason, distributors felt that the end product was not worth the time of an average horror movie watcher. So they decide to make him dumb. Then, after placing the film on the set for several months, he laid an egg at the box office. No matter what they did with the movie, they made things worse. They should have stayed quite alone. Hey, the production company knows better than the filmmakers now ... no? <br /> <br /> Producer editing: highly recommended <br /> <br /> Published version: not recommended
