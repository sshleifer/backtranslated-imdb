It started off strangely, the middle was weird and the end was weird, but I really, really liked it. A modern version of Odyessy by Homer, but it does not matter. Interesting story and casting Clooney has been great and I commend him for his untold role - so different from what he did or will do again. A lot of surprise stars - why is not Holly Hunter more present? Do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected movie.
