Many people love these type 80 movies, but these people may not have grown up during this period. I had just started my studies when this movie was released so that I could really appreciate it at that time. My friends and I are still joking about some lines of the movie. Even though I liked Sean Penn's character, Jeff Spicoli, in "Fast Times", I appreciate Chris Penn's character "Tommy" because he's the main character with more than just a roll of talking paper opposed to a series of liners like that with Spicoli. Chris Penn should probably insert this film into his VCR and use it to motivate him to lose weight. Yes, the subplot with the character of Randy Quaid, veterinarian in Vietnam seems a little out of place, but he does a convincing job in the role. If there is someone who has not seen this movie but who liked other movies of the same type as "Fast Times", etc. I highly recommend it.
