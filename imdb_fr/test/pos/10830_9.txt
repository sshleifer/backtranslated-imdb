In Paris, a few months before the Nazi invasion, the manipulating actress Viviane Denvers (Isabelle Adjani) uses her former love Frederic Auger (Grégori Derangere) to hide the body of a man she killed. Frederic hits the car, the dead man is found and he is sent to prison. When the Germans invade France, Frédéric escapes with another prisoner, Raoul (Yvan Attal), and they become friends. In the flight to Bordeaux, they meet in the train Camille (Virginie Ledoyen), the young assistant of the physicist Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehlé), who tries to leave France with his research on heavy water. Once in Bordeaux, the group meets Viviane with his new lover, the Minister of State Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gerard Depardieu), and is pursued by a German spy, the journalist Alex Winckler (Peter Coyote), while Paris is in fall and the population is confused. <br /> <br /> What a beautiful and beautiful romantic adventure is "Bon Voyage"! The excellent and complex scenario contains action, romance, war, comedy, espionage, drama and many characters, interpreted by a fantastic cast, or even a constellation of stars; the direction is magnificent; the score is beautiful. I really loved this wonderful movie and I have to finish my review because of the limited number of adjectives to describe such a jewel. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem do Coração" ("Journey of the heart")
