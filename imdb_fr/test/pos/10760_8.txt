Opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (a tribal custom game photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator Finn Earl, showing why this South American tribe of Ishkanani is so ferocious), the direction of the film is nebulous: we are watching black comedy about the comparison of life in the streets of New York with uncivilized peoples, or is it a movie with a message of a more serious intention? But as history develops, this dividing line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes more and more clear. The way Griffin Dunne directed Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a little negligent at times, as it moves away from the development of rational plot, but in the end, the final impact is quite strong to fill the holes he created. <br /> <br /> Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives in New York with his masseuse and sexeuse obsessed with coke, Liz (Diane Lane), waiting for the summer when he has to join his father anthropologist during a field trip to South America (a father he knows only through letters and videos), when a drug crisis suddenly changed their lives: Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland ), a rich client of Liz, rescues the torn family and transfers her to her ten-acre estate, the pinnacle of wealth and power. In exchange for being Osborne's private masseuse, Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with her "very rich" daughter, Osbornes - her daughter, Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins), and her grandchildren, Bryce (Chris Evans ) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his doctor lead Liz on the path that dries up and links Finn to Osborne and his grandchildren. Despite the disparity between poor and rich, the living situation works for a while. Incidents occur to alter the feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant, which is a turning point for Finn's film and point of view on the Osborne family. Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they manage to discover the truth about his troubling incident - as well as the ferocious illness of the rich class. <br /> <br /> The film uses many clips of tribal activities during the film, establishing disturbing parallels for some of the most difficult scenes. For this viewer, it works well, but when the director chooses to place tribal people in ceremonial dress in the context of Osborne's domain, the concept seems artificial, as if the audience were to be forced to "get it". The various secondary intrigues between maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn and the introduction of the late obese chalk artist Whitney (Branden Williams) reinforce the credibility of the distinction between the rich and the "lower class" but the performances of Sutherland, Lane and Yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the failures of the film. It's not a good movie, but it contains a lot of laudable ideas on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction. Grady Harp
