It was one of my favorite shows as a kid. Everything was there: music, stories, talking squirrels and chuck daisies. I wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing. I'm 35 years old and I grew up in the south of Jersey, but we have three New York chains with our connection cable, and I think it was on channel 11. They're just doing these shows I look very old) and I think I grew up with only 9 channels on our TV, but I could always find something cool to watch. I only spoke to another person who heard about this program and watched it. She is three years younger than me and she grew up in North Jersey. I would love to see this series on DVD so I can show it to my 5 year old daughter and she could see the idiotic (but excellent) stuff her mom was watching! I just found a VHS tape of a few episodes and a music CD of the show on eBay, and I bought them directly, even if they were a bit expensive. I can not wait to revive these wonderful memories!
