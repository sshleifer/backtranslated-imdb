I have just come back to see this awesome movie !! I can understand that so much ... It reminded me when my sister had to go to college, we had to go from one place to another and my mother behaved like Adele August! Boys may not like this crying movie. One of the best real life movies I have ever seen !! and Natalie Portman reigns !! 10/10
