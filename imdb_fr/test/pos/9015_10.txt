I had the privilege of attending a regional premiere for this. It's one of the funniest British movies of all time. The plot is fantastic. It focuses on a girl who involuntarily changes into an ideal man at a computer fair while creating the film is full of jokes, both visual and auditory, and gives an impression of freshness and freshness, and the game of actors is of high quality, released in the UK on July 2nd. must, go see it !!!
