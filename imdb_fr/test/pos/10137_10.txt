EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING, Jr. Should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie !!! He was the movie! Although the film is lacking in some areas, Cuba was great ... and for me, it's the best role he has ever played! The scene in the film where he discovers that his mother is dead made me creak and cry IN THE THEATER !! I guess I could really understand this film because I saw the same treatment as people like that in my own school growing up ... what a tragedy! Learning to see the "real" radio and the coach at the end of the film was also very special! If you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears, you need a heart check! If you like "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you'll also like "Radio"! I wish they would make more movies like this ... Radio is the real deal!
