Turner and his friends are getting closer to HBO for first place among movie producers designed for television. It is a contemplative thriller with a pleasant rhythm. William Macy is stellar, as always, and Adam Arkin offers one of his best performances. A little more alive than the classic Hitchcock but not as opposite as the typical movies of this type, A Slight Case of Murder makes your life easier and never loose. (Note: I've seen a preview, which means that I did not have to wait for the commercials.) These interruptions can hurt the rhythm, but you know it will be available on video from time to time.
