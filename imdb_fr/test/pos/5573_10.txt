Since J. Michael Straczynski's Babylon 5, a television show has not captured the wonderful art of applying a narrative arc to a television show. It's easily the best thing on TV right now! The characters are friendly and can be easily attached and take care of their well-being. The villians are the type you like to hate and let you ask what they will do next. And Brian Hensen's puppetry is the most innovative. Congratulations to Rockne S. O'Bannon for a job well done!
