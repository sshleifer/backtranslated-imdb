I was a little worried about actors and acting in Italy, then "Conseguenze dell'amore" and Toni Servillo came. It had been a long time since I saw such a charismatic actor on screen. Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years. The film is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will remain long behind you after the film's vision. Toni, continue to play in movies, you are certainly the coolest actor of the moment (and not only in Italy, his performance deserves an international acclaim). I note this film 9/10.
