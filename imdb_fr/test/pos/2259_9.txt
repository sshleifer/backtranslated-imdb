I saw that last night and I voted "8". Since then, he pushed me and I would give him a "9". <br /> <br /> The film has (initially) a facade apparently slightly disconnected between the first and the second half. The first half is a comedy and there are few traces of the tattered truths of times, life, wars, religious intolerance that will be revealed in the second half. At first, it may seem a little disconcerting because it's a slightly unknown narrative sequence, but on reflection it works. <br /> <br /> The acting was good (Hultz in the role of Alex, the performer, was particularly good). <br /> <br /> I went through most of the other "User Comments" and found that some readers of the book are happy with the movie, while others are not. Of course, both feelings are valid. <br /> <br /> For me, retired family therapist and believer from around the world, the film was relevant on two levels. <br /> <br /> The first, as a story, strongly reminded me of how polarizations commonly occur - by demonizing and trying to exterminate one who possesses a system of moral values slightly different from ours. <br /> <br /> The second revealed that the demonstration of the first one also revealed something common to EVERYONE of us, ALL our families - that each of us had to go back to his roots to better understand himself. TS Eliot expressed this exquisitely in the 4th of his "Four Quartets" saying: - "We will not stop exploring // And the end of all our explorations // Will be happening to the place where we started // and know the place for the first time. " <br /> <br /> Jonathan embarks on a fulfilling journey that each of us would find fantastically enlightening: exploring and discovering our roots; what were these people going through, who were they - really! - before, when and during the first years before and after our birth? Etc. <br /> <br /> The film first gives us an impression of comedy, then moves to give us a lesson in history and human shortcomings, but through all this, it also gives us - subliminally - a message about each one of us. Each of us would be well rewarded for going back and understanding the place from which we started.
