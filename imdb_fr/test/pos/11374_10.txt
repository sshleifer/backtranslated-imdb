Boogie Nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster movies (though it does not fit into this genre): the rise and fall. We are witnessing the rise of many individuals, some of whom have gone from total darkness to the attainment of great heights ... then grace because of their excesses. <br /> <br /> I think this is the first feature film by writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it's a good start! I've seen influences from other filmmakers, such as Robert Altman, but the film has its originality and intrigue development. <br /> <br /> Character development is the best feature of the movie. I really identified with all the characters and felt their pain and success with them. All the performances were brilliant. (It was particularly nice to see a small part played by veteran pornography, Nina Hartley). <br /> <br /> Basically, this film combines comedy and tragedy, making it one of the best films of 1997. Was snubbed at the Oscars (probably because of the "racy material" - as one says - the subject, and the general conservatism of the Academy.
