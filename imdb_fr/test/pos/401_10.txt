The kind of "little" movie in which the studios excelled but did not shoot anymore. A kind of "soul" version of the most famous "The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells". Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and soul music enthusiast. He is obsessed with bringing together members of a classic soul group. The film follows his exploits as well as those of his members. a cast that includes authentic musical talents such as Isaac Hayes, as well as the pillars of the Taurean Blacque Theater, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. It's not an epic, it's still a piece of solid gold.
