If you have not seen it, look for it. It is available on DVD. This is a production of channel 4 (uk), possibly in conjunction with German and Danish television. If you've seen the movie, it's basically the same plot. Several interlaced stories are linked by the drug trade. The story is between the housewife (interpreted by the excellent Lyndsay Duncan) who tries to make a deal on behalf of her husband, who, to his surprise, is an international drug dealer (and a generally dangerous man). <br /> <br /> A The minister, who is rooted in his work to the detriment of his family, is investigating the whole problem of international drug trafficking. He discovers a little more the reality of the heroine when her daughter turns out to have a "problem". He then goes to Pakistan, officially, where he seems to have learned that abuse (not just drugs or occasional use) is the problem and that he must also taste certain products (an excellent scene where he achieves what attractiveness is and why it is and why it is such a problem). In Pakistan we see the other side. The desperation of farmers who can barely survive turning to opium production and crime lords. Unnecessary subsidy attempts resulting in the enrichment of the system. And a country so drunk in drugs but only a fraction of the abuse we have in the West. Around all this, a customs officer / interpol agent tries to seize the "Dutch" link in the smuggling of heroin. Seeking justice for his murdered partner. It's really a masterpiece. Superb and unobtrusive performances by all major players, as only European cinema can do. <br /> <br /> Must see. Especially if you have seen the film, they complement each other and present slightly different opinions / attitudes on both sides of the pond.
