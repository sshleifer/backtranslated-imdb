Excellent movie starring Anthony Wong at the height of his title. An erotic reverie, but more and more violent, dreams bought from a crazy occultist who quickly turn into nightmares of a scale that the wizard introduced himself to manipulate the poor Mr. Wong. Well filmed and very fast, this film constantly tells stories of serious magic, medicinal plants, power and corruption, but also leaves time for beautiful scenes of sex and violence very bloody. There is also just a touch of humor from time to time to catch you even more off guard and the whole thing makes it a thrilling experience of about 90 minutes. Excellent performance throughout.
