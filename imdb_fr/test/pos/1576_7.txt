I just finished this incredibly crazy case and although I can not say it was as good as I said, it was always in my mind that it was still an effective and sometimes quite nasty piece of deformed brain and powered by misogyny. Her story tells the story of a poor girl looking for her sister who ends up being raped and drugged by Yakuza idiots, and by the kind doctor who undertakes to avenge her, doing it in a bizarre and horrible way after a similar rape. Oh yes, and there is a bit of direct sexuality in there too, unfortunately, everything is sweet, as the Japanese disapproval below the nudity of the belt, but the pixelation is minimal, actually only noticeable in a hilarious pipe scene. Although writer / director Kazuo "Gaira" Komizu fails to create a particularly compelling story, it is at least rather crazy. To dive early in the pit of filth with a pretty disturbing rape (aggravated by the fact that the girl looks pretty young, although I'm pretty sure she was old). In addition, for the most part, these are rather professional things, perhaps not elegant, but they have a certain flair and the content is relatively well managed, with particular congratulations for having largely avoided using a lot of pixelations. Things are mostly based on sex and rape for about two-thirds of the race, and it's nice to see if we love this kind of fare, it gets a little numb after a while, but the ladies are soft to the eyes and hard enough sometimes. YÃ´ichi Takahashi's music is sometimes effective, although it is not a key part of the show she produces in a few places complementary to the action, at least enough for me to notice. The most important effects are those of Nobuaki Koga, who attract the impression of making a sensation when they appear, helped by the whimsical nature of culminating shenanigans. Things even end at an end that curiously affects, of course it's not a weeper or anything, but for a film so flat that most of the time, its depth is poignant enough. All in all, this is an entertaining entertainment for junk food fans, especially those who love the adventures of Japanese rapey. I really could have done with a longer and more gory revenge section, maybe also more pointed / brains, but hey, it kept me from watching and it's pretty well stocked with memorable wtf moments. So, if you dig up this kind of degenerate junk food, which is probably worth it, maybe do not expect the second coming.
