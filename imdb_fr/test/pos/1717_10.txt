If you're a long-time fan of the Doctor and you're scared to hear that they're performing another series, be quiet, that largely meets the high expectations of the original. Stimulation is much faster than original programs, more often in episodes of 50 minutes rather than an average of 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the actors play superb. The hardest thing - and the best - to get used to is the production values ​​of the new series. Compared to the original, he has some now. (Although I will always have fond memories of bubble monsters and puppets in hand.) If you are not a fan, or if you have tried the original and can not control yourself, jump in now! All you really need to know about the doctor, they will tell you as and when. This series was written with minimal references to the Doctor's enormous story in order to encourage new viewers. Admittedly, I see only the first new series as it is broadcast on the Sci-Fi channel (in other words, it is probably cut into ribbons for reasons of time), but I can not wait to see the next episodes, either on television or on television. on DVD. (July 4th can not come soon enough!)
