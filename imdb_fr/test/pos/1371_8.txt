I think this film was made for the not so princely sum of £ 8000, but it does not really show. There is nothing amateur about the production or the acting, the characters are realistic and realistic and the location could have been any desert area of ​​the world instead of a not too hot beach just north of Aberdeen. The actors were quite easily acceptable as a group of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and unexplored planet. None of them seemed to be particularly friendly to each other but were willing to fight to stay alive and for their comrades. There was no good explanation about what was going on, which can be really artificial, so a lot of the plot was left to your imagination, much like The Big Empty, a movie I have also loved. I realized that most of the characters were listening to me warmly. There were perhaps fun moments, the men were so ordinary that you felt that you could understand them and the climax and the end of the movie were quite poignant. I think Mr. Stirton and his team should be pretty proud of themselves. I have seen some of the worst movies on a budget of millions of dollars.
