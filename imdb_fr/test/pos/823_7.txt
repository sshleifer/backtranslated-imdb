I like the shepherd! Of course, the acting was not good but the fight scenes were good. Van Damme kicks and kicks too. The story was average. A Texas cop fights smugglers. This film did everything a van Damme film should do, namely martial arts and action. Van Damme has never been a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes 2 last. If you're looking for an Oscar-winning performance, you will not get it here, but if you're looking for action and martial arts, then this movie is for you. Scott Adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the audience is tired of martial arts superstars, but his films in this movie are awesome. Van Damme delivers strong kicks and it is good to see him start playing martial arts again since he has not done it in his last 4 or 5 films. This movie is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of van Damme.
