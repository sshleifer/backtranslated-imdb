Romantic cliche drama with very simple scenario but very good cinematography and screenplay. The script, the staging and the realization were also good. Jones makes his character very memorable and adorable though. A deeper story could have really brought this film to a higher level but still, the film takes into account its genre. Only for the hopeless romantics, the big fans of history of love, the big soap opera fans, Cinemascope cinematography fans of the 50s and the fans of the main actors .....
