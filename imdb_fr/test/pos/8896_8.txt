Although I do not like to disagree with the original poster, I found Asterix and the Vikings pretty good, and a huge step in front of previous attempts to animate Gaul's favorite of all. <br /> <br /> For those who do not know the famous comic series, the show would be hard to follow, but for those of us who are aware, it's a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the animation is far superior to previous comic adaptations. You can tell they took the time and effort to really get back to the comics look this time around. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the film and I can see how fans Some of these titles may sound confusing or a bit disappointing, but I felt so much taking to see one of my favorite comics from my childhood faithfully represented on the screen. All my scruples were minor in comparison. Minor spoliators follow ... <br /> <br /> Asterix and his loyal friend Obelix head north to save the nephew of their village chief, who was captured by the Vikings. The Vikings think that the boy will teach them to fly, teaching them fear, thanks to the poorly formulated advice of their village druid. On the way, the boy meets the Abba girl of the Viking chief, who falls in love, etc. etc., etc. If my explanation seems complicated, do not worry. The plot is easy to follow! Definitely a good buy .. You can buy this DVD at Amazon France, but know that your DVD player will probably not be able to read it. I had to change the region setting on my computer to see it.
