In my analysis of "Three Colors: White", I wrote that his tone is much clearer than that of "Three Colors: Blue". I think it's the same with this movie. This time, it's not because of a tragic element of comedy, but much more because of the main character, Valentine. Although her boyfriend lives abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with lightness and optimism, but it seems to me that she could be Kieslowski's image for a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who lives a great loneliness. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are quite similar, the judge is just a lot older and has had a lot more disappointments. They share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn a lot from each other. Finally, I would like to insist on the performance of Irene Jacob, she ends the series of incredible feminine contributions to the trilogy of the "Three colors".
