Margaret Colin plays the lead role in this story; Looking at it, I remembered her role in Adrian Lynes' "Unfaithful" as a neighbor of Diane Lane in a tony neighborhood of New York. <br /> <br /> This film was surprisingly good and Diane Stillman deserves credit for her faithful portrait of the class, the crimes and the misdemeanors, which actually occur in the upscale neighborhoods (perish the thought !!!). It's real but not too dramatic; the public lives on his accident, the pain he has caused; denial; and the ultimate solution. <br /> <br /> It's more than the simple question of knowing what a good person is, as Colin tells her husband ... is the character of a person defined by a single act; and should they be condemned forever because of their action? The questions are relevant. It is also fun to see several film references to Martha Stewart (that is, the capricious and embarrassing mother); Colin is known by her friends from time to time as a "perfect hostess, with perfect genes" ... (gag); and a scene where Colin is confronted by the police (the "friends" also betray her later) .... <br /> <br /> The denial and the facades of the American society are approached; (Oh, murder does not happen here, similar to author Dominick Dunne's "Season in Purgatory" about the real murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of his crime. but consciously, it is perpetuating the facade, until it finally breaks down: rent or buy this film; it is an underrated actress who is doing pretty well in these roles.
