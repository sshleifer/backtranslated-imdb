I attended the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows that he can play in front of Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as a domineering mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Lady Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope this film will be picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This film not only deals with driving lessons, but also with life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between the desire to obey his dominant mother and his vicar father and the desire to live his life. It's an amazing film, from an extraordinary director who committed suicide and put it on the screen so everyone can see it and everyone who can do it should do it.
