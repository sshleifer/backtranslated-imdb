One can not help being impressed by the intelligence and the scale of this film, and by the disappointment by lost opportunities. <br /> <br /> I found the script excellent and the vocal talent of Edmund Purdom quite impressive. However, as an artifact of his day, the film suffers from too many Hollywood films, especially poor castings, too much lust in the sets and too many pretensions. Edmund Purdom (who embodies the main character) is so obviously clumsy with a physical game, I suspect he was mainly in Shakespearian theater before that. <br /> <br /> excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you present real egyptian egyptians!
