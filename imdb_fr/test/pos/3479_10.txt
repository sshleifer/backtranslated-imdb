This movie was amazing, extremely funny and moving. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have put together a fantastic movie that will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson made this film brilliant. Their game was excellent, there was this real feeling of life between them, which made you really believe that it was the characters they were playing. Romola Garai is incredibly gorgeous and brilliant in her role. The story of these two people with reduced mobility and their entourage is well over, and you really start to know and feel the characters as the film moves forward, it was particularly upsetting at the end. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a film that is really sensitive to the heart, warning the viewer to be more sensitive than you have the fabrics you will need. <br /> <br /> Another amazing movie !!
