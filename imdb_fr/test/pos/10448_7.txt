Ahhh ... the 80s. 1982 reminds me of the really crazy time we were facing in America. Just out of the 70s "Do What Feels Good", "The Last American Virgin" comes in the form of a wolf disguised as a sheep costume, another "teenage sex comedy" of glorious times. Oh, of course, there's sex, but, I can not think of another movie - OK, this and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" - it did not really waste time between topless teen scenes - there were some very good things here among the cleavage. <br /> <br /> The film follows three hormonal friends. Gary (wanting to lose his virginity), Rick (incarnated stallion) and David (overweight, but not inexperienced) as they strive desperately to make sure Gary enters the men's world. But, a funny thing happens on the way of the kegger - Gary falls in love with Karen (pretty brunette who likes bad boys) and does not seem to be able to follow a sexual conquest that David and Rick can facilitate. The only problem is that Rick and Karen get very hot and Karen skips a period. It is Gary who is with her when she is going to have an abortion and it is Gary who really cares. But who does Karen dance with before the movie ends ... Rick. Subtract the "R" and add a "D" if necessary. <br /> <br /> What sets this movie apart from the other 80s we think is that, god, they're trying a real drama here, not the "my parents just shoot in the variety of the aisle. " And you know what? I bought it. <br /> <br /> It was not sloppy. It was not exaggerated. And when Gary saw Rick dancing with Karen at the party at the end of the movie, I actually felt sorry for the guy. Our teenager Romeo truly believed in unrequited love - and when his heart was broken in the end, it touched me in some way. <br /> <br /> So, apart from all T & A, there is a really credible and engaging story here. Oscar worthy? Not a mile away, but I do not know if I'd put it in the "we're going to get laid" category either. Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", they were actually trying to make a real movie here, letting the hi-Jinx fall between the two.
