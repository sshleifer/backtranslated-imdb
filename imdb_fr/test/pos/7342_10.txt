Whatever you do, do not stop watching when you think the movie is over! Hang out for the first batch of credits or you will really miss something! We saw this movie at the Savanaah festival and thought it was the best of the band. Dreya Weber is truly a marvel, not only because of her performances, but also because she can get by at such an altitude. During the question period, she said that there were no wires or effects, so all you see is that she is doing it. Addie could not go to the festival because she was dancing with Madonna. She was excellent and my beauty was so beautiful. I was amazed to see that the movie went so well with the crowd of blue-haired women, but now, Savannnah is not a backwater.
