After the release of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)", Walt Disney Productions continued to produce a quality animated feature film for children, which I still have not had the pleasure of seeing. "The AristoCats (1970)", directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, is the twentieth film of Disney's official canon. This is a romantic musical that revolves around a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris in 1910. In the mansion of old Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (voiced by Hermione Baddeley), her feline pet loved it ?? including the Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens ?? are the most important residents. When Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), the scruffy butler, learns that cats will inherit all the wealth of the old lady, he begins to get rid of pets and throw them in the countryside, far from the big city. Lost and confused, the duchess and her children meet an alley cat who speaks very well, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them the way home. <br /> In terms of animation, "The AristoCats" is nothing particularly remarkable, with much older Disney movies such as "Snow White ??" and 'Fantasia (1940)', demonstrating a visual style similar or even superior. However, the story is interesting and exciting ?? especially for young audiences, I bet ?? and the music numbers (which I wish they are more numerous) are fantastic. For the sake of trivia, I will name my two favorite songs "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody Wanna Be a Cat", the latter being a psychedelic comeback in the late '60s, with a swing jazz and color band flashy delirious, led by a fashionable feline called the Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The family's return trip to Paris is eventful and adventurous. We meet such friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble {two talkative geese}, uncle Waldo {the drunken parent} of the couple, Georges Hautecourt {the old but cheerful advocate of Madame Bonfamille} and Napoleon and Lafayette {two dogs hunting idiots who are thirsty for butler rump}.
