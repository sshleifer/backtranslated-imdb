Forever Strong is a type of movie that we have seen before, but in different types of genres. However, having said that, I really thought it was an excellent movie. Sean Faris shows the kind of potential that usually allows actors to access celebrity. Apparently, this movie had a limited release because I was not even aware of it, but I saw it in the video store and decided to try my luck after watching it play with Sean's performance in Never Back Down. I finally made a good decision, I'm not a rugby fan, but the film does not really deal with rugby, it's about taking a stand in your life, challenging yourself, reaching your goals , over there. is much more than the simple plot suggests. At first, we do not care what happens to Rick, he has a mouth full of voices and is completely arrogant. We think he has completely sealed his fate as a troublemaker. On the way, we see the changes in his character, he starts hanging out with better people, he improves, we learn the negative impact of his father on his life, it's just a big gap and the film did a great job to turn Rick from an insolent conch into a good person. <br /> <br /> The rugby action itself is not so bad at all, unlike what I played and saw in high school, it was actually quite fun. watch and beautifully choreographed. A superb young production combined with a veteran experience has helped this film immensely. He simply did a fabulous job of avoiding what could have been a routine of this kind to a poignant and effective drama. I also liked the conflictual contrast between The Coach | Garry Cole | and Rick | Sean Faris |, the scenario was very interesting and I liked to see him help Rick during his career. It was both moving and comforting. It's a real hidden gem that I'm really happy to have discovered that it made me think about my life and, often, I need something like that. <br /> <br /> The performances. Sean Faris is outstanding as Rick Penning. He reminded me a lot of a young Tom Cruise daring but very charismatic and talented. It was a difficult role to pass from a teenager to a young man with a big heart, but Sean escaped with perfect perfection. He clearly put his heart and soul into this film, a big congratulations to Sean for putting so much effort into this great film. Gary Cole is excellent as a pragmatic but friendly coach who wants to help children. I always found him friendly, he always has a kind of presence that he wears to his films. Neal McDonough is fantastic as a selfish but under pressure father of Rick. For the majority of the film, the script suggests that he is nothing more than a bitter, selfish man who wants Rick to be exactly like him, but in the end, you start to see the truth come out, I'm felt sorry for him bit. Julie Warner is a good actress and she embodies the good-hearted but ignorant mother. Penn Badgley is asked to play the role of a real idiot, and he always does it well. On several occasions, I wanted to make one, so I must say that it is an excellent performance. Arielle Kebbel is the interest of love, she did well. Nathan West plays a character a little mysterious, he did very well. Sean Astin is considered a major actor of the film, but he barely does anything, he did well what he had to do. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Forever Strong is a good film that feels good, it will make you stop definitely and think about how your life was better than you thought. Do not let this one escape you, you will not regret it. <br /> <br /> 8/01/10
