Fantastic movie! One of the best film noir films ever made. Bad guys, bad girls, a jewel, a twisted morality, an abduction, everything is there. Jean Servais has a face that would be Bogart's pride and the rest of the cast is filled with actors of characters who seem to know they have something good. Get some popcorn and have a good time.
