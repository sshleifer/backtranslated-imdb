First of all, I think this film is much more appreciated by the viewers who read Joseph Conrad's book "Heart Of Darkness", the book that formed the literary base of the film. That said, I think this film is stunning. It is an excellent war movie that does not focus so much on the coolness and brutality of the Vietnamese conflict as on the psychological weight it has caused to the young, inexperienced "children" who have been sent to fight it. Coppola has shown a true cinematic genius by using many visuals to help tell the story. The game I felt was really up to par. Marlon Brando's role in the film is what really made me play. His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film challenges you and reveals the hollow of a man you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the film. Those who view this film as another war movie should give a detailed overview of all the literary elements related to this film, because there is a lot of meaning behind all this. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculpted and best-made films of all time.
