*** May Contain Spoilers *** OK, it was not really as good as expected. In fact, it was very different from what I thought, but the film still turned out to be a very good movie. <br /> <br /> I do not usually care too much about this type of music, but in this film it worked perfectly (I mean, he's a rock star), but I liked Stuart Townsend in this movie, and Aaliyah, although she had a little part in the movie was amazing. <br /> <br /> And even if Tom Cruise played Lestat in the interview with a vampire, I must admit that I'm glad he refused the role, even though I normally hate when they use Different people can play the same characters in suites and stuff. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was excellent and I enjoyed watching it, although some parts could have been better. Great vampire movie.
