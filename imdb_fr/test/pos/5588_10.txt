This may not be considered a film review, but as a commentary on a movie I saw when I was young. I remember my return from an evening filled with wonder at what I had seen. I tried to tell part of my parents' story, but they listened without understanding what was so strange about two children stranded on an island who fall in love and grow up together and have a son. As you may have guessed, I refer to The Blue Lagoon (1949), which has left me bewitched and disoriented over the years (almost 50 years) and now asks me, with anxiety and disgust, who or what prevented the release of the film. in cassette or DVD or whatever. I have spent all my life chasing the opportunity to get one and nobody knows it. What a mess indeed! Sorry if my English is neither technical nor scientific, but my mother tongue is Spanish. I do my best to make myself understood. Thank you, my name is Juan and I write in Uruguay in South America.
