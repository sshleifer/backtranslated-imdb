This movie was amazing. Never before have I seen such a film that brought me to the harsh reality of drug use, just like this one. There is no glamorous, sweet or glorifying heroine. This film shows the real struggles, pain and loss experienced by people who use this drug. Good movie, decent and emotional actor, and beautiful plot. A good watch! <br /> <br />
