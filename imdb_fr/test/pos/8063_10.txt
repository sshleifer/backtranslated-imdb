Over the years, I have been very interested in the life of this teenager who has left a mark as deep and indelible in the world. My fascination is also born of fear, because it could happen again. <br /> <br /> And throughout the years to come, yes, I'm afraid this will happen around us and of course that goes well before Anne. The "it" is, of course, a so-called civilized society can turn alone or to an innocent country / race / continent and kill cold-blooded citizens on the slightest excuse? I leave that question there. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the documentary, there is a statement about the leader Adolf Hitler, that the only profound fact about Hitler that was never mentioned is that he was democratically elected and all of them atrocities were committed as a result of docile propaganda on the poodle and repeated alarmist propaganda for a docile population. <br /> <br /> One of the atrocities was Anne Frank, who put a face on the death camps by the miracle of the survival of his diary. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Brannagh does a great job in commenting and interviewing, he has this rare gift of minimizing his own character allowing subjects to speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Many new facts and people never interviewed before are unearthed in this meticulous search, which I will not discuss here, because they add a lot to the reality and the sadness of the film. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close reads the newspaper choices and her voice is perfect for the role, she brings naivety and freshness to the role. <br /> <br /> Anne's friends from early childhood are interviewed at length and her last days before her death are well recorded and witnessed with her. evil personality. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. A wonderful and respectful film about Anne, rarely seen. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
