So first of all ... <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is a much better film and very different from the code of Da Vinci. <br /> <br /> After the recent multitude of comics, remakes and questionable resurrections of older franchises. it's refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film, devoid of shaky camera shooting techniques, excessive lighting, excessive GCI, and exceptional action sequences. <br /> <br /> In this respect, Angels and Demons feels almost out of date He proposes a serious and thoughtful debate on the secular subject of religion and science, offers a glimpse of parallels between the great houses of God in Rome (magnificently photographed by the way) and the temple of modern science which is the great facility of hadron collider. <br /> <br /> Hanks claims to be the clever guy and he fits much better into the role he plays for the second time than his interpretation of Da Vinci. strong support is provided by a rock-solid cast, with Armin Mueller-Stahl's stoical cardinal as strong point. but the main saving advantage of the film is its pace. For the duration of the film, I was totally absorbed in the story and the film never really gave me the time to sit down and identify its flaws in logic. <br /> <br /> My only serious criticism is that part of the science described is at best debatable about the authenticity of the real world. But this is not the fault of the filmmakers, it is rather an observation of the old saying that we must never let the truth interfere with a good story. <br /> <br /> Say that this story is a cracker, a mix of adventure and race against the clock with a good dose of intelligence and a nice touch on the course. <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend it to fans of one of the national treasure films (which clearly imitate but with a much more serious atmosphere) and fans of adventure story tears in general .
