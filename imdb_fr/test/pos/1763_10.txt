Could it be one of the first color films? This is actually the second. This is a very beautiful film produced by Thomas Edison. It was one of his many films. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most beautiful film by Thomas Edison. He shows a girl dancing and moving her dress around, which turns red with the film. It's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> You look at the story by looking at this. You look at what started making awesome movies of the day! It may not be intriguing or interesting, but it's the second color film of all time. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, especially if you teach your students how to film or something, you have to show them what started the color films!
