This film was on the edge of raw humor ... I absolutely can not believe that these people can get away with it. Johnny Knoxville did not cross the line ... he was trampling on it! It was better than the first ... ALL HOT! What I found on the first film is that the shenanigans were a bit like it was on TV. show. NOT THIS TIME!!! they completely made a 180-degree turnaround ... the whole cast is so remarkable in what they do and the stunts were not crazy ... but the music basically adapts to all situations ... GOOD JOB !!!! When you go to see this, make sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater, maintain a strong stomach and remember not to let your drink spill through your nose ....
