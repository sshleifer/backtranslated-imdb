Chris Morris's TV series Brass Eye has consistently generated a large number of complaints from both the public and the participants. But nothing he did managed to stir up more controversy than that. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the overdue arrival of the opera Jerry Springer, the Brass Eye Special held the record for the highest number of complaints received about a television show ever aired. <br /> <br /> The huge amount of complaints by the general public against Brass Eye Special was incredible! Many complaints have been voiced by people who have never even watched the show! The subject dealt with by the program turned a lot of heads, but the message was widely misunderstood. The message was lost even for those who enjoyed the program. It was not a show that mocked the subject of pedophilia. The show focused solely on the media and its presentation of the subject. Morris is and will always be a satirist of the media. The idea that the program "mocks" pedophiles and child victims of violence is completely laughable! Morris never tries to do anything. It simply draws our attention to the overwhelming and often stupid hype surrounding the subject. <br /> <br /> Using many of his well-known characters such as "Brass Eye", such as Ted Maul and others, Morris shows how much of the media blows everything on a subject they have themselves created and constructed, and the result is as funny, if not funnier, than anything Morris has done before. Using his proven formula, Morris manages to make credulous celebrities believe that they are working on a serious documentary. In reality, they are designed to look exactly like what they are. Delays. <br /> <br /> In total, you have to see the Brass Eye Special to believe it. In a single opening line, Morris summarizes the entire media situation of 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
