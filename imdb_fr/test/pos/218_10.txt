I remember first the frenzy of the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams at the time at Comedy Central. At that time (the 90s), their programming consisted of rebroadcasts of Benny Hill and original MST3k, with a bearded host. <br /> <br /> Capt. Frank Drebin (portrayed by stone-skinned buccaneer Lelie Nielson) is a process created by the fusion of several stereotypical protagonists of a police television show (think Dragnet meets Starsky and Hutch the Show ) TV broadcasts and well-known police TV scenarios This is distilled, 3 times to produce the purest policeman each done Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now, keep it for later) Frank Drebin is most often ignorant, he's a terrible pilot, a terrible, machismo but sensitive and vulnerable shot, and he has a perfect command of the police investigation methodology (aka - ask Johnny the Old Leathery Shoe-Shine Boy). Do not make him a bad cop The cops are also lucky Capt Drebin (note that he's captain here) has perfected him With his companion Nordberg and the rest of the forces, parody the drama perfectly e police officer during six gold episodes. <br /> <br /> The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialogues and quotes between quotes. Most visual gags are a bit dated and stupid. Magic never came gags in plain sight, though. Basically, a conversation and absurd and frank activities in the foreground, with crazy things in the background. The movies can be described as 90-minute compilations of the best gags in this series. Think of Monty Python and now for something completely different ..... <br /> <br /> If you liked Airplane 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3 or Top Secret, then you will enjoy without any doubt that. <br /> <br /> I always liked the show better than the movies, even though I saw the movies first. Why? 2 words: No O.J.
