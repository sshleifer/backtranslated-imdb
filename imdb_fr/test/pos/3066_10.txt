Mel Brooks really outdid herself in this movie. No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic and a breakthrough in this style of comic film, but Men In Tights has become the pinnacle of his creative genius. This film is to see absolutely. If you like this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and History Of The World. The same goes in the opposite direction. If you've seen any of these movies, Men In Tights should be next on your list.
