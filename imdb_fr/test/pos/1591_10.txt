<br /> <br /> This film is a summary of Visconti's obsessions: the decadence of nobility, death, aesthetic research, homosexuality ... Everything mingles with melancholy mastery. A slow pace, just to allow you to contemplate all its beauty (whether in music and in pictures or in history), this is the type of movie we are no longer allowed to watch, brave, deeply personal and intelligent. The authentic fruit of a genius like Visconti.
