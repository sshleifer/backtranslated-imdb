I remember this film fondly on seeing it at the theater. I recently found a copy on VHS and she remembered it. Although it is obviously not a "big budget" film, the acting is quite credible and the sets, the places and the costumes are very well done. I only wish the Mammoths were more representative of the photo, but when you see them, they are also well done (remember, SFX was performed at that time without the benefit of computers, a poor devil had to really put everything which was stuffed tusks on real elephants!) ... the same effect was used on elephants in "Quest for Fire". A better-than-average adventure film and a chance for star, Rod Cameron, to play a role other than a cowboy, which he has also done very well over the years.
