Not only was this movie better than the last season of H: LOTS. But it was better than any TV movie I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Looking at the "Top 250", I see that only one small film was successful: How the Grinch stole Christmas. I think it's time to increase this group to 2. <br /> <br /> I admit that the original series had several series that were better than that, but that did not bother me. I just WANT to be able to re-enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad!
