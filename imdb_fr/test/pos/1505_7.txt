At the time of his death, in 1996, Lucio Fulci was one of Italy's most prolific directors. Yet his career has long since fallen into a downward spiral of increasingly futile genre entries, which could barely remain in the shadow of his previous work. For most of the 1970s until the mid-1980s, he created stylistically distinctive horrors such as "City of the Living Dead", "The Beyond" and the brutal giallo "The New York Ripper", whose fans remember with tenderness. myself. And while "Cat in the Brain" is part of Fulci's era of decline as a filmmaker, it's a shocking and hilarious head shot that, while a much lower job ( 'framing, effects and acting are below normal), interesting and open meditation on pop psychology and the ability to desensitize movies. Make no mistake: "Cat in the Brain" is a real gorefest, as disjointed as Fulci's previous films, but deserves credit for trying to be something more. Fulci plays himself delicately in the hollow of the cheek: a director filming another violent horror film that falls with perverse / murderous hallucinations; after visiting a psychiatrist who puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to cross, to the point that the viewer can no longer discern the two. The recent Grindhouse Releasing DVD mentions "Cat" as an apparent heir to "Eraserhead", and presents an equally disturbing and strangely amusing quality associated with the best surrealist art.
