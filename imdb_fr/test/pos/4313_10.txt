NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese black. This is about three employees who get angry at the moment their innocent drunks shave the nets of three other guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, whose behavior is much more deviant than even the film allows us to know, escape the light of day of one of our "heroes", the trio decides to make the favor in kind - them only accidentally KILL one of the other guys! The remaining two villains then begin the systematic destruction of everything these poor schmoes have at heart, including their rapidly deteriorating mental health. The DVD cover of Phaedra Video contains a critical quote calling the movie "A Paranoid Street Crime Freakout!" or something, and the term more than applies here. Courageous, tense, very violent and discreet (but still quite slippery), shot mainly at night with many deliberately vague moments and motivations of character that prevent the audience from guessing with the besieged protagonists (who, to some extent, deserve all what they have to get!). I give him a 10.
