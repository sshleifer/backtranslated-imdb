Walter Matthau is wonderful as a "persecutory" dentist, Dr. Julian Winston, whose frequent words to his girlfriend Goldie provide irrefutable proof of the dangers of lying. Goldie Hawn's touching jester, Toni Simmons, certainly deserved an Oscar. Ingrid Bergman's work as an unfaithful nurse, Stephanie, is also touching to see how she gets out of her shell, slowly and nervously. It's a good movie to watch in the spring, or anytime. It is very underrated; I've never heard of it before I found it in the video store, and what a find!
