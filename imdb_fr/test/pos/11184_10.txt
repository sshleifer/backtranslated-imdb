Before that, I only wrote a review on IMDb, because I consider that most games are unworthy of the time and effort needed ... The curse of Monkey Island is different. <br /> <br /> Having played and been impressed by Monkey 1 and 2, I had great expectations for the third version ... and I was not disappointed. The first thing that struck me was the dramatically improved graphics. Do not get me wrong, for the games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively, Monkey 1 and 2 were revolutionary and provided the goods well, but CMI intensifies and offers a superb cartoon style game that is both fun and satisfying. . All scenes and settings have been carefully designed and designed for this type of game. Animation / CGI is a mix of realism and exaggeration. a fantastic combination in this case. <br /> <br /> For me, the script played a crucial role in the success of the two previous games. The CMI script is intelligent, appropriate and above all absolutely hilarious. In addition to this, the script is now audio, unlike the previous two, where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. The voice of Dominic Armato is perfect for Guybrush: spiritual, clear and slightly naive. All other vocal talents fit their characters perfectly, especially Earl Boen, the voice behind LeChuck. I loved each character throughout the game: not only his personality and his spirit, but the way each character is animated in a superb and distinctive way. Regarding audio effects, the soundtrack deserves a mention. The soundtracks of Monkey 1 and 2 were both monotonous and, despite this, were still very effective in creating an atmosphere and representing a change of mood. The soundtrack of CMI is, once again, a step forward. Each scene is completed by a catchy melody, subtle, playful and piratey (if it's a word). The music also adapts to the change of scenery or mood, which adds to the entertainment offered by the game. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and problems to progress. It may seem easy, but it is devilishly delicate in many places. Some may be put off by the level of logic and amount of thoughts that go to Monkey Island, but in reality, this makes the game even more fun and fun, and also adds to the replay value. The option "The Monkey Island Curse" or "The Monkey Island Curse: Mega-Monkey" (which involves more complicated and abundant puzzles) is suitable for players of all levels and also gives good reasons to play at least two games. time. Regardless of the level of difficulty you choose, you are guaranteed to play a different game every time you play, with many speech options and other puzzles to solve that do not affect the outcome of the game, but are just there for pleasure. The most fun part of the game is Ship Combat, and the sword "fights" that follows. These have been particularly well thought out and make the game completely interesting. Add to that a wonderful, nonviolent story that is suitable for all ages, that will keep you hooked and want more to the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, to conclude, a special mention must be attributed to the designers. of this game. The way each intricate puzzle and every problem is thought of is simply amazing. While collecting objects and objects during the game, you can not see how everyone will help you progress, but with a little thought and perseverance solutions, and for this, the designers of CMI should be warmly congratulated. 10/10 for the best game I have ever played (no exaggeration)
