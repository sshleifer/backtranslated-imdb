At the time I was working, I remember having a really nasty client who insisted that everything be done personally. I told him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed that I was personally willing to get him out of what was rightly his. I swear, but I was thinking of this guy as I watched John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle of wits. <br /> <br /> In the crosshairs, Clint Eastwood is portrayed as a former secret service agent in office. in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was murdered. He has always had doubts since and was given a drink and his life at once was a real disaster. He went back to the details of the White House now and when a potential tenant of a killer on his secret-service tenant, Eastwood and his partner Dylan McDermott pull the case. <br /> <br /> But the assassin is not an ordinary crank case. He is a professional at work, trained and used by the CIA. John Malkovich has been nominated for Oscars for Best Supporting Actor. He lost this year against Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but I thought Malkovich was better. <br /> <br /> Curiously, Malkovich could have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent In charge of entering his apartment while he was at work, he insisted that everything be personal. He calls Eastwood all the way through the movie and makes fun of him. And after a while, what Malkovich says and does makes Clint really personal. <br /> <br /> The presidential killers of our history are lucky amateurs, unless you believe in certain conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imagined grudge, is the most dangerous type of enemy. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that Fred Dalton Thompson is the White House chief of staff (and president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent who craves for Eastwood's masculine charm, John Mahoney as head of secret services, Gary Cole as head of the White House secret services, Gregory-Alan Williams as other agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as president and first lady. <br /> <br /> But when Malkovich is activated, he owns In The Line Of Fire. The highlight with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.
