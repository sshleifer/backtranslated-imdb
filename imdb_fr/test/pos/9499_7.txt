Gloria Swanson (as Leila Porter) is an understandably bored woman. Workaholic's husband Elliott Dexter (James Denby Porter) "lost his love" with his waist; he also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions and snores. He barely remembers his birthday - attended by the caddy Lew Cody (Schuyler Van Sutphen); the young man looks at Mrs. Swanson's voluptuous figure and flirts shamelessly. Soon, Swanson is attracted to Mr. Cody. Then Mr. Dexter decides to try to recover it. Who will win? <br /> <br /> The three principles are good, Swanson being particularly impressive in her central role as a torn woman. Julia Faye seizes the honors like other interest of Cody, "Toodles"; off screen, she tried director Cecil B. DeMille. DeMille's contact is obvious; especially in an imaginary sequence in which Cody promises to Swanson ... "Pleasure" Wealth "Love" <br /> <br /> ******* Do not change your husband (26/01/19) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Gloria Swanson, Lew Elliott Dexter, Lew Cody
