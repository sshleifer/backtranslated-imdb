Despite its many flaws, Hallmark's Gulliver's Travels version of 1995 remains the best adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical classic - largely because it includes not only ALL of Gulliver's many travels, but also satire, which is often overlooked. Unfortunately, the double problem of the extremely episodic structure of the book and a television budget (even fairly generous) remains. The book is a somewhat disconcerting collection of stories of travelers moving simply from one surrealist landscape to another, but Simon Moore's adaptation attempts to impose some order on chaos by proposing a parallel plot that sees the Gulliver's return to England clearly traumatized and trying to prove it. to leave the insane asylum where the rival of his wife's affection made him commit. English scenes reflect and comment on journeys, some of which are sometimes found in the real world. The problem is that for about an hour, it's more of a distraction and keeps you moving away from the story as it begins to get interesting. Lilliput's scenes suffer more here, with the feeling that house scenes are too often designed to prevent them from filming the most expensive pieces - this must be the only version where we do not see Gulliver pulling Blefescu's fleet behind him . <However, once Gulliver has managed to escape, the tone becomes more consistent when he discovers that his situation is reversed and that he becomes the pet of the giants of the utopians of Brobdingnag, a guest of the sages of the island. floating of Laputa. who are so absorbed in science that they no longer have any common sense, the guest / prisoner of a historian who draws his story directly from the source, offered immortality with all its terrible consequences before finally finding a world to which he wants to belong, if only he could convince Les Houynhnhms are not an incivilized Yahoo, each new destination convincing him of what is an absurd and petty species. For the most part, it's a darker set of journeys than expected, with only Gulliver's curiosity, common sense, and disappointment preventing him from plunging into irremediable moroseness - and even that is outweighed by the scenes at the asylum where it becomes more and more obvious that even telling the truth may have made it really crazy. It is in these last scenes that Ted Danson's Gulliver really shines, never more than in an extraordinary speech in which he transforms his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole of the human race. <br /> <br /> Being made for television, the Yahoos are rather less literally scatological than on the page, but most of the time, it is a treatment more reserved for adults than you think, without real failure. The cast of stars is certainly impressive, and for the most part well used (although briefly, in a few cases) - Mary Steenburgen, James Fox, Peter O'Toole, Edward Woodward, Omar Sharif, Shashi Kapoor, Edward Fox, Ned Beatty Alfre Woodard, Kristin Scott Thomas and Isabelle Huppert among them. It's hard to imagine that Jack Black's upcoming version is almost as impressive as that.
