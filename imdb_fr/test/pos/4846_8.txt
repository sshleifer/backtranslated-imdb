Focus is another great movie with William H. Macy. I discovered Macy for the first time in Fargo and I saw some of his films and he did not cheat me yet. Macy is the archetype of "nice guy with something to hide". In Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hardworking man who shelters his disabled mother at home. The scene takes place after the Second World War, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of human resources for a fundamentally anti-Semitic society. After accidentally hiring a Jewish woman, she is asked to buy a pair of glasses to improve her eyesight. <br /> <br /> Incredibly, the mere fact of buying glasses has a big impact on his life and on Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by a great Laura Dern). As the film unfolds, Newman will begin to see a completely different world, where being a Jew is like being an animal. <br /> <br /> The film is disturbing because it shows that being racist was something normal. The scary thought is that in some places it probably still is.
