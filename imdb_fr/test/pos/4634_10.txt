If you're an "80s kid" like me, you probably remember that 1981 film, Disney - one of Disney's first movies, and Michael J. Fox's first film. I remember watching this movie over and over on HBO when I was in college and I only recently found a very old copy of it because Disney stopped producing the movie several years ago . Needless to say, it's a real fun movie to watch. Five university teams decipher clues in an evening race around Los Angeles, trying to reach the finish line first. Watch for Paul Reubens' cameo. From the old-fashioned music to the disco scene with the big twins, it's a fun movie par excellence that you'll love in the 1980s.
