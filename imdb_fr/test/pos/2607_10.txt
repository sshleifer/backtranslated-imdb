During the War for the Independence of the South, General Spanky mobilized his forces to defend the women and children of the region against an invasion of the Yankees. <br /> <br /> In 1936, Hal Roach decided that it was time for his popular children OUR GANG to diversify into occasional feature films. With the great success of Shirley Temple in two films of the Civil War in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE SMALLEST REBEL), it was natural for Roach to look in the same direction for his GANG. Although produced by a rather sumptuous production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY has not been a critical success nor at the box office. The small gangsters would be confined to short subjects. <br /> <br /> Although he has been ranked in the foreground and lead role, George Spanky McFarland rivals the first half of the film with little Billie: Sarrasin Thomas. Here are two of the best young actors ever to appear in American movies. With all the experience of former seasoned professionals, these two kids could steal scenes and hearts with so much bravado. A constant joy, without any false note between them, they provide the essential reason to watch the movie today. <br /> <br /> Phillips Holmes gives a discreet and gentlemanly performance as Spanky's adult protector. Almost forgotten now, Holmes was a good actor who died far too early in the Second World War. Genial Ralph Morgan is particularly good as a friendly Union General - his scenes with Spanky are quite amusing. <br /> <br /> Other OUR GANGERS appear midway through the film, notably Carl ?? Alfalfa 'Switzer; he can make noise? Just before the battle, mother. Even the pretty Rosina Lawrence (the GANG group's school teacher) introduces herself as the beloved of Holmes. <br /> <br /> Irving Pichel is particularly slimy as a loose cardharp turned Yankee avenging captain. Bumbling Willie Best and fiery Louise Beavers play Miss Lawrence's slaves. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the film contains racism, not unusual for Hollywood of that time - but almost completely missing in the original series of OUR GANG shorts. <br /> <br /> Music lovers of the 19th century will appreciate the soundtrack, a long succession of old melodies.
