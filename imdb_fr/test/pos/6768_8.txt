of the Adam's apple and with your permission. I did not know until I looked at him earlier. Also, the error message 'Wilbur wants to kill himself' I prefer this very concentrated impasse ... Adam Apple's drama of comedy. But with your permission is much more nuanced and subtle, but it's another director. <br /> <br /> Once the "fleshy" part of the story took place, I felt the fear of coming back to the store again and again. A little claustrophobic ... maybe it's intentional. It reinforces the atmosphere. You dread the rediscovery and again and again until you hear a "kick in the shin". <br /> <br /> These are funny things.
