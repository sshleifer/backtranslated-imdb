This film is great because it shows how beautiful cartoons really are in the 80s. The animators are not lazy as they are today. They contain so much detail with very few resources compared to what we have today. If more people ask for these drawings to be rebroadcast, then maybe all the other drawings from the 80s will be shown again on television. Therefore, to finish my sentence, I would simply like to say that it is a drawing with which I grew up and really. would like it to be on TV once again.
