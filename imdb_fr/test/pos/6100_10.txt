Spoiler Alert I worked as an additional actor on this Lifetime TV movie (shot in Seattle). It's really interesting to participate in the production of a film, because usually they are still writing parts (as was the case here) or make major editing and editing from final games. <Br/> <br /> My husband and I both worked as extras in this movie. I remember that they had been discussing the filming of how it remained to determine whether the little girl was going to die or not. Frankly, I would never have imagined that Margaret Colin's character was adequately punished for the crime of hit and run, lying to the police, covering up, and so on. Can you imagine how the end would have changed if she had ended up killing the victim's leaving shot instead of eventually getting out of her coma? Just something to think about. <br /> <br /> By the way, I play the role of a police detective that you can see for a split second, while my husband plays the role of another police officer that you can see often ( we counted four times). Margaret Colin was a great person to work with and very down-to-earth, even though Lisa Vidal (now a Lifetime regular) was distant. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film turned out to be a 7/10, but like another The commented poster is still a real tear and makes an excellent Saturday afternoon movie.
