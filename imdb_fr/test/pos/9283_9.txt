Yes, non-Singaporeans can not see what's wrong with this movie. Some of the references in this film fly just above the heads of foreign viewers and it is mostly the Singaporeans who "get it" really. But I beg you, stranger, look at the other shit that was produced in Singapore and compare it to this movie. It's like comparing pieces of mullet diarhhea to a small diamond. This film is the first to truly show Singapore's gloomy belly - something that the forces claim to exist do not exist. And there is a part in the film where a gangster (ah-beng in our unique and familiar 'ingris') curses in 4 languages, namely Malay English Tamil and Hokkien. The truth is that most of us can and do it all the time. What is sad is that viewers from foreign countries will find it easier to get their little oily claws on this gemstone. In her home country, she was banned initially, but only to be entitled to a rating R, and that too with about 20 cuts to that. It's nice to know that one of the best creative, edgy and original movies ever created would be easier for you to get unaltered, uncensored results; at the other end of the world only in your own country.
