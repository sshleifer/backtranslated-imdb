K-PAX is exactly what a film that warms the heart should be. The story is about a mysterious patient, Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his incredulous psychiatrist, Dr. Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. The two men are very friendly and, as their relationship grows, Dr. Powel can not help wondering if there is more than his mysterious patient, who insists he is from another planet called K-PAX. This movie is a lot of fun, and Kevin Spacey draws well-placed liners as if it's his second nature. K-PAX is a smart movie, and I did not expect him to go there. In the end, I found myself thinking about the little things in life, the wonders and the magic of everyday life that we so often take for granted. I left the theater with a warm feeling of blur inside, and for families and couples on appointments, K-PAX is a beautiful film, which will not disappoint you. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in anything other than the monotonous versions of glossy, action-packed and gore festivals.
