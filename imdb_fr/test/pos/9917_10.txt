The murders at Opera are not real murders, but rather symbols of past events and elements of Betty's broken personality. In fact, Betty is the same person (a man) that Suzy Bannion is in Suspiria, only ten years later (Suzy was a ten-year-old boy who befriended another ten-year-old boy with a larger version). sweet of his own antecedents). It is useful to think of Betty's luxury apartment as a military barracks bay; she spends most of her time in her bedded room next to her hi-fi system, and other parts of her apartment seem to her to be somehow foreign, as if other people were living in those other rooms. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento's movies are synchronized with a wide range of rock music, as well as Funk (Dario starts syncing right from the beginning of his films, the brilliance of the eyes in Opera and the beginning of a drum roll in Suspiria). There are also standard movies with which Opera (and Suspiria) sync. For example, Opera syncs with an album by Judas Priest called Priest ... Live (just like Suspiria) and Suspiria synchronizes very well with Kiss's album Kiss Alive II. Films like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Image and The Vampire Happening are synchronized films used by Argento and dealing with the same subject as the Argento films. These synchronizations, as well as many others, reveal that Betty is a man who has been sexually tortured by her father since birth (even in the womb after a novel by Anne Rice called Lasher). <br /> <br />, Big budget movies are occult works that relay spying information collected by occult means, all in a synchronized symbolic / alchemical way. Usually, the sync point in a movie is the beginning of the score, or the first frame of the movie beyond the introduction of a production company. Sometimes it's more creative. The heavy metal music used in Opera and Phenomena are simply musical timings that have been deciphered by other films with which Argento's films are synchronized, an intellectual game among the elites of the industry. <br /> Betty didn 'Do not respond normally to the murders she witnessed because she has never witnessed the murder of a real person. "She herself" simply suffers a soul murder; she is witnessing her own "murder"; The father of this individual almost dropped him in a mine shaft abandoned in Arizon at age 4, in 1970; he was about to fall from a board of wood on which his father put him in equilibrium before his father changed his mind, seized him, and pulled him away abruptly; the kid did not feel anything consciously. The memories of sexual torture are lost for this individual through extreme sexual repression. The vague memories that remain are those of the great square and deep hole of the desert. No meaning is given to this memory due to the absence of trauma conscious the loss of trauma ", also a" buried trait ", is described in the 1975 film The Image) .The sausages that are in the Suspiria granary are each individual memories of the first three or three years of life (Toys In The Attic). <br /> <br /> The reason why Betty (or Suzy) is a female character is Christina's character Marsillach is a man who has been trained to a female role since his birth (all Simpsons comics DVDs synchronized with Suspiria), his very nature having been modeled along with "queens" (The X -The file episodes synchronized with Opera.) It even changed her body to be "beautiful" like a woman's, behavior alters genetics, and a newer film called Death Proof discusses the same ideas and the same individual. /> <br /> P The whole of this person's life is reflected in big-budget films, record albums and books made since 1966, before 1966 and after. The album Scorpions, entitled Virgin Killer, is an album of Suspiria sync, the cover of this original album serving as a symbolic mirror of the fall through the skylight.
