This movie had everything I needed in a movie: - Women, skateboarding, violence, music by H.I.M and Tony Hawk !!! the illustrations and camera effects in this movie are extraordinary. The music in this movie is the best I've ever heard in another movie. Each track goes so well with its scene. I thought the acting was really good since none of the Bams team members were previously in scripted movies. Although the concept of the film is based on the story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend (Glauren) who sleeps with Hellboy in the back, it is a predictable and secular story. For example, Falcone and the gas tank, Raab himself, Dunn breaking bottles behind the wawa and all the scenes of Don Vito. This film is to see absolutely!
