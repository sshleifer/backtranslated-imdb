Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie with all the kung-fu, crazy stunts and awesome humor you've come to expect. Not as good as the previous one but it's still a good movie if you just want something fun to watch. The story is simple, Jackie Chan against the evil men. So, if you want a movie you do not need to be a Branou to understand, I suggest this one.
