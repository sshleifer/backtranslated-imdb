After 10 views in 20 years, I also think it was the best effort of the movie Crazy Gang, with more cohesion in the plot than his next success, "Alf's Button Afloat". It was actually a crazy trio of double acts, mostly on stage, sometimes in front of royalty, until Chesney Allen retired in the 1940s because of "health problems". He has survived them all by years. Apparently, they were just as crazy outside of "work", regularly playing practical jokes. <br /> <br /> The head of the Six Wonder Boys' troop for I'll Get-Her-To-Me (Alaska) to dig for the gold that was there. It seemed a better idea than going to Mansfield ... because they had been there. When they arrive at Red Gulch, they discover that their information is 40 years old, they think that the fries contained in the guilty newspaper they read are funny. But at this point, it does not matter, they all fell in love with Snow White and want to help their grandfather to find his gold reserve long lost. Baddie Bill "M" McGrew wants it though. <br /> <br /> The number of verbal and visual word games is amazing, but most of them will probably make sense (?) Only for British and former tapestries interested in seeing British Comedies In my opinion, almost all the gags and routines work, including the Gold If between Bud & Chesney and the Whistle While You Work, even the inserts "Always get our man". A wonderful little movie, in a rather tired condition but quite recommended.
