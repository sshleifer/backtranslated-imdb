I remember seeing this film for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California, in October 1976. While walking the streets laden with tourists, we saw a commercial with the words "ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX ". So even before watching the Disneyland version of Lewis Carroll's classic half-kilometer, our curiosity triumphed and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the film started how surprised I was to see this kind of film appear in Orange County, ultra-conservative and pretentious. <br /> <br /> Thirty-two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND in a local video store. I wondered if it was the same movie until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of the lovely Kristine DeBell in the main role and decided to revive some memories. Subversive Video, to their credit, has released two versions, X and XXX in the same package. In fact, the version my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X despite XXX's original advertisement. Seeing it for the second time, I realize how much the director Bud Townsend brought to the screen. As an example of this man's reach behind the camera, in his salad days, he directed two episodes of DEATH VALLEY DAYS, TV. <br /> <br /> Miss DeBell, appearing in the April 1976 Playboy cover, is ideal as Alice. She brings a whole new American innocence to the role of librarian in her early twenties, aspiring to a better life. When her boyfriend is rebuffed from taking their relationship to the next level, Alice reaches her turn. It's a "musical", but the melodies are quite catchy with strings and brass appropriate to offset the generally suggestive lyrics. Miss DeBell has a pleasant singing voice as she trembles to want to be free. That's when the magic begins. The pace of this film is surprisingly fluid, given the genre and casting of Wonderland are there to allow Alice to become a woman. Special mention goes to veteran television Larry Gelman as White Rabbit, who seems to be the only character not to be obsessed with sex because he's always late for an appointment or something of the sort. <br /> <br /> Special features include comments. Lena Ramone, a prominent feminist lawyer, explains how watching this movie during her studies has influenced her in her career as an adult film actress after graduation. <br /> <br /> What makes ALICE IN WONDERLAND so charming is its garden setting. Partially filmed in the lush, natural splendor of Vancouver's Stanley Park in British Columbia, the film hides its pornographic roots. You do not leave with the feeling of having watched a shady skin movie. As I write, I have not seen the XXX triple version. The additional sex sequences subsequently added would, in all likelihood, disrupt the general flow and eliminate the light and clear atmosphere that prevails there. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lewis Carroll's version is the best way to relax and explore The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland. However, for a capsule depicting the adult film archives of the 1970s, ALICE IN WONDERLAND deserves to follow this white rabbit for a scribble ride full of joyful chaos.
