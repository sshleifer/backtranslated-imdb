Although the video box of many copies of this film claims that it is about people returned, it is a total lie. In fact, apart from the opening segment, the movie is not even a horror movie. With his sunken treasure, fish legions and crazy scientists, it's much more like an adventure film by Doug McClure. Obviously, this film is not a work of art, but it's quite fun to watch ... Just know that the beginning is rather bloody.
