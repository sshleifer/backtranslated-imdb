This educational show focused on emotions, interactions and relationships. It was produced by Detroit's ABC subsidiary and distributed in 90 markets nationwide. Last week, Detroit's public television aired a one-and-a-half hour clip as part of its sponsorship campaign. Wow, memories that have resurfaced! While I remembered the series, there were segments that I had forgotten, but that I remembered immediately as soon as they started ("Hot Fudge HOLY MOLEY!", Detective Tomato and pies in the face). <br /> <br /> To learn more about the special public TV show, search on "Hot Fudge Comin 'Atcha Concert"
