A wonderful movie ahead of its time, <br /> <br /> I think so, in the 80s, it was all about winning, Greed is Good? Do you remember that one? I saw this movie more than 20 times. For me, it's a real movie on a desert island, I keep watching it because there's always something to learn about those imperfect characters I love, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronin, are just wonderful. Beverly D'Angelo and Beau Bridges come in second place. Do not get me wrong, there are many more great performances in this film, and it's also the way it's written that did it for me, and I hope you, a movie you'll want to see again and again, I think TV shows like "Northen Exposure" and now "Earl" owe a lot to this movie. but remember it's not a Tom Cruise movie.
