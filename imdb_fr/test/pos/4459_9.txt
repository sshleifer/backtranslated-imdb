Being a seasoned fan of Italian directors and thrillers Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado, I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack. I had seen The Beyond, which, in my opinion, is totally overestimated. I found The New York Ripper just horrible and I did not particularly like The House By The Cemetery. These three films let me conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to watch more of his films. The city of the undead is a movie that I found very interesting, but do not torture your duck is almost a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Located in a small town in the Italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are murdered. The authorities have no idea who is behind these crimes, especially after their main suspect has been declared innocent. An eager young reporter with a rather slutty girl (who seduces boys) investigates and gets to the bottom of things. <br /> <br /> A brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a nice distribution (not always the case) with the Italian thrillers of the 70s) make Do not Torture a Duckling a good thriller. The plot is well constructed, hard to understand and the final conclusion is very satisfying. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very ruthless and ignorant community and creates very strong images, especially in a scene where a woman is beaten to death by residents of the city. Fulci's social commentary on religion and innocence is quite complex and every aspect is well treated. When you think of his zombie movies and his ultra-violent New York Ripper giallo, it's amazing how well he balances his criticism with explicit violence and reinforces his argument. So far, I have not seen any film on Fulci made with as much professionalism as this one. <br /> <br /> Although not a traditional film, Giulo carries many brands of the genre. Fulci displays total control over the format, only once at sea with a gore moment unconvincing, but overall, he seems to be even more talented at creating mysteries than for the epic gore apart whole. The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and make a lot of noise. <br /> <br /> So far, do not torture a duckling is by far the best Fulci film, in my opinion. Edifying social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crisp mystery.
