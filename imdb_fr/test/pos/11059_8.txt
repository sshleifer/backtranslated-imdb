This short film is not in doubt. The story is that of a butcher who wrongly kills an innocent man who, according to him, has sexually assaulted his retarded daughter. The film then describes how the butcher serves his time and comes back to life with his daughter on guard and faces a life without a future. <br /> <br /> The opening scenes depicting a horse massacre and the frontal birth of the butcher's daughter place you in a brutal state of mind that accompanies you throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The flow of the film is very direct and adds to its brutality. As a result, a lot of ground is covered within 40 minutes. You are fully engaged with the non-life butchery - especially after he lost his daughter to social services and his business. His story continues in the excellent film Alone Against All
