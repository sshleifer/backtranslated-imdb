This film, in its current version, is much shorter than it was in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other silent feature films of Chaplin (A DOG'S LIFE and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin reissued in the 1950s. . In that day, SHOULDER ARMS was a great success because of its humorous uniform approach. It's always very funny (Chaplin disguised as a tree, spying on the Germans, so ridiculous it's hysterical), but he suffers from being in his own age. Charlie deals with World War I, a hideous conflict that killed 20 million people, but not the worst (horrific) war of the 20th century. Chaplin would also live to witness this war and emulate his leading architects in THE GREAT DICTATOR. But it is more accessible to the modern public because this film is a talking image. In addition, Hitler as a target seems more important to the public in 2008 than Kaiser Wilhelm II and his staff. <br /> <br /> SHOULDER ARMS should guide us in drafting the tramp, its training, its trench warfare, and its real fight against the "Huns" on the Western Front. Much of it is now gone - a segment (when Albert Austin is a doctor who examines Chaplin in his treatment center office) is still extant and has been completely featured in the UNKNOWN CHAPLIN documentary. This is unfortunate because the film now lasts about forty-five minutes and there seems to be gaps that these scenes have filled. What is left is top notch but we want more ... and we feel a little deceived. <br /> <br /> Sydney Chaplin and Henry Bergman are doing well in the minor roles, especially Sydney as Wilhelm. He had done it before in a short film with Charlie for the sale of bonds, pronouncing a militarist speech before being overwhelmed by the tramp with a huge hammer called "War Bonds"). Here we see the clan succeed in capturing Wilhelm and the staff at the conclusion. It was only overcome by Stan and Ollie capturing the German army with a tank and barbed wire in PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Chaplin had a major crisis as a result of his wartime activities. . He was not a naturalized American - neither in 1917 nor in 1952, when Attorney General McGranery publicly announced that Chaplin could not return to the United States because he was a foreign enemy (Chaplin and his family were in Europe while Charlie was angry in Switzerland for the rest of his life, except when he went to A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG and when he went to Hollywood for his special "Oscar" career in the 1970s). Because he was not American, he could not be chosen by the United States. He sold (with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford) US war bonds. But in Britain, tens of thousands of people had died on the battlefields of the First World War, and the public was upset at Chaplin, whom they considered a "slacker" and a coward. Chaplin finally overcame that, but the rests of his resentment followed him until his death. This does not detract from the success of SHOULDER ARMS as a film, but this suggests why Chaplin did not shoot another modern war movie before 1940, and therefore does not constitute a more dignified target.
