Linda Blair has been playing for forty years and, although she will never escape Regan MacNeil's role in "The Exorcist," few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status as successfully as "Witchery". She plays Jane Brooks, a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to buy. They are accompanied by two real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth). Upon arrival on the island, they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his girlfriend writer (Leslie Cumming) who are squatting illegally at the hotel while investigating the legend. of a local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seems like a long witch hunt has caused her suicide. She was pregnant at the time. Unaware of the danger, Jane recently dreamed of the witch's dramatic death and her little brother, Tommy (Michael Manchester), was more directly visited by his phantasmagorical, black-clad spirit, whom he calls "the woman in black" . The time spent by the group at the hostel island starts fairly slowly. Unbeknownst to them, however, the Lady in Black has already sent the captain of their rented boat (George Stevens). Soon, isolation and cold begin to affect everyone and it is during this period of bad mood and tension that the Lady in Black begins its reign of terror. She plans to avenge her own destiny by owning Jane and sacrificing her companions and unborn child. Each of her other victims accomplishes one aspect of her vengeance curse - the greed, lust and blood of a virgin. As the sun goes down and the sea goes wild, it haunts them one after the other in horrific and frightening ways. The location of the island is actually scary and the hostel is very scary and slaughtered. It is a film so colorful that it reminds me of the work of Dario Argento. The lighting is excellent and the decor is perfectly spooky. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horror effects are extreme, terrifying and unforgettable. The cinematography is excellent and that's what brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this film takes her as a horror star: many dramatic thrusts, close-ups that subtly detail Jane's extra possession and moments reminiscent of other great horror movies. There are hidden tributes to "Rosemary's Baby", "Jacob's Ladder", "The Shining", "Black Sunday" and of course "The Exorcist". She does a great job and steals the show with her depressed and unobtrusive performance. This does not mean that the rest of the distribution disappoints; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and performer Annie Ross is memorable as Jane's mother-in-law, Rose. Hasselhoff gives the best of himself, but he is not essentially a movie star, and his character on television prevents him from playing. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The film is also so violent and scary (in a good way) that it desperately needs their heat (Blair also played a mother in "Monster Makers" in 2003, and his maternal scenes in this film have the same feeling of tenderness). Finally, Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch and has an incredible voice and accent. With Blair, she was also perfectly chosen. But it's Blair's movie to the end. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability, and this aspect of the film refers to "Exorcist II: The Heretic". I think "Witchery" is up there with "The Exorcist", "Exorcist II", "Hell Night" and "Summer of Fear" as Blair's best genre work to date.
