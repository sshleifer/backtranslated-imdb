In addition to portraying a lesbian love story, FIRE is also a comic satire of middle-class Indian culture (?). I think it's an unappreciated quality of the film. These two genres (that is, a deep and meaningful alternative love story and comic satire) usually marry as well as oil and water, but Mehta (somehow) is able to almost perfect balance. The behavior of the servant Jatin, the treatment reserved by his family, the inescapable presence of the bedridden grandmother, Ashok's obsession with the teachings of a swami: from a culture very similar to that of India , I can immediately identify it as typical. They shouted for being reported and ridiculed. By developing her main subject, Mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme with skill. In fact, much of the film's humor, which provides essential relief to the heavy topics of taboo lesbian love and gender issues, stems from this satire of ordinary looks. The film runs comic seriously with great subtlety. <br /> <br /> All in all, brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compared to Sita of legend and coming out of the untainted and therefore pure fire; life long desire of the young Radha to see the ocean finally reached when she gains freedom). Congratulations to Shabana Azmi (Radha), lighting team and Deepa Mehta; their very little Hollywood (and non-Bollywood!) talents made this film special. A criticism: the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to the extent that they did not flow very well into each other. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 9 out of 10. Nothing less for a film with scenes as engraved in my memory.
