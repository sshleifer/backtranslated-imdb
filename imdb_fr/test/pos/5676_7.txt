When I read the synopsis - 3 people lost in the wild battle against a huge crocodile - I was not really attracted. It looked like the typical horror formula of a yawning movie of a group of people stalked by a monster - except in this case they are only three, and we would not even have the macabre "joy" of them watch being kidnapped one by one. <br /> <br /> However, I watched it (I could not sleep, did nothing else) and it turned out to be much better than expected. The acting is awesome, the atmosphere is tight and you really get the rare feeling of a low budget winner. <br /> <br /> Horror as it should be. Realization of first-rate films. It's not perfect but it's worth seeing. I give him a 7.
