I do not agree with imdb.com's summary that he is a bisexual guy getting ready to get married. It's more about all the bullshit we're going through - caused by ourselves and our parents - that we have to "overcome" when we grow up. As Linda McCarriston's poem says, "Childhood is the barrel in which they throw you over the falls". This film is much more like a narrative poem. It's about life and the mistakes we commit and inflict over the years. In the end, it's all about love (I'm not trying to be hyper sensitive or schmoopy) and looking for a special person.
