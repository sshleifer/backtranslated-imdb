Everyone who goes to the Manhattan Hospital Center gets in his hands. This includes the staff of the hospital. <br /> <br /> I had never seen the hospital before and I was intrigued by the similarity of the characters and situations of the plot with this other masterpiece by Paddy Chayefsky, Network. There are elements in the character of George C. Scott that have both those of Al Schumacher and those of Howard Beale. <br /> <br /> He is the administrator of the hospital and he is mad and is not going to support him anymore. He is completely separated from his wife and children. It takes a Faye Dunaway character in the person of Diana Rigg to get him out of there. A blow in the hay with her and he is shocked to come back to reality and to the fact that he can always contribute to the world. <br /> <br /> But first, he has a real problem. Someone is killing the hospital staff, four of them in 48 hours. And the nice part is that their deaths can be attributed largely to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy. This is where the comedy comes into play. <br /> <br /> There is a character like Howard Beale in the person of Barnard Hughes, the father of Diana Rigg. Its end is not as spectacular as Beale's. <br /> <br /> At the time of my job, it was my job to pay medical providers. Some of them could be as scary as those described in The Hospital. The black comedy satire really touched me. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott was nominated for the Best Actor Award, but after winning and refusing to accept Patton's Oscar of the previous year, he did not get a second chance. He lost to Gene Hackman for The French Connection. Nevertheless, his use of the role is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to watch The Hospital back to back with Network and see how many similarities you see.
