Since I've been allowed to play Goldeneye again, it's impossible for me to stop thinking about it. I am surprised that I could have done without it. This is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time. I have never played other shooting games, but I know that this one prevails above all else. Most people attribute this to too much violence, but I find that ridiculous. There may be some graphic antics, but there is much worse. <br /> <br /> More importantly, it's fun. With an impressive arsenal of weapons such as the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Gun, you will cross several challenging levels of the film, completing crucial objectives and repelling swarms of guards. There are tons of awesome cheats to get and even two secret levels that you will only win if you have the real skills. Goldeneye is also one of the best multiplayer games of all time. You can choose several characters from the movie, classic villains of old movies 007 (Baron Samedi, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws) and guards in the game. It is very likely that you and your partner would laugh so much that you would blow at not look like Bart and Lisa Simpson watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy. <br /> <br /> So if you do not have the game, do not rent it: buy it. It's too good to be true. For some cool Goldeneye stuff, check out the Goldeneye Detstar.com website. All lovers of James Bond will dig this game big.
