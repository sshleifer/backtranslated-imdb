First, a word of caution. The DVD box describes this film as a comedy. I do not think that was the intention of anyone related to the film other than some stupid marketing. Light and a bit funny in places, it's NOT a comedy and if you expect to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I had never even heard of this movie and I had absolutely no expectations that way. other. Considering that the other two DVDs I picked up were big disappointments, I was so happy when I saw this movie. The acting, the writing and the staging were excellent. The story itself definitely interests me, because you do not usually see films on the last month of France before the Nazi seizure of power in 1940. It helped to better understand the parasites that have given up so quickly and agreed to divide their beloved country. Along the way, intrigues involving a selfish and weak actress were very well performed by Isabelle Adjani - who looks wonderful after all these years. She kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall. This sap escapes from prison and finds - with another lover - a senior government official and a weasel incarnated by Gerard Depardieu. In addition, a secondary plot about a Jewish physicist trying to introduce deuterium out of the country is introduced and eventually becomes the main plot. The story has a lot of twists, a sense of humor (not wanting to be a comedy) and real moments of suspense. Together, they create a nice package that will please you.
