Although defective in its vision of homosexuals, this film will enlighten the viewer on myths and inaccuracies about AIDS. Despite the depressing subject, this film describes a warm friendship between two boys and will make you laugh and cry. Very well played by all, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is a little strong, although appropriate, and it's an entertaining and intelligent movie for the whole family. But remember to have the Kleenex ready!
