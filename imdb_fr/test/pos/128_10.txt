It is worth it to debase the Hindu pantheon before watching this movie. There are three main female divinities - Sita, Lakshmi foster and Kali the Transformer - as well as three main male divinities - Serious Rama, Krishna and Shiva the Ender - who are cheerful. Knowing the folklore in an indisputable way, makes every Indian member of a public confer a richness to the narrative of contemporary history. In fact, a folkloric tale is performed first on stage, as part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the "real life" of the film. "Fire" denounces the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers originate, and it does so with a beauty that inserts the message at different levels of the viewer's consciousness, making it a deeply satisfying presentation. It's the best film I've seen in the last ten years. very strongly recommended!
