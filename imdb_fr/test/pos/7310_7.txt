Sweet wife Norma Shearer (as Katherine "Kitty" Brown) waits for her husband, Rod La Rocque (under the name of Bob Brown), hands and feet. While preparing her breakfast in bed and helping her get dressed for a Sunday golf outing, Ms. Shearer suggests joining Mr. La Rocque for the day, noting how rare it is for both see themselves. But La Rocque repels her, claiming that her presence harms her game. Then, unexpectedly, Shearer discovers the real reason for her husband's frequent absences. his pretty blonde mistress! <br /> <br /> Three years later, Shearer is a glamorous and seductive divorcee. During her summer in Paris, she made friends with the rich and old socialist Marie Dressler (as Madame "Boucci" Bouccicault). Mrs. Dressler invites Shearer to his Long Island home to socialize with friends and ask for a favor. Dressler worries about her granddaughter's relationship with a mellow, suave man. She wants young Sally Eilers (as Dionne) to marry Raymond Hackett (as Bruce). Aware of Shearer's flirtatious conquests, Dressler asks her to draw the unwanted man away from Mrs. Eilers. Shearer is stunned to discover that this man is La Rocque, his ex-husband. <br /> <br /> Shearer and Dressler make it a cute and fun piece. They are in top form, offering guaranteed performance, with enthusiasm and professionalism. The story is stupid and predictable; yet, in a way that helps the humorous situation. And the end is smart enough. In fact, the comic "Let us be gay" may have aged better than "The Divorced", more product and more serious Shearer, which was released around the same time. The distribution evenly good. La Rocque is better than his film with Lilian Gish; but his role is not at all endearing. Gilbert Emery (as Towney) and Tyrell Davis (as Wallace) argue in a fun way. <br /> <br /> Those who are not familiar with Norma Shearer may not realize that it is she who appears as the frumpy woman in the early scenes. This is Shearer as "Kitty" before his makeover. Watch Shearer's close-ups with light, natural make-up to watch a woman of fascinating beauty. <br /> <br /> ******* Let Us Be Gay (1930) Robert Z.
