I attended a screening of this film, thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of horrendous beasts, blind intrigues and the kind of nauseating acts that made "The Postman" the one of the most clever cinematic gaffes of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film featuring Costner that appeals to the public's soul. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could play such a serious role. Shocked that a movie starring both engaged and captured my own emotions. Since "Robin Hood", I've never seen this Costner: full of deep and complex emotions. Kutcher seems to have changed the serious acting with which he played in "Butterfly Effect". These two actors entered this film with a serious and focused attitude that reflected in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No, it's not a movie worthy of the Oscars. This is not an epic, nor a film of deep social commentary. It is rather a story about a simple subject, enlightened to bring this audience to a level of empathy higher than expected. This is what I think is a good cinematographic achievement and I am particularly impressed by this work. Bravo!
