Inspired by True events, Radio is one of the most played and sincere dramas I know that is widely broadcast. It's certainly one of the best movies of 2003. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris, star of the radio, deserves an Oscar in this film, as a football coach, Harold Jones . Coach Jones has taught football all his life and loves the sport. However, coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio Cuba, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance since Men of Honor, passes on the football field while the coach's team is training for the match. Some team members then attach the radio and throw it into a building. They then hit the building and coach Jones finally suspects that something is wrong. He comes and helps Radio, who is scared, and from there, Coach Jones and Radio share a very special connection. The radio becomes the highlight of every football game and enjoys playing football games and school events. He also becomes the main interest of coach Jones for life over football, which was first his main priority before his family and radio. <br /> <br /> accept the people for whom they are even if they are different, death and family relationships. The film addresses all these issues and more and is extremely well done. Director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film. What I liked the most about radio is how real it was. The performances looked like watching something in real life unfold before your eyes. The radio had a good mix of comedy and drama. Some parts were pretty funny but other parts were very serious and sad. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think critics only give average criticism on the radio. They have to have their heads high because it's amazing how this film can only receive 2 stars and that something like a rock school can have 3 or 4 stars, that makes no sense to me. In addition, the performances I mentioned are worthy of an Oscar and worthy of a director. In my opinion, Ed Harris, who I think is underestimated as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should both get an appointment for this film. Radio is one of my favorite movies of the year and gives me the reason to always see some of the great Hollywood movies. My final score for Radio is 9/10.
