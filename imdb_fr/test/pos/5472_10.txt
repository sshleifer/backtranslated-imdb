For those of you who commented on this film earlier and hope to see it again, I hope you did it. It was released today (28 November 04) on the Lifetime movie network. I sign up for Dish. <br /> <br /> Karen Arthur directed William Petersen and Barbara Hershey in this gothic story from the southwestern part of the country, with expertise. The lighting, editing and dialogue contributed greatly to the film and Hershey and Peterson were perfectly chosen for the roles, playing both sensitive, bold and intuitive characters. The game on the screen was excellent, as well as the secondary distribution. <br /> <br /> As I did not know in advance, I guessed well that the story was based on the truth and, now that I know it, I have to make the stay. , Santa Fe being a jump, a jump and a Tucson jump. <br /> <br /> As an engineer, I was fascinated by the theme of the unique construction of the staircase and the man who designed and built it (who was he an angel?) . But the scenario, and it's many intrigues, of what has happened is what captivates you the most. You certainly have the feeling that God in his heaven was in all the details of all this drama in history. For you who have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who have not done it yet, I will not give up a minute ... <br /> <br /> Happy Holidays, <br /> <br /> Bob Shank Jr, Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ
