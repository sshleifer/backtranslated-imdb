In August 1981, there was a country-ish buzz for the movies, hits such as "Urban Cowboy", "Every Way Way But Loose", "Smokey and the Bandit" were all the rage. For this reason, I guess the producers of this movie chose the title "Honky Tonk Freeway" in the hope that it would help the box office recipes by attracting the same "Urban Cowboy" audience. Instead, "Honky Tonk Freeway" bombed the theaters and I suspect he did so partly by being overwhelmed by a badly chosen title. It's the same problem that is bothering the video now and it's a shame because it's a very good film and a comic style ahead of time. Anyway, whoever remembers 1981 will probably appreciate it. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that this film was bombed. But I think that would be the case even if the title had not been badly paid. It's a film ahead of its time. We could watch this movie now and see that it's clearly a father or a great-uncle anyway) to the kind of comedy being made today. "Honky Tonk Freeway" was filled with little insinuations and a kind of life franchise that only became popular in comedy much later. Although it is clearly a "plane", it is more mature and, although it is certainly not a "Knocked Up", it clearly points in this direction. The characters are more "mature" in that they are discreet and never think that what they are doing is anything but serious. The jokes concern the choice of the elements to emphasize, the views of the camera and the way they are seen and their situation. <br /> <br /> But more than that, "Honky Tonk Freeway" is a real time capsule. A big comeback on the early 80's. The people in this movie are dressed and act like the ordinary people of 1981. It was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sneaky and comical commentary on everyday life around them. <br /> <br /> I do not know if my opinion helps you, but it's really a good, sometimes kind of excellent, a movie that is worth renting if you want to see what a lot of faces known today when they were 30 years younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young that it's hard to realize sometimes. Just like Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was about to become Hollywood's toast since his next movie after this one was "Tootsie", which finally made it a star. Howard Hessmann was probably the biggest "current" star of the day this film was shot. In 1981, Howard Hessmann was the star of the famous TV show "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his main character, the nocturnal DJ. Daniel Stern was about to become a star as an adult narrator of the main character in the popular 80's sitcom "The Wonder Years". There are also many faces that are no longer with us these days, it's nice to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as an old married couple on a trip. Jessica Tandy would finally win her Oscar ten years later for "Driving Miss Daisy". There's also the brilliant Geraldine Page in one of her last appearances at the cinema. Despite a brilliant career, she did not get her Oscar until four years later, in 1985, as part of "Trip to Bountiful", for which she deserved it, and she died very soon after receiving this award. <br /> <In addition, there are many other faces in this film, actors who are not big stars but have done a lot of support work. Many are familiar even if you can not think of their name. <br /> <br /> This film is a nice little diversion. A group of people struggling with a variety of problems come from different places, each for different and independent reasons, all of which, vaguely, end up heading for Florida and unknowingly go to Rendevoux, in the small town. the city of Ticlaw, Florida, which is suffering the effects of the newly built intricate on the nearby highway, which has not built an exit for Ticlaw, which has resulted in the town being pulled out of the map. <br /> And this is also what this film is a fascination for the whole idea of ​​the inter-state system, which had just "completed". It had taken a generation to build, from the time it was authorized by the Congress around 1960, and for many years during which different rooms had been built and then "put into operation". By 1980, most of the system had finally been built and all interconnected. For the first time, the promise of what would be the interstate system had turned into what is. And people were delighted by that. In 1980, everyone was almost an "interstate highway veteran" in the sense that everyone had already used parts and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that There were no traffic lights or stop signs, and access ramps, and he had traveled to places that were less accessible in the past. In 1980, everyone could move comfortably and constantly, except to eat, sleep and go to the toilet. And it was all new then. <br /> <br /> The end is anti-climatic and is not satisfactory, even if it's a spectacular moment. What's great is the trip, not the destination, which makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless despite the fact that it is such a product of its time. Forget his title; let it carry you away in memory.
