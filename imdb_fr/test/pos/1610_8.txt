Based in Venice, mainly on the Lido, Visconti's "Death in Venice" is a triumph of cinema combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterization and the expert photography of the seaside resort in all its daily moods. For those who love Venice, it's a movie to cherish. <br /> <br /> Mahler's music, often heard in the film, accentuates the drama. The atmosphere it creates is not always happy. But what more do you expect with a title like that? <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the film. Rather sparse. This is mainly about background noise and chatter and laughter among hotel guests. What is intriguing is to interpret the exchange of glances between Gustav von Aschenbach, renowned composer and a thin teenager, Tadzio, who meet from time to time through the tables of the dining room of the hotel, on the beach and in improbable unexpected places. around Venice. They seem to shyly acknowledge everyone's presence at the beginning with a little more than the suggestion of a smile, but later with a strong, captivating and urgent look. <br /> <br /> Each spectator will have his own interpretation. The composer lost his own child. Is this behavior an expression of longing for the child he loved? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction for this fragile young man with his slightly dazed look? Would he be discovering a new inspiration for a musical masterpiece not yet written? Who knows? <br /> <br /> From start to finish, this film captures the true spirit of the 19th century in Venice. The elegance of the ladies, the chairs on the sand, the children frolicking in their swimsuits from the neck to the knee, the brilliance of the sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction of the world. Although some may think that the pace is sometimes rather slow, the film is generally sweet, but with an indecision that simmers between two human beings repressed. Be ready for a sad and beautiful end.
