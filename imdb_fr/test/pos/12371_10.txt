The masterpiece of Victor Sjostrom's silent film, The Phantom Carriage, has just been released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL. The duo, made up of American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian artist Peter Rehberg, has created an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original images of the film dating from 1921. A resounding sound introduces every act and a mix of drones, guitar chords and feedbacks come and go as the drama unfolds. <br /> <br /> As impressive as the new soundtrack is, the film remains the true star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this story, the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve is sentenced to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous ghostly carriage, thus gathering the soul of the dead. It is the fate of the movie's antihero, David Holm, who is moved by a close examination of his life after his untimely death and his meeting with the driver of the car. <br /> <br /> This film is often called a horror film and although it is an appropriate label, the real horror here lies not in the supernatural elements but rather in the description of the film. human suffering in the hands of others. Sjostrom gives a remarkable performance as a drunken, wicked and menacing Holm of life, and the miserable and frightened Holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds. <br /> <br /> Stunning images abound across the Phantom Carriage and more than make up for the inevitably limited dialogue. The evil beginning of midnight is powerfully illustrated by the image of a dial hovering alone in the night sky darkened like a second moon. Equally impressive, the dead are represented through pioneering semitransparent images and scenes of the ghostly horse-drawn carriage straddling land and sea remain chilly to watch. <br /> <br /> Sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films of all time and the new KTL soundtrack is a superb accentuation of its themes. It is to see absolutely.
