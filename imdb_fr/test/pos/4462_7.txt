In a small, picturesque village in Sicily, someone brutally kills sexually curious young boys. The local police are working to locate the murderer and reduce the list to about five main suspects, including the retarder Giuseppe (Vito Passeri), a voyeuristic village, and a wizard named Maciara (Florinda Bolkan). There is also Don Alberto (Marc Popel), a handsome young priest who runs the local boys' school, Andrea (Tomas Milian), a journalist helping the police, and the beautiful Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a beautiful but seriously damn- addict who seems to have a weakness for the very (I mean, very) young boys. As usual with the subgenre giallo, the plot will be fully revealed only in the latest images, but if you can hang on long enough, this film will be profitable. The script (written by Fulci, Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) minimizes red herrings and will interest you. The story is comfortably supported by an excellent filming work, a cinematography (by Sergio D'Offizi) and a musical score (from Riz Ortolani). ). The acting game, especially Bolkan, is also very good. Fulci fans who were weaned in his grotesque 80s like THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE will find more art and less and less gore than they would have imagined, but they will still appreciate a particularly flogging scene unpleasant in a cemetery (oddly, but effectively, to the ballad of the singer Ornella Vanoni "Quei giorni insieme a te") and to a long fall in a rocky slope that Fulci liked so much that it reused it in his film THE PSYCHIC (1977). The scenes of children killed are mainly kept off the screen (with the exception of a brief strangulation), but the camera does not hesitate to dwell on their corpses. The film was not released in theaters in America and, presumably because of anti-Catholic elements of the plot, it was only distributed in cinemas in Europe.
