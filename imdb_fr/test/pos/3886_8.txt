Garlin surpasses himself as a screenwriter-director-actor in his independent production of a great guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye on every woman he sees. The laughter continues to come almost every minute. It is a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man seeking love, but realized with remarkable comic writing and interpretation. Secondary roles are also very well done and very entertaining and really enrich the film. <br /> <br /> Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her role as receptionist, plunging you into the mood of the rest of the movie. Sara Silverman is great with some of the good things she does with Jeff. Bonnie Hunt is classically brilliant in her role. I just wish there was more of it in the movie, because I think most will agree. It's certainly refreshing to see her wearing a tight leather outfit. <br /> <br /> David Pasquesi was the distant companion of reason. Mina Kolb plays Jeff's mother with whom he lives. There were many other cameos, all very well done. <br /> <br /> To the Prime Minister, Jeff mentioned his inability to do more with Bonnie because of production issues. Nevertheless, it is good to leave you wanting more. I think keeping some things ambiguous is about letting the public think about itself to fill the gaps. The complimentary title should inform you. <br /> <br /> Jeff said some of the basic characters were based on his past relationships. This explains why they work so well. Real life people are always exceptionally colorful and make great characters. He walks away a bit from what you might expect after seeing Curb Your Enthusiasm and some of his other works. This is one of the situations in which an actor takes risks to do something that he may have always wanted to do, but he could not. <br /> <br /> I think it's interesting to note that Garlin made his debut in Second City in improvisation and that Hunt Matter, here define the style of acting that is central to the story and This may be an innovative new hybrid combining improvisation and independent film making.
