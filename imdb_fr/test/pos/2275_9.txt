I entered the movie theater, without waiting for the movie that I was about to watch: "Everything is illuminated". I came out with a joy that I have just felt with American movies. Actor Leiv Schreiber's first film, the film follows a man on his journey in the past, accompanied by an eccentric group of English-born punk brakes from his grandfather, Eukraine. blind and their crazy dog. The first half of the film is funny and intelligent, with an extremely European flavor in the use of small but wonderful characters, while the second half of the film plunges into a dark history of discovery and the Holocaust. This little film gives birth to so many emotions and colors, with such a wonderful conclusion and more than a story of enlightenment, but also of relationships and relationships. The acting is incredibly powerful, the story mysterious and interesting, and the artistic appeal of cinematography, to die. With brilliant and absolutely touching scenes, "Everything is illuminated" managed to capture my heart.
