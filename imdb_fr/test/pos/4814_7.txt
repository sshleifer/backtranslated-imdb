The late director John Frankenheimer directed his first feature, The Young Stranger, after making live television dramas in New York. This film is part of the success of Rebel Without A Cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his film debut as a troubled teenager with a producer father, James Daly, who does not have enough sons. Kim Hunter plays the mother trying to bridge the gap between her husband and son. The film uses the popular angle of juvenile delinquent time to tell its story. MacArthur is in trouble in a movie theater with an overzealous theater director played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur, in turn, faces a police sergeant, James Gregory, determined to teach him a lesson. The material could easily have become exploitative, laughable and sensational, as many others of this period did. However, under the able guidance of Frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive representation of teenage and parenting dynamics. The dialogue is realistic and most of the scenes stand surprisingly well. Some of the scenes with Bissell, as director of the theater, and Gregory, as police sergeant, are a bit cumbersome and dated. The performances are uniformly good, which is necessary for a film of this nature and on this subject to succeed. This is an impressive first feature film for MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.
