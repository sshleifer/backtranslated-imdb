Based on the true story of Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Daulton Lee (Penn) and their involvement in the sales documents of the US government secret to the Soviets in the 1970s Boyce works for the government and its job is to protect documents, which ultimately deceive him about the affairs and practices of his country. He then asks his drug dealer friend, Daulton Lee, who has become a wanted man, to serve as mail for these confidential documents. Lee infiltrates the Russian Embassy in Mexico and makes contact with Alex (Suchet). They both start playing the game of spying. <br /> <br /> Lee's interest is purely economic, while Boyce gets angry at the system in which he is involved. Alex believes that Lee is the man of the American government. Lee's addiction and irresponsible behavior towards the mail position compensate Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid and the initial spying game becomes more deadly and more consequential for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This is a real spy thriller without the old-fashioned action. The motives of the characters and analysis of subjects from real life are friendly but very well written, and the film cleverly mixes the events of real life political issues underlying the human predator behavior. Where a great nation uses its political power to control small nations. Well directed and intense in places, especially where the protagonists are huge above their heads in the game of spying. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give incredibly captivating performance in a film that questions the authority, but there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of the system. The plight of the protagonists is the underlying message in "The Falcon and the Snowman" and made a smart political thriller with a poignant element of society, human relationships and the American system. Excellent movie! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 on *****!
