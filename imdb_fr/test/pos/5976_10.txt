I saw this film many years ago (with another film by Shepitko, Wings) as part of a series of Soviet films in a local film archive. As far as I know, none of Shepitko's films were recorded on video or DVD in the United States. Ascent is a great film in every respect, with beautiful black-and-white photographs, a hypnotic direction and actors so deep in their roles that you do not feel they are just giving a performance. Although the details of the period on the Russian resistance to the German occupation (and its collaboration with) are very revealing, the story is timeless. The two Russian partisans are captured by the Germans and the interrogation tests their integrity and their courage. I suspect that the reason why it was not published on DVD by the Russians (here's the spoiler) is that the Jewish intellectual (and not the tough Russian peasant) is the partisan who resists both threats and temptation, serenely goes to his death, and gives a heroic example to the villagers.
