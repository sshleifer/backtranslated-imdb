I found this gem as an extra feature on my Allen Gray Vampyr-Der Traum DVD, and I did not expect that much. It seemed like an interesting short film, so I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I'm really happy to have done it. It was really amazing! Although it was created more than 70 years ago, the animation was, in my opinion, better than some of the achievements made today with all the computer effects and experience available at the moment. <br /> newly developed dog, the toy dog ​​hears the lamentations of his owner about not being able to afford an orange and goes in search of finding her. In the process, he comes up against an underground world of toys with all kinds of evil creatures and toys being watched by none other than the devil himself, who all want the dog's orange too. <br /> <br /> but reminds me a lot of Mad Monster Party? (1969, Jules Bass) - a film I've always loved - and to a lesser extent, some of Tim Burton's animated works - The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993, Henry Selick) and Corpse Bride (2005, Tim Burton). I'm sure fans of one of these movies will also love The Mascot. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is an incredible animated film that deserves to be viewed.
