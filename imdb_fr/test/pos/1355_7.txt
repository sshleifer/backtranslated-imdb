There is something that one of the characters (the aging director who pretends to be dead) says what can sum up the entire film: "In Italy, it is the dead who lead". True! It is a country without a future, in the hands of elderly and tired men. And the cryptic portrait of the country of Bellocchio, centered on the seemingly foolish story of a director who has to film weddings for a living, manages to say a lot about what does not work here. But foreigners may miss the boat, because it is not clearly expressed. I understand that Australians or Canadians watching this can get bored and wonder if there is any sense - well, it's clear, but it's clear to the people who live here today and keep their eyes wide open ... like Bellocchio. This is certainly not one of his best films and he is not as powerful as Buongiorno, but it is worth seeing ... for Italians living in Italy.
