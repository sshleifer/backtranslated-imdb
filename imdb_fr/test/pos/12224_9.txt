I am continually surprised by the American networks. What is the problem with them? Another very promising series, launched after only 15 episodes and we do not know what will happen to everyone. I really liked this show and I'm so upset that we will never find out what's happening to the characters and the "monsters" of the depths. This show had everything. Humor, suspense, action. What more could you want? Why oh why did we unplug this? It does not mean anything. Buffy went on for 7 sets just like Charmed and as nice as they were, Surface, Invasion and Dead Like Me were even better. It is not because a series reaches very high ratings that if the audience appreciates it a little longer, but more people would accept it and they would end with great success. A season simply does not give the time needed and the networks are far from eager to unplug. They need to know that, like quality wines and cheeses, they need time to mature. <br /> <br /> Bring Surface and Invasion - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
