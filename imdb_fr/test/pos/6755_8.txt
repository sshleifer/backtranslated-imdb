One of Starewicz's longest and strangest movies follows a stuffed dog looking for an orange after being animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who yearns for an orange. The dog falls on an orange after falling from the back of a car about to be sold, but at night he has to protect the orange when he enters an evil nightclub with many weird and scary characters . With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog brings the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. The mascot presents new techniques that I have not seen in Starewicz's films yet. The addition of synchro sound and a mix of live action and stop-motion animation gives a new twist to Starewicz's old puppet style. The live scenes of moving cars and the feet of people walking while the puppet is sitting on the concrete sidewalk are impressive and fresh. Car horns and shouting street vendors are noteworthy, as small studio shootings have been expensive and Starewicz's use of the new technology looks old. The new puppet characters in this film are scary contributions to the devil club scene. Twigs and shreds of newspapers come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs that hatch skeleton chicks. The characters arrive from everywhere by tapping pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses fast zooms, obtained through editing, to accelerate the pace of what could have been a slow scene before. Overall, Starewicz is able to update his film-making style to meet the demands of a new audience, making this film one of the best examples of his work.
