"North & South", the TV mini-series is in the 80's what "Rich Man, Poor Man" was the 70's. <br /> <br /> It's a Fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy of author John Jakes. The story itself covers the two decades leading up to the election of President Abraham Lincoln and the imminent proclamation of the Civil War - North versus South. The intertwining stories revolve around the Hazard families (the "North" in the title) and Hands and their two central characters, George and Orry, who form a friendship during their training at West Point in 1842. <br /> "North & South" is a wonderful historical chronology and, as I grow up (and become wiser!), I am very interested in knowing the contrasting attitudes towards controversial aspects such as "Slavery" and "Abolitionists", and how these attitudes originated. <br /> <br /> The series also describes a great development of the characterization, as we get to know the friends and foes in the life of George and Orry, as well as the women who stole their hearts when they were youth. This aspect of the story also reveals a romantic story that unfolds in the turbulent context of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "North and South", as well as "Rich Man, Poor Man" is eclipsed by the 1977 "Roots" is the largest mini-series of all time. However, he comes in second / third position and also shares the same type of timeline and themes as "Roots". But do not let this one escape, even if it's just to see the beautiful scenery, the costumes and the shining stars of the cast, including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland and Lesley-Anne Down. et al. <br /> <br /> The series is beautifully designed and is firmly tied to historical events. Too bad the Emmys and Golden Globes have not honored many more actors and actresses for their portraits. Patrick Swayze and James Read, the two main actors virtually unknown at the time, perform compelling performances under the names of Orry Main and George Hazard respectively. However, it is the captivating performance of Kirstie Alley as George 'Abolitionist' sister, Virgilia, who steals the show several times. In addition, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff, of Elkanah Bent, are the delicious villains of the room you love to hate. <br /> <br /> "North & South" Books 1 and 2 are now available on DVD.
