This is a good little movie about the life of a man (Peter Coyote) who lives a middle-class life in a perfect suburb while one night the police burst into his house and took him arrested for the murder of a guy 27 years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> In his prison cell, Coyote tells his wife of the tragic events of 27 years ago and explains how he got in touch with Wayne Kennedy, the man he allegedly killed. <br /> <br /> From there, the story is told flashback and more you will learn about Wayne and Coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did, the more you are interested. <br /> <br /> The action is not a favorite subject, even if the guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty scary. The real highlight of the film is this mystery of what really happened on the mountain. The woman spends the film looking for clues to the mystery and whenever something new comes up, we are treated with a new flashback revealing more mystery. It's rather good. <br /> <br /> So, in the case of television movies for life, this little film is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
