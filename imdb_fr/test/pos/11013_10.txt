Fassbinder's film, of course, does not contain any massive firearms and pyrotechnics, but also a lot of "artistic" elements, but the atmosphere it creates is intense and raises the question of how we can know this. which is real in a dark and captivating way. making it a cooler and a thriller for the mind.
