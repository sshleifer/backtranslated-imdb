Even if you do not generally enjoy documentaries, you'll find this one fascinating. It has not only a well-traced outline which, though easy to follow, contains interesting detours; it also has a very strong emotional resonance and not one that relies on a specific and simple tone. Instead, the emotions here are as deep and turbulent as the seas presented. <br /> <br /> That said, if you do not know anything about Donald Crowhurst and the one-handed boat race in 1968 around the world ... as was the case for me ... if please stop reading, and rent / see this movie. <br /> <br /> THE SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> My friend Brian recommended this to me at the same time that my aunt had sent me a cut linking this film to the work of Antonioni. In 2007, I was fascinated by many Antonioni's films, I am always! To link this film to Antonioni, I think it's a little exaggerated, the character most likely to be seen in one of Michaelangelo's films is Fran√ßoise Moitessier de Cazalet. It's funny on IMDb's main page, it's not even listed as playing "Himself", which is probably a function of his long name, as opposed to his own realization / surrender. Since Moitessier is at the start of the race, we could consider that it's a bit like Anna in L'Avventura. Major minor character. <br /> <br /> Although there are many things to love in this film: the real images of the time, the best stoic friend, the power of the roaring forties, I left with simple connection. A man really at sea. There were times in my life where I wondered how I could get to such a point, caught between dreams and reality and feel like a stowaway. I may read too much in this documentary and the filmmakers in turn read too much in Crowhurst, but I found this meaning as captivating as the other secrets kept in this film. <br /> <br /> On the odd luck that Crowhurst's wife (who seemed to be a remarkable study, contained with contradictory subtleties) and her children (so young in the film found, and still young at that date late in the sense of pain and pride of their father), I am certain that the comments here and the film itself fail to catch the man that your father was. In his death however, he gave the world a glimpse of something like a lost myth, he is a pre-GPS Ulysses. To never find one's body only adds to the frail immortality, if not to the stature of a cosmic being of which he was the author. This film remains after the viewing, as if you were expecting another turn to emerge from the deep waters. Or at least, you hope for the continuation of Moitessier. <br /> <br /> Thurston Hunger 8/10
