Despite the fact that some aspects of this film did not seem to me enough developed, I appreciated it and I would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are excellent in their leading roles. The basic premise of the film is that both were after broken marriages when they met. Both are also seeking to heal. Unexpectedly, they discover that they can help heal each other. There were aspects of the film that I would have liked to see played more often - simple hot flashes simply suggested themes on which my mind had to fill in the blanks, such as the apology to the grieving widower and the way Adrienne felt bad. guilty of having slept with Paul and feeling well soon after. An opportunity for a great love scene was lost when it was simply suggested that they make love with the coming hurricane. But in the end, the film left me deeply grateful for the relationship my wife and I share. And there were moments that moved me to the brink of tears. So, I must say that it is worth watching.
