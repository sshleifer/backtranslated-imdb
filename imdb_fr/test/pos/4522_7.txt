Chan is in New York and is involved in an attempt to sabotage a new model aircraft. <br /> <br /> The war was in over a year before reaching America, but the Second World War was already raging around the world. and so it all colored because most people probably understood that the war was imminent. Here, we do not talk about the war, but the fact that the film deals with the production of aircraft is at least alluding to it. The mystery itself is pretty good, the concept of plane sabotage lends itself well to a few rather tense moments. To be certain, we are talking about Charlie Chan so that we can be sure that he will live to fight another day, but nothing guarantees the state he would be in, and not if anyone around him would survive. . <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. This is not one of the nests, and far from the worst. It's one of the really rare things, really nice. Well worth a look or six.
