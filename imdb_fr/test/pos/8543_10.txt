I saw this film for the first time in Papua New Guinea in 1967 and I have remembered it ever since, although I had never seen it since this first time. <br /> <br /> The lives of good people can be destroyed easily existed then and is still a memory that will haunt me forever. <br /> <br /> The film is funny and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by Anthony Quinn is superb. <br /> <br /> This film should be included in all university studies on the inhumanity of man to man.
