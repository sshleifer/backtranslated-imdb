This film is a very nice tribute to Bogart and other crime movies of yesteryear. Robert Sacchi describes it as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a truly timeless beauty like Gena Anastas. <br /> <br /> However, the most notable part of this movie is about the longest belly dance scene ever produced in a Hollywood movie. A well-known professional instructor commented that nothing in the cinema gets close to the excitement of dancing. <br /> <br /> The scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, takes place in a lush and gorgeous Middle Eastern nightclub and is, in all respects, fascinating. Thrilling music, swirling sails and sound cymbals, flowing ripples and gorgeous costumes - and a surprise twist involving the alluring Sybil Danning - create tension and excitement all the way through. <br /> <br /> The three talented and beautiful professional club dancers are led by the exotic brunette beauty Kamala Almanzar, one of the greatest American belly dancers since the mid-1970s. The famous Armenian musician Guy Chookoorian the chose to travel with his band on the road. The whole of Guy is the live band in which the dancers perform. If you watch the trailer on this site, you will see a preview of Kamala (playing finger cymbals behind Sybil Danning). <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a fan of belly dancing, you will watch this movie after seeing it and if you are an aficionado, it resists very well after repeated viewing.
