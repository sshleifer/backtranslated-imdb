THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a great example of anti-80 film. While many other films of the decade lacked substance, this film is a pure substance. There is nothing elegant, fake or superfluous about it. It offers two great performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, still friends of Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee, respectively. Hutton, Penn and Tom Cruise were part of the triumvirate of actors of the early 80s who all wanted to turn to much bigger and better things (the three played in TAPS). While the popularity of Penn and Cruise has soared, Hutton has been largely forgotten, and that's a shame. In fact, Hutton is the first of 3 to win an Oscar for his role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980, but I think his performance in this film is even more remarkable. <br /> <br /> Hutton really captures the post-Vietnam era. the rebellion of war in his character Chris Boyce. A student in failing the seminary, Chris has a love-hate relationship with his father that is well performed by the great actor Pat Hingle. The scene where Chris quotes the poem his father thought he had long forgotten is particularly powerful. <br /> <br /> Chris finds a job at the Department of Defense and uses his hatred of the US government and his foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviets. He asks his friend Daulton, a self-serve hyper-drug dealer, to be the mail of the microfilm project plans. While Chris does it based on his beliefs, Daulton does it for his money. The Soviet liaison is excellently played by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a quirky chemistry and a kind of fun exchange between them. But make no mistake, this movie is anything but that. It's a serious study of pessimism, malaise, paranoia and mistrust. <br /> <br /> Again, the main roles make this movie. Hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Chris, a rather intelligent young man with a lot of potential. As usual, Penn incredibly embodies Daulton, a pathetic loser who acts before thinking and who, for the most part, does not think at all. The end of this factual film is very painful on many levels. A really powerful character study.
