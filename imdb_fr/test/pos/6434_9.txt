Co-directed and performed by Rutger Hauer, this short film is based on a short story by Dutch writer Harry Murlisch. <br /> <br /> During the 10 minutes of the movie, you will have the chance to live a life "Harry" unties his fascination for a long time for a play that he constantly passes in his youth. Back in the city many years later, he discovers that he rented the same room. <br /> <br /> Using black and white film, the textures are accentuated in this delicate story of a tale. The voice of "Harry" draws you into his world. <br /> <br /> A subtle and tight performance by Rutger Hauer and 2 non-speaking characters. Beautiful soundtrack of the Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> At the moment, it is difficult to see this film because it is only available on the DVD Region 2 "The Unfaithful" (Liv Ullman) as a bonus. But the reissued movie "The Hitcher" should appear - another tight performance but very different from Hauer! <br /> <br /> See this film if you can!
