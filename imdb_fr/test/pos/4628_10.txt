It was fascinating. I could not just look away. As the film was spinning, I began to feel that it was powerful and confronting, but I did not know how much more intense it would become. <br /> <br /> The film gives a glimpse of what is unfortunately the daily life of many schoolchildren. Some of us live outside of this environment and are not aware of what is happening. <br /> <br /> Parents need to see this particular movie, just to get a glimpse of what their kids are going through. Parents often think that their children's problems are insignificant, but unfortunately they are huge. And unfortunately, problems can escalate into tragedy. <br /> <br /> A must for everyone.
