Words alone can not describe the beauty and power of this film. <br /> <br /> Think "Toy Story". Now think about "Toy Story" around 1934. Now imagine that the animation looks as realistic as fluid. Imagine that the film is not appreciated by adults and children but imagine it as a film noir. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to do something like this in 1934. In a way, "The mascot" keeps its promises. In a story where toys come to life, one of which tries to give an owner a sick orange, Starewicz offers an unexpected level of animation. It's so fluid that you'll wonder for a long time if what you're seeing is really frame-by-frame animation. <br /> <br /> The comparison between "Toy Story" and "The Mascot" is a trivial exercise in terms of intrigue: while "Toy Story" is a story for children, adults can enjoy it, "The mascot" is dark and scary. story for adults. That means, NO, your kids will not like it. A little. <br /> <br /> Yet, get it if you can. You may be able to find it along "Vampyr" on DVD and LaserDisc. And get ready to be stunned by what Starewicz was able to do in 1934 with some puppets.
