I really like this series. his funny and unique style of quirky comedy, sometimes controversial, is a new interpretation of the genre. Although this is a sitcom, it stands out for topics that could be embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Every aspect has a comic twist and the show is really very good. My favorite part of the program are the rather strange comments from the father, Dave. his ravings break the program and allow a very good flow. not perfect, because sometimes the comedy is not funny, and actors sometimes seem to wait for a response from the public, but otherwise, this program is good. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it, and I am very sad that it has been canceled. please do another series, and finish it properly
