In S.O.S of Tweety, Sylvester goes from collecting garbage cans to smuggling on a cruise ship carrying a certain canary and Granny, its owner. Uh-Oh! Again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to catch the bird. Sylvester also has seasickness many times. And the second time the red-nosed cat goes to the spot on the boat that has something that cures its ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now, Sylvester can blow! I'll stop here and say it's another great cartoon by Friz Freling featuring the popular duo of cats and birds. The S.O.S of Tweety is highly recommended.
