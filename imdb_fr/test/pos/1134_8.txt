So, when I first saw advertisements for Greek, I asked myself some questions about how they would approach Greek life, if they wanted to reveal sacred secrets of brotherhood and sorority, they had to focus on brotherhood and fraternity, a brotherhood. or sorority brings, or what most college students think of Greek life as a big party. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it covered everything. The plot of the story was great, it gave you a character to love, to hate, someone you want to be, someone you do not want to be, and of course a crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> one of my first glances at what writers thought about Greek life, and I can honestly say that they managed to silence the point. <br /> <br /> I love how one of the greatest things they have covered all season is the relationship between Rusty and his mad roommate. It's quite difficult to leave the house and to be forced to live in a small room with someone you do not even know, come find out ... you have nothing in common. The worst nightmare is probably the worst nightmare of every university. <br /> <br /> Rustys sister, Casey, was pretty much the typical campus girl that everyone is jealous of. What did not she have? Oh that's right ... Evan for herself. Rebecca and Evan had an "affair" early in the season, which made you feel pretty good for Casey. His character evolved and his relationship with Rusty became more and more affectionate and sociable. <br /> <br /> Cappie is one of the most amusing characters, absolutely crazy. One of my favorite episodes included that he was completely trashed to a strip club and that Rusty had to call Casey to bail him out. I like the way they approached the issue of homosexuals in Greek homes. Calvin was a very real character and I really respected him because he met his criteria. So Jen K was pretty crazy, but she liked Rusty. It was surprising and I continued to interrogate her from the beginning, but of course I wanted it to be between her and Rusty. <br /> <br /> I'm really looking forward to finding Greek. It takes you to the truth of Greek life, which many people watch. Parties and drinking parties are one of the most well-known fraternities and sororities. Greek is a great show and the characters are easy to understand.
