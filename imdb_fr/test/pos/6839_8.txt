It was the first directorial work of Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Snakes on Plane and Gothika. Anyone who read my reviews knows that I love capers and that it was a doozy. An abduction and a woman shot in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson on the kidnapping case and the police chief (Roscoe Lee Browne) has tasked Alan Rickman with resolving the murder, which happens to be the wife of a Senator (Hal Holbrook). These two men are a remarkable couple working together. <br /> <br /> The kidnappers / murderers have lovers, Simon Baker (Land of the Dead) and the hot Carla Gugino (Sin City), as well as two partners. . They kidnapped a mogul from the computer and ran his accountant around the city before getting the dough. Things go quickly from there as new twists are introduced. Everything is brilliant and undoubtedly a "piss in your pants because you can not go to the bathroom or you will miss something". Now, to be quite honest, I would have given this film a 10 if there had been more film than the security guard was watching in the opening movie. I would have liked to see more Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but, hey, that was not part of the caper; just the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Thompson and Rickman should definitely do more movies together. A treat: <br /> <br /> Agent Hawkins: Complete me. Detective Friedman: This remark could be misinterpreted as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get away then: you have never worked under a female superior before. I got to where I am by pushing paper and playing nicely - I had never shot with a firearm before, I can only prove to my father that I am not a coward. I'm decent, I'm promoted to all worthy candidates, all men, all equally talented for fellatio, but there was a quota of women to fill. I am also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical and you are usually right. I am secretly in love with you but I have trouble showing it. Have I forgotten something? <br /> <br /> Heck, it's a great dialogue! Gutierrez not only directs a good movie, but he also knows how to write! <br /> <br /> And have I already said that Carla Gugino was hot? <br /> <br /> Put this on your list.
