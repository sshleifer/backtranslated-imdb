William Shakespeare probably did not consider Stephanos as a homosexual doctor, Antonio as an unfaithful wife, or Caliban as a ride with a Trinitron, but the Bard had worse to do his good work over time and could even take advantage of the sumptuous parade of life. it's his "Tempest" reconfigured by Paul Mazursky and his co-author Leon Capetanos. <br /> <br /> This time, Prospero is Philip Dimitrius (John Cassevetes), a Manhattan-based architect tired of designing Atlantic City casinos for the lovable mafia Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after discovering that Alonso had an affair with Philip's wife, Antonia (Gena Rowlands). In the company of his daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip escapes to an isolated Greek island with Miranda and his new mistress Aretha (Susan Sarandon), a pretty Catholic girl who struggles with Philip's unmarried lifestyle. Will a sudden storm eventually work out? <br /> <br /> Here is a reflection on Cassevetes' career: how many other actors could make such a confused film such a fascinating reality? Darling film critics for his previous work, often with his real wife Rowlands, he presents a central character who is really suffering for his art here, but seems to have fun and makes us love too. It is not Prospero, but something rich and strange that contributes to a tremendous change in depth. <br /> <br /> "It's all here," he says to one of his faithful companions, Aretha's dog, Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and serenity." That's all. "Tempest" transfers 1611 London around 1982 to Manhattan and finds beautiful resonances in Philip's misplaced life. "Show me the magic," he cries out in a storm-ridden cityscape, and Mazursky's version, complemented by Donald McAlpine's exceptional cinematic quality on crimson seascapes and naturally sunny Greek landscapes, makes exactly that. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie, far from it. In fact, the grand finale, which is the only part of the film that faithfully follows Shakespeare's story, is a disaster. The character of Rowland is hard to cherish in this movie. After meeting Sarandon in all his glory, it is difficult to understand Philip's persistent concern for his wife, not to mention his left-wing desire to make an unfortunate "sacrifice" in order to restore the natural order of things. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot to love about "Tempest". In addition to Cassavetes, Ringwald makes her film debut as a faithful but concerned girl. Here in the room, an object of desire for the rustic primitive "Kalibanos" (Raul Julia). Ringwald is pretty much the same teenage teenage muse who would inspire John Hughes, but with emotional depth, Hughes' latest films have not been touched on. Ringwald and Julia have never caught the attention of the Oscars, but they would both win Golden Globes for their mischievous work here. He tries to seduce her in his isolation on the island with his TV rebroadcasts of "Gunsmoke" in Greek, tempted by his body aged 15 years. <br /> <br /> "I want to hang out with my beautiful johnny," Kalibanos claims to be dismissed but still a winner, especially after playing "New York, New York" with a chorus of goats. (When "Tempest" appeared on the screens, Julia was the star of "Nine" with Broadway.) <br /> <br /> This is Mazursky's show, even if we sometimes have the impression that Cassavetes plays with an improvised line. readings and emotional breakdowns galore. (Philip goes to Aretha and says "I'm in the middle of a nervous breakdown.") He plays his character as an obsessive lover, seeking to crystallize his happiness by building a theater on his otherwise uninhabited island. <Br /> <br /> Gassman's pleasure in playing is just as pleasant as the other man's, just as kind as Julia, while telling Philip, a youth obsessed with youth, "The boys have not half as much money as we do.They are nervous ... and they make love in the back of an old sports car. "Despite its length and pretension, like many art films, "Tempest" entertains his excesses and his trip is very similar to the one Shakespeare had planned, even though his dreams were not about smoking marijuana at a Go-Gos concert.
