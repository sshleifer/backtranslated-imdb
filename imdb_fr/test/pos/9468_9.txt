I saw this film during a special screening. At first, I thought the movie would look like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The film is based on Shakespeares' book The Twelth Night. This film tells the story of a girl who lives to play football. Well, when the girls 'team is cut, she must try to be part of the boys' team from another school to take revenge on the team of selfish boys from her old school. On her way, she is caught in a long network entangled with love, lies and deception. This movie is this year Mean Girls. I think that shows excellent new player capabilities and that big stars need to be featured in this film.
