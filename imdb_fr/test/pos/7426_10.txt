a beautiful romantic comedy. Errol Flynn shows how good he was at comedy. a talent that probably shows some of his real joker. the comic writing on this film is excellent. Eleanor Parker is doing a good job as Flynn's ex-wife, who is trying to win back. Eleanor is also nice for the eyes. the sets give off the glamor and style of the 1940s, if any. <br /> <br /> Flynn's sense of humor and comic spirit are fully displayed here, look at his double taps, his ability to counter verbally with a quick return or to act as a straight man. , and his total credibility and sincerity, if any, this guy could act! It's a shame that Ferrol did not have the chance to play more roles like this throughout his career, he was extremely talented. if you liked "it happened one night" with Gable and Colbert or some of the comedies of William Powell and Myrna loy, you will enjoy this fun and fun evening. a diamond lost from a film.
