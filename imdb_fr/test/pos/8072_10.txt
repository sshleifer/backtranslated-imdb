I did not see such a movie where the creators put so much blood into their work and paid close attention to the finer details for a very long time. <br /> <br /> Everything was well thought out and perfectly put into practice. The work on camera, editing and composition worked so well together that it was amazing. The titles were so amusing and so perfectly choreographed. <br /> <br /> This film simply dazzled me. <br /> <br /> The "confrontation" could have been reduced by 10 to 15 minutes. This is an almost perfect tribute to the first silent black film. The story, the acting, the sets and the costumes were perfectly adapted and credible to have come from the time of the silent cinema.
