Dead or Alive: Final, the film supposed to bring together the three films of the very loose Dead or Alive trilogy, and mainly linked by its stars, Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa, and stating that each film has its share of bizarre montages and neuroses. world and lots of violence, is certainly the weakest of the lot. The fact that none of the three films ended up being a disappointment shows less the creativity of the material than the courage of the director, Takashi Miike, in terms of the environment and the material. He presents here an openly dystopian, even discreet, future where a homosexual mayor / dictator (Richard Chen) is drugging the entire village with the exception of a group of rebels. There are also replicants - robots - in this year of 2346, one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a complete lethal mastery robot, but also capable of loving and learning, etc. Then a cop, Takeshi (Takeiuchi) happens to be the best guard of the mayor. But things are starting to spoil on both sides, with Ryo joining forces with the rebels and Takeshi with his employer, although bloody excesses as a compromise with a hostage gone awry, and Takeshi discovers that his wife and son are robots an extraterrestrial mood, you notice, suddenly, as if the electricity was off), and that he was himself one. And all this leads to one last inexplicable confrontation between the two men. <br /> <br /> Strange that there is another movie where Miike has ups and downs here, sometimes finding the ground for success where science fiction can make sense of it. But there is really nothing to be gained from this story, except that the mayor / dictator is an uneventful dingbat who does well by making sure his drug prevents couples from getting pregnant and that all stays under control. He also has with him his loving slave, I suppose, in the hilarious part of a saxophone player who does not speak, who also sometimes plays a human role when he does not blur the bad mood blues. In the meantime, we have the conventional sides of the Ryo and Takeshi stories, and they are never uninteresting, they just are not convincing enough to hold the interest. Of course, Miike is not before the fun, as when Takeshi sends Michelle (Maria Chen) into the water to make her swim after an assassination attempt against the mayor, or the original rebel leader speaks English for no reason . good reason at all. There's even a fun tribute to old science fiction cartoons at the beginning of the film. But nothing is very convincing from the point of view of the substance, with the exception of Takeshi's minor twists that have become "good" in the middle of the film (helping a couple cope with the right to have a child) , and this time Miike's forces are purely stylistic and the choice of locations and scenery. <br /> <br /> It's like a grungy Japanese Alphaville where everything still has a contemporary look through all the special effects. And I really liked the yellow-green hue that Miike used in the film, because it had a very good impact in the outdoor scenes and added enough roughness to the indoor scenes. But as far as peaks and valleys are concerned, we're seeing more and more clearly - and the level of visual effects of science fiction movie chains, with maybe a few extra dollars - during the heyday. This contains some of the funniest elements of the director's most delusional Freudian sensibility, even if it must begin with an unbearable device; The way Ryo and Takeshi meet at last is a kind of chance and a way for producers to try to link the last two films cheaply when it was not necessary. On the other hand, with regard to the purely culpable entertainment value of a film like Miike's, where we see something totally unexpected and very grossly sexual, the film ranks among the best scenes of Happiness of the Katakuris and Visitor Q. Overall, Dead or Alive: Final is a ridiculous 90-minute effort that is not taken TOO Seriously seriously, and that is all the better for its perverse devices, its militaristic decadence and its Cultural blockages highlighted at the dough level.
