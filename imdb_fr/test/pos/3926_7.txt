** 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. <br /> <br /> Yet another classic horror movie remade with a game of teenagers head dunder despite deaths of grizzly and creators. Inspired by Vincent Price's House of Wax, published in 1953, a maniac kills unsuspecting hooligans and turns them into priceless wax characters. The film is still a classic horror remake, like Tobe Hooper's 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was redone later, despite its creativity and mediocre playing. The director Serra has shown a moderate enthusiasm with his staging, but nevertheless deserves to be viewed. My final score 7/10.
