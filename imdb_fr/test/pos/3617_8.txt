I must admit that I approached this film with a feeling of expectation and fear. The best-selling novel by Louis de Bernière is one of my favorites and anyone who reads it will realize that there is no chance that the adaptation to the screen is 100% faithful. <br /> <br /> Throughout my career, I convinced myself that the film had failed and that I had got rid of the plot of the book to make it superfluous. The end is however much better than that of the novel and I could not help but think about the film later. Nevertheless, the positives (the magnificent cinematography of John Toll, the beautiful score of Stephen Warbeck, etc.) have, in my opinion, not exceeded my initial negatives (the poor diffusion of Cage, a very diluted scenario). was queuing again to see Corelli, and although that was not perfect, I must admit that the movie is what everyone could hope for better. Cage is really brilliant in a role that, even Berniere was concerned, was not a complete character: his carefree spirit that leaves room for broken remorse is perfect and perfectly complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt. David Morrissey is discreetly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer who tries to reconcile his feelings for his new Italian friends and his superiority complex inherent in his entourage. And the beautiful Greek-Italian support troop revives dazzling Cepholonia bloody universe of De Bernière. history of the second world war Cepholonia in kinematic terms. My hat goes to John Madden who, despite the almost-awaited criticism he receives from British critics (any director having had a great success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is still a target for these ninnies moaning!), Managed to transfer a book terribly difficult to the big screen with so much heart, verve and humanity (the basic virtues of the novel) that he created another classic love story that will probably be fully appreciated only when the dust has dissipated In some years. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the book, like me, it is difficult, but try not to make the same mistake during your initial viewing. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bask in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr. Iannis, as if for the first time (act as if you were watching an original screenplay). and I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can not wait to get your own copy of this film on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> 8/10
