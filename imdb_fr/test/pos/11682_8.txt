Let's start by saying first that I have been a fan of punk almost all my life. I've always had a bit of disrespect for the Los Angeles scene of the early '80s, documented by The Decline of Western Civilization, with the exception of X and Black Flag, which is more of a New York punk and from English. After seeing this movie, it has completely changed. The people presented may look like a bunch of idiotic and bandaged kids who think they can do something beyond their lifestyle, but it's a great display of hedonism at its best, coupled with a fun and entertaining game. powerful. One of the best, and most insightful, scenes is Claude Bessy's interview with Catholic Discipline, or "Kick-Boy," as the readers of Slash magazine called it. Of French origin, he is passionate about punk like a dirty old French and gives viewers clues about many aspects of punk, DIY, attitude towards music, politics and life in general. Darby Crash of the Germs seems to be a complete idiot most of the time, but Manimal's performance in germs is rather decent, complemented by young Pat Smear. Black Flag's performance with Chavo Pederast on vocals (she was shot a few years before Henry Rollins joins the band) is correct, and X and FEAR give the best performances of the film. Watch for interviews with young punk. You'll hear some of the funniest things you've ever seen in a documentary. Highly recommended.
