charming. I love the movie. I want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are superb, spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters was perfect too. I think Rupert is the only red-haired boy I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. I think the movie was awesome and awesome. See Rupert in another aspect, but Harry Potter. and he is a very good actor, so he deserves it and more. he just has a gold globe but he probably deserves an Oscar Academy. there are actors who do not act very well but who have an Oscar anyway. it does not matter. but he is perfect, brilliant and handsome
