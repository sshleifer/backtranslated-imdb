I love this movie, I could watch it again and again. Carlett always gets what she wants, no matter the price. She's really trying to forget Rhett but she just can not do it. She loves him so much. It's a story of true love.It started with the wind and ended up in this movie.The only real way to end this movie for true love.Is to reunite Scarlett and Rhett at the end.And that's how it ended with their daughter and their daughter. What more? There is no better end to this great love story than this one. What can I say more about this great movie?
