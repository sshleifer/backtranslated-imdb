Wagon Master (1950) Director: John Ford <br /> <br /> Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO radio footage <br /> <br /> John Ford takes the stock company to the Utah desert for film a western out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicting anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a picture jewel. <br /> <br /> This ensemble piece features Ben Johnson (Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They are horse traders who come to town to do business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are shown the way out. The group is about to embark on an expedition to their own encampment, but they know that the odds and the hostile terrain are against them. They hire Travis and Sandy as wagon masters for their trip. Along the way, they meet and take a drug vendor and his two cohorts (Alan Mowbray as a doctor, recalling his appearance in My Darling Clementine and Joanne Dru as a "girl"). The tension is added when the murderous gang Clegg arrives on the wagon train. And there is also an atypical encounter (for Hollywood) with the Navajos. <br /> <br /> Most of the story and humor are motivated by the clash of ideals / cultures; first between Travis and Sandy and the Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (he constantly tries to suppress his urge to curse and be a reformed man), between the doctor and his ladies and the Mormons, between the train of trolleys and outlaws, and finally, everyone and the Navajo. There is also a classic Ford scene in which a rowdy dance expresses one of its emblematic themes of civilization approaching the border. <br /> <br /> Again, no Duke here, but I found Ben Johnson, especially the young, confident, Ben Johnson, to have an engaging screen presence. He comes with his own story, with this trail and also when you see him doing the whole waterfall himself. He's great here on one of his first credited appearances. Harry Carey Jr., although he's been around for a few years now, is still pretty rough at times, but he's nice. Ward Bond is his usual and wonderful self. I found Joanne Dru like a trail in everything I see her, but here she is happily unobtrusive. Jane Darwell, Francis Ford and Hank Worden also play "stupid", as it will do in The Searchers a few years later. It's not fun anymore here. <br /> <br /> Bert Glennon, a frequent contributor at Ford, offers absolutely spectacular black and white photographs. There is not only the typical master class on landscapes and horizons, there are also some scenes in a handful of scenes with shadow and light (sun). The soundtrack features the country's legendary band, The Sons of the Pioneers. You can not have more cowboys than that. <br /> <br /> *** Â½ out of 4
