All the lines of a comedy are not funny. This film addresses a serious subject, the absence of the right to vote voters and keeps it in the light while telling jokes. This is the movie the Daily Show would have done if they wanted to make a movie. I found Robin Williams much more funny in this film than in RV. And while my wife and I shared opposing political points of view, we both laughed together for several parts of this movie. The writers could give Fox News just and balanced lessons. Lewis Black agreed, but he never really seemed to be able to bring out his own comedy for his role. Christopher Walken was also good, playing his role of discreet support quite common, advancing a story.
