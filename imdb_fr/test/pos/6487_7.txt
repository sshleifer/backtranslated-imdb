Susan Fletcher (Hopkins), heiress of the company, and her wealthy father, Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson), are upset by the fact that their young nieces, Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) lead a bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their uncle artist John (Milland). after the death of their parents (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon stopped trying to convince John to allow Susan and him to take care of the children and used private detectives to catch him in inappropriate or unemployed behavior and therefore unable to take care of their children. Susan finally decides to take things in hand and goes herself to Greenwich Village, pretending to be an actress, to try to obtain information and / or to convince him to see the reason. What she discovers, however, is that she not only enjoys the free and artistic lifestyle of John and her friends, and that the girls are well-behaved, but that she soon falls in love with John. Inevitably, her true identity is discovered and she must convince all parties in the custody debate who should belong to whom. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and found that it was very short. The race time (70 minutes) was the ideal time to turn this simple but endearing story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great actresses of the years 1930-1940, is delightful in this film. Her energy, style, and wholesome beauty lend themselves to the creation of an endearing character, even if you know she is quickly attacking the people with whom she is quickly bonding. This is the first film in which I saw Ray Milland. He was actually young and did not look patrician. (And apparently three years younger than his co-star) His energy and recklessness in "Wise Girl" was a refreshing change in the behavior he's affecting in his darker films. Honestly, although I'm not usually a fan of kids acting, I really enjoyed the two girls who played Susan's niece. They were early lovable and were really the jewels of the movie. Unfortunately, I can not find any other movies that either have been after this one, which is a shame, as they have both presented a large amount of natural talent. <br /> <br /> "Wise Girl" was a movie This film was shot three years after the introduction of the Hollywood code and, to some extent, it was clearly seen in the happy ending and happy ending, as well that the beauty of the sky and the ease with which the characters lived. The so-called bohemian cooperative was in fact a beautiful cul-de-sac where artists lived for free or commercial, and everything is very well connected. Fortunately, it was a fairly light film and the characters were charming enough to take into account his fluffiness and flaws and I was able to take "Wise Girl" for what he was; a good love story that is both entertaining and endearing. Unfortunately, romantic / dramatic comedy films are much less intelligent and entertaining today, otherwise I would not be returning to the classics all the time. 7/10
