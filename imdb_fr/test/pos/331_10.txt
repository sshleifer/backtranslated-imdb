You do not have to be a Tamilian to appreciate this jewel of a movie. I do not know a word of tamil and I only saw this film because a friend recommended it to me. without knowing the language is difficult enough but I could tell the story because the main actors (and the actresses) have really been very emotional. And the little girl was really cute (she was not irritating as a child actor in most Hindi movies). Mr. Ratnam for trying something different. Relationships between parents and their children are shown very realistically (I could relate to the characters in the movie). It was a film that will stay in my heart forever and I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends. Besides, the songs are just amazing! They were beautifully illustrated.If only I could understand the meaning of the words :(
