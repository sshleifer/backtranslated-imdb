I play this game exactly after watching the trailer of an old magazine in a magazine ... <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is very interesting and dark (it lacks in games / movies current). The game takes place somewhere in the mid-90s in the mysterious spooky mansion. You play the role of Adam Randell and your quest is to free the soul of your father trapped in death. <br /> <br /> The look of the game looks like an unfortunate game, but very different. This old classic game features many action games, puzzles, quests, mazes and many other interesting places and characters. <br /> <br /> The game only works on Windows 98 and no patch is available for Windows XP.
