Plunkett & Macleane are part of my favorite movie genre (comedic action adventure), which probably explains why I like it so well. <br /> <br /> The action is centered around a highwayman (Plunkett) and a "gentleman" who gets entangled with him and his stratagems (Macleane). This leads to all sorts of adventures and adventures tinged with comedy. There is also, of course, a love interest. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast consists of several dynamic characters, larger than life, which add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the rich at that time. <br /> <br /> It's a nice film with a simple but worthwhile plot that offers a lot of entertainment.
