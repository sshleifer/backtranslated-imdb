Even if this film starts as usual: something is wrong, a spaceship hangs, people are stuck, etc. It is triggered anyway and presents the viewer with new ideas. Riddick is a bit of a tough guy and has changed his eyes so he can see in the dark a desirable ability due to the situation of the ship's crew and its arrival. The break in the film is very good and highlights the mystique surrounding the anti-hero and the male protagonist: "Riddick". As already mentioned, the story of Pitch Black is, to a certain extent, very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the clippings of the film mingled with surprising elements that have been added to the story helped him to keep up very well, and one subsequently left with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel plays very well in the role of Riddick and, even though his character is a hardcore and hard survivor, he always makes decisions on morale almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean that his decisions do not turn to its advantage. ... Why destroy an already perfect reputation? Overall, it's a very good movie but not perfect. The story seems very original on the surface, but below it shines with enough originality to entertain. Some scenes have this amazing factor, while overall it is a little better than average. This could perhaps be described as a cult movie and it is certainly a recommendation for those who want a sci-fi story embellished with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely Riddick.
