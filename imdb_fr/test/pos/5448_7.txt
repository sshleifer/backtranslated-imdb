Now, I'm a bit biased because I'm a big fan of late-night television. I've been a loyal fan of Jay Leno for about 6 or 7 years and I think he's one of the funniest and most talented comedians. And David Letterman is also a hell of a comedian, although I only watch his show (unless Jay does it again) during commercials or when he has a better guest than Jay on the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both excellent actors. They looked a lot like Jay and Dave, but did they disappear into the characters? Nope. Roebuck can not understand Jay's voice and expression, mumbling loudly, evoking the castrato of Marlon Brando. Higgins nails David's facial expressions (for example, his trademark) but he does not slap Dave's voice. Those who are not big fans of late-night television might be much less biased. There are a couple of comics who can make an absolute imitation of Jay. Why could not they choose one of them for the play? And the same thing with Dave. I would prefer Norm McDonald to play the role. Norm does not look much like Dave, but he did it on SNL. "Hey ... do you have chewing gum?" It was so hilarious! <br /> <br /> However, I learned a lot about the late-night wars I had very little knowledge of at the beginning. I had never watched The Tonight Show before Jay Leno was the host. I did not know that it was difficult to finally replace Johnny Carson and the countless negotiations that finally convinced Dave to switch to CBS. I knew very little about what was happening behind the scenes and found the film very informative. And Kathy Bates gives an inimitable performance as a former rude executive producer of "The Tonight Show". She basically steals the movie. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
