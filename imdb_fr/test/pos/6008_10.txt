Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Although his experience is essentially comical, he shows here that he knows how to play theater as well or perhaps even better (although there is a lot of humor in all this). It's hard to turn a blind eye to his American accent, especially since his character is supposed to be English, but it's only a minor thing. <br /> <br /> All the bad guys are as well melted: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O'Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Although most of them are tiny people or giants, they are 100% believable in everything they do and their motives are very clear, for example Lilliputians constantly suspect Gulliver, Grildrig, the hate of dwarf (giant) against him for having usurped his role as court jester, the attempt of Dr. Bates to make Gulliver mad to marry Mary. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen is awesome like Mary Gulliver (another 17th century English character with an American accent, but never mind). She is deeply tormented because she has been waiting for nine years for her husband to come back and when he does, he talks about tiny people, giants, a flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong fantasy of the story, is a very credible character. <br /> <br /> The special effects are breathtaking especially if you consider that it was filmed on a televised scale at a time when CGI was in its infancy. It seems very realistic when you see a man six feet tall walking in a city populated by six-inch people. <br /> <br /> Cameos are excellent too: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All the big players who create a solid cast that complements Danson's superb acting ability. <br /> <br /> The Houynhnhms and the Yahoos are probably the most effective element in the history of the satire side of things: a society of talking horses that have none of the vices that humans have while the Yahoos are primitive and disgusting humans who mate with strength and designate their leader according to his disgust. The study by Gulliver and Mistress is also very well done and shows the differences and similarities between humans and Yahoos. <br /> <br /> The best version of "Gulliver's Travels" by far and one of the best mini-series.
