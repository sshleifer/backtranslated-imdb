This TV series tells the story of a stupid and unconventional English gentleman who faces all kinds of misadventures. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing Mr. Bean with my family in 1990 when I was still a child. My family laughed so loudly with each episode, and the content of it always came back into our daily conversations twenty years later. Memorable scenes that stay in my mind include Mr. Bean trying to get out of his parking lot, turning off the lights, counting sheep, and him in the pool. We bought all Mr Bean videos on VHS, no matter how expensive they were. It was worth it because we watched them again and again! It is so rare to see a very funny television series that is suitable for all ages.
