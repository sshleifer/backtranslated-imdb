This evening took place at the seventh edition of the NYC Home Film Festival, a rather tumultuous place that soothed this sweet and touching film for two women. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two blind, the other, a twenty-year-old man who helps him with his mail - is crafted and his depth is obvious. <br /> <br /> There are no car chases, explosions or mind-boggling special effects - just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of humans struggling to help themselves and each other help. <br /> <br /> See if you can!
