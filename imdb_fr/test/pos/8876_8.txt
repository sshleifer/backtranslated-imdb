Thinking of the movie, I laugh at myself. Anne Ramsey plays an unforgettable role in "Momma", probably the most naughty and hilarious matriarch ever recorded in a movie. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal form a fabulous duet, bringing a real warmth to the film. Although not too complex, the beautiful story holds your attention and makes you laugh all the way through. It's a fun comedy to lighten things and even entertain children. I give him my complete recommendation.
