This film is probably one of the best I have seen so far. I would say it's a second place of All About Lily Chou-chou because it gives me the same atmosphere ... capsule at Mount Fuji Elementary School. they later discover that there was not much there and start in their own way. the first half of the film is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated. it's a comical and serious part of the trip. the second half moved me to tears. As the movie progresses, each character tries to realize his dreams, but unfortunately ends badly. at the end, only 2 of the 9 escapees are left. the way each character left the stage was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes. a beautiful film made fantastically. It's a movie for people who liked Toshiaki Toyoda's other films such as "Blue Spring".
