I can not believe there are people who do not like this movie! I thought it was the funniest movie I had ever seen. It's because I'm the biggest fan of Mel Brooks ... I know almost every word and I'm discouraged to have censored them, when they are broadcast on a family channel. :) This is one of my favorite movies, so I do not know why we would disagree! thank you Kristina
