This film does not deal with soda or the French connection. <br /> <br /> The Seven Ups are a group of elite policemen who use tactics that do not comply with the NYPD protocol. Scheider is at the head of the group with his group or his regular look. They watch a local costra nostra cartel and things go wrong when a cop's wire is discovered. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the most evil man in the film (Invasion: America, Little Nikita) and his partner end up killing the police officer by accident and escape from Scheider in the scene The coolest hunt I've seen, Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as they were in the West Side of George Washington and Palisades Parkway in New Jersey. <br /> <br /> The stuntmen are great and Lynch frees himself, even if he looks frightened by this dangerous trip. Roy Scheider is almost killed when his car hits the back of the Mack truck, tearing off the roof of his vehicle. <br /> <br /> Things get complicated and we must continue to monitor to follow such a sequence. Fast and intense, fresh for thirty years.
