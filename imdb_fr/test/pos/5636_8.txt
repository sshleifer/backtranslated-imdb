For me, the best and most memorable films are often the ones I do not know anything about at the first screening. American Movie is a perfect example of such a jewel. Watching TV late in the evening, I spotted the only good slag critic - luckily I settled for a real treat. American Movie is a documentary that follows the unforgettable Mark Borchardt (pronounced "orchard", I believe), a very articulate and charismatic boy from Wisconson, who strives to write, direct and produce the Mid-West film " of low budget horror "that he has been working for years. Mark discovers a young man full of contrasts. Its appearance is that of the classic stereotype of the trailer-trash: fine and soft mustache, metal style of the 80s, hairstyle mullet, etc. However, on camera, Mark reveals a surprising spirit and insight as he philosophizes about life, love, movies and American style. As the film unfolds, it becomes unfortunate that Mark's lack of discipline and high alcohol consumption are steadily sabotaging his creative efforts. American Movie is a charming watch, filled with hilarious moments and live characters. Among them, Mike's friendly friend, Mike Schank, a reformed stoner with a soft voice who, after defeating his addiction to scratch cards, is now dependent on soda. I absolutely loved the American movie. It generates real empathy between the viewer and the main characters, and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative. I would recommend it to anyone without reservation.
