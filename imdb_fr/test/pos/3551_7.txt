John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also the thief, Arsene Lupine. Although no one knows for sure that this is the case, the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure of it, but can not prove it. So, Lionel spends most of the movie following John - hoping to catch this shiny and slippery thief. <br /> <br /> Even though I liked the movie, I really think I was expecting more and more from him and thought it would be better than a very good time saver. It's because he had John and Lionel Barrymore in the movie and these brothers were such dynamic actors, I think I was expecting sparks and magic, but I did not get them only a glimpse here and there. Now, that does not mean it's a bad movie - it certainly is not. It just did not allow me to be unforgettable or to be a movie that I highly recommend you to watch. Thank you a suitable scenario, the film is pretty good but I was surprised not to hear about French accent in the film when he was supposed to be a French! Plus, the movie did not have much life until it was almost finished. The end was indeed excellent and fun - so good that the film was raised from 6 to 7. It's nice to see it finish in style.
