eXistenZ was a good movie. At first, I wondered what was happening, organic "pods" made from mutant reptiles that connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via an umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> But once it's started, it's a great movie, with some twists and turns with an open end and a positive side of casualness throughout the movie, it's fun too look like you're not sure what's coming next. Security personnel throw metal detectors; they have bone rifles!
