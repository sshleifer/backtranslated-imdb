It's a bewildering, Absurdist Short. A miller dressed in white is heading towards us from a windmill in a desolate landscape. Although the image is reduced, there is an obvious logic here. However, he is stopped by scanning, all black because of his work. They start bickering for no reason - does the pretentious miller insult the sweep of soot? Is it class war? <br /> <br /> Anyway, he peels his opponent with sacks of grain that fly throughout the fight, making unnecessary everything he had done before the fight, making unnecessary the mill to wind, so that everything becomes useless. The miller's grain whitens the blackness of the broom - the later Westerns would not be so subtle, the heroes and villains having a color code. Is there a racial hue here? <br /> <br /> If it was not wonderful enough, the fighters are driven off the screen by a crowd of people from nowhere, a Kafkaesque ending appropriate to a strange story (or is it just the social conscience that rises against a fight that denies order and purpose?), and very unusual in the early silent film era. This mix of comedy, surrealism and absurdity is a clear precursor to BUster Keaton, while the windmill reminds us of one of the great thrillers, Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent".
