I really liked this film, which, in many ways, as Hitchcock has done many times, was a first attempt at a plot he re-made later in his career. What is perhaps most amazing about this, however, is the faceless character of the main characters. After watching, Murray Alper is remembered as a jovial truck driver, Vaughan Glaser's moving tour as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable traveling Freak Show and of course Otto Kruger as a villain. suave and sophisticated, which completely obscure Bob Cummings as a fugitive rather wooden (compare this bridge jump to the similar Harrison Ford waterfall in "The Fugitive" Andrew Davis) and Priscilla Lane whose change of heart and Subsequent love for Cummings has never been so credible. <br /> <br /> The other main The supporting player is of course Hitchcock himself who closes the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. Many people criticize older movies for lacking realistic special effects. My feeling is that with the lack of technology, even trying and transmitting what the director wants to show is an incredible feat. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film carries an anti-fascist message, created at the time of the Second World War, but being a Hitchcock is never the most important thing and the focus is always on the action. It's worth checking out, especially for support roles.
