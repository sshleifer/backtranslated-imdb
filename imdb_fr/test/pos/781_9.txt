I saw it tonight with moderate expectations - if Tartan Films has picked up something and is publishing it, it's usually a good sign, but I'm not usually a fan of Julie Walters, generally hating her roles in comedy (sorry for all fans, but it's something personal - I do not find it funny in comedy). <br /> <br /> It was beautiful, a great performance of all, but Grint and Walters are exceptional! Lots of laughs, a lot of pathos, good timing and a wonderfully rhythmic movie - such an adult movie would not normally be something I would expect so much to love but I can not recommend it enough - and watch Rupert Grint as he matures in a good actor.
