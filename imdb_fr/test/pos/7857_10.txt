This film is not what it seems to be. Clint Eastwood is not Dirty Harry nor a "cowboy" here. The attraction of the film comes from its careful manipulation of the atmosphere and theme. It's a Gothic tale unfolding in the American Civil War and as such any "action" of the film, or its absence, takes place in a house populated by Southern Belles of all ages and all forms. <br /> <br /> The horror has just watched the whole story through the eyes of Clint Eastwood's character. To see it stuck in the house and held captive by women is a very "seductive" experience. And who is "seduced" here exactly? Are women seduced by the incredible appearance of Eastwood? Are we, viewers, seduced by both its sexual appeal and the potentially deviant sexualities it triggers? Or does "seduce" refer to what the director is doing here - holding us back for a short space only to (maybe) let us go? Don Siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing films I've had the pleasure of watching.
