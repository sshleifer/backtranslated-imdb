I discovered this late at night with Turner Classics. I kept telling myself, "I'll turn it off as soon as it stops being funny," but needless to say, I've been watching all the way. <br /> <br /> I'm a movie fan but I never heard about this movie (or if I did it in 1971, I forgot). It's worth watching for Goldie Hawn's performance as a tongue-in-tongue energetic. His game is a revelation in this film. Yes, the screenplay is accurate and excellent (when was the last time they did a comedy in Hollywood with a smart screenplay?), But his acting is extraordinary. I never realized how funny Goldie was and that made her a little sad later in roles such as Laugh-In and Private Benjamin. In her later career, she is far too exaggerated compared to her minimalist and incredibly funny appearance here. Goldie Hawn will make sure this film deserves to be watched again.
