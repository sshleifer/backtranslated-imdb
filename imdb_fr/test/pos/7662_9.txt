Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) is a farm girl from the country who comes to the city in search of love. She met a man who told him about an astrologer who will show him the stars. It's a journey of souls ... Eliza is put to the test, can she realize her true love when she sees it or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker trying to find his native heritage. They are different ways of looking at things. All the while, Eliza is still looking for love and Tommy is trying to protect the store on which her grandmother lives. It's a twisted story to look beyond the obvious and find beauty in the simple things of everyday life. The style is artistic and overflowing with symbolism. The psychedelic style of the camera can frighten average viewers, but the deeper message and interesting images make this movie interesting to watch. It is a film that explores the underground world of strange, miserable and devastated individuals. It is away from the path but certainly deserves to be watched!
