Main cast: <br /> <br /> Vlastimil Brodský .... Frantisek Hána Stella Zázvorková .... Emílie Hánová Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda <br /> <br /> Director Vladimir Michalek tells this charming Elderly story enchanting twists that make the characters attractive, truly universal. <br /> <br /> Frantisek Hana is retired and receives a pension, her previous activity is unknown. He lives in a very nice apartment with his wife Emilie, aged forty-four. His son Jara covets this spacious apartment to solve problems because he has to house one of his ex-wives and several of their children. The son is not an intriguing villain, it's just a man who has too many former husbands and a blind eye on his father's attachment to the apartment (in which he moved after abandoning a residence at son). <br /> <br /> Hana and her close older friend, Ed, devote more free time doing odd jobs not for money, but for the sake of attacking people easily. fooled, like estate agents. A favorite stratagem is for Hana to play the role of a retired divo at the Metropolitan Opera in New York returning home looking for a vast mansion. Ed is his companion as gullible real estate agents fall on their heels by offering chauffeured limousines and good meals in French restaurants in the hope of a lucrative sale. <br /> <br /> If they are not involved in scams, the duo embark on fast-paced schemes such as pretending to be railroad security agents to snatch kisses from breathless teenagers and without a ticket trying to sneak into trains. Chaste kisses, that is, there is no lust here. <br /> <br /> Hana's long-time wife is obsessed with money saving that will allow the couple, individually and jointly, to organize a large funeral, an event like Frantisek is in no hurry to experience. <br /> <br /> Disagreements over money and the prompt disposition of Frantisek's matrimonial funds lead to a crisis whose resolution is both real and endearing. Michalek looks for the emotions of the viewer, but he does it openly, honestly and effectively. <br /> <br /> "The autumn spring", of course subtitled, is the product of a more and more dynamic Czech cinema. It has not been widely distributed in the United States, but its availability on DVD will hopefully bring this film affecting a wide audience. Unfortunately, Brodsky has recently succumbed to cancer. This film is a tribute to the good actor who impregnated his character with a passion for the pleasures of life that had to reflect his own values. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
