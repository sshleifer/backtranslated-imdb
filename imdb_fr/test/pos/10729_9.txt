Normally, movies stay out of the realm of "domestic drama", and for good reason: who wants to intentionally try to entertain themselves from a story about what they or their loved ones have to deal with in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes, and guard battles are ugly and necessary. This is not escape - the main reason why an average person turns to the cinema - it is a sad reality. <br /> <br /> Normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a larger story and has an impact on how we understand it or how we deal with it. "Kramer vs. Kramer" focuses on the subject and asks us to understand why we do it and why it makes it so disturbing. It's a challenge for both this film and its audience: to turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us feel bad when the mirror is presented to us in the face. Screenwriter / director Robert Benton has perfectly adapted this Avery Corman novel. <br /> <br /> The story, as one might expect, is quite simple: Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), corporate director for big business comes home and finds out that his wife, Joanna (Meryl Streep ), leaves him, along with their 7 year old son, Billy (Justin Henry). Ted must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, Joanna will take him into custody. <br /> <br /> To make an Oscar-winning drama around something as generic and particularly heavy-handed as a dialogue takes on a dramatic talent first. You're not much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is at his best in this role: his first Oscar win after three other outstanding appointments. He creates a complete character, whose selfish and temperate ways are clearly changing as he learns to be a better father and the only caregiver. Streep wins her first Oscar in the second major role of her career as a woman who does not spend much time on the screen but must communicate both on her inner torment during her decision to leave and on a feeling of identity renewed upon his return to detention. Streep does it without effort. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest nominee in the Oscar competitions category, is an outstanding example of 7-year-olds. <br /> <br /> The writing and the direction of Benton follow the performances to the level where we see more deeply in the problems of this family that we make ours and thus reconsider our thoughts on the love and raise a family . Benton's previous notable credits ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") did not indicate a solid mastery of family drama, but man can write well. Many scenes give us strong images that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they represent. The first morning that Joanna left and Billy's French toast to Ted's fleece is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent of this film in a scene that happens in American kitchens every morning. <br /> <br /> You will rarely see a story as simple as "Kramer vs. Kramer" does better. There are no surprises at the end or twists that would keep us desperately stuck on the screen. The film must then build on his talents and they are all convinced, bringing a new understanding of such a familiar subject.
