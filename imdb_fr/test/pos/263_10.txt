We really liked this movie. He was not trying to be scandalous, controversial, intelligent or profound. It was just entertaining and was what it said about the box a charming romantic comedy. All other British filmmakers seem to want to change the world. It's good to see one that focuses solely on telling a good thread with an elegant style.
