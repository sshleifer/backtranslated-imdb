... and there were several. <br /> <br /> I do not like this drawing as much as many others, partly because it was made in his day. I much prefer cartoons with Daffy and Bugs fifteen years in advance. This will please many people, especially those who always find violence funny, whether it is animated or not. <br /> <br /> The basic plot is well known for Looney Tunes: Elmer goes hunting, Daffy drives him to Bugs and Daffy gets shot. There are also very smart and funny jokes (some do not improve the episode), ugly shots and slightly mediocre animations. The plot is mostly about jokes - every joke keeps the episode going. This way of doing intrigue is not so unusual in Looney Tunes (of course, if you're rather boffin - or passionate - like me, then you'll know it already). <br /> <br /> For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and who like the sound of what I said, enjoy "Rabbit Seasoning"! <br /> <br /> 7 and a half in ten.
