Nightbreed is not only great, it is also unique, even taking into account Barker's other films, which never lack originality. An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, there are a lot of subtle symbols and references. Certainly, it is very fun to have a little thought, if you care to do it. And, not to forget, a beautiful score. As usual, special effects age faster than anything, but this is probably the only drawback. I have just seen him again after ten years and I still find him to recommend.
