It is a classic film that portrays the fate of a man unable to adapt to ongoing changes in society and feels increasingly alienated, which leads to violence. Joe is a worker, he is angry and angry, and all he needs is a pretext to denigrate, that's what the story is about. Alone, Joe is silent. with someone else, he becomes mortal. And what makes Joe's character even more frightening is that he fully rationalizes his violence so that it is not only bad, but necessary. Because Joe projects his own violent tendencies on those he considers "the enemy" and therefore considers himself a war. In this film, the "generation gap" is described as a war. But it's a war in Joe's mind only, because "the enemy" in this case is in his imagination. No one wants to fight Joe, but Joe thinks he has to defend himself. Although this film was released in 1970, its message is as relevant today as it was as society continued to undergo major changes, which led to the kind of intense alienation the film dramatizes effectively.
