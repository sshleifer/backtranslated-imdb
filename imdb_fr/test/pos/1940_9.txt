I have just taken a look at another comment posted here in which the author describes the disturbing ways in which the teenagers of this film are used to find the body of their deceased friend. one of the most neglected in this statement is perhaps the most disturbing of all. No surprise, that's what the character Crispin Glover (Layne) does. he is delighted that one of his friends has murdered another of his friends, the killer's girlfriend. not because Layne did not like this individual, he is rather excited about his death because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life and dies internally from the fact that a murdered friend is something that arouses enthusiasm because it gives him something to focus on.
