Travis (James Franco) is a young man traveling on a train for business reasons (we assume it) who left his beloved phone. He is caught by a prostitute, Terri (Rachel Miner), and when he goes to his city to pick him up, a series of events will happen that will not fail to stay with him forever. <br /> <br /> Both characters have obstacles that they set up to defend themselves from communication. But despite their facades, it is obvious that both are eager to demolish them. In total, there are about thirty spoken lines, but the way James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces, you can both cut the volume, the words are useless. One scene to watch for is Terri, who looks at herself in the mirror. You can just feel his desperation permeating the room. <br /> <br /> But the film is not perfect. Most of the time, it is filmed using portable cameras, which is a bit awkward. Mainly because of the act of Mr. Franco and Miner and photography, the flaws of the script do not stand out as much. Yet, sometimes, we have the impression that the story does not really know where it wants to go. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the type of movie that stays with you long after watching it. An hour after seeing it, you are always ready to act on behalf of certain characters. This is not flawless, but still leaves you wanting more, wishing it to be at least 4 times longer.
