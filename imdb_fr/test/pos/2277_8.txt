"Japan gets the best of the world and makes it its own", although it may be true, it applies to all but one thing, namely, ..... the major baseball ... but do you do not worry "Mr. Baseball" is here to try to change all that. But who will change who, is the part of the film that makes it really rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines in his comic roles. The scenario may be true to reality, but the subplot is immutable. The Japanese people are a gentle and respectful people, with customs and traditions very different from those of Western society. All these elements and obstacles combine to form a really nice and fun movie. It's really worth a look!
