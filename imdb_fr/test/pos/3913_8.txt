I think that anyone who has the nonsense of risking being a wax model just to watch a football game or who does not want to leave their car "to undress" deserves what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The guy, Wade, who "went to a hairdresser and asked for the He-Man haircut" was not my type, but there is this really cute scene where he has shaved eyebrows and facial hair. It's a little too demanding for me. <br /> <br /> Also fun, but it's not my type, it's the fat guy with big sunglasses that looks like "Elton John only gayer", but all this intrigue leads to nothing! <br /> <br /> Blake was hot, I would see myself with him if he did not like his girlfriend, who is a fake Paris Hilton with a bad wig (no Chihuahaua in his bag) hand, but that would have been really valuable). I do not think girls who look like that go to football anyway. Nick the car thief is the sexiest! One of the best places is where a soccer ball lands near it. Instead of rejecting it, he smothers his cigarette and burns it. You see, it's just the kind of guy he is. He has a sister who looks silly by borrowing his wife-drummer white. His suspenders show, like half of the movie! <br /> <br /> You will especially want to wax your legs and never go to football games after seeing this.
