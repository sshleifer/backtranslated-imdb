When a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to an isolated island, they quickly discover that their new home is inhabited by a strangely threatening doctor (Richard Johnson of the fame "Zombi 2"), a mad scientist (Joseph Cotten) , his beautiful daughter (Barbara Bach) and a horde of superstitious natives. The tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque creatures half-human, half-fish for perverse and secret purposes. And although the prisoners do not believe it at the beginning "Screamers" is a very entertaining mix of "Mysterious Island "and" Humanoids from the Deep ".There's a lot of gore with a really cool decapitation scene and a heart-rending throat to stimulate yourself. Not great, but the movie is fast and entertaining. Look it at 8 out of 10.
