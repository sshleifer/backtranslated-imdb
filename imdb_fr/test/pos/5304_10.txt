The magic of Hayao Miyazaki continues with Ponyo on the cliff at the edge of the sea, his latest animated film that will please everyone, and which shows the usual sweetness to delight your socks. I thought the trailer contained his song that was discreetly hypnotic, and I did not have to wait for an invitation to be sure to get my ticket for the preview of the film, which will open here next week . <br /> <br /> For fans of Studio Ghibli movies, you'll probably know what you're going to do, as Miyazaki still has another winner in his filmography that will appeal to new fans. I'm embarrassed, to say the least, that until now I've only watched My Neighbor Totoro (eyes full of DVD Ghibli) and adore it in small pieces, but I guess it would be my last effort to I do not continue to miss this. It would probably be animated films that I would appreciate. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magical goldfish that aspires to know what life is like beyond the sea, with its constant incursions into a bubble on the surface of the sea. water to take a look. Nevertheless, these ambitions are ominous for his humanoid father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who feeds a certain hatred towards the human race in the face of pollution and briefly addresses a secondary plot on the protection of the environment / the vengeance of Mother Nature . An accident one day sees Ponyo being carried to the ground and picked up by Sosuke (Doi Hiroki), a five-year-old boy who lives in a house on the cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while dad Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mainly at sea since it is marine. And you can expect moments backtracking like The Little Mermaid, or Splash, designed for kids. To say anything more would be to spoil the pleasure. <br /> <br /> The work here is still simply amazing even though it's in 2D glory, knowing that every cell is meticulously crafted. There are so many things happening at the same time in the same setting, that you will probably be ready to watch several times in a row. This definitely beats any animated production in 3D or computer graphics every day given its beauty from its simplicity, and not only from the art department, but also from its history, despite complaints that it would inspire Hans Christian Andersen's classic. Although there are ways to make this movie extremely dark, it only suggested some dark themes, but instead opted for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> about love, that between members of Koichi's family, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. Even more, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish he named Ponyo, and I tell you that Ponyo herself has enough kindness in her to beat the likes of Bolt, WallE and Eve with bare hands. The characterization here is first-rate, and it's hard not to fall in love with Ponyo, no matter what form she takes, especially when she's so playful and does not hide her emotions - if she's mad at you, she's Turn away, or you could expect a jet stream to spit from his mouth on your face! <br /> <br /> Ponyo on the cliff at the seaside is definitely a major highlight for my best movies this year. And the next time I'm in Tokyo, I'm sure I'll go to the Ghibli Museum to enjoy the magical world that Hayao Miyazaki introduced to us. Highly recommended movie, so do not miss it on the big screen!
