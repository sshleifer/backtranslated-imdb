We have just returned from seeing Black Snake Moan. I had spent time reading critics ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... "A skinny white girl chained to the radiator of a black man" ... I hate when the "critics" are missing the purpose of a movie. Now, I suppose that living in Memphis and having lived in Mississippi many times also helps. The fact that I'm the former director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie can also help. Brewer's simple "redemption story" is easy to follow and could have had different themes to tell the story ... but I think it's very effective as a "blues". I hope people will not read all the hype ... and / or various reviews ... and will not miss a very good movie. Go beyond various things, like skinny girls in white panties ... pass Justin Timberlake, accept his character, Ronnis (he plays very well) ... pass "Snakes on a plane" and discover the mercurile Samuel L. Jackson ... as he turned into a very credible Mid-South blues man. If you know little about mid-south culture, a lot of what's happening may sound caricatural ... but accept that Craig Brewer KNOWs how to paint the canvas and lets the actors tell the story and enjoy it. Not someone who tells a story ... so go see this movie ... and yes, I agree with one thing that critics have understood: the music is wonderful!
