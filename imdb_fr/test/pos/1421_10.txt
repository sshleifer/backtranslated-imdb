WARNING: MAY contain minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> Hard to say anything about this movie except for one thing. <br /> <br /> YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SEE IT MUCH MORE !! !! But maybe it's because you have to be at home in the morning or at 3 in the morning to catch Fox Movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad, because it's another time-lost jewel, Clifton Webb takes his He has been turned into "Sitting Pretty" and into sequels, and he's become "Nature Boy". <br /> <br /> In fact, it's like that. <br /> <Webb plays Robert Jordan, the host of a Sunday children's educational program that loses audience, and the network tells him he has to do something else. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married guest does not have children. <br /> <br /> BUMMER !!! But in this case, the pastor of the local church needs a leader to form a troop of unruly Scouts and finds a volunteer victim ... ahhhh "VOLUNTEER" ... at the host's it's so Jordan is taking care of him. <Br /> <br /> Problem solved, RIGHT ??? <br /> <br /> FALSE !!! This being a movie, there are other problems. <br /> <br /> For example, it turns out that one of the scouts is the son of his boss on the TV channel, which causes a bit of friction; especially since the child is overweight, has asthma and an attitude. <br /> <br /> And he is the most reasonable. <br /> <br /> There is also this cub, Mike (George Winslow) who wants to stick around, being of the type "wandering puppy". <br /> <br /> It turns out that the reason is that he has no parents to him, but that a parent who does not have much time for him. <br /> <br /> That's what makes his job harder than expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, Webb understands children better and records not only his show, but also learns a rewarding lesson and even adopts Mike. <br /> <br /> Another good movie after all these years.
