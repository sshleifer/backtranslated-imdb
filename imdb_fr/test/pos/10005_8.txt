Maybe I read too much about it, but I wonder how much Hongsheng could help develop the film. I mean, when we tell a story in which we embody the main character, I would think he would have a lot of trouble writing, documenting, etc., which would make him a bit biased. <br /> <br /> But. ..his family and friends may also have had a hand in getting the real details on Hongsheng's life. I think the perspective of Hongsheng's family and friends would have been the best. They saw his transformation and were not so caught in the drug trap that they remember everything. <br /> <br /> Hongsheng being full of himself, the coherence of the pose of Jesus Christ makes him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he is obviously still alive because he was chosen for himself) for the happiness of his family. Huh? <br /> <br /> The viewer sees it at its lowest level while maintaining a superiority complex. He is lying in the grass, descending from (high?) ​​Alone and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom by bicycle while stretching out his arms, his head straight. side. <br /> <br /> It's fabulous not to have drugs anymore, but it's not a hero. He went from a peak in his acting career to his most vulnerable point when he was under the influence of drugs to return somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br /> This same device is used in Ted Demme's "Blow" where the audience understands with the main character who is presented as an imperfect hero. <br /> <br /> However, "Quitting" ("Zuotian") is a recommended film, mainly for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting and landscapes. But the best part is the feeling we feel when what we presume to be Jia Hongsheng's house is actually a stage set. The viewer feels that Hongsheng's life is just a play in many difficult passages.
