My partner and I had never heard of this movie and decided to try the title by choosing the title from a list of movies on the cable, without knowing anything about it. In opening and unveiling the cast, we wondered if it could be serious. - Kathy Bates, Jonathan Pryce, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Akroyd and more. As the story unfolded, our selection tickled more and more and the film made us laugh out loud. It's not a "big" movie, but it's one of those rare films that has such a combination of memorable characters taken through surreal events like "truth is stranger than fiction" that I could not to stop loving him. I had no problem "suspending my disbelief" in the face of some of the most zany elements of history, because the filmmakers' intentions are so warm that they still manage to make fun of everyone involved. As others on IMDb have said, it's a comforting movie and I would not be surprised either that it becomes a cult classic.
