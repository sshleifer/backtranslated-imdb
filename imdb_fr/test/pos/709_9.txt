A film that deserved a theatrical release. This film made for television is a cinematic gem that illustrates Michael Mann's technique with moving contemporary music closely integrated with images. Always with Mr. Mann, the amplification of the impact of the music is almost as if an invisible actor awarded by an academy was added to all the actors, the scriptwriter, the director and the director of photography. <br /> <br /> This movie is certainly one of my favorites of all time. Although nothing is perfect, this movie is very, very close. <br /> <br /> In addition to an excellent script, a superb staging and a masterly interpretation of Richard Strauss, you will discover a complete set of character actors: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize names, but you will recognize all faces. <br /> <br /> If it appears on TV, sit down with popcorn, turn up the sound to get a breathtaking soundtrack and score, and get ready to be riveted on it. the 97 minutes of the film. I strongly recommend you save it because it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and the DVD is coded in Region 2.
