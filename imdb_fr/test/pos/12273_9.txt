"Zen and the Art of Landscape", written and directed by David Kartch is a short film about a young man named David (his friends call him Zen) and about what happens in a strange day of his life. Zen is a hobby for a family of the upper middle class. The hostess tries to ask Zen to help her cheat on her husband. Unfortunately, her son takes them instead of her husband. From this moment, the film begins to cross many revelations between the characters and the possible implication of the man of the house. "Zen and the art of landscaping" is witty, intelligent and, overall, very well written. The comic timing of the actors is also very strong. It's a light and fun movie that I would highly recommend.
