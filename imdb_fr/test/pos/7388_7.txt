Dark Harbor is a small, moody outing in extremely deep troubled and emotional waters. This is actually a three-character piece, featuring the always-great Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also excellent), forming the other two faces of this strange triangle. A perfect cable film in the late evening, with a surprise ending to start.
