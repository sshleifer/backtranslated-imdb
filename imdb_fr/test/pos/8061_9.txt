I read "Anne Frank: A Girl's Diary" when I was in high school and found myself completely engrossed in her story, as well as in the Broadway play of her life in the Secret Annex. <br /> <However, I am a little puzzled by the fact that people perceive her diary and that she is a person, seeing her as a little saint or carrying a message of hope for the world. I do not think that was the original intention of his diary. She wrote it mainly for herself, even though she made some harsh rewrites before the occupants of the Secret Annex were betrayed, with the intention of publishing it one day. <br /> <br /> But I've never seen her as a saint or a messenger of hope ... but as a very talented writer who could very well express her thoughts in a very funny way in a newspaper. No doubt she was a very engaging writer and possessed an extraordinary talent for expressing herself fully with words. You must really know her through her diary. But the importance of his diary lies in the fact that it is a testament and an important historical document attesting that the Holocaust took place. <br /> <br /> He has also brought the tragedy of the Holocaust closer to his country. to lose someone to whom we could give a familiar face and personality, at such a young age ... having literally seen his young life torn from her and other occupants who were murdered during the Holocaust. It is a burning accusation for the systematic murder by the Nazis of more than 6 million Jews, and we must not forget it. <br /> <br /> But I'm sad that his diary is so misinterpreted as that. When I look for hope, I have the Bible ... the world's first most read non-fiction book. The words of God in the Bible are eternal ... but Anne's diary is that of a girl in extraordinary circumstances, and that's all. She is not a person to be venerated or idolized, because she was an ordinary girl with many flaws, endowed with an incredible talent as a writer and died at 15 years of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. She was a victim of the Holocaust and, as this otherwise excellent documentary so aptly testified, she was Hitler's most famous victim. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story of Anne Frank ... that of her family and friends. and the survivors of the Holocaust were captivating, alive and powerful. I particularly enjoyed the testimony of Miep Gies and I marvel that she is still strong and alive today. Hannah Goslar's testimony was also very interesting. And I also liked hearing about Otto Frank. But I also agree that the animated image of the girl with dark hair and big, familiar eyes at the end was particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the Holocaust that I do not share with the documentary at all ... is that I do not think it was just a matter of discrimination ... but rather something deeper and deeper, and it was just an act of pure evil. Pure evil. Nothing but pure evil. <br /> <br /> Excellent documentary by Anne Frank and the Holocaust to watch.
