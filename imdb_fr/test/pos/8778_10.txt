I consider Saboteur to be Hitchcock's first "American" film, as the story unfolds entirely in the United States. <br /> <br /> This film contains brilliant scenes. Scene of the Statue of Liberty, Barry Kane jumping into the water from the bridge. The waterfall scenes are extraordinary. It's not Hitchcock's fault that he did not have the actors he wanted. Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper for lead roles in Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur. But Gary Cooper was not interested in a thriller. Another reason why Hitchcock did not get big stars is that he was not one of the best directors. Although Rebecca was a resounding success, the success of the film goes to producer David O. Selznick. For example, David O. Selznick received the Oscar for best film for Rebecca. And Hitchcock did not get an Oscar for best director for Rebecca. Hitchcock began to attract attention after the correspondent abroad (1940). But Universal gave him a small budget for Saboteur (1942). Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea for this movie because he was ready to work with Hitchcock again with a low salary. He liked working with Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent (1940). But he was not available. So the role went to Robert Cummings. Hitchcock called Robert Cummings "a competent interpreter". I thought he was doing his best. He was a lesser-known actor who was ready to play a role when many major actors refused to play the lead role. <br /> <br /> Regarding the female lead, Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck to play the lead role. . They were not interested either. So Universal decided to give Priscilla Lane the role. I read in a book that it was one of his favorite movies. <br /> <br /> I also liked the scene at Blind Man. This is my favorite scene. If we listen more closely to the dialogue in the scenes that unfold at Uncle Philip's, we will see how intense he is. Uncle Philip (Blind Man) was studying Barry Kane's character just as he was entering his home. As Barry entered his house, he heard Barry's handcuffs. During a conversation, he realized that Barry Kane was not a criminal at all. We also see his hearing ability through these scenes. For example, Barry hears the sound of a car and says, "Is this a car coming?" Uncle Philip says "2 cars I think." Uncle Philip was right. We see 2 cars in the next scene. Priscilla Lane played her part very well. She was not a big star. But I thought his performance was really good. Another brilliant scene at Uncle Philip is where he asks Priscilla Lane (Patricia Martin) "Are you scared, Pat, is that what makes you so cruel?" I thought Otto Krueger was playing the villain brilliantly. Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey to be the bad guy. But he refused. Harry Carey is famous for his role, Mr. President, in "Mr. Smith travels to Washington". I want to talk more about this movie. But I think my message is too long. <br /> <br /> Every Hitchcock movie is special in its own way. I'm sure Hitchcock fans will love this movie. I rate 10 out of 10.
