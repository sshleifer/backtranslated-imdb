The intrigue of this wonderful, thought-provoking film is far more complex than mere infidelity and the concealment of responsibility for the accident. I was struck by the apparent initial goodness of her husband, Wilkinson, who wanted the driver, while he thought it was Everett, was revealed to the police, as well as the change of heart (and moral ) when he learned that it was his wife. In addition, was he really good and / or trying to redeem himself by allowing him to leave with Rupert. Then things changed and she decided that the good choice was to admit that she had hit him. Most importantly, the theme of redemption (for the accident - for unfaithfulness - in its own way, strange and imperfect) is the most important in the care lavished by Watson at Everett. I think that's why she started this effort. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a recurring theme in modern British novels: Brideshead Revisited, the end of the affair comes to mind. Like.
