It is a very good and beautiful film. The underlying theme of this film is the innocent child (Heather Graham as Joline) who strives to make naive vows as to how the world should make sense when she is constantly being beaten by the real world. This is not an unfortunate film, quite the opposite. It's a funny movie with a sad side, but thinking about the movie makes me so happy. Near the beginning of the film, the beautiful and vulnerable Joline confronts an addict trying to break into her friend's car. She reasons with him, convinces him to ask for help and gives him $ 30 at the start. At the end of the film, he reappears to pay for it, explains that he does not use drugs, that he is well and that he thanks her. I can hear the cynics moan. Of course, that would never really happen. This film does not take place in the real world. This is happening in the world in which we would have liked to live. What is sad is to realize that we do not live there. The happy part is knowing that there are people who wish us to do.
