I can get bored with murder mysteries except for some really great TV series. Otherwise, there are too many themes in this plot for murder. I do not like the theme of the two young people too intelligent and selfish killed as an intellectual exercise. I have no interest in Hitchcock, who seems to have been associated with it in a way that I do not intend to discover. . But make no mistake, the theme is excellent in itself, the whole movie is very well done and, of course, Sandra Bullock is superb, as always. <br /> <br /> The character of Sandra (as in Miss Congeniality) is not rated by the male team she works with despite her obvious skills, and the boss mostly ignores her ideas, forcing her finally to leave the position and give the male partner sound. Of course, Sandra discovers what is happening and is almost killed in a dramatic denouement. It's intriguing to see how the boy who drew up the assassination plot can not allow him to be killed by his colleague. He has some consciousness and could perhaps be "saved, while the other is a true psychopath. <br /> Sandra's hard shell is caused by the misery of his past poignantly linked to the murder case.Her colleague, realizing that Sandra solved this case despite the refusal of the supervisor, finally discovered what happened to him.Adolescents, she must now face and exorcise and the last scene shows it, she hopes still start. <br /> <br /> I can see among the few other critics that I had time to read, read that this movie would attract a group of enlarged - those who are interested in both boys spoiled wasting their time with their macabre philosophical determination to deceive the police and get away with the perfect murder, the relationship between them that is so cleverly described, the horrific links to the past of the heroine, a policeman-theme, and cigar and mirrors - as well as for Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> For those who wonder why the character of Bullock must have a problematic past, I really think it would be a much less interesting movie if it had been just a detective trying to understand what was happening, with a hard-working acolyte who helped and a chauvinistic boss. The connection between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show that the detective is involved too much or otherwise, how would he lose the confidence of his arrogant boss and lose his life? This is not an original theme, but an extremely irritating one, because this chauvinistic boss is brutally telling his frustrated but obviously inspired agent to drop the case and leave it to someone who clearly has not the skills needed to solve it. if the boyfriend is. I became very worried towards the end of what might happen to Sandra's character, namely her emotional involvement in the affair and her particular sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime that was leading her dangerously by herself. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the relationship between Bullock's character and his sidekick. It's interesting and sometimes very poignant. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two boys is really intriguing, if that's what you'd like to watch. I thought it was unobtrusive in some respects, either because the filmmakers did not want to make friendships between boys, or because we were not supposed to think that emotion dominated their relationship. The film skillfully leaves one wondering which boy is in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at different stages. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that I wish to have clarified and this is what happens "after the end of the film" when the character of Sandra arrives at the court .... you must see the film to find out why she is here. <br /> <br /> Very well played by all. I certainly can not agree with those who complained about Bullock's behavior - she was superb. The room suited him very well. The story is captivating even though the mysteries of murder are not your thing and they are not so often mine.
