One of the biggest crimes committed against science fiction television was the cancellation of Farscape. This is one of the best-written, most-performed and best-performed shows to date on the airwaves, setting new standards for science fiction television. Once Sci-Fi Channel's flagship show, the highest-rated and most critically-acclaimed show, she does not understand why shows such as Buffy, Tremors: The Series and even StarGate: SG-1 last as long as they have summer. Yes, even Buffy. But I will save my victim Buffy for another time. Farscape has been badly handled by the Sci-Fi channel, continually shuffled through the planning, rebroadcasts rarely aired and never actually announced. But while the show was canceled, all those involved in producing the show want to bring it back (even the CEO of Henson Company, Brian Henson). There is also a huge fan-based movement to bring the show back. Overall, the situation is far from bleak, and I hope fans will have their season 5
