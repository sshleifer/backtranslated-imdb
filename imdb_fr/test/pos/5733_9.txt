The elegant universe highlights many ideas about the universe and existence. After watching this documentary, one can not help but take a step back and rethink their point of view on the existence of everything. There is a wide range of scientists, mathematicians and others on both sides of the string theory. It is continually challenged as untested, priceless and perhaps totally false. The closest to proselytism that anyone does is to explain that quantum physics, the set of mathematical ideas that give a very good approximation of what happens to subatomic particles, has never made an incorrect prediction. This is not the case with string theory; no one wants to tell the camera that string theory is the truth and that in doing so, the play retains a respectful distance from the subject.
