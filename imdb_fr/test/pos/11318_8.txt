This film was really interesting ... it is also shocking that similar events happened only 10 months after the release of the film. <br /> <br /> it was interesting to see the problems that we could meet and realistic enough to show that no matter how prepared you are, you are not. if it were done for an American audience - it would be different because they would have used it as a complete propaganda film and not as a wake that the BBC did! it's still a propaganda, to a certain extent - no film can ever deal with these topics - but the problem has been dealt with successfully. <br /> <br /> a film that should be featured in all the courses on terrorism / the fight against terrorism but will not be because it shows flaws that are not allowed to be recognized! A great film in which the BBC took some risks and, unfortunately, London no longer needs a fictional narrative, because of the reality of July 7, 2005.
