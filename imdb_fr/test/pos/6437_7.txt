I first saw this film at about age 6 - my grandmother thought it would be a good children's movie to entertain and take care of me ... However, every time I I watched him, I had nightmares the same evening. Yes, it is considered a children's movie, but even now, I find it very dark in places, especially the haunting music that is played every time the guardian angel woman is on the screen, and by his look and his voice rather hypnotic. The film's "villains", ie the sharks, Mr. Grimes, etc., did not frighten me at all, I always found the film as a whole rather dark and scary. This is obviously something that I can understand now that I'm 21 years old, but speaking from experience, I have no way to show it to my children!
