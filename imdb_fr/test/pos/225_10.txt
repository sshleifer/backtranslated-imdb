I watched this series after watching Naked Gun movies. I found it much better than the movies, and I found the movies super! This series literally sticks you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun, snap shot or funny situation (the wicker nightclub, flamingo club). I do not think I laughed so much about a TV show in my life, even after watching the movies first and having some of the jokes. I find it unfortunate that only six episodes have been produced, but I agree that screenwriters would have a hard time maintaining this level of comedy for new episodes. Overall, the series is a must-have for those who love puns, bad jokes and slimy gags.
