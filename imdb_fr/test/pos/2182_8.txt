I saw this last night on Turner Classic Movies (TCM). I had never heard of it before and I was quite surprised to find it so captivating. <br /> <br /> Bogart plays the leading role as a cynical city editor who grudgingly accepts his greedy radio network manager this incisive "B" programmer. About 12 years before performing perfectly in cynics similar to that of the city in films like Deadline USA, Knock On Any Door, The Barefoot Contessa and The Harder They Fall, Bogie already possessed the qualities of a star. <br /> <br /> To improve the ratings and bring their programming a little higher to a more popular level, WUBC, "The Voice of America", offers a radio mini-series about a woman who has been acquitted 20 years ago by a defense of self-defense for the murder of her husband. Not wishing to be discreet to preserve the reputation of the woman and her husband, the station uses sneaky methods to reveal everything to all listeners, and as discreetly as possible. <br /> <br /> As a time capsule, I also discovered very enlightening man-woman mores at the workplace in the mid-thirties. Although beyond Henry O'Neill, I do not know the secondary cast, the players were always excellent and the direction was tense. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie (for example, A Face In the crowd, an inspector calls, etc.), do not miss the opportunity to see this one. <br /> <br />
