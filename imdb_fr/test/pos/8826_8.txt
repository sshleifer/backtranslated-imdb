Whenever the so-called explorers and we, the public, are ready to place for the first time one of the wonderful new worlds, the filmmakers have decided, for some impious reason, to distract with an "emergency" or a false alarm or a bit of dramatic suspense. <br /> <br /> Instead of quietly enjoying the surface of Io, standing above the rings of Saturn or focusing on the magic of flying through a comet or asteroid, we are distracted by the concern for survival the characters. Big let down !!!! <br /> <br /> Filmmakers do not really know what they want. A documentary about the natural wonders of our solar system or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than the subject. Come on. <br /> <br /> Hello. If I wanted suspense and tension, I would watch a real fiction and fiction film. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a dramatic documentary. But the characters and their survival here (the risks of such a mission - should be secondary to the subject treated). Expect. Yes, the risks of such a mission are an important part of the topic - since it is essentially a film about a space mission, not just about the solar system. But it was exaggerated and distracted from the discovery of new worlds that we were supposed to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the film was remarkable in giving a very realistic idea of ​​the human elements of a space mission, disputes, tensions, the weight of responsibility, almost fatal errors, sacrifices, etc. It would also be very good for the sub-genre of science fiction - in fact, it would be one of the best, because science was almost scrupulously respected. <br /> <br /> But the distractions were terrible. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I failed to show the effects of being in space for several years on astronauts AFTER having landed on Earth. Not as well
