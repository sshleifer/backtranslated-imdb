I have always loved this film and I am happy that it is finally available on DVD so that more viewers can see what I have told them all these years. The story tells the story of a high school girl, Gary (Lawrence Monoson), a delivery girl in a pizzeria. He spends time with his friends David (Joe Rubbo) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary notices Karen (Diane Franklin) who is the new girl at school and one morning he drives her by car and at that moment he is totally in love. That night, at a party, he sees Rick with Karen and now he is jealous of his best friend but does not tell anyone what he really feels. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary if he can borrow his grandmothers' house, but Gary finds an excuse so that Rick can not have Karen alone. But one night, Rick boasts of Gary having nailed her on the football field and Gary gets furious. A few days later, at the school library, Gary and Rick and Karen argue. He asks Karen what's wrong. She tells him that she is pregnant and that Rick has dropped her. Gary helps her by driving her to her grandmother's house and paying for the abortion. Finally, Gary tells Karen what he really feels for her and she seems receptive to his feelings. Later, at his birthday party, he meets Karen and Rick again. Gary leaves without the girl! This film ends with a much more realistic version of real life. Even if you are nice to you, you do not necessarily get the girl. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Boaz Davidson who would become a very competent action movie director and he did two things properly movie. First, he made sure there was enough free nudity to make it marketable for the young men who usually go to these movies. Secondly, he had finished the film with the young Gary without Karen and I think the men in the audience can understand the fact that they are being fooled, no matter how hard you try to win a girl's heart. Yes, this movie is silly and exploitative but it's funny and sexy. Actress Louisa Moritz almost steals the film in the role of sexy Carmela. Moritz has always been a popular "B" level actress and you may remember it in "Flight over a Cuckoo's Nest". Like "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", the soundtrack is excellent and the songs played reflect what is happening in the story. But at the heart of this film are two very good performances of Monoson and Franklin. Franklin needs nudity but she always expresses the sorrow of a girl who is being dumped at a crucial moment. She has always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film. But this is still the story of Monoson and you can not help but feel this guy. When the film ends, it's his performance that stays with you. It's a solid acting job that makes this more than just a teen comedy. Even with the silly scenarios of teens trying to have sex, this film still manages to achieve what he wants. The underrated comedy hits the target.
