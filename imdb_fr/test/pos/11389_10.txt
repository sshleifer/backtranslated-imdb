Altman and Scorsese have twisted sex in one of the greatest American movies of the last 20 years. Boogie Nights did not make much noise at first, and I still do not think he got the credit he deserves. The immediate clamor surrounding the film ("Some porn movie with Marky Mark") was totally unfounded. What Paul Thomas Anderson has created is nothing less than a striking representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the American dream (if such a thing still exists). <br /> <br /> For those of you who lived in a Boogie Nights tells the literal story of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) for 8 years. Eddie is just a dopey kid from Torrance California who wants something more from life. Her room is soaked with naive Americana, muscular. His dreams are much bigger than his potential, but not as big as his ... special gift. His bald-faced Southern man is quickly raising the attention and eyebrows of the burgeoning and pervasive adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as Papa Bear with the sparkling eyes of the film) gets wind of Eddie's hidden talent and decides to put it in a movie. <br /> <br /> Before he could say "deep throat", Eddie changed his name to Dirk Diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide-eyed public. Fame and fortune meet Dirk, as well as many local pornstars. His friends and colleagues become his makeshift family, but he quickly turns out to be a Sunday picnic like no other. While the 1970s filled with coke and user-friendly video gave way to the well-being of the 70s, Dirk & Co. started a dangerous backslide. <br /> <br /> Anderson put all he had in this glorious and moving epic. It sizzles and never fizzles. Nary loses a frame of this monumental picture and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO's disappearance from the soundtrack. See this one immediately. And watch him again. <br /> <br /> And again.
