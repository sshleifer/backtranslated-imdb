I really like this film because of all the stars, the dance and the story that goes with it. Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. Although it's a musical, I thought Rita Hayworth had also made a great dramatic performance in this movie. As for her dance, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Rita's dance in this film by commenting that Rita was dancing rings around her own dance and, let's face it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer. Cinematography and bright colors are also noted. Rita wants to cover a magazine, but she is also in love with her mentor, Gene Kelly. Is she leaving Kelly to realize her dream and bypassing the love and fame of Broadway, or is she still looking for that unique pearl that will change her life forever? You will have to watch the movie to find out!
