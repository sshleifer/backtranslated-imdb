Overall, I give this movie a decent score of 7.6. To start, I would say that I like the way the character has been described and adapted to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or just look at DVD supplements, you will find that the character of Blade is radically different from the one we see in the movie. Among the changes, Blade is now mostly a half-vampire, thus acquiring "all their strength, but none of their weaknesses". The credit goes to David Goyer, a fan of the darker genre of comics. Thanks to him, Blade has become a much more interesting character and I really find him one of my favorite anti-heroes. Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, although some would probably have imagined Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His role here does not have to be exactly an Oscar, but I'm glad he decides to play the DayWalker in both suites. Stephen Dorff is the main villain and Kris Kristofferson, somehow Alfred de Blade. The acting is good in fact and the action keeps the plot for sure. The opening scene of the club is one of my favorite scenes I have to say. As much as this movie, there are few things that bother me that hurt this ranking with something like "Spider-Man" or "X-Men". Stephen Norrington described the bad guys in a way that I did not like so much honestly. Their lines were so full of dirty comedy that I did not really feel like a cartoon movie. In addition, "La Magra" is a little disappointing as the last villain but the fierce fight with the sword catches it, I suppose. Not to mention the lack of realism: a black man wearing a leather coat with a sword, the # $% ^ of a policeman in the light of day, how much not being noticed by the crowd who passed seemed a little ... well. ..stupid. Moving away from some of his flaws, Mark Isham's music was excellent and fit the film perfectly. Fortunately, all these problems are solved and improved in the amazing "Blade 2" suite.
