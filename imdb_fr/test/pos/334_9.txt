It's an incredible movie that starts slowly. This brings you to consider it a typical family drama of maudlin. Then, in the second half, there is a plot that completely transforms this into a deep story of global scale. <br /> <br /> If you are not used to Indian movies, the routines of songs and dances seem to graft for no reason, stay with this film. Especially from the second half, you will find this movie an amazing experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Minor Spoiler Here ************ * I only have one problem with the movie. The dialogue at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to make war a force that transformed people's lives. It was implicit from the beginning, but there should have been something about the importance of the fight for MDS.
