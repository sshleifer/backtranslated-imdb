For me, a ten-star movie is a movie that never dies in my memory, but that can be viewed again and again with the same pleasure as the first time. It could be a technically flawed film; pleasure has nothing to do with polishing (my top-ten staff is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). "The Thing" by John Carpenter is one of the few films to meet this criterion. <br /> <br /> I've been a science fiction fan since I was a kid in the sixties and I read John W Campbell's short film. story on which the film is based ("Who Goes There") before seeing Howard Hawks' original black-and-white film (like many people, this viewing was illegal, on television, when I should have to be in bed!). This film, like many others that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed almost perfect: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the stranger, photography; everything seemed to work. I watched it several times in the years that followed (and it's still the case when it is broadcast on television). For this reason, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing the remakes of his favorite movie is, I thought, always a mistake. When I finally watched the movie in 1988/199, again on TV because there was nothing else, I realized that I had to change "always an error" into "usually a mistake" ! Carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story and truly wonderful. From the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the disturbing scene of the pound, to the end (sorry, no spoilers here!), I became addicted. The only soundtrack lives with me - all I have to hear is a close similarity to this bass drum beat, and I'm back in the final scene ... <br /> <br /> Up 'Seeing' The Thing ', I had Carpenter as another gore-monkey, based solely on comments and criticism in the mainstream press. Since I saw "The Thing", I think I saw most of his films. I did not get out of there to do it, but if there is one, just see his name as a director to make me decide to watch it. He is thoughtful and knows how to build a movie so there is something left in the memory. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen "The Thing" and you like science fiction, treat yourself - sit in a dark room, get well dressed and get ready to improve your memory!
