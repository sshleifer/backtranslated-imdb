It's not a film, it's a smart, witty and often touching film. This is a retrospective of a failed relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leydon Campbell) and his Irish girlfriend Grace Mckenna. Michael tries his luck and decides to make a documentary about his whole relationship and what was wrong. He exploited his friendship with an actor he met at Nadia Gymnasium (Nadia Dajani) with whom he plays Grace. The concept of this film is very original. The relationship of Michaels is shown from all points, whether high or low. Michael Leydon Campbell performs a fantastic performance that makes him want to help find Grace. In fact, most characters perform very well, with the exception of the puzzle. The puzzle is necessary to advance the plot, but seems too surreal to exist in a cafe. His monologues are often exhausted and useless. This is proven when he says, "Out of this chaos, we are all trying to create order, and out of order, of meaning, but in reality, meaning does not exist. that if we give it a meaning. "<br /> <br /> The commentary records this movie. The comment is made in vain. It's Spinal Tap and asked Michael and his brother to explain the problems they encountered while making the film. Michael offers a very funny comment that makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would give a 7/10 to this movie.
