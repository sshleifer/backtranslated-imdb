I was very excited to see a documentary about one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato touched everything from post-apocalyptic horror film to hardcore porn. He has evoked genius several times with films like Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals. This documentary is a long and informative guide to D'Amato's films. He is interviewed throughout the interviews with English subtitles scrolling at the bottom of the screen. The excerpts of his films are told by a narrator (subtitled in English). The documentary proved particularly interesting when it analyzed "Emmanuelle In America", often censored. Here, D'amato explains in detail the scenes of "snuff" and recalls some amusing stories. In fact, the good old Joe is very warm and funny, always wears a smile and smokes a cigarette. The only disappointing aspect of this documentary is that it spends a short time on D'amato's horror films like Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buio Omega. He spends too much time on the erotic cinema and barely touches the post-apocalyptic films. But I can not complain. It's wonderful to see D'amato get the respect it deserves. Highly recommended for fans of D'amato. May he rest in peace.
