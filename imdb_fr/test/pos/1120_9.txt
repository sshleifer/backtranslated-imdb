One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and I'm happy to have such a good movie as this one to remind me why he was so wonderful. Observe it with your children (or your horse). <br /> <br /> The story of an old horse trainer with kids and his luck. If you've ever had or enjoyed horse racing, you'll love the story of Rags to Rich. It may be a little under "Seabiscuit", but not much. The story is the same except that it is the quarter quarter version. Well done, correct race conditions and equipment, and enjoyable racing scenes. Do not take my word for it, listen to it and make up your mind.
