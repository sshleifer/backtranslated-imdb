Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> This is a Peter Watkins movie. If we saw his BBC masterpieces "Cullodden" and "The War Game", we will recognize the style (and his voice) a few seconds after the start. Made in 1971, it takes place in the very near future, when the war in Vietnam has intensified and now seems to concern China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and the protests are treated violently using drumhead courts (apparently civil with "ordinary citizens" as judges). Because "the construction of the prison can not follow", an alternative is introduced: the Punishment Park. Offenders can choose between stiff prison terms and a man who hunts in a hostile environment, in this case a 85-kilometer trip through the California desert at a temperature of 10 Â° C. If they reach an American flag at the end without getting caught by the National Guard or the riot police, they will be released, otherwise they will have to serve their sentence (or be dead, as we will see). The film is made in a completely documentary style with three European teams covering a court and the course of two groups already sentenced. Scenes stand between the court tent, the hunting troops and the convicts for the hunt. The rare comments of Watkin give us raw general information (time, temperature, etc.). The court scenes show a kangaroo court on one side and a wide range of personalities on the other, ranging from real terrorists to "undesirables" to obviously innocent ones (for example, a total pacifist who can not even hurt the flies) . The defense lawyer (who takes his job seriously) must accept the abuse on both sides. What makes these scenes particularly bizarre is their resemblance to the rhetoric of retail administration. Meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert clearly show that the "rules of the game" do not really apply. The question remains open, whether rigged from the beginning or arbitrary by the troops because of these events that lead to the result (I guess they are both). At the end, we are back to square one and the next group goes to "Punishment Park". This description may indicate a strongly biased (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but that would be misleading. Behavior (all participants were non-professional professionals, as usual with Watkins) is real (court scenes may even contain text from actual and contemporary essays). I would say that it could be sold as the "real thing" without a problem. With Watkins' "The Forgotten Faces", the reaction was "We can not send this anymore, otherwise no one will believe our true news anymore (because it is impossible to distinguish them from reality"). With "Punishment Park", it should be the same. Banned in the United States, to my knowledge, this is a must-have that has not lost its power or its relevance (especially today).
