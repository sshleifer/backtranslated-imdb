I have seen this film three times and each time I appreciate it more. I think that Jordana Brewster should have received an Emmy nomination for his real and natural performances. Many of us who were Phoebe's age at the time the story unfolds will understand how real it is. For most of us, life is neither romantic pessimism nor cynical pessimism. It's a fuzzy balance, and this film captures this balance. It is as well built, with so many fine details in its composition. Whether or not in the film, judging by the extraordinarily high scores available to the demographic group of women under 18, we can know that this film reveals an important truth about how young women see themselves in the world.
