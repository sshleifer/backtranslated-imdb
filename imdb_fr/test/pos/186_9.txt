It is a beautiful film and in many ways impressive. I saw it on TV when I was little, the throat almost choked with tears, and still today with the beautifully restored Criterion DVD. <br /> <br /> Cranes is the essence of War Weepie. Imagine umbrellas of Cherbourg without music or color, or a bridge of Waterloo without class consciousness. <br /> <br /> Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, is deeply moving as a pretty girl whose fiance does not write and do not come back. <br /> <br /> The fiance, Boris, dies in the foreground, and his death scene is incredibly romantic. Very daring too, because so close to "on the top". But this scene will stay with you. <br /> <br /> Although the Soviets were so defined by the Second World War, the film is not specific and is more powerful for him. The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel. There is no attempt to detail the period. The whole film becomes more and more stylized, until the Siberian scenes, which resemble a modern opera decor (it's a compliment). The last cathartic scene unfolds to its last drop, again comparable to Cherbourg. The production looks like a big budget (these scenes of stairs must cost a nice kopek). <br /> <br /> Go ahead. Do not expect a bitter social pill (though, of course, very sad). The Cranes are Flying is an impressive slice of world cinema, quite advanced considering the place and time of its manufacture.
