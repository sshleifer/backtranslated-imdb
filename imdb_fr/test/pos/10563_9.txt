The story was very complicated and interesting in itself. However, it is difficult for me to write the criticism of this film without spoiling you. To avoid that, I will not talk about the story here. <br /> <br /> I consider this film as a good adaptation of Sarah Water's book compared to the previous "Tipping the velvet". I first read the book and then watched the DVD later. The film has retained most of the minds of the main characters in the book. Of course, because of the time limitation, the film in the last 30 minutes seemed to be in a hurry to cover the third part of the book. As a result, it could not be a good illustration of the scene in which they all met in Mr. Ibbs' kitchen and those that followed (even the book seemed like a rush to the stage). In spite of that, the movie did a really good job in representing the story. It is definitely worth watching. We still do not know when BBC-America will be able to broadcast this film. Too bad. <br /> <br /> PS: we noticed that the ages of Maud and Sue were 20 to 21 years instead of 17 to 18 in the book; the latter is more reasonable while the former is closer to the age of the actresses.
