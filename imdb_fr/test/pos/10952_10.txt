Twins Effect, featuring some of HK's most popular stars, offers one of HK's most enjoyable movie experiences. There is something for everyone: action, comedy, horror, romance and drama. This film can not be taken too seriously, otherwise you would be disappointed, but if you leave your brain at the door and watch the movie for fun, you will surely enjoy it. <br /> Great special effects, great action, cute twins, cool HK actors, FUN movie! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone!
