I had to call my mother (a WASP) to question her about it. Was it really so bad in the 40s in New York? Surprised, she could not remember. So I told him to see the movie. Arthur Miller was not 30 when he wrote this in 1945, not on the screen, but as a NOVEL for a change. It is a painful representation of anti-Semitism. Yet, oddly enough, there is a tender history of human relationships (Finkelstein, the Jew, with Newman, the non-Jew, primarily) underlying this cruel history. The acting is competent and the cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not think it will not make a big difference at the theater is that it's >> aaagh << controversial. <Br/> <I give him ten out of ten. Maybe a little high, but it's definitely worth it.
