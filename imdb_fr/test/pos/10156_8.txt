If there's a good suspense movie, it's one of them. James Stewart performs a dazzling performance as the American Ben McKenna who, with his wife and son, is touring Africa. They fall on a murder scene and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later. <br /> <br /> Before you can say, "Fasten your seat belt," Dr. McKenna learns too much about an assassination attempt and tries to stop him. However, other people know that it can be dangerous (dangerous for them) and try to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Hank, the son, is found alive and doing well. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies, this is the one to watch. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
