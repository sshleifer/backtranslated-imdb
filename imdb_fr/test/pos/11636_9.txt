Okay. To take advantage of this silent short film, you must suspend any disbelief regarding the main point of departure of the film. If you can not, you will probably have more chances to score this movie much lower. Charlie Chase has a huge overbite and his wife has a nose big enough to have his own area code. Unknown to each other, they both saved to be operated on to correct these defects. Apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better in the 1920s because none of them seemed to need to recover from these major surgeries and they looked dandy right away !! Okay, remember that I said to ignore that, right ?! Well, well, you should also ignore the hard idea that the two could meet each other and not have a clue that the other is their spouse. Ok, ... now that you've allowed yourself to accept these two stupid premises, the movie really gets really good. <br /> <br /> Charlie passes him a pass and she passes a pass. Both are shocked and delighted because no one has ever really considered them attractive. So, because of this new vanity, they agree to go on a date. But they both go home - not wanting their spouses to know! In any case, they meet later and are very attracted to each other. But what about the so-called poor wives at home? Well, they both learn that the other is married and both expect that their marriage will lead to divorce because they really want to be with each other! Late in the movie, Charlie discovers that the woman is really his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence in which he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband - changing his clothes and putting false teeth when he play the husband! It's really a laughing laugh to see him bouncing in and out of the room while he seems to be fighting with another person! You really have to see it to believe it. However, the woman sees an advertisement with Charlie's photos before and after and knows what's going on. In the end, they feel pretty stupid!
