For people like me, born long after the end of the 60s, we can learn more about the era than through cultural artifacts, including "Hair". It is certainly a tour de force well done. One can get an idea of ​​the situation in the hippie culture. The most impressive scene, at least for me, is probably the one where the band crashes with the rich people's party. As for the final scene of the film, we could interpret it as the symbolic end of all that represented the 60s. <br /> <br /> But whatever the way we interpret this film, it is important to understand that even though the 60s themselves may have ended, the movements that characterize them still exist in small enclaves. This is a moment that people will not forget anytime soon. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I highly recommend this movie. Milos Forman scored another big one here, just between his two masterpieces "A flight over the cuckoo's nest" and "Ragtime" (so why did he later make a shit like "Man on the Moon "?!) With John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
