Dark, dreary sets, thrilling music that cuts you off like a knife (or razor), a perfect cast led by Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. It's an exciting theater perfectly transferred to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our time and Todd is his masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the sumptuous show of Act I, "A Little Priest", where Lovett and Todd fantasize about victims who will end up in their tourti√®res, this game never stops to thrill, excite and satisfy. Betsy Joslyn also excels as Johanna, even for her, because the game room seems slightly crazy. Edmund Lyndeck turns into a bravado as a corrupt judge who covets Joslyn and is the subject of Todd's vendetta. Lansbury and Hearn command the series as two great actors / stars do. Other highlights of the music include Lovett's "Lonest Pies in London", Todd's "Johanna", and the opening of Act II, "GOD THATS GOOD", is the title of this production!
