The efforts of a new group of young talents reinforced by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, two extremely talented actors, make it a night of exciting and captivating entertainment. And I could add that Hal Holbrook shines as a senator. This film deserves five stars. I give him a ten on your scale. And the end is perfect. I am always amazed at the ability of British actors to master our American accents. I was convinced that all the actors were born in Louisiana. And what better place for a mystery than New Orleans! The Big Easy, also known as Crescent City, permeates every scene. As a writer and director, Sebastian Gutierrez deserves praise.
