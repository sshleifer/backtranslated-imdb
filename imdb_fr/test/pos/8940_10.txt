Betty and Boris look at each other in a junior dance when they're still kids, but unfortunately, Hugh returns for the first time and thirty years later, when we get back to normal - Betty is married to Hugh and supports her capricious mother, who also lives with them. <br /> <br /> Neither Boris nor Betty, however, have forgotten each other, and when their paths cross again, they soon declare their feelings. <br /> <br /> But Betty thinks she can do it. If you do not divorce Hugh, a city councilor, it would hurt him too much. What Betty does not know is that Hugh does not suffer at all. He rolls in the sheets with his beautiful secretary Meredith. <br /> <br /> Boris, a funeral director, thinks he has the answer. They will simulate his death. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken plays the role of Frank Featherbed, a rival and scandalous undertaker in their average town - which causes Boris and Betty further problems. <br /> <br /> All sorts of complications happen when Boris and Betty try to make this big move. <br /> <br /> Laughing scenes, delicious dances and insulting words are heard. In short, the film was a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> 10 stars.
