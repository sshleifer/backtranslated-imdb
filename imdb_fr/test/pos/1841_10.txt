I saw this film a few years ago and I was literally swept by it. So charming and so very romantic. David Duchovny and Mrs. Driver have such a hot chemistry that you will need to remove a layer of clothing. The distribution of support is 100% top notch. Watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play against each other is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the most charming movies are those where they are on the screen. As Jim Belushi shouting to his kids to fall asleep "FOREVER!" or dance to him in the kitchen. This movie made us want to know people like that in my own life. Not to mention, what woman does not want David Duchovny as a boyfriend?
