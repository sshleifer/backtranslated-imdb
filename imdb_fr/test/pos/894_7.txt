You know you're watching a softcore with a bad attitude when bad dubbing bugs you. I'm fine with the lip sync of shit but the sound mixing is really too much. Whenever someone says something, it sounds like a narrator. Anyway, it's about the purgatory between the boring professionalism of France and the heavenly films of Joe d'Amato, which portray cannibalism and all the rest. Do not get me wrong, there is a good deal of exploitation in this one, but there is always room for more. Laura Gemser plays the main role, and that's good because she is sexy. It's a bit odd to see sometimes its bone structure, but it still reigns on its white counterpart. You can also make a nice game of alcohol on the frequency with which she takes her kit. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every place is good. A scene involves even a whole hockey team, no matter what it does in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way and the base cast is made up of very mean people, but there is enough Laura Gemser for everyone.
