I attended several Pauly Shore movies, but this is the only one I liked. Of course, it is a lot less irritating than usual, maybe even a bit friendly. The rest of the cast is doing a good job, especially Carla Gugino, underestimated. The film itself is basically a harmless and stupid comedy, and although few jokes are particularly fun, the movie is rather amusing.
