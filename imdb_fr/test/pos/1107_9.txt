Australian-born Australian director Alex Frayne draws attention with his strange, requiring a meticulous and surprisingly visual reading, Modern Love (2006). Following in the footsteps of a man incapable of controlling a radical personality change caused by the death of a close relative offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. <br /> <br /> John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small town in the south of the country to look after his deceased uncle. (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward go to a local hotel, John begins questioning residents about the death of Uncle Tom. Some say he committed suicide, others do not want to talk. John, surprised, advances his own theory: Uncle Tom is alive and well, he hides in the surrounding bushes. <br /> <br /> If not for the occasional lines of dialogue used to tone down his heavy atmospheric tone, Modern Love could have been easily confused with a Sokurov film. Shot with a 16 mm camera, its faded colors are strangely reminiscent of the Russian director's thoughtful incursions into human agony. It may not be a coincidence that Modern Love was presented for the first time at the Moscow International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> The observation below the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating visuals, however, reveals a slightly different image - while Sokourov's films tend to remain painfully intimate, to the point of deliberately dissociating the main protagonists of the film. environment while blurring while a broad splash of the director's favorite yellow, Modern Love, which feeds a lot on the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation depends on it, and as history progresses, it becomes clear that nature was an integral part of Frayne's vision. <br /> <br /> In Sokourov's The Second Circle, a young man returns to the Russian countryside. to bury his dead father. In the cabin where the old man lived, everything is covered with dust. He gathers the few old clothes scattered and places his father's body in a coffin. Then he says goodbye and bury him. The rest of the film is a long reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system, the loneliness and discontent many have been victims of. <br /> <br /> In Modern Love, a little ironically, love is nowhere. On the contrary, it is the pain, the loneliness and the dissatisfaction with "modernity" that suddenly invade John's life. Unlike the Second Circle, the main protagonist here has the opportunity to resume his modern life. His wife and son are waiting for him, but he is leaving. Slowly but surely, the present begins to disintegrate under the weight of a somewhat confusing past. <br /> <br /> I doubt that Frayne wanted Modern Love to be so similar to what Sokourov did in The Second Circle. Yet the rhythm, and particularly the confusing framing, is precisely what turns this film into an almost meditative experience - a difficult and extremely fragile approach to deconstructing the human psychology that both directors have mastered to perfection. <br /> <br /> Mark Constable delivers top-notch performance while John adds even more depth to his extremely challenging character. His facial expressions are remarkable. Victoria Hill and William Traeger are in perfect harmony with the tight visual style of their performances.
