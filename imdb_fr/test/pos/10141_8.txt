This movie certainly looks like it's supposed to be based on actual events at a Marine base. This is the attempt by the local navy commander to conceal the unacceptable behavior of a naval major who has been shot by his former girlfriend, a naval captain. The man and the woman were lovers, but the captain tries to break the relationship when she discovers that her boyfriend is married. He continued to follow her, even pulling his arm in the direction at the same time. Eventually, he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife and was shot twice with her service pistol before being killed. The civilian prosecutor ruled on the murder, but the Marines decided to charge the captain with murder. You see, the major was a decorated Vietnam hero and an old friend of the colonel commander at the Navy base. The captain, too, had made enemies in her group order, rejecting some masculine advances in a very butchish style. <br /> <br /> There is considerable psychological freight that motivates and controls the actions of the main participants in this drama. that very skilful actors have understood well. The director and editor, however, seem intent on overshadowing events with frustrating flashbacks and changing viewpoints. You are lucky if you know where you are most of the time. Bear with them, though; it is a worthwhile story as the captain's martial trial unfolds, and it seems that everyone's hand is against her, even her lawyer at times. <br /> <br /> The verdict? Well, after all, it's more of a suspense, so you'll have to see it yourself. There is some sort of "pacifist" message in the movie, but forget about it. Of course, "war is hell", but sometimes it's impossible to avoid it. We will need these Marines, even if they are not always the best champions of fair play internally. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins": <br /> <br /> "It's Tommy this and Tommy that, and Tommy is waiting outside." But, instead of Mr. Atkins, when the ship of transport is safe. "
