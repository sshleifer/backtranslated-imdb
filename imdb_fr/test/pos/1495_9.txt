"Mr. Bean," starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was hugely successful during his 1990 tour, and I probably saw him for the first time when I was about ten, shortly after end, so I saw reruns. I was certainly not a big fan at the time and I did not see a lot of episodes. I did not really enter the series until the end of my adolescence, just a few years ago, when I finally watched all the episodes. Unlike before, it made me laugh a few times, and since then, this has always been the case during replay episodes! <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a mysterious, egocentric, anti-social and extremely naive jester whose best friend is his teddy bear! He is almost isolated from society and life is not easy for him because he constantly struggles with very simple things! This is because he lacks basic enough knowledge and has the mind of a child. Wherever he is, he finds himself in very difficult situations and finds very bizarre solutions to try to solve the problems he is facing! Not only does it often cause problems, but sometimes other people, which it often does not tend to understand! In other words, Mr. Bean is a walking disaster! <br /> <br /> The humor in this show is very visual and there is very little dialogue. The gags are almost always gags at sight, which is mainly the subject of the show. Although there may be an occasional weak gag, I would say that the vast majority of them are funny, often hilarious (there are so many highlights)! Although "Mr. Bean" is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever created, it's still good for those who love visual humor and, because of the very limited dialogue, it's not even necessary to speak fluent English to enjoy the show. that's why he's earned such a reputation around the world! The series lasted a few years, but the episodes were made very gradually. Only fourteen have been made. Nevertheless, it is a classic series that deserves a big attraction!
