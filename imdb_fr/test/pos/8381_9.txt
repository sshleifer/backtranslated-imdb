Tarantino disappoints me a little since death. But I insist it was a little bit, because I appreciate the amount of work needed to produce such a tribute to stuntmen. Inglorious Basterds has definitely propelled Tarantino to the forefront of my universe. This film can be summarized (although inadequately) in one word: "RAW". <br /> <br /> There is intense emotion in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes. From the beginning of the film, we feel compassion for the victims of the Nazis and we place ourselves in the fictional dimension of Tarantino in the historical context of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> The characters are unpredictable, fun, scary, brutal, sexy and other adjectives that I'm sure they get out of my mind and that are equally appropriate and positive. I will not go into the appreciation of each character, but the other comments of other users summarize the appreciation of different performances. <br /> <br /> The dialogue has evolved from the classic provocative style of Tarantino's "bad ass", as evidenced by Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. One can feel in the dialogues that Tarantino makes more open references to other films. Indeed, many dialogues were close to the cinema lessons for the public, the setting taking place partly during the premiere of the film; a reference to a movie is close to each corner. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see that each presented language (German, French and English) is used in a rather equal and natural way. I speak French and English very fluently and I am often disappointed by the poor efficiency of English characters in French films and the mediocrity of French characters in English / American films. Surprisingly, Tarantino has managed to ensure that his actors get a natural and graceful performance from his actors. This helps put the audience in the context of the historical context. Effectively ; soldiers, spies and civilians have rarely included soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> The images / photography are beautiful, with landscapes that convincingly reflect a Europe of the 1940s representing the Second World War. The outfits are perfect, and the violence transmitted in an orgasmic / realistic way. No fist is withheld, and it is often shown that the Nazis are tortured. This makes the film not open to all audiences; Graphic violence can shock the more sensitive demographics. <br /> <br /> volumes can be written on this film. But the film is so good that during the North American premiere of Inglorious Basterds at the Montreal Fantasia Festival, I had to pee, but I refused to go there to miss no scene. I hope this picture reflects how much I am attached to this film and that I am an audience difficult to satisfy.
