A cowboy couple helps a group of Mormons cross a rugged country en route to a new settlement. This understated Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks big stars. Johnson ranks first, but his role is mostly minor, though Carey and he work well together. Dru has little to do except to provide a loving interest. The best performance is given by Ford, Ford's favorite, as a leader of Mormons. In fact, this role helped him to land a role in the long film of the Western television channel "Wagon Train" before his untimely death at 57 years. With his superb cinematography, Ford considered it one of his favorite movies.
