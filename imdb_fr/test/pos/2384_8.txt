cool movie. nice to watch. I hope to see more of Fred Carpenter soon. I really like setting the location with all new york references. it was interesting to see how it all went at the end. the suspense factor was effective and the acting, although kept simple, was also effective at representing the characters. There are a lot of neat little tricks incorporated into this movie that make everything better. I think the support actress did a great job in her role. the casting and the realization in this film seem to be perfectly sewn and the quality of the shooting is impressive. the film is not without sweet moments either, which gives it a nice feeling of balance.
