"Best In Show" traces the stories of a handful of human candidates as they prepare for one of the largest dog shows on the calendar. Any amateur psychologist would say that an unconditional love and an obsession for a pet is the sign of something missing in someone's life, and each character fills this cliche. There is former high school student Hottie who is now married to a geek man, the Yuppie couple without children and obsessed with etiquette, the lonely young man, the young wife of an old rich codger (with his dog trainer at short hair) and the gay couple. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so funny is the way it portrays these stereotypes in a very believable way - almost affectionate in many cases. Every ridiculous thing that one of the characters does or says - with their dog as an innocent bystander - seems to be the kind of behavior one would expect to see at a dog show. <br /> <br /> The biggest laughter comes from the commentary team of an American-style sports commentator, comparing moments spent in a dog show with parts of a baseball game, and his English, academic canine, foil. <br /> <br /> The tests of the geek husband as his The blonde wife meets a surprising number of men from his past, she is also always a laughter, as well as the crazy behavior of the young couple yuppies while the pressure rises, while their dog remains completely without brilliance. <br /> <br /> watch - even if cats are no longer your bag.
