Business vs personal conviction. Profit against art. <br /> <br /> As with any documentary between big capitalist corporations and the small producer, the viewer will invariably have to take sides for one or the other based on his or her own convictions. It is just as much a documentary about the new standardized way of doing things that globalization brings us, compared to traditional methods where the character and art of doing things matter almost more than selling the product. . <br /> <br /> If you have to remember one thing from this film, it's because the masses can no longer decide for themselves, they just follow the taste of one or two critics who tend to equalize and normalize the taste in the same way that MacDonald do for the quick bite (something that Parker himself admits in the film in the context of a Burger King sign). "Everything is a question of image" in relation to the content, as another interviewee says. This is the easy way, the standard way. Easier than taking the time to ripen a good wine, easier than forging for himself by trying again and again. The controlled taste of the brand is easier. <br /> <br /> There is a glimmer of hope when even some of our cousins ​​on the other side of the ocean agree that some people "level" the taste of wine to maximize profits and ensure maximum. of it is sold to the "gray masses". Individuality and difference are sacrificed for the extra money. It is nice to see that everything or everyone does not give in to normalization, even on the other side of the ocean. <br /> <br /> As in many other parts of the world today, the dominance of a few and the reduced freedom of choice affect us all. ... that everyone decides and decides what to do. Too much normalization kills the mind and the taste; the difference brings innovation and healthy competition and allows choice - not just vacuum packaging "unlike". Standardization sells easily and a lot, and puts everyone on the same level - the lowest. <br /> <br /> With that, I'll open a nice bottle and wish you a good "health".
