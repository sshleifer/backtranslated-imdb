It's a wonderful movie as a movie - it gets an 8 out of 10. As a film shot of a specific story ... we want to be more affectionate, but it's a 5 out of 10. And I think I am being very charitable. <br /> <br /> How was he - this man on horseback and sword who was the youngest general "boy" of the Union of American Civil War, and finished dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the Indian tribes of North America? Opinion, militant, charismatic, bloody, ambitious, intelligent, too intelligent, Indian foe, Indian friend (?) And national hero. His death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of glory equivalent to that of Washington, Lincoln, Jackson and Grant / Lee and Sherman / Jackson. It was only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious scarecrow - that his reputation deteriorated. Still, George Armstrong Custer remains the most remembered figure in our military history and has lost his last fight (I can not think of anyone else like him), maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his men at Bataan Death March - but Wainwright survived the March and World War II). <br /> <br /> Custer has appeared in more movies than much better generals, due to Western adventures and Little Big Horn. Too bad the details of the real career have never been treated with as much love as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn have treated in this film. But even in 1941, the legend was still powerful. Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, who was recently mentioned in another film review on this thread. She survived George until 1933. His effective treatment of the story was therefore still in place eight years later. Custer was seen as our lost but courageous knight, and with the shadow of the Second World War looming, we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would have understood and approved. <br /> <br /> We understand that he was a hot spur, but that he was patriotic. Although virtually unprepared for West Point by demerits (which was true), Custer was part of the 1861 class, and it would have been really stupid to be difficult about a fighter of this type that year. You see, most of West Point's so-called military talents (from Robert E. Lee down) were from the south and joined Confederation. The Union needed all the northern "men of the North" they could find. <br /> <br /> Custer's career during the Civil War should be studied more closely - he was attached to the staff of General-in-Chief George B. McClellan, and distinguished himself in the Peninsula Campaign and other East Front wars. But he was a horseman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of Phil Sheridan, Grant's and Sherman's friend, in the latter part of the war. In particular, he served with impetus and distinction during the Battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of Confederation in the Shenandoah Valley. Custer was also hard hit personally (his close friend from West Point, Stephen Ramseur, joined Confederation and rose to a position similar to Custer's - mortally wounded, Custer spent all night living behind this last). <br /> <br /> After the war, things collapsed. He wanted to surrender his permanent card - Major General (this was not the case, it was a promotion on the battlefield). They had only one lieutenant-colonel to give him in the reduced army bordering the border. He tried to play politics by making the mistake of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866 and finding that most northerners hated Johnson as a foolish idiot. He supposedly admired the Indians (he was certainly eloquent in their writings and in the West), but he provoked a real military massacre in 1868 of Indian women and children that ended with a court martial. Later, in the 1870s, he would support Indian claims against a group of politicians (which would go to War Secretary William Belknap) who bought and sold for-profit Indian trading posts. This ruined Belknap and left a black eye on the Grants Administration. This put him in the niche with Grant and Sherman (the former commander of Belknap), and Sheridan barely saved his career. Then he was sent to the last Big Horn campaign. And immortality has arrived. <br /> <br /> This career is worth a real movie, but would it be too critical? Should we hold a man from the 1850s - 1876 to the 2007 standards? Would we like it to be done in one hundred years? It could certainly happen, but I'm not sure we would like it. <br /> <br /> Custer (fashionable from 1941) goes like a glove to Flynn, with his performance closest to a "dance" in his major films. His latest film with Olivia De Haviland is highlighted with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character. In support, actors such as Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn have acted very well as friends, enemies or even stealthy traitors (Kennedy). As an entertaining mythical play, its creation remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero, it is not what it should be.
