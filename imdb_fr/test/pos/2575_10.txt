I really think this film deserves Oscars! I do not care what people can say bad about this movie ... because it's a very good role played by Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci !! I'm a big fan of herself, since I saw her in Addams Family ... I try to look at everything she does, and that's really one of the best roles she has have played !! I like her looks (even if people say she is not pretty ... I think she is ... and I love her eyes) !! The film talks about a lot of things ... people say it's religious ... people say it's racism ... people say it's drugs ... people say that it's nymphomania ... well ... maybe it's a bit of all that !! But what I really feel is that this film has a great opening eye on what the blues is ... what it represents ... and especially what it comes from: life ... the heart ... the pain ... the sadness ... and especially ... spontaneous feelings !! I hope you can see it ... if you are that kind of person who loves a movie, not just because of the pictures or the story he tells ... it's a good movie to watch. .. if you are not ... well ... see it anyway ... I can not hurt too much, and you can see Christina Ricci behave so horny !! She is a fox !!
