Krajobraz po bitwie, like many of Wajda's films, may not be understandable for the "rest of the world". History based on some news from Tadeusz Borowski, prisoner of the camps of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen during the Second World War. Borowski in his books describes the inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view of the vorarbeiter Tadek - spokesman of the author who also held a privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was ruthless to humanity and ruthless to himself. He describes human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, after his return to Poland, he stopped writing artistic prose and became a communist propagandist, producing a flood of anti-imperialist and anti-American press publications. After a few years, he committed suicide. In the film, Wajda changes his point of view. Vorarbeiter Tadek - character created by Tadeusz Janczar - only plays a supporting role. The story centers on the poet, destroyed, exhausted by war and imprisonment and his one-day love affair with Nina, a Jewish woman who escaped from Communist Poland while she hates life and the Jewish mentality. In the background, we can observe a sad grotesque life called "dipis" (displaced persons) who, after liberation, are settled by the Americans in SS barracks. Walks, patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for extra dose of food and / or to German prostitutes. <br /> <br />
