"Crossfire" is no longer remembered because its three stars all had the name "Robert" but was one of the first Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> The story opens. with the silhouette murder of a man who, we will learn later, is a Jew named Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene). Captain Finlay (Robert Young), a pipe smoker, is assigned to the case. A former soldier, Montgomery (Robert Ryan) arrives at the scene of the murder and we learn by flashback that he met Samuels in a bar with other soldiers who were about to be mobilized after the Second World War . <BR /> <br /> According to Montgomery, he and his friend Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) followed Samuels and Cape. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) at Samuels's apartment for a drink. Montgomery tells Finlay that Mitchell left the apartment first and he and Floyd followed him soon after, still alive and in good health. <br /> <br /> Unable to locate Mitchell, Finlay suspects him of the murder. He hires Sgt. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) will help locate Mitchell. Mitchell, meanwhile, is amazed at the streets in a dazed state. He meets the prostitute Ginny (Gloria Grahame) in a bar and becomes friends. She gives him the key to his apartment and he rests there. Unexpectedly, a man (Paul Kelly) comes looking for Ginny. Mitchell, still dazed, goes away and goes to meet Keeley and his friends. Keeley manages to keep him away from the police and hides him in a movie theater all night long. <br /> <br /> From Mitchell's point of view, we learn that Montgomery hates Jews and is probably the murderer. Finlay begins to focus his investigation on Montgomery trying to prove his guilt. It is organized so that one of the soldiers, a child named Leroy (William Phipps) puts a trap to Mongomery. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is considered one of the best of the genre "black film". In fact, he has won several Oscar nominations, including Ryan and Grahame, in the Best Supporting Actress category. It was manufactured on a modest budget in about three weeks. <br /> <br /> It contains all the elements of the classic "black film", shadows, soft lighting and the story taking place mainly at night. The required femme fatale of the play is Ginny de Grahame, who plays a minor role but who is nevertheless your classic "femme fatale". The anonymous character of Paul Kelly (in an excellent part) was chewed and spit out by Ginny and was she about to do the same thing to Mitchell? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan steals the image as the brutal Montgomery even though it would make him tap into similar roles for years to come. Robert Young is a discreet detective, but Robert Mitchum has nothing to do but befriend Mitchell. Other actors include Jacqueline White, Mitchell's wife, Lex Barker (who will later play "Tarzan" the following year) as Mitchum's boyfriend and Richard Powers (formerly known as Tom Keene), assistant from Finlay. The director, Edward Dmytryk, will soon run up against the Uninamerican Committee of the House as having Communist affiliations and spending a few years in jail.
