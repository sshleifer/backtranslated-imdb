As a fan of history, mythology and fantasy, the show "Mystic Knights" dragged me from the start. He has a semi-decent scenario, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), he has a very good acting, and the heroes and villains play well. <br /> <br /> SCRIPTS - Half of the story is pretty awesome, the other half falls flat, but everything is mixed up, which means a lot of episodes go wrong. In addition, some key players are imposed deadlines (King Conchobar and Angus, for example), we must give them something ... more. I do not know what, but the authors should be able to suggest something. ACTION - Except for some excessive reactions of the villagers (horrible lines in which they end up putting too much effort), the castings have been extremely successful at choosing their leads, etc. Everyone, good and bad, works well together! COSTUMES / WEAPONS - The everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular! The falling Mystic Knight's armor is Deirdre's and Garrett's. A chainmail bikini would probably have better protection in his case ... and would not look so plastic; its appearance looks like a pile of brown plastic pieces, whereas it should look bronze. The Ivar trident seems to have been bought at a discount store and, although Garretts weapons look cool, they also look like plastic. <br /> <br /> Recently, "Mystic Knights" has adopted too many traits "Power Rangers", if you watch the show, you'll know what I mean. As the series progresses, she should find her place and perfect her style. All in all, it's a wonderful show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and I watch it and we are all over 20). The plot thickens and twists, even if it becomes a little juvenile in places, and everything becomes more and more interesting. This might interest fans of the movie "Willow" or the TV series "The Adventures of Sinbad" T.V. A lot of adventure, a touch of mystery, a touch of romance, a pinch of strength in nature ... Look! (My score: 7/10)
