For a long time, I did not know it was sunny or not. It's surprising, because I usually know it, but since the film did not go anywhere, I was a bit puzzled. <br /> <br /> Two people settle in a somewhat communal household. Noticing that their spouses work or go on a business trip, their attention, out of sheer loneliness, goes astray. After a platonic love affair, the main role played by Tony Leung Chiu reveals that he is accompanied by a mistress. Su Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung, is hurt, even though their love affair was not physically consumed. Chiu leaves the country and returns only years later, when everything changed. <br /> <br /> For the cynic, the film is correct. By never touching actively or really the role of love, but by approaching, the film, certainly, says more than so many others on the subject. It is also true, I think, that nothing good could have happened if they had continued to have this affair. At least, that's what I feel. <br /> <br /> If we must believe it, however, when Garica Marquez writes that "... love is a state of grace, the omega, an end in itself", then this film is sorely lacking in this, like all the others. Or, if you are inclined to totally incomplete minimalism, hit it well. Which films of the story have realized, approached or supported this sentence, if only for a short moment? My honest feeling in memory is that about two. When Harry meets Sally effectively suggests this romantic perfection; and getting it is just getting there. It is interesting to note that in When Harry Met Sally, this is done in order to woo, rather than in its realization. Can not someone say a lot about love after it has been done by two people? Nicholas Spark's recent movie, The Notebook, may be closer to it than any other movie. should we believe that once the love obtained, it disappears from the radar to exist perfectly in another dimension or, perhaps more true, to become a latent vehicle for other purposes? <br /> <br /> In the Mood for Love is an honest film, with a sumptuous and generous cinematography, worthy in every respect of the best that Almodovar can offer. Yet, all he can say is that "life is sometimes like that." Now, it's not a trivial matter to say, especially if it's well said, but the problem really arises at the end of the last act when Kar Wai Wong tries to complete the film by telling, for the second time only, a historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship that has just unfolded. This is a commendable effort, and the variation of the musical pattern played throughout the film is rather brilliant, but the relatively unaffected imputation of the theme plays too little to have more than a superficial effect on the audience inclined from a perspective holistic, which leaves the viewer different, an error in any movie. A director should know where he is going and how to get there. But in all honesty, this is just a bad turn. However, as everyone knows, all you need is a noticeable imperfection to ruin the perfect barrel of honey. <br /> <br /> The effort is worth it; to try to let a historical theme expand and complete the film and bring it out beyond the micro-meaning of the couple, but without any real foreshadowing, is the crucial error. In a word, and unfortunately, it is too little, too late. I also think that the non-Asiatic viewer does not know enough about China's history to fully understand this powerful blow.
