This film has hardly ever been seen today - the only reason I can enjoy it again and again is from a lightly used copy I made when showing the film on television in 1991, here in England. <br /> <br /> Actors play obviously and this is reflected on the viewer. A very specific script makes things easier and once you've seen that, you'll want to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Rogers is the "star", but everyone contributes to a great movie, with a soundtrack of jazz to boot. There are moments of emotion during the film, but never to the point of becoming sickly sentimentalism - they are guys on the journey of a lifetime, and they convey this excitement wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you can actually get to see that.
