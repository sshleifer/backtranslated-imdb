The Hookers was for me a great story of ordinary people, like someone you may have known. I'm just trying to get there, my big shot is close. Then the small temptations of life slip, the spoiler, still stumbled. How much can your love take and give to the guy who is really not so bad, after all, just human. I liked that, I was also an extra paid in the movie. Played drums in the bar, with the group kicking several times, my 66 'green corvette was in the motel's party shots. A great cast and crew, great people, a realistic movie. I had lunch with James Coburn on Mother's Day, what a wonderful man, as I have known him for years, I will never forget him. My father spent the day with Slim Pickens and exchanged horse stories. Slim was also really down to earth. I like these guys, we really miss them. Real people who make movies about real people, thanks Levy, Gardner and Laven.
