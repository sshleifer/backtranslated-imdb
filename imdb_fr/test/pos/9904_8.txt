At the 2005 Phoenix Film Festival, the film was not a secret. Checking Out (2004) brought crowds of moviegoers to the Scottsdale film Harkins Cine-capri. Festivalgoers who queued for hours were turned away at the door, despite the ability to view two rooms. <br /> <br /> Checking Out (2004) is a beautiful animated picture; an inspiring comedy for a wide range of audiences. The director, Jeff Hare, combines the traditional cinematographic technique with a new twist of creativity, capturing Peter Falk in his biggest and most sentimental moments (usually represented in close-up intimacy) on the big screen. Checking Out (2004) is an independent and historical film that deserves your attention.
