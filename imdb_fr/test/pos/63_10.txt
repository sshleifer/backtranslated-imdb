It's really a good movie (after ignoring the references of Blake Edwards Pink Panther which he seems to be obsessed and he is extremely funny). Julie is as usual wonderful - sings and plays brilliantly. I remember seeing him at the Odeon cinema in the Haymarket, London, when he was released. However, Julie's non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR! was very unhappy and (apparently!) because of the shooting of Darling Lili's aerial shots on Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had participated in one of these plans, but she had not. Two consecutive box office failures ruined his film career for several years. But Darling Lili, like STAR!, Deserves greater recognition from the public.
