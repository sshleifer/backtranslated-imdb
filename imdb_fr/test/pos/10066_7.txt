Madonna goes into action, again and she fails again! Who's That Girl came out just a year after the huge flip of Shangai Surprise and two after the success of the cult movie Desperately Looking Susan. She chose to play in there to forget the flop of the previous film, without suspecting that the latter could also be a flop. The film was poorly received by American critics and audiences, while it was a hit in Europe. Madonna said that "some people do not want her to be successful as a pop star and movie star". The album of the soundtrack, in which she sings four tracks, is selling well and the single title has been a big hit around the world, like the World Tour. The truth is that Madonna failed as an actress because the screenplay was pretty weak. But it's not so bad, especially for those who love the 80s: it's such a dilapidated, trashy, colorful and happy action movie! In the end, it's very fun to watch.
