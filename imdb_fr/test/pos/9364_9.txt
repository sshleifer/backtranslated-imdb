Crossfire is one of those 40s movies that calls for a remake, if for no other reason than the time it is time to do it. The story on which the film is based concerns the murder of a homosexual man. But anti-Semitism was certainly a hot topic at the dawn of the post-war period, with the holocaust coming back to everyone's mind. <br /> <br /> In Robert Mitchum's biography by Lee Server, director Edward Dmytryk was interviewed. In plain language, the film could never have been shot on a hate crime against homosexuals at the time with the Code firmly in place. That could have been the case, because the character of Robert Ryan hates so much equal opportunities for everything that deviates from its social norms. <br /> <br /> It was said to Mitchum in clear terms that he was in the movie strictly for the ride. Robert Young was selected as the homicide captain of the Washington, DC police, who seized the case. Although Mitchum was ranked second, he knew from the beginning that the film would belong to Ryan. But he was the new star of RKO by playing in The Story Of Joe GI and Till The End Of Time, so he was there for insurance at the counter. Mitchum's role was as sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, George Cooper. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not a crime, even if we do not see the crime, it becomes clear that Montgomery is the one who kills Sam Levene, the Jewish representative par excellence. And it becomes clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is the culprit almost as fast as the public. It just becomes a question of proof. <br /> <br /> Ryan was one of the many Academy Award nominations for the movie, Best Supporting Actor. Although he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film was Ryan's decisive role. Similarly, Gloria Grahame was nominated for a short party as the party's daughter in the Best Supporting Actress category, but she was beaten by Celeste Holm for Gentleman's Agreement. In fact, Crossfire ran into Gentleman's Agreement and lost the title of best film and best director of Dmytryk to Elia Kazan. This is her fifth nomination for Best Screenplay and Crossfire which was won by Miracle on 34th Street. <br /> <br /> Gloria Grahame also had her own problems on the set, which spilled over from her personal life. She had big problems with her husband at the time, Stanley Clements, who was a violent husband. He was hanging around the board, causing Ed Dmytryk many problems. Fortunately, Grahame's share was small. In fact, the entire film was shot in a typical RKO economic style in 20 days. <br /> <br /> Robert Young has a particularly successful scene with William Phipps, a young Tennessee boy in Mitchum, and Ryan's suit, which Ryan constantly belittles. Young speaks very eloquently about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affected her family as Irish Catholics who went through the years of potato starvation. It's one of Robert Young's best moments on screen during his long career. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as the movie Crossfire is, it's time to be redone as a story about an anti-gay hate crime. Especially with the murder of Barry Winchell of the last decade and the debate on homosexuals in the army. <br /> <br /> It's a film whose time is almost up.
