Hercules the Avenger is by far the best entry of the muscleman genre I can remember. The critics' accusation against him - it's a cut / paste of two previous Hercules films, with some extra additions to make it cooler - misses the fact that this cut-and-paste approach solves the problem. one of the central problems of sword movies and sandals. With most of these films, the average third party flexes horribly - usually involving a love affair or secular political intrigue or both (the queen falls in love with Hercules and her evil brother pleads against them, etc.). is often difficult to hold through this look at the exciting finale. Hercules the Avenger removes all this shit from the source movies, and adds a rather quick story of an imitator of Hercules trying to get himself into power. (It should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but critical comment on the rise of fascism in Italy.) This also sets up a beautiful final fight between the true Hercules and his imitator. <br /> <br /> In a narrower perspective, I could also add that later editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from other films. For my money, the scene of the mutiny here is much better than it has appeared in Hercules and the Captive Women, as it has been reinforced with the reduction of several characters and the complication of their plot. <br /> <br /> There are also floppy disks of monsters, scary atmospheres of the underworld borrowed (literally) from Mario Bava, a whole city destroyed, and the usual number of pretty girls in revealing dresses. Since no one expects any of these movies to compete with The Seven Samurai - or even The Magnificent Seven - it seems a little difficult to remember the film borrowing from other films.
