Enough to be plausible and still fun, it's a pure slice of the 1970s (even the cops really need a haircut!). Shot in and around London, the plot of the ex-American inmate trying to get straight to the point but sent as an electrician to a Mayfair bank, then fooled by crime lord David Niven, and found in the process of plotting the crime of the century is well managed. <br /> <br /> I liked its simplicity and even its innocence, it goes back to a time when caper films were where such a case, a caper and violence were not part of the deal. <br /> <br /> Overall, you could do a lot worse than look at this: he has enough twists to give him punch and a distribution that was obviously fun to make. <br /> <br /> Well done and observable.
