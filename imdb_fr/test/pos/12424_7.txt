In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Monster Man is surprisingly well done - though stupid - but has little horror. Add a little comedy to a friend, a beautiful gore and intense fear. It's hard not to say that Monster Man is really fun. The small budget seems pretty obvious, but it does not affect the presentation of the film in general and does not shame other big budget horror movies. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is a bit generic. Two friends, Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) are driving across the country to stop the marriage of a woman Adam has always loved. Although Adam is a nerdy guy, Harley is a self-proclaimed lady and a big offensive mouth. By adding a bonus to the plot, they then took a sexy hitchhiker, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things turn into a nightmare when a monster truck with a scary face pursues them. When the dead body starts to count, they have to race against the clock before taking their own lives, at risk. <br /> <br /> The plot is obviously reminiscent of many famous horror movies, but Michael Davis' success is assured by keeping the tension. Fear is fairly well constructed, where characterization is never the best, but good enough. The screenplay is also full of comedies that work for fun moments and they are pleasant rather than awkward and also await the transformation of the finale. It's hilarious and shocking at the same time, which is quite fun. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Monster Man is surprisingly fun. It deserves more attention on the big screen. This proves that the big budget is not an effective horror film, but the know-how! Something the director has shown and delivers.
