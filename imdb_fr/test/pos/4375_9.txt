Mr. Carlin left our joint forum in June 2008, shortly after going to the hospital for chest pain (he had a history of heart problems). The media and comics around the world have covered the loss more than I would have expected ... but he was the grandfather of the comedy of observation. <br /> <br /> This recording was his last production and contained a large section. devoted to the subject of death and the prospects of life thereafter. The filming of the project took place shortly after his seventieth birthday, which he was happy to have achieved (observed?). I've followed Carlin's career since the days of blurry black and white television and enjoyed his top-notch albums. <br /> <br /> It's a privilege for ALL Pug fans to see at least (if not own a copy) of this particular show. He was still moving fast and with good timing, even at age 70! As he would say, "he is not" smiling from the sky for you. "If he does anything, he does not take harp lessons, maybe he's looking up !! !
