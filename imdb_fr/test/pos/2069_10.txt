I've watched every version of this piece that I can think of, including many on the stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> He has the most wonderful voice for the theater, and his expressive face will take you on roller coasters of emotions throughout this play. The way he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. He (as Hamlet) can in one moment be loving, sweet and gentle and in another moment unleash himself against the hell that is his life. You think he's in pain, you think he's angry, you think he's not a little crazy. You believe he is Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the thanks go obviously to Shakespeare :), but without an excellent actor to get the words from the page to the stage, it does not matter how much a piece is well written. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, you absolutely must see this version. If you do not like Shakespeare, you should definitely see this version. If you do, you will leave with a new appreciation of Shakespeare. The nuanced performance of Sir Derek will leave you speechless.
