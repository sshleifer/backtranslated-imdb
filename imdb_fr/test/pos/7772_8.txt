Since the opening sequence, filled with black and white shots reminiscent of those of Gordan Parks, this film plunges the viewer into a feeling of artistic renaissance. The backdrop of a well-known poetry caf√©, "The Sanctuary", provides just that. The jazz that permeates the film and cinematography will seduce you. <br /> <br /> This love story allows love to grow, evolve and, ultimately, mature, a rarity in Hollywood. Everyone can identify with one stage of their journey towards each other. This story of two artists who can not understand everything has sparked a debate among the audience. Should she have gone? Should he have stopped him? Who knows ...? <br /> <br /> With Larenz Tate (Darius Lovehall) and Nia Long (Nina Moseley) with a stunning performance by Isiah Washington (Soap) and Lisa Nicole Carson (Josie Nichols) as the ultimate best friend, this film is a romantic jewel. <br /> <br /> See this one with someone you love (wink).
