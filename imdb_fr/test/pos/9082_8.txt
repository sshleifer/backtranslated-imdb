Although Flatliners is 15, tonight was the first time I saw him. I had heard about the movie Flatliners, but there was never anything to do to get me out and rent it or show it. Well, I saw it on one of the premium channels and I must say it was very good. <br /> <br /> This film was about bright young medical students who decided to explore death. They found a way to kill someone briefly and bring them back to life. Besides the cast of stars, this film was something serious. The simple thought of exploring death is quite captivating, but I really thought that the screenwriter and the director had done a great job in giving a different but breathtaking view. It was not a generic attempt to scare, frighten and run our minds ... it was the real deal. <br /> <br /> Instead of making it an empty thriller, superficial and studded with stars, this film had content. A thriller with a hard, biting nose and white joints at the edge of the seat. I give him an 8/10.
