The jungle is more of an adventure than a sci-fi movie. The only science fiction mammals are the woolly mammoths that live today. <br /> <br /> Elephants attack villages in a part of India and also cause death. An expedition is sent to investigate and one of its members, an American hunter, blames these elephants for being frightened by woolly mammoths, which are supposed to be extinct. Nobody believes it at first, but they do it when the Mammoths appear at the end. An earthquake has completed them. <br /> <br /> The Jungle was shot in India and has many beautiful landscapes and good Indian music, including songs that advance the film. Mammoths are actually elephants with fur coats and long stuck tusks. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (The Moon Cat Women). <Br /> <br /> The jungle is worth seeing, just for the scenery and the music. Very pleasant. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
