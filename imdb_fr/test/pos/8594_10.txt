I feel very lucky to have the chance not only to watch this film, but also to learn about this fascinating person and time. Lumumba is an exceptional representation, giving a complete sense of history without falling into the usual traps of Hollywood - yes, he is shown with his wife and children, but most of the story is his politics and those of the Independent Congo still emerging. The film is brilliantly shot and is moving at an ever-engaging pace. I can not wait to see more of Raoul Peck's films, as well as other Eric Ebouaney's films!
