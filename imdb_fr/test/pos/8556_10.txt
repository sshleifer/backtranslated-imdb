I saw this film a hundred times without ever getting bored. I first saw this film at the age of 7 and since then it has left a mark in my memories. It is an enchanting love story that attracts the sun for most people, even in the darkest moments. I think it's a "must-see" movie and one of Anthony Quinn's best performances. I just wish TV channels would send this movie more often. That inspired me in a good way and that's what he's going to do to many others. If there was one actor I wanted to meet, it would be Anthony Quinn. There will never be such a thing on silver screens, ever. Wish that Anthony Quinn is still alive. God bless his soul.
