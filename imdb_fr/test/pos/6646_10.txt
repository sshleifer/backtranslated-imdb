Bergman's Skammen is one of the most realistic representations of war of all time. It's not an action movie at all, although the pace is faster and there's more action than most other Bergman movies. Nor is it a romanticization of war or patriotism, unlike most war films. In fact, the realism and deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalty have a very contemporary appearance. <br /> <br /> Skammen is a dark film, you have to watch at night, to let it work, it's magic. . Many effects are transmitted indirectly, but so effectively that some scenes compete intensively with an incredibly huge budget movie like Saving Private Ryan. Of course, the action in Skammen is much smaller but it is still impressive. <br /> <br /> Although the film style looks contemporary, the film frame is timeless and sensational. The war-torn campaign and even the still intact provincial hamlet could be anywhere, anytime. And this film does not deal with specific historical events, with specific names and dates, but with universal human reactions to adversity and chaos. <br /> <br /> The acting in Skammen, though generally impressive of Ullman and Sydow, is not of prime importance in this film, unlike most other Bergman films. In most of the film, they are spectators, much like us. Bergman has imposed war on them, and through them, the public, and their reaction is perhaps what our reactions might be. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/10
