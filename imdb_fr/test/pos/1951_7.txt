A teen movie about anxiety, friendship, loyalty and growth ?? but it is not a happy excursion because of the circumstances and dilemmas that change the life of the place. What happens is quite numb, haunting and downright cold. However, I was expecting something a little more powerful and effective, and while exciting and unforgettable, it did not generate much emotion. The performances are reasonably mixed, but there is brutal honesty for all. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are incredible ?? Crispin Glover does it eccentrically and the death of Keanu Reeves seems to pay off in his usual slacker role. Joshua John Millar is very good, as is Ione Skye. Jim Metzler scores with a short, but very engaging performance. The story is dramatically confrontational, imprinted with character and heartbreaking in its eventual collapse where it infuses a hard and painful blow. JÃ¼rgen Knieper's swirling musical score is bubbling with anxiety, tension and wonder as morals and commitments are put to the test and learned.
