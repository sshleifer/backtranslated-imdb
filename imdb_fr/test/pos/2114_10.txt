It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light humor of this year's best family film ... Grand Champion. The story of a 12-year-old boy (Buddy) who, with the help of his sister, mother and best friend, is determined to raise a great champion. It's a fantastic trip to the big competition. After Hokey Pokey is crowned Grand Champion, he is auctioned for $ 775,000. pay for the education of college kids. Buddy discovers that the next time he sees Hokey, it will be on a bun! The children conspire to steal the award-winning shuttlecock, promising to save him from the barbecue. This is where the fun begins ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Natalie Maines, Steven Bland, Tommy Guy, Tuff Hedeman and so many other stars set the backdrop for all the antics. You will not believe who really won the race price !!! (It looks good in a mustache) The soundtrack is rich in songs from George Strait, Natalie Maines, Willie Nelson and more. Where can you experience movie stars, country and western stars and rodeo stars ... only in Texas ... only at the Grand Champion. <br /> <br /> This is a masterfully designed "little" film that could be the best movie you'll see this year. The film is released in some cities on Friday, August 27th. 2004. <br /> <br /> Another great movie from Rope the Moon and Michaelson Productions is IN A WHISPER. Keep an eye on the wired networks for this one!
