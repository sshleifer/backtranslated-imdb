I saw this film for the first time in the mid-60s, when I was a teenager, and it moved me a lot, in fact the final scene where Han Suyin heard about Mark's death, then rushed up the hill in disbelief, then you heard Mark's voice saying "Give me your hand", then his image disappears, the superstitious butterfly, the music, the broken emotions of Love of Han Suyin, have just left me sobbing. Outside, I cried bitterly, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked by my reaction. I just left the room to be alone. Fortunately, I do not react like that BUT I always cry at the end. I like everything about the film, the music mainly, Han Suyin's costumes and the location. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the handsome William Holden, they were both at their best. I have the VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of Music & Lyrics by Arthur Newman and Sammy Fain. I also have Han Suyin's book A Many Splendored Thing. I recommend this movie 100%
