The mere presence of Sam Waterston as an Indian is enough to place this film in the category of essential. It is both beautiful and very subtle, without any lines. He is tender with his kidnapped and yet we can see him among the proudest of all young Indian men. Martin Sheen is just a silly cluck who decides to challenge Waterston (White Bull) for a magnificent white horse. The other subplots are really useless. I do not understand the role played by Caroline Langrishe as a poor girl that White Bull kidnaps ... I do not know how she keeps her hands away from this handsome Indian man! It's very funny, though; especially if you are a Waterston fan. Dude, he looks good in this one !!! The role of Harvey Keitel does not even deserve to be mentioned, actually! But rent it and enjoy! In fact, I think that if the score was better, the film would have been more dramatic ... the music is so bad that it distracts. Always - there is Mr. Waterston!
