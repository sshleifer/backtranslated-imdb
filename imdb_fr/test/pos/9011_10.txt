It's not as good as the movie, but it's a cute children's show. Okay, the emperor has slipped again and becomes a selfish egotistical brat, accept it and take advantage of the cartoon to entertain him. He has a lot of jokes for parents and still holds children's attention. In addition, he claims two of the original voice actors of the film. Earth Kitt who has played in many movies but I am sure many people know him as Catwoman. And Patrick Walburton (sorry if I misspelt) who has also appeared in many movies and TV series, but is more widely recognized as The Tick. It's really a rare and wonderful combination. If, for no other reason, I strongly recommend comic book lovers to watch at least one episode, just to enjoy the dynamic duo. To summarize, a fun show for kids, with lots of jokes to laugh with adults. If you are looking for educational value, it's not your show. If you're looking for something funny, it's a great choice on Saturday morning!
