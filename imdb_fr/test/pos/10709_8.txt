Favela Rising is a documentary about the shantytowns of Rio, the favelas, especially the most violent, Vigário Geral. According to this film, many more children died violently in Rio's favelas in the last decade than in Israel / Palestine during the same period - a fact as amazing as it is true, which shows how much this problem of society is poorly recognized rest of the world. This is an important topic, particularly for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to bring together the poorest and most exposed through a vibrant cultural program. This is a compelling documentary, even if it is occasionally tainted by a slightly personal version of the personality and a grainy digital video and film that can sometimes make you think that you need to have your document reviewed. eyes. <br /> <br /> Lords of drug rule in favelas and armed teenagers are the main drug traffickers, as in some parts of Colombia. The film City of God / Cidade de Deus by Fernando Meirelles has been accused of celebrating violence (Cidade de Deus is another of Rio's many favelas). But the first part of Favela Rising shows that in fact, favela boys are celebrating violence and want to sell drugs where money and action are. It's cool to carry a gun there, to work as a drug dealer: it's fifty times more profitable than the income available in other ways. <br /> <br /> Mochary discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders, Anderson Sá and José Junior while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor Zimbalist to quit his job and come help to make a movie with his own promise to finance it. Sá's eloquence and charisma and a surprising twist of his life make him the center of the film and his main narrator, but like the favelas themselves, the film is teeming with other people. There is no doubt that Sá is a remarkable leader, organizer and artist. <br /> <br /> Vigário Geral is compared to Bosnia: the shot was very dangerous. Anderson Sá's friendship, protection, caution and diplomacy in the filming allowed the filmmakers to have access to detailed footage of their subjects while avoiding (especially: close calls) any serious confrontation with lords drug or cop salespeople. They also taught the boys to use cameras and left them there on their home trips. This resulted in 10% of the images, including rare incidents of violent incidents, including beatings by the police. It is difficult for a foreigner to follow the police killings in Rio. In the early 1990s, one of them was threatening history and inspired Sá, who ended his drug-trafficking debut to lead his cultural movement. Cops are everywhere in the drug trade and if anyone does not like the poorly trained police paramilitaries come in (often wearing black ski masks) and shoot at a neighborhood, killing a lot of innocent people. <br /> <br /> This is about what we see in the City of God of Meirelles, except that this time Sá, Junior and the other guys arrive, starting in Vigário Geral, and then extending to a number of other favelas to give percussion lessons that attract Dozens of young girls and boys. Their AfroReggae program (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR), created in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the Rio ghettos. This leads them to leave behind tobacco, alcohol and drugs (it's the rule) to explode in rap, song, percussion and gymnastics in expressive and galvanic performances. Finally, the best Sá-directed performers find themselves in front of large local audiences with local producers and their Banda AfroReggae has an international registration contract. <br /> <br /> Other centers and groups have been created by or through GCAR. over the years, in Vigário Geral and other favelas, in search of the improvement of youth by organizing music, capoeira, theater, hiphop and dance performances in GCAR centers. <br /> The performing arts are not everything. , just the focal point. GCAR is also a movement for broader social change. By raising public awareness through such performances, the centers also offer training in information (newspapers, radio, Internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sex education to bridge the gap between rich and poor. poor. , black and white, and offer audiovisual work workshops, including the production of documentaries. The program is currently active in four other favelas. <br /> <br /> Favela Rising has many scenes of the street of favelas and family life. They look a lot like City of God images, and the results are really much more positive. Not that it is not a difficult battle. And the corruption of the police, the inequalities of the social system and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly taken into account by any of this. But there is a scene where Sá talks to young children in another favela, cynical boys who are not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and who are determined to work in the drug trade as Sá himself made it . Sá does not seem to convince anyone, although the traffickers have not yet reached the age of fifty. But we learn that the most negative boy in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There is also the story of an abnormal accident that handicapped Sá, but with a positive result. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the images were sharper and clearer and the story was changed a bit, but A vibrant and inspiring material represents a committed and risky documentary. Fortunately, Favela Rising has been included in seven film festivals and has won numerous awards, including Best New Documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently presented at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. In the United States, a large audience of the art house seems rather unlikely. <br /> <br /> Included in SFIFF 2006.
