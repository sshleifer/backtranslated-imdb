My brother made me addicted to Carlin in the 70s. I always liked his observation humor. That is to say, to look at things every day and find humor, like asking the question: "Have you ever tried to throw away an old wastebasket? You can not do it! They bring you back without stop! " And ask questions such as: why is the word kill more acceptable than the word "F", while giving meaning to the discussion? <br /> <br /> However, during the 90s, its content was less funny and more angry. What he seemed to do was hold a mirror in front of the face of the company and say, "Look!" At this point, his shows were less a comedy than a reproach. But in all fairness, he has always made a lot of sense. It really made you think. <br /> <br /> Here Carlin, old and new. He begins by having fun as he ages, then describing the state of the world. Once again perfectly logical. <br /> <br /> It was his best since "Jammin" in New York ", and as he turns out to be the last one. <br /> <br /> I think" The shooter "was at John Wayne, or "A mate of the meadows" to Robert Altman, "It's bad for you" is from George Carlin A farewell to a real big icon Love it or hate it, I think we'll remember him.
