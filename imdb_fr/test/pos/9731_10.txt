It's good to see a new batch of puppets wreaking havoc in this series. I found this chapter very amusing. In fact, it would probably be my second favorite of the series. This film has very little violence and is only rated PG-13. This is particularly different from the other R-rated puppet master movies that were loaded with gore and violent chaos. The lack of violence, however, does not diminish the pleasure. This film also has much better special effects than the last movie in this series. Well.
