This film reminds me so many memories! I was very young when he came out but I remember the first time I saw him! My dad and I were still watching the movie "Ernest Movies" together. We had not seen one for several years and I found some really cheap. We watched them and could not stop laughing. I like all "Ernest Movies", but this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Spoiler part! <br /> <br /> The part I remember most is the "magnet" part. My dad always makes the scene of the electric chair! <br /> <br /> End Spoiler! <br /> <br /> It's a very lame film ... but excellent! It's perfect for families (it does not look like trash), but at the same time adults can laugh too! If you like physical humor (like facial expressions and how people move), then this is the movie for you!
