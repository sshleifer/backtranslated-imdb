This film is exceptional in that Marlene & Raymond presents remarkable performances. Playing in this film is the greatest force of production, but the screenplay, the production and editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exists between the two stars. If you like Marlene and if you like Raymond, you'll love this movie ..... (It's a classic that compares to Casablanca.) <br /> <br />
