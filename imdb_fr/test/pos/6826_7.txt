I can not understand the need to jump back and move in the background, and spread the plot. Showing that someone has a skill just before using it, I think, offends our intelligence. He begins to feel a little artificial, and as if they made up for their vagueness for the first three series. A bit disappointing for this episode. <br /> <br /> In addition, using oddities from the past, like Locke's ability to know when a storm is over, is frankly insulting ... are we supposed to scream or laugh, or laugh at the sweetest side Locke? <br /> <br /> This episode was everywhere.
