A great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their 1960s years of study to ten years later: a Yugoslav immigrant in love with the American dream and struggling with a reality often violent; a fireman's son prematurely bald; a soldier; and the crazy hippie girl they all love. Good leadership and solid distribution do justice to Steve Tesich's brilliant script; the dialogue is not as lively as in "Breaking Away", but the themes of growth and father-son conflict are also discussed, and there are still some wonderfully comical moments between shock and drama.
