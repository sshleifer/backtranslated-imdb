The other night, I wandered around Blockbuster with a friend, having decided that we were too broke and too lazy to be active. She decided that she wanted to watch Closer, which seemed such a rebellious idea that I had to rent another movie for once she had gone to bed. Looking around me, I did not see much that interested me, but I saw The Doll Master in the news section. Just on the base of the cover cover (a doll-faced woman crying tears of blood) I thought it would be pretty interesting to rent. house, with all the lights off it was pretty scary. I must admit that I've always had a little phobia of dolls since I was a child (and that I watched a horrible film called Asylum, one of the stories that is told involved a mental patient creating a doll that kills people, lame, but scary at the time) and the first three quarters of this movie really hit me. The first half hour in particular was great. The frightening atmosphere was really setting the scene in place and, without moving, the dolls seemed really threatening. But unfortunately, as soon as they started to move, everything became a little cheesy, I was a little disappointed when moments that could have been really scary made me laugh because of the way they were filmed . <br /> <br /> for the characters, it's a horror movie, you do not expect anything memorable. I found that I remembered names and faces better than most of the Asian horror movies I saw, which suggests that there was a hidden development of characters that I did not consciously Note. The typical stereotypes are in effect in this film, each having a kind of quirk of character that sets them apart from others, from the timid and silent Yeong-ha and his Damien doll to the outgoing bimbo, Seon-yeong. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot itself was pretty cool, although the end, which brought together many elements of the plot, seemed a little confusing and did not really nothing done for me, although it has intrigue-twists that I will not mess up here. The basic plot is a group of children are invited to be modeled as dolls by a famous manufacturer of reclusive dolls, they must stay in the scary house (adorned with scary dolls, some big or small) and things start to happen as our heroine Hae-mi begins to explore the areas of the house and things begin to happen to other inhabitants. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would definitely recommend the movie. Do not watch with too many people, because certain moments would probably make you laugh if you are surrounded by friends, but also watch something in the dark, with the windows and doors open just a bit, in case a doll would want to watch with you. This really leaves you guessing for most of the movie, allowing you to go on crazy plot theories to destroy them completely later. If you really get in the way and do not know it in certain places, I can guarantee that you will check under your bed before you go to bed and maybe even leave the lights on. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's just me: P As for Closer, it was ok but I preferred that.
