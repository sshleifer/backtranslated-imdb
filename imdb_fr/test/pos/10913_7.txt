The most entertaining performance was that of Shalom Harlow, the girlfriend of Matt Dillon's model. She was more interesting to me than all the main actors. This film is all wrong. Even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Cusask, could not get up about the conspiracy ridicule. I enjoyed hearing "Macho Man" from the village people about the closing credits. The rest of the film could have been tolerated if it was to reach that level of energy.
