This film has been excellent from beginning to end. The action, the dark humor and the incredible bad luck that our hero encountered at each turn fascinated me. Thomas Jane is an excellent actor and I hope to see him in many other upcoming movies. While reading other people's comments, I must admit that I never thought of Tarrantino by looking at "Thursday," but now that I think about it, I suppose there are similarities. I guess I do not spend a lot of time trying to connect everything to everything else. The rape scene between Porizkova and Thomas Jane is one of the sexiest scenes of all time.
