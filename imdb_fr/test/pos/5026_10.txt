Honestly, I loved Michael. although there were parties "Give me a pillow, I have to take a nap", it was cool. I think everyone did a great job in this movie. and nora ephron is in my list of directors "ok". <br /> <br /> It's nice to see John Travolta as an angel with a rounded belly. it's not very often that I see one in a movie. Some people might call it a boring movie, but for me, I loved it. the angels and all.
