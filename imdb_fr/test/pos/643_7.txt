It may be the most energized movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's so nerve-wracking that I could not watch it after watching it two years ago, but I've been going since I got the DVD . There are some scenes here that are almost too much to watch ... so if you have problems and you need to "escape" for an hour and a half, this movie will avoid anything else. <br /> <br /> The Russian actress Marina Zudina did a great job with regard to facial expressions, which she had to do since her character here is silent. She plays a cute and healthy makeup artist for a shady filmmaker. Once the filming day is over and "Billie" is about to leave, she hears something. She glances into the room where they were filming and discovers they are shooting a "snuff film" and are killing someone. We discover listening to Billie and she runs to save her life while the killers look for her in this big building resembling a warehouse. <br /> <br /> There are two very long scenes in which our heroine runs for her life and both of them will carry you. The first I described above. The second scene, the most decisive, lasts too long and is not as successful as the first. In fact, the film should have been a little cut, but overall, since it keeps our attention so well, it was then used for entertainment.
