Who are the people who play in this business? Never heard of them !! But it's one of the funniest comedies I've ever met. He should win the Putz Puller prize for the parody. The absurd begins with Dr. Jeykl who sniffs his powder and turns into a rascal sex. He is pursued by a libido-centric nurse at the beginning of the film in one of the funniest scenes in the film. Pay attention to the sound system of the hospital in the background; a bit like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the prize makes me laugh for years. Oh ... and "busty nurse" is Cassandra Peterson, who has become Elvira, Mistress of the Dark. <br /> <br /> If you liked Mel Brooks classic movies (Blazing Saddles, etc.), I guess you'd like this one. <br /> <br /> Damn, pity you can not have it. DVD anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's available on DVD now !!!!! Good thing that DVDs do not wear out of their use !!!!!
