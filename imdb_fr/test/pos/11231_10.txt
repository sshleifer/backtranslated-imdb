A dream movie with a striking atmosphere takes place in a small town in Northfork, Montana in 1955. Government officials arrive to evacuate the city, which is about to be flooded by a new hydroelectric dam. There are other visitors in the city, the angels of another time but they are only seen by a dying boy, Irvin. A local priest (Nick Nolte in a heartbreaking and silent performance) takes care of the boy. Irvin begs the angels to leave the place with them ... <br /> <br /> The film contains a supernatural quality, a dignified mourning and a sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of all relations, cities, countries , civilizations, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we go through them in ultimate solitude. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the film that touched me the same way and as deeply as "Northfork", so beautiful and so tender, so calm and so powerful, so heartbreaking and moving. Even now, several weeks after I've seen it, tears come to my eyes when I think about it. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent a message to one of my friends and asked, "Please, tell me what I just saw?" And my friend responded with the words, "You just saw one of the greatest movies in modern times, one of these days, others will see the light."
