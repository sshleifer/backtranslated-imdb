A European musician and composer undertakes to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul. Alexander Hacke (from the German avant-garde group Einstürzende Neubauten), a music lover, explores the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and his "magic mike" to draw an inspired portrait of Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a broad spectrum ranging from modern electronics, rock and hip-hop to classical arabesque. As he walks through this seductive world, Alex collects impressions and pieces from artists such as neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula, Fusion Orient Expressions DJs, rock bands Duman and Replikas, the nonconformist rocker Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkish response to Public Enemy), breakdance performers Istanbul Style Breakers, digital dervish Mercan Dede, renowned clarinettist Selim Sesler, Canadian folk singer Brenna MacCrimmon, street performers Siyasiyabend, Kurdish singer Aynur, the "Elvis of the Arabesque" Orhan Gencebay and the legendary divas Müzeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu.
