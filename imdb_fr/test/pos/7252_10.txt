This movie is great. Elegant, fun, good acting. I had already described it as "lockable carabiner, stock and two smokers" and "tank fops", both of which are excellent descriptions. The plot is simple, but it does not detract from the pleasure. Carlyle is a brilliant ruffian and Miller is an excellent drunk gentleman. The sets and costumes are breathtaking, and the music and camera work is incredibly unusual for a "costume drama". Sense and Sensibility it's really not !!!!! My recommendation? Go see it, sit down with a huge bowl of popcorn and have a good time.
