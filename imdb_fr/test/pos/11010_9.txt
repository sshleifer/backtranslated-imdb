The premise of SF is not unique (although it was at the time), but its purpose is completely different from that of other artificial reality movies. Especially during the first part, this is an elaborate crime picture, which uses the premise of SF to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of characters in the process disappearance and useless witnesses who must not lie. to be useless. Instead of an unreliable narrator, we have an unreliable world. <br /> <br /> In the second part, we follow the main character's struggle for mental health and it becomes more of a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. He knows that his very existence is none other than electrical impulses. How does he deal with this knowledge? He knows that there is a more real world than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where no one can understand it. The problem of thinking about something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a real problem that many of us can identify. For me, the film carries this despair very well, with its sullen and artificial atmosphere that also supports the art facticity of the film world. <br /> <br /> Other than "The Matrix" or "The Thirteenth Floor", he is not worried about arousing a sense of respect for his artificial reality plot, he focuses instead on the psychological aspects. Philosophy is only interesting insofar as certain philosophical concepts play an essential role in the way in which they shape and alter the perception of the character by the world. <br /> <br /> We can say that it is longer than necessary (which is not a problem if you are as captivated as me) and part 2 turns rather low.
