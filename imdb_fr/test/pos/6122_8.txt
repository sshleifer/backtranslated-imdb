For me, Pink Flamingos has lived up to its reputation for shocking, disgusting, disgusting, trashy film that I was expecting to see and that really contains everything except the kitchen sink. We are entitled to nearly two hours of unrelenting perversity: rape, chick sex, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism, and a horrible demonstration of anus chants. This is a strange couple who are starting a competition with a family of trailers to buy their title "the dirtiest people there is." Divine (a fat guy in the train) is an incredibly ugly human being, who becomes painful to watch. Trust me when I say that this movie should not be forgotten quickly, especially the final scene in which Divine is eating dog bullshit on the sidewalk. I always thought that John Waters was overrated and I can not say I like this movie, but it's an experience if you have the opportunity to see it.
