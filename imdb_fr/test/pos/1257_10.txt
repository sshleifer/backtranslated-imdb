From the perspective that it is possible to make films that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is really worth it. This is the second Bruce Willis film in a series that manages to tell his story without nudity, without humor, without blazon or gratuitous violence. (I'm referring of course to The Sixth Sense.) Both films are committed to more than one level. This one is appropriate for children as well as, as others have pointed out, it is not a children's movie. <br /> <br /> I was worried that the time travel device that animates this plot is never explained, except that we know that Russell himself initiates it at the age of 70 years. Also, why does her dying mother have to come to school to get it when he wins the fight? why, if, as his eldest says, he has to fight this kid again and again for the next few years, his mother does not have to pick him up every time and why he does not learn to type in the process. I also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate for action on stage. <br /> <br /> Good use of the red plan as a metaphor, however.
