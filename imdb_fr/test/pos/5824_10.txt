HBO created this show in order to make us see the most realistic vision possible of the prison and they did a hellish job. Oz was created by the creators of Homicide who wanted to show a rough version of the prison. It was this show that kicked off all the other original HBO programs, such as Sopranos, Sex and the City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood and Six Feet Under, among others. Oz is the nickname of Oswald State Penitentiary, a fictitious prison in a US state that is never declared (though, with accents, crime scenes and racial distribution, NY is assumed). The main prison unit examined is Emerald City, an apparently ideal prison unit with more deprivations than others imagined by a liberal unit director named Tim McManus. Overall, this show shows us what life really looks like if you want to survive in prison. <br /> <br /> There are about 10 gangs on Oz. We first have Muslims, a group of blacks who want to destroy the injustices of the criminal justice system and help improve the lives of blacks around the world. They are led by Kareem Said, a black militant minister who wants to destroy all that is racist in the justice system. As a group, they are not so anti-white but rather anti-unfair. Our second group of Blacks is the Homeboys, who are essentially Blacks in the street who want to keep all the ghetto's bad behavior and manage the drug trade. Their direction varies mainly because they always lose members because of the violence. In this group, Simon Adebisi is one of the most terrifying characters. Adebisi is an African detainee who is essentially the most horribly evil character in the world. This gang, as a whole, sometimes receives help from the Irish and is still in conflict with Latinos and Sicilians for the purposes of drug distribution. Since Oz is mostly black, Homeboys have the highest number of soldiers among all gangs. <br /> <br /> Latinos and Sicilians, like the Homeboys, have various leaders because of the violent deaths that occur throughout the show. Sicilians have about the most important word on how illegal activity is conducted in Oz. Latinos make their presence known so that they can at least run well if they are not in control. Unlike Homeboys, however, these gangs do not compete as much for power and are generally more stable when it comes to drug use. The Irishmen mentioned above are a small group led by a manipulator and snakel, Ryan O'Reily. O'Reily always manages to stay in good graces with all the powers of drugs and manages to manipulate things in his own way whenever he wants. They do not control illegally, but they have at least good relations with everyone who does it. <br /> <br /> Among the whiter prisoners, we have Bikers and Aryans. Bikers are simply tattooed addicts who help the Aryans most of the time. The Aryans are the most hated and hated gang of most Oz viewers. They are led by Vern Schillinger, one of the most racist, sick, and sadistic characters we can ever see. The two gangs do not control anything illegal. They simply let the darker inmates see that they posed a serious threat to anyone who thinks all white inmates are soft. We also have others. The Others is a gang of foreign prisoners that does not necessarily pose a problem to another inmate. In this group, we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a girl whose life is forever changed by prison. We also see Augustus Hill, a black man tied to a wheelchair for killing a police officer who tells the series and introduces the public to each inmate. The character's crimes are shown as they are presented and Augustus lets us know how long they will stay in jail. Finally, among the gangs, there are Christians and gays. Christians are simply religious not to lose their reason and gays are a gang of transvestites often raped by other inmates. <br /> <br /> This program explores many issues related to the criminal. justice system and is more explicit than any movie about prison. Since language is not published, we have more epithets and racist words here than in any other television program. Augustus Hill's comments allow us to fully understand each problem related to Oz. This sight as good as it is is not at all for the light heart. It explicitly shows the use and distribution of drugs by all means possible: rape in prison, murder, deadly stabbing, and gore in general than anything others have seen. In my opinion, this is the most influential and biggest show ever created, but I can see at the same time why other people would be disturbed by this show. If you are interested in shows and movies about the prison, Oz is a must.
