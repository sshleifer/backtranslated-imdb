I waited a long time to comment on this program and I thought it was time for justice to be done. It's one of Christie's darkest, most sinister and most engaging works, not just being killed for money, it's a dark and deeply engaging story of mystery, intrigue, love and murder, made even better by the changes made by the adapter. The level of play is absolutely superb, Joan Hickson is sublime in the game, as always! The rest of the cast, including Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry, is very beautiful, but I think the show is stolen by Margaret Tyzack, the final scene between her and Joan Hickson is just magical. as good as it sounds, chilling, moving and totally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Please let me know if you agree with my words. I'm looking forward to the remake to see how good Geraldine McEwan's version is. Watch and enjoy.
