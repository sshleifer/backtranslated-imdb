This film was revolutionary in the former Soviet Union, because it was the first film released on the market containing a real sex scene. However, the film can be considered brilliant for many reasons, the most serious of which is the cruel picture of disillusionment and pain in the family of a family of the Soviet working class. I will definitely recommend it.
