The story begins with the transport of a soldier to a desert city, then goes back in time to tell how he arrived at this place. He began as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt, but was separated from his unit. After almost dying of hunger and / or thirst, he fell on a leopard who became his companion at heart. This brought him food, and soon the soldier became almost totally wild, as his bond with the animal was acute. All ended, however, and the man decided that it was necessary for him to leave the creature. A very strange film, well written and represented. Beautiful landscapes of Jordan and Utah that have not always mixed perfectly, but we do not care.
