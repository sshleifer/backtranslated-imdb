"Committed" describes Graham in his irrepressible optimism, which sets off in search of her husband so much separated from himself and looking for him, which leads to a kind of comic and optimistic odyssey featuring several characters. A cool, funny and unpredictable little film, which is missing in "Commit" in a story of good humor, a subtle morality and maxims. If you like this little girls movie, which has received slightly above average reviews from critics and the public, you might want to try Lisa Krueger's Indie "Manny & Lo" (1996). (B)
