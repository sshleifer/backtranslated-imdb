Wow, what a strange movie. It's a David Lynch movie, so it's not surprising that it's weird. <br /> <br /> I challenge anyone to fully explain everything in this movie. I can not be done. After some research after watching this film for the second time, I know about most of the story, but at first glance, and without the help of other commentators or outside help, it's hard to understand. So, if you are in this boat and you are confused, do not feel bad; It's normal. Let me say that the key of the film is the character of Naomi Watts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I find the film fascinating. I love great graphics and rich colors and I find each character in this movie really different and fun to watch. The work of the camera is excellent and the music is scary, like Lynch's "Blue Velvet". There are also good sound effects to help some dramatic scenes. In all, it is very well noted. <br /> <br /> As with Lynch's "Twin Peaks" television series, it was a film that was coming to an end, because Lynch thought it would be a very long movie. television series. When that did not happen, he developed at the last minute this end. This may explain in part the confusion that reigns in the end and the lack of explanations about the characters we see earlier in the film but that disappear mysteriously. <br /> <br /> The theme of the story is supposed to be a negative comment about Hollywood and its impact on people, especially those whose dream of being an actor is crushed. <br /> <br /> Watts and the other main woman, Laura Eleana Harring, are very interesting to watch, especially in their lesbian celebrity. sex scene. Regarding the look, the two women were chameleons, both medium and breathtaking at other times. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie more often during the second viewing than during the viewing. It's not just a piece of curiosity; it's a very intriguing movie ..... but do not feel stupid if you can not understand some things.
