Viewers of Motorama should already be passionate about other quirky movies in the desert, such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which unfolds more or less in the desert). He also embodies the bizarre humor (and especially the eccentric journey of characters) of the comedy of the writer Joseph Minion, "After Hours". In a fantasy of desert travel, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (well played by Jordan Christopher Michael), a smart 10-year-old boy makes money in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang and runs away from his careless parents. . It begins with a journey through salvation (which is evident in the scenes with John Diehl), but once he becomes addicted to a scratch game called Motorama, he becomes easily corrupted by temptation and loses his childlike innocence. He moves from one fictitious crazy state to another by purchasing Motorama cards at participating gas stations, just enough to spell the MOTORAMA winning word and be eligible for the $ 500 million cash prize. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he's dealing with dozens of strange characters, such as Flea playing the role of a very nervous boy, Meatloaf playing a crazy biker, and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron (a Seinfeld regular) who are two violent kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The reissue of DVDs can be very misleading, as well as previous attempts to sell this film on the non-cult market first with slogans comparing it to Home Alone and Thelma & Louise. The most recent calls this a love story with the slogan that the film is about Jordan Michael Christopher on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams ... who, despite the size of his photo on the DVD cover , do 1 second Drew Barrymore cameo as a fantastic girl whose dream Gus. Why did not they just sell it for what it was? Although it may seem totally bizarre at first reading, it is actually a well-crafted story. <br /> <br /> Motorama is an excellent material for fans of strange B-quality comedies. It was an interesting story, especially because of the strength of its main actor - Jordan Michael Christopher (who Unfortunately, there are few credits on the screen - and the intelligent metaphor inherent in the plot. Let's hope his re-release on DVD will make it easier for cult fans to find.
