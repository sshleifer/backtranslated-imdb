I caught this movie about the most unlikely success? , from a lower league, the football team. The plot is thick and plays a role in some big thin twists. Clipping with snapshots and comments from the 70s. I was caught off guard by his fun-filled down-to-earth game. <br /> <br /> A superb cast includes the excellent Tim Healy as a crazy manager, stuffed with things that will win his team ...? I constantly remember some things, such as the stolen secret file that Don Revie (the US leaders, loved by fans hated by everyone) has on Bostock United (the sub-fire men) who, in his detailed report on their opposition, Bostock United, in this FA Cup final, simply says "Sh-te". <br /> <br /> Many other football blunders long before the fantastic feature film "Mike Basset - Football Coach" with Ricky Tomlinson. <br /> <br /> Up there with the English Gung ho defeating the Germans, in football. Well morally.Although the score lines are different, from "Escape to Victory" (I continue to applaud when England scores) <br /> <br /> And the heavy task of following a really bad team at Micheal Palins "Golden Gordon" From the series "Ripping Yarns" (with Terry Jones), the team's name was Bostonworth United, in case you're interested. <br /> <br /> I looked up and down a copy of the Bostock Cup - even Nick Hancock's biography did not list (probably someone -not mr hancocks- error) <br /> <br /> Play it again or sell me a copy- PLEASE ....
