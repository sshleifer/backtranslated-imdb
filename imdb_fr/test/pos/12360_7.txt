Victor Sjostrom, the grandfather of Swedish cinema, made this existentialist film about atonement, treason, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption and the darkest moments of the human condition. He embodies David Holm, a bum who reacts to a moment of kindness by resuming his drunk habits, then having to negotiate his soul with the driver of the ghost car: death. <br /> <br /> Unlike many silent films from this period, the film is almost absent and presents over-acting scenes. The pace becomes tedious with his Dickensian story too familiar. However, the review of the film in retrospect and compared to others of his time, is a very daring and unique film. The spectators of the time were not exposed to such a subject and the cinematography is formidable, symbolic and accompanied by effects of double exposure and multilayered backslides. It's really a scary and scary movie for young people. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie, it's easy to see the later influences of this film on Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the big Bergman themes are here in full screen. Sjostrom, of course, later played in Bergman's masterpiece of alienation and loneliness: the wild strawberries. This would be Sjostrom's last performance as an actor. Sjostrom based his screenplay on a novel by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. *** of 4 stars.
