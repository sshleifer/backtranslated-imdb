There are movies that are only a different version of another, not remakes, but similar to others, that's not the case. Although he talks about the Mafia, he is looked at in another way and often it is only a secondary theme. I went to see this movie just in case (the other person's theater was full) and I was satisfied at the end. It surprised me, because of its black irony or cynicism, and there are more and more interesting things to analyze. It does not follow the classic style of cinema, it's just different and I think I'm not the only one to like it. I'm very happy too because it's Italian and I was afraid that Italian filmmakers and producers would not be brave enough to change the theme. In this film, you can also watch the new Italian style, but do not make clich√©s. I hope to be quite understandable, I know it's difficult, I also hope that this film can be exported outside our borders, it is a good product to export. I also want to emphasize the music, the very good soundtrack, the film needs it because of its long silent pause and they are perfectly covered by this music. Many compliments to the director, and thank you, the cinema needs these films.
