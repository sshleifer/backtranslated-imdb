Many accuse Rod Steiger of acting excessively, and anyone who has seen Amityville Horror and the 'fly' section would have a hard time saying the opposite. That said, he is brilliant in this area. <br /> <br /> It is never broadcast on TV, you can not buy it on DVD (legitimately). In 1988, while Channel 4 still had a prescription for innovation, they showed it among a small amalgam of films from the 60s, Privilege, etc. - and I remember an essentially theatrical experience, well transposed to the film. The great thing about the theater is that it's locked up - how's the appointment available and interesting on the screen? PH almost succeeds. Because this type of film is never broadcast on cable or Sky TV, it's hard to engage in a debate, but for all who have seen it or remember it, I remember a frank performance and Sally Geeson's almost shrill 'thats all is taken care of' (which avoids the almost shy general performance of her and her brother in many early-70s offerings), she explains. There are several - key lines that you remember years, decades. It's the power of a movie like this. <br /> <br /> PS I just saw him again and it's just as good. One day, the television will also be enlightened.
