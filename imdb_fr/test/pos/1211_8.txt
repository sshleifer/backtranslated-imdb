In the 1980s struggling, the world was simple. Hulk Hogan would face Roddy Piper, Bobby Heenan's friends or Ted DiBiase and would come out victorious more often than not. From time to time, he met an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but it was mostly Hulk Hogan versus Bobby Heenan, and that's how it should be. <br /> <br /> But that night, she was about to change, a new champion, a man that the WWE thought was their man for the 90s was crowned. It did not work. But WWE was right on one point: Hulkamania was over and a new order was to be established. <br /> <br /> This historic Wrestlemania, the first to take place outside the United States, was launched by Rick Martel beating Koko B Ware. . Koko was never really lucky in Wrestlemania and was quickly eliminated. <br /> <br /> Next step, The Colossal Connection, Andre the Giant and Haku put their team titles in play against Demolition Ax and Smash. and lost. New crowned team champions. <br /> <br /> The next match saw the defeat of the Hercules earthquake. Hercules was another guy who did not really have a chance at Wrestlemania. A lot of luck for Brutus Beefcake who ended Mr. Perfect's unbeaten streak. Well, I guess someone had to stop it. <br /> <br /> Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown fought for a double in a slow but fun match, then the Hart Foundation beat Nikolai Volkov and Boris Zhukov in 19 seconds. Not really a match, unfortunately. The barbarian then defeated Tito Santana in a short game. <br /> <br /> The American Dreams Dusty Rhodes and Saphire then defeated the macho king Randy Savage and Queen Sherri in a messy match. It was the only WWE female fight at that time. <br /> <br /> The next step was a fun match as Rockers Marty Janetty and Shawn Micheals defeated the Orient Express in a quick encounter. There were a lot of good tag teams right now. Jim Duggan then beat Dino Bravo in a draw. <br /> <br /> Next Ted DiBiase put his most expensive possession, the Million Dollar Championship on the finish line against Jake Roberts. Roberts was distracted by Virgil and was counting out to keep Ted in his entertaining game and one of the longest games in the series. <br /> <br /> Next time the Twin Towers will face each other while the Big Bossman defeat Akeem Rick Rude wins a short match with Jimmy Snuka. <br /> <br /> Finally, we arrive at the main event with Hulk Hogan putting the WWE title at stake against intercontinental champion The Ultimate Warrior. It's an entertaining home-and-home match won by the warrior after Hogan missed a fall. The crowd was amazing and the match was a big show. <br /> <br /> The torch was over, but would the Ultimate Warrior prove to be the champion that WWE hoped to be?
