The Polish brothers are unique film artists, and they really pushed the limits here. A fantasy that has in common with "Wings of Desire", "Northfork" tells the story of a small town of the 1950s in the middle of nowhere, which has only two days to be flooded and submerged thanks to desire of the US government a tank instead of the city. It is a sarcastic parable about loss and remembrance, featuring angels, dreams, premonitions and the hilarious officials in government claim since "Repo Man". The performances are all remarkable, especially Nolte and Woods. I noticed, reading some of the comments, that there were people who were shocked just by the fact that the Polish twins use elliptical storytelling tactics, and I want to say that this is one of the things that make this film so great: its the desire to embrace the mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. David Mullen's cinematography is magnificent. Highly recommended; if you have suffered a significant personal loss, such as the death of a parent, I would even call this film necessary for visualization. - Ray
