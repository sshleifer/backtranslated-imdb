It must be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). It really taught me when I observed at the age of 10 (in 2000) that a child's freedom escaped earlier than expected. Joseph Mazzello must also be my favorite actor, and I think he and Elijah Wood have done a great job in the roles of brothers. This film is quite sad and some people do not understand the end. But the story itself is pretty incredible, the thought of a poor 7 year old boy (bobby) being abused by his drunk stepfather is horrible and what the two boys are doing about it is sad and important. My favorite part of the movie is when Tom Hanks (the eldest, Mike) lists the 7 things of being a lost child for the adult world. However, there are parts that could have been better done in this film, such as the casting of the mother (Lorraine Braco), who, in my opinion, is a horrible actor. "the king" has played his role well, because it is a difficult role to play. Joseph and Elijah were definitely the stars of the movie. I could not believe how much they had played the victims of an abusive father-in-law at the age they were (7 and 9 years old). But overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves big kids and big actors. :)
