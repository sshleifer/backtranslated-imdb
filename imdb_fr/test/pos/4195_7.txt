You really have to remember the Monkees and understand perfectly where and how they integrated in the second half of the 60s to fully appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> There is no plot as such. Basically, it's a crazy and mixed pastiche of various unrelated sequences. But, it's interesting AND entertaining in its own way once you're on its wavelength. In short, it was a classic, cleverly designed and well-designed experimental cinema from the late '60s. It contains some good songs, an ultra-groovy cinematography and many other interesting ideas in terms of film technique. <br /> <br /> I give him 7 out of 10 for several reasons. First, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox film in the mainstream, where its stars and producers were firmly anchored at the time. If a feature film falls at the box office, the consequences can be disastrous for all concerned. Second, it was for the most part a creative success. And, finally, as we have already mentioned, it is undeniably a classic of its kind and, as such, it now has historical significance. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Head" arrived too late in Monkees' career. But again, they would not have been allowed to do it earlier because it was essentially a very sharp and cynical satire of their own image. <br /> <br /> Clearly, members of the group knew very well that the entire Monkees behemoth was about to run after they started working on this project. In a sense, it must have been their swan song and they were determined to leave everything behind. They were tired of being treated as mere pawns in the very powerful corporate game in which they had been manipulated and exploited in the past few years. In short, they "wanted to go out" and they would say a few things before leaving. <br /> <br /> However, history has proven the group right. Let the critics be damned. The Monkees, left behind some of the most brilliant, successful and successful pop records of the decade. Yes, they had a lot of help. But at the end of the day, they were standing in front of the studio pickups, facing the movie and TV cameras and giving the concerts. They were fun and just a little crazy. But, unlike some of their contemporaries, they were never threatening. You can safely introduce a monkey to your old aunt. <br /> <br /> "Head" probably borrows a bit too heavily in Beatles' "Hard Day's Night", but it's always worth looking again for those who were at the same time or for the young retrophiles who have the ability to appreciate its importance. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
