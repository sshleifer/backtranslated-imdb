The second episode of the new "Lost" gives you exactly what was missing to his fans: many fascinating actions. From the beginning, you continue to see new features that you did not expect to encounter. This is the best proof that the series, which is entering its fourth season, is still alive and in full swing. <br /> <br /> Although the producers do not marvel us with more flash-forward, the return to flashbacks is more than satisfactory, because it brings shocking facts. Flashbacks introduce a few new characters, and pets are bound to be surprisingly related. <br /> <br /> The new characters dominate the whole episode and I can not say that it hurts. Their screenplay roles and their actors are doing extremely well, giving us a toning sensation - you'll realize that just after the episode, you'll realize that the show really needs people like that. And here they are. <br /> <br /> "Confirmed Dead" is full of startling acts and very written dialogues. I'm sure I'll long quote the best scenes from the episode - they're so good they stay in the viewer's mind. The episode is entertaining, intelligent and happy. You like "Lost", you have to watch it. My vote is ten.
