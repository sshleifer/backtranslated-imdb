I watched this show as I grew up. When I think about it, I remember it very well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I remember very well are the opening sequence and the theme song. On top of that, everyone was ideally thrown. The writing was also very strong. The performances were also excellent. I hope a network will bring it back so I can see each episode. Before I finish, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory, even though I did not see all the episodes. In conclusion, if a network brings him back, I hope that you will catch him one day before his final disappearance.
