I have not seen this in years, but when I was about 6, I saw it for the first time on VHS and watched it at least 10 times. now, as I said, it's been a while that I risk ruining everything, but I remember some Colombian terrorists taking hostage a preparatory school with the request to release the father of the main terrorist (the "master of the wishes" "). Now, I could just check the plot here on IMDb but I'm pretty sure it's true. Anyway, a group of boys at school decide not to sit around waiting to die to decide to fight. this film has always been stuck in my mind. There are so many images that I have not forgotten, like the scene of Joey's death (I think?), Billy spitting in terrorist sandwiches or the false child (no idea of ​​his name), a false crisis asthma. just a good movie. It may be films like this that have allowed me to tolerate violence in movies, because if I remember correctly, this film is pretty graphic. the guys being shot down by helicopter guns, a special forces guy's hand being pulled off by a grenade (I do not remember that, but I seem to remember something like that at the end) and the most bloody being the leading terrorist in bloody detail. great action, good mood, good acting, wonderful cinematic experience. I have to watch this after all these years!
