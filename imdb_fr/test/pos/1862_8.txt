Paul Bettany played a big role as a tortured father, whose favorite girl died tragically from illness. For that, he deserves all the credit. However, the film was mainly about this, keeping Darwin's adventures as he collected data for his theories in the form of incomplete stories told to children and completely dismissing arguments about his ideas. <br /> <br /> Two things bothered me terribly. : the soundtrack, with its shrill whistle, practically burying the sadness in the throat of the viewer, and the trailer of the film, showing beautiful landscapes, theological reveries of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for the fight against blind faith, thus completely distorting the film. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, if we removed the scenes from the movie's trailer, the result would be an unfamiliar family drama about a dying little child and his parents' difficulties as a result. Clearly, not what I expected from a film about Darwin, although the film was beautifully interpreted.
