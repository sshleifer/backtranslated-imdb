A film, above all, should be a good story. This should be entertaining - and entertaining does not necessarily mean "laughing" or "light". This basically means that you do not get bored by looking at it. <br /> <br /> Brilliant as it may be in 2001, it's a hard film to watch, especially for the current generation (video game / iPod lovers). Its slowness and the sometimes unbearable time it takes an actor to perform a single action (for example, trying to save a crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience. On the other hand, the cinematography is brilliant, the film cleverly realized, the end prompting the reflection and the score ... the score is terrifying, especially as the team of the carrier approaches the artifact on the moon . Boy, I got goose bumps, big time. This does not happen often when I watch movies and demonstrates Kubrick's skills as a director. <br /> <br /> It's considered a classic and many consider it to be the best sci-fi movie of all time. That alone is a good reason to look if you have not done it yet. However, just because everyone thinks it's a brilliant film does not mean you have to force yourself to appreciate it. You will like it or not. Maybe slowness is not such a bad thing after all. To draw your attention to something quite static and slow for two and a half hours could give you a lesson. It will certainly be a different experience from all these fast and rhythmic images we are subjected to today (be it commercials, music videos or video games). <br /> <br /> I myself think it's a "memorable" movie. But I'm not looking forward to seeing her again soon (unless I'm in a special mood for slow-moving movies). <br /> <br /> Therefore, 7 out of 10 stars come from me.
