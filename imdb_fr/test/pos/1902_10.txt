Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation movie to come, but it's certainly one of the best. This is a crucial film in the genre of Black Exploitation, in which it caused a dramatic shift between previous films, as opposed to subsequent films. It was not necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it was a fight to overcome problems like racism or anything as important as that, but it was the story of a Naughty guy who fought "white" with his army of kung fu mama's. It was a guilty pleasure, very amusing and best to watch with friends. (10 of 10)
