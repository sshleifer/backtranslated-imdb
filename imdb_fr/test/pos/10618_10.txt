This movie is absolutely amazing. From Huppert, Girardot and Magimel's performances to Haneke's script and direction, there is not a single misstep. It is possible that the film disturbs the sexual content and the slow rhythm of its film, but it is really a masterful film ... so do not let these difficult means get you away! <br /> <br /> Powerful and deserving of all the prizes won at Cannes!
