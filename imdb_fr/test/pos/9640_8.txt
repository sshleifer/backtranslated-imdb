Exciting, action-packed and interesting film telling the story of a group of men stationed at a naval base in Italy and their adventures aboard a Navy submarine during the First World War. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two friends and form a very beautiful pair of officers, I must say. A new captain arrives on board, already known by some as the "Dead Pan" Toler (Walter Huston). He is a real tights who respects the rules and the "code of honor". Soon, Tommy and Brick chase a pretty blonde in an officer's dance, Tommy insults the captain - and, of course, the blonde is actually the captain's daughter. But Tommy still wins, as he and his daughter move away from the dance to a street carnival outside, and soon get tied up in an air raid - unfortunately for him, she reveals that she's married. Later, Tommy has big problems when he disobeys orders in order to save his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite fun with a captivating plot that has captured my interest and the high level performances of all. The decisive death scene starring Sterling Holloway haunts indeed - the most memorable scene in this movie, I thought. Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante add a little humor: the character of Durante is becoming a mail-order dentist and regularly gets into trouble on the floor with a Brit who mocks his nose. Ok, if you are looking for a movie showing a man boxing a kangaroo, it would be that one.
