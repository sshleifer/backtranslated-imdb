Like a winding country road, "Tough Luck" takes the viewer on a tour. There is nothing wrong with the plotlines, as long as the credibility does not escape the window. Unfortunately, the film ultimately questions the tolerance of public beliefs. Nevertheless, it is easy to forgive this fault because of the superior acting, the character development and the wonderful carnival atmosphere. Do not expect to like any of the characters. Armand Asante, Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk play suspicious scammers, who are not the type to be easily admired. The double crosses are fast and furious, and the last cross is a bit exaggerated. Recommended. - MERK
