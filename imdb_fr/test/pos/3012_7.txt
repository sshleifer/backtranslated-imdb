In spite of all its pitfalls of style and cinematographic invention, it is basically another serial killer thriller, which follows the same type of intrigue favored by old favorites like Silence of the Lambs? A team of cops is following in the footsteps of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else is being caught and has to find out where he is before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (played powerfully by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need the psycho-psychological machine of psychologist Jennifer Lopez to put himself in his head and force him to say everything. This is where the film becomes all new and different, as we enter (via a CGI update of Dr. Who's favorite kaleidoscopic favorite, the connected time tunnel), a kind of strange world of Hellraiser mingled with scary things place, ruled by D'Onofrio, now a kind of superking suzerain of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body. The sequences inside the mind are well done and often quite breathtaking, all the tracks work properly, the macabre is at its maximum if you like that kind of thing, but the hype surrounding all this was a disappointment for me, because I was expecting something completely new and different from anything that has ever been done before, not this pretty successful mix of serial killer and horror special effect staples. Sometimes horrible, often pretty, a story captivating told with care and attention by talented filmmakers, but by no means the leap into the unknown that it is the subject.
