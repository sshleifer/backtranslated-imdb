THE RED CIRCLE (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). <br /> <br /> This is perhaps the coolest film ever made, in the most literal sense of the word. Men here never lose control and never show their emotions once. No dramatic explosion in this film. Everyone is cool all the time. It is an abstract dream world, where men live according to their own code, a code of gangsters with values ​​of the outside world remarkably absent. In this saga filmed with talent, Melville tackles the American thriller with his style decidedly dark and sorry, but with a huge budget of ten million dollars and four of the biggest French stars of the time. Alain Delon as a master thief, Yves Montand as a former alcoholic police officer, Italian star Gian-Maria Volonté as an escaped criminal and André Bourvil in an atypical role as a cynical police chief. <br /> <br /> Melville describes THE RED CIRCLE is his penultimate film and is in fact a masterfully styled cop. He also claimed to want to make a black film in color and have succeeded in many ways. The two main influences of this film were THE THE ASPHALT JUNGLE, film of John Huston in 1950, and RIFIFI (1955) of Jules Dassin. But unlike these films, where we learn so much about the gang members' backgrounds, with all their insignificant needs and the anxieties that motivate them, it's clear that they're not just ruthless types of hell, but individuals. Ordinary engaged in a world of daily worries and human activity, Melville, however, tells us almost nothing of his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in prison? Why was his partner, Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonté) arrested? Or why did the ex-sniper Jansen (Yves Montand) leave the force, was it his alcoholism? We will never learn the motivations of their actions and will never discover what motivates these men. Women are even more absent than in her previous films, with "emotional" ties exclusively between men. They do not even seem to have a personal life. A kind of emotional twilight and although the decor is not as abstract as in his previous article, LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville still sketches a very strange world. Melville's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and surpasses himself almost in cold blood, so imaginable. <br /> <br /> Deliberately paced and lasting over 140 minutes, Melville takes her time to tell the story, but her slow pace and length seem an ideal way to show the sorry world in which live these men. Nothing is ever out of place in Melville's films, and here it's no different, with every little detail apparently of crucial importance to the story. Although LE SAMOURAI remains my favorite movie in Melville, even with the greatest movies ever made, this one is also among the best. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 10/10
