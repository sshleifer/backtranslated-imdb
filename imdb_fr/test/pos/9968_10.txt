I saw The Merchant of Venice in London last week. Big actor of Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compared to other films based on Shakespeare's play, this production makes it so easy to understand and follow. Congratulations to Michael Radford for leading such big players. The costume and the decor are great and since the film was shot in Venice, it gives the film an authentic flavor. I had read the play more than thirty years ago at school and the focus was on the anti-Semitic behavior of the characters towards the Jews and the cruelty of the Christians. I do not know if this film will provoke controversy, but I'm sure he will have few Oscar nominations.
