Warner Brothers has dramatically altered American history in the movie "The US Prime Minister," "The Prime Minister of the United States," directed by director Raoul Walsh, is a somewhat inaccurate but quite uplifting biography of the cavalry officer George Armstrong Custer. The film tells the story of Custer since his arrival at the West Point Academy until the Indian massacre at Little Big Horn. This is one of the iconic roles of Errol Flynn and one of the greatest epics of Raoul Walsh. Walsh and Flynn often teamed up later, and "They died with their boots" brought Olivia de Havilland together as Flynn's romantic interest for the last time. They appeared as a couple in seven previous films. This 140-minute black-and-white adventure is not brilliant: dynamic action sequences, humorous romantic scenes and dramatic and harsh confrontations between our hero and his opponents. One of the notorious errors involves Colonel Philip Sheridan, who is billed as commander at West Point prior to the American Civil War. Indeed, Sheridan was a lieutenant at this stage. In fact, the commander was Robert E. Lee, as shown by Flynn's previous film, "Santa Fe Trail". Another historical error concerns Lieutenant-General Whitfield Scott; Scott was not the commander of the Union troops during the Civil War. Warner Brothers introduced Custer as a drinker (probably because Flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life, Custer was neither drunk nor smoked. Nevertheless, these, as well as other historical gaffes, do not remove anything to a really splendid film. <br /> <br /> "They are dead with their boots" opens on Custer who enters the West Point Military Academy dressed in a fancy uniform with an African-American carrying his luggage and looking after his dogs . After the guard sergeant realized that he had become the guard of honor for a future plebate instead of a high ranking foreign general, the sergeant told Custer the rank of senior cadet Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy of "City for Conquest") take charge of him. Sharp plays a handy job on Custer by installing him in the quarters of Major Romulus Taipe (Stanley Ridges of "Task Force"), who quickly seizes Custer. Of course, the volatile attacks of Custer Sharp in a public brawl. General Phil Sheridan (John Litel of "Katie Elder's Sons") is ready to dismiss West Point's Custer for unworthy conduct. It turns out that Sheridan can not evict Custer because Custer did not register. Once registered, Custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with eagerness to fight and accumulate innumerable demerits. When the American Civil War breaks out, West Point prepares cadets who have not completed their education and rush into battle. Custer is one of the last cadets to go to war. Anxious to fight, Custer meets his future wife, Elizabeth 'Libby' Bacon (Olivia de Havilland of "Santa Fe Trail"), and they engage each other, despite Mr. Bacon (Gene Lockhart of " Carrousel ") who hates the sight of Custer. It seems that Bacon crossed Custer in a parlor and insulted one of his friends and that our hero reprimanded Bacon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, back in Washington, Custer is desperate for a transfer to a regiment, but Major Taipe has cooled his heels. Custer befriends Major General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet of "The Maltese Falcon") and they share an appetite for Bermuda's Onion Cream which is becoming a feature of Custer. Not only does Scott ensure that Taipe assigns Custer to the Second Cavalry, but Custer also appropriates the Taipei horse to his command. In the Battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861, Custer disobeyed Sharp's orders, struck his superior officer, and held a bridge for the infantry to cross. Wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, Custer receives a medal rather than a court martial. When Confederate General Jeb Stuart threatens the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Scott is shocked by the possibility that the South will triumph. In the absence of a brigadier general, Scott urges Taipe to promote the first available officer. An error is made and Custer is promoted. Incredulous at first, Custer embraces the moment and sneaks ahead of Stuart. After the war, Custer idled and began to feed the boys at local salons. Sharp presents himself as a twisted railroad developer and tries, with his father, to have Custer assume the duties of president of their railroad company in order to obtain funds. Finally, Libby interceded on his behalf with General Sheridan, who commanded the army, and found him on active service as commander of the 7th Cavalry. When he takes command, Custer finds that the 7th Cavalry is intoxicated and is not surprised that Sharp orders the liquor to the fort. Meanwhile, Custer takes his first steps with Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn of "The Guns of Navarone") and puts him in custody. Of course, Crazy Horse escapes, becomes the opponent of Custer and they fight. <br /> <br /> Once Custer has mastered Crazy Horse and the Indians, Sharp and Taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with other Indian nations. They also ensure that Custer is accused of hitting Taipe in an indoor fight. On his way to Washington, Custer discovers the treachery of Sharp and Taipe, who beat a golden strike in the sacred Black Hills. The settlers are unleashed and the Indians find themselves on the path of war. Custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men to Little Big Horn in a merciless confrontation against 6000 red skins. The crystalline "Stagecoach" Bert Glennon captures both grain and glory. The long shot of the 7th Cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular. Further premonition of Custer's imminent demise, Libby faints after he leaves his neighborhood for the Little Big Horn. "They are dead with their boots" enjoys an excellent Max Steiner score that incorporates the regimental melody "Gary Owen".
