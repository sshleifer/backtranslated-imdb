A group of young adults are stuck in the back of the afterlife, where the only place nearby is a museum filled with wax manikins, and the only form of help is Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) . As night falls, children are abducted in record time. <br /> <br /> A weird and bizarre B movie combining the terrifying nature of the woodland scenery with the realistic dummy scenario device (making it a good update to the "Body in the wax museum" genre) ), it is an intense shock party in the sense of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". (So ​​it should come as no surprise that TCSM Artistic Director Robert A. Burns is repeating this duty here, and his eye for a beautiful stage decoration is always useful.) Pino Donaggios' score is downright scary; accompanied by the troubled photograph of Nicholas von Sternberg, he plunges the film into an oppressive atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The plot twists vary in success; there was one that I saw arriving a mile away and one that caught me by surprise, and I was all the happier. One of the best moments is shared almost immediately, because the first victim of this type is stuck in a room with objects that fly voluntarily. The capper is an excellent impalement by pipe with blood flowing from the tip. <br /> <br /> Star Connors delivers a captivating performance as our good antagonist, while the youngest co-stars, as expected, can not play at the same level, even though Jocelyn Jones is a pretty attractive and certainly attractive lady who has enough charm to be considered a damsel in sympathetic distress. Co-star Tanya Roberts (a brunette in this movie) agrees to support him. (If I have a problem with this movie, it's just that the victims are a little too stupid, again, it does not differ much from the many horror movies of the 80s.) Notable future names among the credits are future directors Ted Nicolaou, who was the editor-in-chief here, Ron Underwood (who made his debut almost a dozen years later with "Tremors") as assistant director and veteran makeup artist Ve Neill, who has made many films and won three Oscars since. Although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, this is a pretty little surprise that new director David Schmoeller delivers with conviction and enthusiasm. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
