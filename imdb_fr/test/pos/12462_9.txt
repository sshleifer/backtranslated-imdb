Where this film is true to Burroughs' vision, it is excellent. where he leaves Burroughs, it's superb. It's a family story, looking for a father by a real and emotional orphan. Lambert speaks of one of the most anxious lines of all the cinema "He was my father!" enough to make the eyes of the most cynical critic cry. This is not a perfect film - Glenn Close's notorious over-dubbing of McDowell's voice is unacceptable and can only be explained by a very British mistake - but a perfect but imperfect masterpiece and a noble goodbye to Sir Ralph Richardson.
