I was in high school when "Flesh" went on big screens, but I was lucky to see him in New York's midnight theaters two years later. <br /> <br /> Flesh is the first part of a so-called "trilogy" of movies, starring Joe Dallesandro, as an object of desire. It bears the name "Warhol", but is rather the work of Paul Morissey. The story focuses on the exploits of a day in the life of a street prostitute (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young, handsome and a little naive ... but he manages to bring bacon to his wife, for reasons that should not be explained to fully appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> Worth noting moviegoers is that this movie (with the other two of the trilogy), had no script, in itself. The superstars of Warhol have received only one premise ... and the words and actions that the viewer sees are quite natural (even sometimes ridiculous or nonsensical). But overall, it works ... "Rolling Stone" noted in its review that the film was better than "Midnight Cowboy", a film of the same year, more polished Hollywood (Oscar winner of the best film) , with talent of great name (I also admire the film) ... but FLESH, in improvisation, was more realistic and realistic, without the need for complex subplots or "cause of celebre" ... nor of elsewhere cause <br /> <br /> The film grossed more than $ 3 million and caused a sensation, particularly in the German market (which, paradoxically, thought it had received a "censored version" of the film because of post-editing .... see note below). <br /> <br /> Curiously, the film is very "cut and paste" with "pops". "clicks", "flashes" and dialogues cut literally in the middle of a sentence. It's almost as if Warhol / Morissey asserts a simple truth: it's a "day in the life" of a superstar, bits and pieces for your voyeuristic tendencies. Much better than Warhol, who already had eight hours sleep early, and the Statue of Liberty as a movie of more than 20 hours. <br /> <br /> FLESH is, in my opinion, the first of Warhol's films really digestible (a wide range) and the first legitimate answer of Warhol / Factory to the Hollywood phenomenon of "celebrity". <br /> <br /> As the premiere of a "trilogy", she portrays a desirable, na√Øve, sought-after young male icon, responding to invitations to please her family. The following movies would show the "same character" with a different set of values. (See "Trash" and "Heat")
