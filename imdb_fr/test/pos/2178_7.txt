This film was certainly not very sophisticated. No, the humor was actually pretty stupid now that I think about it. But, thinking about it, I laughed - to prove that a decent comedy does not have to be very deep. <br /> <br /> Fatty Arbuckle is the real star of this short film, despite the presence of Buster Keaton film as well. He is the butcher in an old-fashioned grocery store. There was a lot of nonsense in the store and I think I laughed at the coffee grinder - you just have to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> goes to a girls' school and because he can not separate, he dresses in drag and infiltrates the school. Arbuckle is an ugly woman! So, for a stupid and unsophisticated fun, see this movie. It will not change your life and is a very light image, but it's also fun.
