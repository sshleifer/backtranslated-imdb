** SPOILERS ** Love story inspired by World War II with Norman Rockwell's paintings at the beginning and end of the film: a "war hero" is not only someone who kills for his country, but also someone who thinks for himself and is not corrupted by the war propaganda that is constantly in his head. Marion "Hedg" Hedgepeth, Jan Michael-Vincent, leaves the training camp after five weeks of camp and is forced to wear the Baby Blue Marine uniform that shows that he just did not have the body . Humiliated and despised wherever he went when he returned home to St. Louis and terrified that his family, who was his father in the Marine Corps during the First World War, would think of him in the sense that he could not "cut the mustard" like a US Marine. <br /> <br /> Hedg stops in a bar and sits next to him a Marine member of the intrepid and deadly Marine Raiders Richard Gere, to whom admiring Hedge buys a beer. Having a conversation with Richard Hedge is shocked to learn that not only is he sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles in which he fought and won medals, but his hair is totally gray and Richard has the air in the middle of the thirties to be 21 years old next month! This is what the Marine Corps and the Second World War did to him! Buy a number of drinks in Hedge, Richard takes Drunk Baby Blue out and knocks him out by taking his Baby Blues and leaves Hedge his awesome US Marine uniform with cash. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hedge puts on Richard's uniform, that suits him perfectly, he is confronted with this big drunk American paratrooper who calls himself Cement-Head and wants to fight with his fist. Marine Raider. Cement-Head is doing everything in its power to avoid trouble, after having himself cracked two bottles of beer on his cement head, to warm up during the big fight between Marine, Hedge and Paratrooper, Cement- Head. Hedge incredibly covers the big cement buffoon hitting him cold with a punch! "I guess the trick is not to hit him over his head," says a stunned hedge, Cement-Heads, his GI compatriot. <br /> <br /> Hitchhike in this little town of Bidwell Hedge note this US military internment camp for Japanese Americans who are there because they are considered a threat to the security of the United States. It is later in the film that Hedge shows everyone that he is a true hero and not what the locals think he is, risking his life to save one of the "Japs." "hated who, blindly, escaped with two of his friends. the internment camp, where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving the scared Japanese-American from drowning in dangerous rapids outside the city. Hedge in his actions taught the people of Bidwell that all "Japanese", even those who are US citizens, are not nasty and treacherous banzais who were shouting suicidal kamikazes as it was thought in the magazines and films of the 'time. <br /> <br /> Hedge starts a conversation with the very cute and pretty local dinner waiter Rose Hudkins, Glynnis O'Connor, who is just crazy about him and thinks that even Hedge thinks it's his uniform, not him. impressed her. Later, when Hedge admits to Rose that he is not what her parents and she thinks, that's what it was when Rose knew this sweet and benevolent marine that he did not care well. All he was supposed to be, a sailor, a skydiver or a post office employee, was what really mattered in his heart. <br /> <br /> The film contains a number of touching and beautiful scenes between Hedge and Rose shows how movies were shot years ago without all the sex and profanity we see and hear today in movies that involve two lovers of each other. <br /> <br /> The precision of the film, Phony Baloney, shows the real feelings of average Americans, in 1943, about the war in general and the Japanese in particular, could not have been done more authentic and more precise, neither of good taste. "Baby Blur Marine" does its best not to be politically correct by not showing the hero or the main actors and actresses of the film the same feelings and the same ideas as during the Second World War that most people, which would have seemed to be fake like a three dollar bill, to those watching the film who lived during those memorable historical moments during which the film was to unfold.
