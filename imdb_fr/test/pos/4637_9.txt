I watched this movie every time he passed the cable and he never grew old. Who can forget some of the best lines in the history of cinema? --- JOHNNY'S BURGERS FAT BOY !! BURGERS OF JOHNNY'S FAT BOY !! and look between the giant melons! I used to wish I could run around the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this one. It's a favorite all the time and I'm happy to hear it's on video! I am convinced that this is where MTV got its basic principle for the Road Rules series.
