I saw it last night and I laughed hard during the whole second half of the movie. All the audience was. Bruce Campbell made a damn funny movie! I do not want to reveal anything, but when the film turns and becomes delusional, it becomes really delusional. Just one fun scene after another. I want to congratulate Mr. Campbell and his team for making this project happen on such a small budget. Bruce was there to present the film and have a question period, which was a treat. Many of the questions people asked were rather lame, but Bruce turned them around and was sarcastic. He was great! Anyway, I loved the movie. I will be looking forward to seeing this on DVD later this year. Make sure you watch the Sci-Fi channel this fall. I highly recommend this one.
