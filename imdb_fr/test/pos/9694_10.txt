I should not like Jackass Number Two. Nobody should. There never was, and there never was anything particularly redemptive in Jackass. And yet ... it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen - and I just can not explain why. <br /> <br /> This new film leaves the first in the dust. It's so funny, so horrible and so fake. The whole team gives it all - with Jackss in Chief Knoxville in the lead. He is crazy. I love it, but it's crazy. And more power for him. With his fledgling film career, he could have let everyone do the dirty work, but the fact that he has thrown himself almost literally into the world of the ass makes me respectfully strange. Bam Margera, who once seemed happy to sit down and make sure that everyone around him does just about what he wanted, deserves to be congratulated more. Here, Bam is not the executioner, but he who is tormented is better. <br /> <br /> I just can not say what is my favorite part because I laughed all the time. While I watched much of the film between my fingers, but there was no "real" film that I have seen for a long time and that made me feel so invigorated. Whether you love them or hate them most probably, the Jackass team has exceeded all my expectations. But I agree with Bam. There can never be a number three Jackass because someone will die and I want these guys to stay around.
