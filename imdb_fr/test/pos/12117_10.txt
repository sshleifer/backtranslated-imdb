It's an excellent anime movie. He is well animated, has a good intrigue complex and very good music. I understand that some may think it is a bit long, but I think it's a good length and the animation is a good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> THREE CHARACTERS: <br /> <br /> The way they use Tenkai is masterful. For example, the double of the body that appears in all these places adds to the disturbing tone of the film. Tenkai's design is also good, his appearance as a monk and, in the end, his armor. <br /> <br /> The old man, Andou, has his feet on the ground and is a very nice character. When Jiro meets him, it's a turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Sanpei, the Satsuma Shinobi who infiltrated the Tenkai clan, saved Jiros' life twice. However, he stays in the background for most of the movie, but he's really one of the movie's heroes. <br /> <br /> THE INITIATIVE: The plot is good. It is traditional without being without originality. The historical time in which it is played is interesting, The restoration of Meiji. The treasure is sought by Tenkai to restore the shogunate, and when Jiro finds it, he uses it to help the anti-shogunate forces overthrow the shogunate. <br /> <br /> The way Tenkai cheats Jiro is interesting and has "Hamlet" feel. There is also a sweet irony in the fact that if Tenkai had not managed to make Jiro a shinobi, I do not think he was able to kill him in the end (maybe with a gun, but not with combat weapons with your bare hands). <br /> <br /> The plot with all the death makes it very dark, but there are moments of light when we see childhood memories of Jiros. All in all, it's a good dark and complex plot. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: The opening theme, for example, is very good with the electric guitar and the drums. In this piece, they sometimes use what I believe to be taiko drums, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of good music. Like the one that was played while traveling to Iga shinobi. I believe the piece is called "Numatou" and contains an incredible flute. The flute may be a pan flute, but more likely a shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The final theme "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and delicate. The voice is beautiful, as is the song in general. <br /> <br /> THE ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> The animation, although good, is not perfect and the blood that runs on the characters does sometimes seem to be orange. The transitions are interesting and I think some transitions are very nice. An example of a good transition is Jiro and shinobi Iga, sunset in the background and music. The transition is simple, but effective and provides a pleasant feeling. <br /> <br /> MY FINAL WORDS: I think that the plot, the animation, the music and the characters make it one of the best animated films. That I've never seen.
