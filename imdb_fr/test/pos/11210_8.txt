Reading some of the other reviews of this film, it reminded me of positive and less positive aspects. But overall, I must say that this is one of the best movies I've seen recently in different genres or countries. More than anything else, he avoided many of the traps typical of newer international cinema, such as taking beautiful landscape shots or being "hip," "fun" or imitating American films like pulp fiction. The film is unique in many ways. On the one hand, it is a film about relationships in which sex plays no role (unusual, especially for foreign films). It's also a film about relationships between two men (also unusual - not a movie "buddy", no homosexual tension, no competition between the ego and the phallic). It uses little dialogue, but communicates a lot. It's a simple story, but rich in complex details, easily understandable by any human being and universal in their relevance. I did not find the film dark or depressing (it would all look like if you were watching Hollywood movies all the time), but rather a true reflection of human emotions. For example, in the scene where Mahmut realizes his cousin is gone, you see both his relief, his cousin gone, and his regret for pushing him away. Who did not feel such an ambivalence - when losing a friend, a lover or in another situation? It is rare that these real human emotions are displayed on a film without clich√©. Regarding culture, or the fact that it is a Turkish film, I feel that it establishes a very difficult balance between a 'Turkish' film - realities that apply more to this place (the more great struggle to do it in a European Turkish city, the contrast between city and city is greater) and a universal human history that does not necessarily have to take place in Turkey. At a time when people all over the world are consuming culture and fetishizing it, this film does not try to seduce us as a "Turk", or to communicate it as a "harsh reality", or "it's like that that Turkey / Istanbul is. "And yet the cultural elements are there.I think the comparison that someone made with" lost in translation "is pretty good.Everyone, at least in the United States, was thrilled with this movie, and I personally thought it was mediocre at best, which was described by someone as a vague story supposed to be about the "disorientation" that affects people living or traveling in the world. Although the film was supposed to be humorous, the characters and their motives or their crises were never clear (even for a film or a comedy "lighter", it is necessary) and I found myself to live a typically "oriental" story aliste "of the insane American overseas. Going back to "Distant", for the idea that it's bad, too slow or has no conspiracy, I apologize, but those who say it know nothing about achieving a movie and maybe nothing to the man, no offense. You do not have to be a movie lover or a cultural connoisseur to enjoy this movie. This movie will be two hours of your time well spent!
