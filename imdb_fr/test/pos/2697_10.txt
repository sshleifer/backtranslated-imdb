I have not seen a better comedy than the King of the Queen for many years. I consider him one of the best of all time. I have just returned from Arizona to Ireland with American Airlines after a business trip and, by chance, they have aired several episodes. I burst out laughing and later I asked the curators to play again and they did it. Thanks AA. The actors of the whole team are first class and more particularly of Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but of all the actors, the acting is superb. I like all the actors, they are so funny. There is a hard side to the king of queens that I like a lot and rarely see in today's television comedy. Leah and Kevin play so well that every situation is credible and funny. I just bought the 2nd season while I was in Az this week and plan to buy the full set the next time I'm in the States. My 20 year old son also loves this show and his talent lies in the fact that he has the magic to touch different generations. I want to thank everyone involved in this amazing show. It's very popular to see this type of TV show in what I think is a poor television show era in general today, with the exception of Seinfeld's reruns, and so on. like ... thanks for a great show ..
