I would like to highlight these excellent arguments in favor of this film: <br /> <br /> The sex scene # 1 Angelina Jolie <br /> <br /> The Foley # 2 artist outdid themselves <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot # 3 was thick enough <br /> <br /> The DVD # 4 includes trailers and chapters <br /> <br /> # 5 no animals were wounded in the making of the film <br /> # 6 tribute to the runner of the blade through the film <br /> <br /> # 7 garbage on fire <br /> <br /> # 8 a guy funny without legs <br /> <br /> # 9 Jack Palance's vocals have added a dynamic element to the film. <br /> <br /> # 10 Sage advises, for example "When you dine with the devil, bring a long spoon". <br /> <br /> # 11 Angelina Jolie was only 18 years old! <br /> <br /> In summary, an evening of animation was organized.
