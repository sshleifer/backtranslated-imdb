'Never Been Kissed' is a film that feels good. If you have not seen it yet, rent it. I will buy it when it comes out because I liked it. Drew Barrymore is excellent again, she plays her role well. I felt that I could relate to this movie because my school days were just as bad. I thought the plot was well written, there was comedy and romance that are the type of movies I like. I loved the end because even if you know what's going to happen, it always leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting - anticipating !!
