A well-paced romantic war story that should have been more exposed. The Czech driver who played the piano gives a sweet touch to the story. Flying images may not have been enough for aviation enthusiasts like me, but again, it's really not an action movie. Although it has nothing in common with James Salter's novel "The Hunters", which became the movie about Korean F8 Saber war pilots, Dark Blue World had the same feeling, but with more than one romantic element. Better in some respects than the Battle of Britain in that it does not depend on renowned actors. Suggest to watch this movie with Czech beer and Czech dumplings called kneldniky (sp).
