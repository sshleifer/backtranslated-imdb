A ham actor without a penny. Who better than Michael Caine plays such a character? He's totally and totally hilarious, but, as in most of Caine's performances, he's going for real. The film seems to be a showcase of Dylan Moran and he is splendid in his double act with Caine. This is where the script weakens. The imitations of Moran should have been integrated more organically. They act too far away from themselves and make the potential plausibility of the plot fly away through the window. It does not matter. Get it if you can find it. There is enough to make it a pleasant trip.
