I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of aboriginals almost every day. There is good and bad in EVERY race, why make them all declare themselves bad? This applies to all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he had graduated high school and he had a university year before returning to the reserve. How do I know that? John Harper lived with my family for 3 years in high school and he stayed in touch with us the year after graduation. He was a kind and gentle man, he could be fun and serious when times were right. I was not very old when he left our house, but I still remember every time he helped me do my homework when my own brother could not be bothered. He even taught Grade 3 the year before he arrived in Winnipeg. None of this is mentioned in the film, and the police officer's suicide is an admission of guilt as far as I'm concerned. What happened to John is unforgivable, not only in the aboriginal community, but also in the white community. Not everyone in Winnipeg thinks the way the police do. I knew the person inside and what he looked like PERSON and not as an Indian!
