I was rather dismayed to see the low rating this film received here, personally considering it a fun family kitchen. This is a young teenage girl, Sandy Ricks, whom her mother sent to Coral Key to spend the summer with her Uncle Porter. There, he befriends a dolphin named Flipper. Many adventures ensue in the predictable relationship between the nephew and the uncle and a little love story for Sandy with a local girl. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Crocodile Dundee and I loved Paul Hogan in his role as crisp and comical Uncle Porter. For starters, he keeps an infinite stock of spaghetti-o at home to serve him his usual meal, heated with a blowtorch! Elija Wood, Frodo of the Lord of the Rings, seemed competent enough to play young Sandy, a boy not very fond of his forced summer vacation. <br /> <br /> Of course, the dolphin is beautiful and there are wonderful underwater scenes. Located in the Florida Keys, it was shot in the Bahamas. This Flipper adaptation offers excellent family entertainment, a sweet, sentimental and fun film that is far superior to the many film offerings for young people today.
