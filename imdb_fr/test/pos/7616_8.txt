I can not say that I embrace this as a romantic comedy, because I found it a little funny. I found it endearing, entertaining, comforting and ultimately very kind. Even though there were moments of wit, I found them more bitter than comic. <br /> <br /> I liked this one. Barrymore has grown so much as an actress and it's always wonderful to see her on the big screen, but that also translates to the small screen. In fact, during the following viewings, I like more and more this one. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of romantic comedy, you may be a little angry at the lack of comic effect of it, but if you're romance-loving, it's really there that you will find it. <br /> <br /> It gives a 7.8 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
