Others commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you would see while watching a show. Feet, faces, the big picture. Unfortunately, it's a bit short. That said, watching Colin Dunne is still rewarding. This is an interesting contrast with Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the series is obvious, the changes compared to the original production of Dublin are obvious. <br /> <br /> "Trading Taps" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion. Tarik Winston is amazing, as is his partner in the room. <br /> <br /> I think the sound was better in this version than the original video production (1995). In Dolby 5.1 on DVD, it is excellent. <br /> <br /> Despite imperfect videography, it's a must for Riverdance fans.
