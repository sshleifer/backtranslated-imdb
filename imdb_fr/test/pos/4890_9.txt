At first, I was looking at it because I thought it would be the sequel to the League of EXTRAORDINARY Gentlemen and that this movie is an entirely different thing happening here, a comedy! However, I loved it anyway! <br /> <br /> Apparently, the League of Gentlemen is a British TV series with rather strange characters and lively humor. It's a British comedy, so it revolves around being very stupid, disguising itself and making fun of Germans and French and homosexual references - in short, it's very very funny! <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the writers of the TV series deciding to cancel some of the characters and characters out of their dimension in the dimension of the writer so that it does not happen anymore. It's a fun twist and there are many beautiful scenes in this silly adventure. I laughed a few times and I applauded the cheeky humor style. This gives Mr. Bean a diluted wimp look. (Rowan is way better in the Black Adder series by the way) <br /> <br /> This is not Monty Python, but you can never escape the comparison when you speak British humor, and there are some similarities but not too much to prevent it from being its own thing and being cool. He bows more towards the young and the Guest House Paradiso in his comic style. <br /> <br /> If you liked, take a look at the series The Young Ones and the movie Guest House Paradiso, and of course, I watch television The League of Gentlemen series must also be quite funny.
