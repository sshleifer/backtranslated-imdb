"The summer of my German soldier" is one of the many television movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s (the others being "Brian's Song", "Sybil" and "Someone is watching me!" ). It depicts a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) befriending a German prisoner of war (Bruce Davison) in Georgia from the time of the Second World War. The film shows that many of the German soldiers were not really Nazis, they had just been recruited. Watching the movie, I had a real idea of ​​the situation in the South at the time; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? <br /> <br /> So, I definitely recommend this movie. I think it's always important to show the things described here. Occasional overexploitation prevents the film from being a full-fledged masterpiece, but they generally perform very well. I hope the movie will eventually come out on DVD. Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (Patriarch "My Big Greek Wedding").
