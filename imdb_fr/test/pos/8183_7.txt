Quite a director's production telling the story of Emperor Qin's ambitious plan to unify all the kingdoms of China. Some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. However, I was not impressed by the film regarding the actors' ability (which was good, which I liked the most about the marquis) or its appearance (although the troop gathering was extremely impressive, if he was a real man, a lot of extras!). <br /> <br /> I saw Li Gong in other movies and she's always great. I think it's a good time, but not the one to judge the true historical accuracy of it. Good movie and found the 2 Â½ hours + not a problem. <br /> <br /> Rating 7 of 10.
