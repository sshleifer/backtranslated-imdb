I would like to buy this and "Thirty seconds on Toyko" today if available. I also saw this movie after seeing big billboards of Jack Webb in his dress blouse on the highway at the age of 12. He still admired Jack Weeb as a type of John Wayne and American. Becoming almost a sailor just because of this film, he served for 32 years in the Air Force, the Air Force Reserve and the Army Reserve. I have not seen this movie on TV at all and would like to own it on DVD. At least if it was on TV, I would copy it to VHS and use it until it's available on DVD. I also have a large collection of films about World War II and the Korean War and I am always looking for new versions on DVD.
