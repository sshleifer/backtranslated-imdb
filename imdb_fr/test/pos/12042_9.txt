Darr is a brilliant film..This is one of my favorite movies.SRK did a breathtaking job in the movie .... <br /> <br /> this role could not have been played by anyone d because this type of role is only suitable for SRK ... <br /> <br /> SRK plays the role of a villain in the movie .. <br /> <br /> The performance of SRK in this film is the best performance ever made in wooden balls. .. <br /> <br /> SRK deserves an honor and an encouraging call for its fantastic performance ... <br /> <br /> Juhi also offers excellent performance .. <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol looked strong and physically fit in the movie.
