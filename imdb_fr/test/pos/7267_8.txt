.. is the married princess meets ... well Trainspotting. But wait, really, it's a good combination! It was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time ... it has the kind of spiritual dialogue that I associate with The Princess Bride or the cemetery man, as well as the disgusting scenes of violence from a horror movie ... the heroic sensation of Princess Bride, combined with the (strange) lack of really good guys that Trainspotting had. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it was as good as the Princess Bride, but it was in the arena, and it rocked. Part of the dialogue transcends pleasant to brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - although slightly light - are anacronic not because of their intrinsic nature (there were flamboyant gays in the 18th century, contrary to the remarks of another a bit of the language they used.Anachonisms have made things fun, though, and NOT cheesy and easy to dismiss. <br /> <br /> If you've ever read a Simon R series Green, or Gleen Cook, Garrett, you know EXACTLY what this movie is, check it out.
