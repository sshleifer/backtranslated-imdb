Released as KING BOXER in the UK <br /> <br /> This film is essentially the FIRST kung fu movie to air in the UK. Many of us took advantage of Kurosawa's dramatic and catchy dramas, and we were used to Oriental cinema. to be admirably filmed and enlightened, with a somewhat sober rhythm, in short, like flipping through an album of very beautiful photos that have turned out to be in motion. <br /> <br /> Next come Run Run Shaw and his friends. with their big-screen "home movie" production values, and their astonishing copy by maturity, all the rules have changed. KIng Boxer was the first to walk through the door, leaving the others a clearly marked path, feet firmly rooted above the burning tracks. <br /> <br /> Despite the hokey intrigues, the play of pantomime and the cheesy jump - Western-style spaghetti cups and zooms, this film was wonderful. Beautiful without being opulent and with the most brilliant combat choreography ever seen on a screen. We loved the sickening violence, the anxiety, the testosterone. Martial artists among us have found some fascinating techniques, though flamboyant and often ridiculous. It was so different from the Japanese that we all knew, and he had a beautiful acrobatic grace that perfectly complimented the sickening violence and blood-stained floors. Delicious. <br /> <br /> The scene "KIng Lear" was, at the time, a milestone in schlock "You, cruel bastards .. My **** !!" Now it's a little less shocking, but it's still a bit unbearable <br /> <br /> We did not notice that the females in sight were absolutely unidimensional. After seeing more movies of the genre, he now stands out like a sore thumb, but at the time it did not matter <br /> <br /> This film defined what would quickly become the clich√©s of the kung fu movie. All. Look at it and remember that until it broke out on Western screens, there was no genre in which to play. It was unique and great. It was the first kung-fu movie and it's still, for me and many others, the best.
