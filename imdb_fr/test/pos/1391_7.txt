Looking at this strange little adventure film, it is hard to believe that it was made by the same man who brought us high quality Giallo classics, such as The quality of its products is low. Island of the Fish Men is an entertaining hike that certainly deserves more praise than it gets. Like many Italian films of the seventies, this one is a scam of a successful American film, the one in question this time being the island of Dr. Moreau, critical criticism. Sergio Martino's film takes ideas such as mutation, greed and adventure and shapes them into a slightly convincing film, which compensates for its lack of coherence and logic with a host of mostly intriguing ideas. The central plot follows a boat crashing on a small island. It soon becomes clear that everything in this place is not normal and it soon became apparent that half of the population had been turned into "fish-men" - a cross between a man and a fish, which exists for purely Selfish ... The truth about this movie is that it's a lot more fun if you ignore the sneaky production values. The central monsters look completely ridiculous, and much of the film takes place on stages that cost a few cents to someone - but the film is well shot despite this, the underwater photography being a highlight the film is well done to the extent that the film never gets boring. The way the plot unfolds is not quite great, but it takes a lot of ideas and I've seen movies made on intrigues with much less thought than this one. The most remarkable place of the film is undoubtedly the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of adventure movies so I do not see many quotes from this lost city, but it's always nice to see it in a movie. The central location of the island is good as it provides an appropriate setting for the story and also provides the film with the right amount of mystery, as Martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. All in all, it's not really a classic and there are certainly trash adventure movies far worse than this one.
