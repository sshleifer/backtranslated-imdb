I just started watching this show. It is currently being broadcast in Ireland on the Irish TV channel RTE1 at 12:30 pm in the afternoon (as of 26 July 2006). <br /> <br /> This show makes me literally laugh out loud and I can not boast of what sitcom's (except the British movie The Office with Ricky Gervais). <br /> <br /> The episode of TKoQ (July 26, 2006) is the one in which Carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home. to make coffee and Doug wants Carrie to have no "outside" friends, so he raises his top and shows his "belly hair"! and lick the plates when he goes to dinner! But another funny episode took place last week, when the old man (the father carries) won at the bingo and that episode made me laugh with laughter especially when they went out and bought a replacement refrigerator and that Carries's father had been there to look at him and to think him new. <br /> <br /> I do not know how long it will stay on Irish TV or what stage (year of registration) we are, but I hope it will not end soon because I am really enjoying it. <br /> <br /> In summary, there are great writings, some great characters and comedies (including Carrie, Doug and Carries Sr.), great punchlines and well delivered - a bit gloomy and close to the Marquez sometimes (Send the kids out of the room!) But I think this US Sitcom is a winner and very funny.
