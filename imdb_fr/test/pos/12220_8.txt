The problem with television today is that people have been spoiled by "light" television. This type of television show is the equivalent of elevator music or "easy listening" jazz. The typical idea of ​​"continuity" of viewers is to remember who was voted out of the island last week and to wonder who will be the next to leave. Show them a program like Surface, Firefly, Dr. Who or anything that has a field arc of more than three episodes and ... well, they will come back to Survivor. <br /> <br /> 95% of the sheep watching television do not want to break their heads. They want excuses not to think. They want to make sure the "chest tube" is aptly named ... and they do not want shows that try to follow another path. For this reason, Surface and many other high quality shows that should have lasted longer have had the ax. <br /> <br /> Viewers do not want stories, morals, philosophy, or even more than a third. level of vocabulary. They want people to eat earthworms, or "real-life" dramas too dramatic (you can not watch something without changing the very nature of what you're watching) or hormonal shows involving groups of friends. <br /> <br /> Today's television is nothing but a fallow land, and the few diamonds you can pick in the dust are simply thrown in the trash because nobody knows anymore what is a diamond. The surface was one of those diamonds.
