I saw the second part of this beautiful period piece on a ship in the 19th century. Golding's book must be responsible for some of the great dialogues but everything else was good too! I particularly appreciated how they created the period and the feeling of being on the boat so well. For me, it gave me a feeling of completeness that I could not express in words ... Maybe that's the way they mixed the technical and historical details of navigation in the history of the eighteenth century without the disturb up. Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. It's not often a mini-series sends me to the "zone", but this one did it.
