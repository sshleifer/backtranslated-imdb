Ladies and gentlemen, the show begins with this documentary film. It is structured in three chapters, each chronologically organized. The first presents classical physics and links to Einstein. The second one studies in depth the quantum physics and enters in the theory of the strings. The last one reveals the theory of everything ... The difficult concepts used here are introduced in a very simple way, with everyday objects; although you must believe them without checking for yourself -if you are not a scientist- (and even if you are a scientist !!). The film is not a masterpiece by its fabulous technique nor by the way it is produced; what really matters is the story, and WHAT HISTORY !!!
