The Curse of Monkey Island is a brilliant video game and a stroke of genius from lucasarts video game designers for creating this sequel. All the characters are brilliant, the voiceovers for the characters were realistic and fun. A lot of effort has gone into this game and it deserves the 10 votes I gave in the vote. Keep up the good work, lucasarts!
