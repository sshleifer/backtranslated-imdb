Most Hollywood movies seem to follow one of the few pre-designed and highly predictable plots. This film is not and is a perfect example of what I'm looking for for the IFC. <br /> <br /> A guy, Michael, and his girlfriend left him without a word. He wants to know what happened. Is she good? Can he say goodbye? Maybe get a closure. He was not able to contact Grace and, in order to find her, he made a movie asking for your help. <br /> <br /> Michael thinks we may need a reason to help him. story reliving his relationship with the help of a friend (Nadia) to play the role of Grace (the girlfriend who left) <br /> <br /> The back view is 20/20 and it's not is no different for Michael. By telling his story and gathering feedback from his friends, he realizes his mistakes and how much he values ​​what he has lost. This is unfortunately a lesson that we all had to learn (or need to learn) and to which it is easy to identify. That's what makes you want to know more about Michael's story and whether he finds Grace.
