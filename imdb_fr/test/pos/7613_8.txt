Never been kissed with Drew Barymore as a journalist Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely sap and sometimes rather painful story of a shy woman named Josie Gellar who is brilliant shrewd and shy and has never been kissed by a man. She is entrusted with her first important report for the paper she works for: to be considered an informal high school student, to befriend trendy children, and to have a good idea of ​​what is really going on in the business world. high school. The only problem is that Josie has never been popular. The high school was actually a traumatic experience for her because she was the victim of a lot of jokes and cruel jokes. Josie takes this task, as much to "integrate" as to get a scoop. What she discovers is the major premise of the story. <br /> <br /> Never been kissed is one of those films so sullen and so sober. schmaltzy sometimes, especially in a few scenes in the end that the limits of credibility are cruelly tested and that many cynics may not like this movie. It is, however, very nicely done. Drew Barymore is perfect in the role of charming Josie - she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her look perfectly realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as an intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day at school. <br /> <br /> Never been kissed had a lot of fun with Josie working hard to get cool. Example: the scene of reggae bars. I also really enjoyed the appearance of Josie's brother, Rob, who also returns to high school and enrolls in high school. It helps to give Josie her "dream" to fit in finally is hilarious. At the same time, Josie's painful story tells of her early years in high school. It is not necessary that Josie had similar experiences in high school to be touched by her story. Drew is great at making his character have a personal connection to the public and we've been loving Josie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of "middle girls" in a movie released in 2004 in this movie, but the average girls were honestly much more serious. Never been kissed really becomes a romantic picture while Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes whether they will find each other. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It was really well done in some areas. The film is corny in some places, yes, the last scene - realistic - no, does this film manipulate your emotions in the most obvious way in Hollywood? Oh yeah yeah baby! But it handles wonderfully, there are lessons to be learned here. The film never preaches, but manages to paint an accurate picture of what was high school for a few privileged. In fact, I have met people who have had similar experiences with Josie. I met people very similar to all these characters. I think a lot of people simply do not know or can not understand the cruelty that can exist in the world. of high school, and how he can be hurtful, but he is there. Not unrealistic at all. What struck me was Drew's talk at the prom, because it shows the "sheep mentality" that can exist so widely - in Hollywood and made as many think, it was well done and very true. <br /> <br /> I make a sound that has never been kissed much heavier than it really is, it's a perfect film to choose when you want a sweet and comforting image. It's attractive, kindly acted and just Rufus. I would say to check. 8 out of 10
