It was so long that I was waiting to see this film and I finally arrived at yesterday. In summary, I'm glad I finally did. The humor is hilarious. The plot is so incredibly credible that it must have at least some truth. If anything stands out in this movie, it's the coffee scene. I went there all the guys. You are dropped. You discover that your ex has a fool with a guy who, you're sure, is a jerk. Now, every time you see something over the next few days, you simply get horrible thoughts about it, placed in all the wrong places. She fucks everyone and everyone knows it. I could probably watch this man lick and touch his wallet all day, look at me and laugh at me for being there too.
