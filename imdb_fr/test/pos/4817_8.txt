John Frankenheimer will be missed. It was his first feature film and it was four years before making his second film, but do not be fooled to look for it. The management of Frankenheimer is assured and he draws some convincing performances of his casting. <br /> <br /> Someone has already pointed out, but I also want to talk about James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two main roles. Both of them would work again for Frankenheimer - Gregory in particular as a rough senator of "The Manchu Candidate" - and they do it for him here. <br /> <br /> If everything seems too simple in the end It's simply because Frankenheimer and the writer Robert Dozier have chosen to tell a simple story, and they do it well. Stay tuned - Turner Classic Movies could show it again.
