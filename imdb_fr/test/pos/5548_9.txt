it was a very well written film, and the actors had a very exquisite way of describing the whole character. but as the movie ended, I felt like there was more, but they forgot to put it on the DVD. maybe they plan to do a sequel ... well, even if they do not, it's a good movie and a good rental, but even a better buy.
