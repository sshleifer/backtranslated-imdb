I have never read good reviews for "Vanity Fair" and I do not understand why. For something that has been "rushed in ten days", everything is going amazingly well. Although certainly "Becky Sharp" is a better film and Miriam Hopkins is a better Becky, nothing prevents him from getting a good 9/10. Sometimes Myrna Loy may look too cute and sweet to play a real bitch, but at other times she must squint and the air temperature drop a dozen degrees. Meow! The move to a more modern setting does not go against "Vanity Fair" and the only thing that really causes a conflict is the casting. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was less than 5 feet tall and few of the leading men were very tall either - all of which came together to give Loy the appearance of an absolute Amazon woman! <br /> <br /> "Vanity Fair" is similar to "Craig's Wife" in that no matter how serious the main character is, you must love it. And you know she deserves her appearance, and still others, but you always feel sorry for her when she gets it. Although based on the same story as "Becky Sharp", this version had a different ending, which is interesting to watch because most of the other movies were almost identical. For fun, the end of "Becky Sharp" is finally more pleasant, although aesthetically, and from the thread of the story, there is no doubt that the end of "Vanity Fair" is the best, whether you like it or no he.
