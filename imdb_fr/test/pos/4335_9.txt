It's an amazingly fun 80s rocker. Charles Bronson reigns as Paul Kirsey. The bad guys are hilariously bad. Jimmy Page's soundtrack is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill and Ted's Bill) is excellent as a street punk who is wasted by Bronson and his team. Crew? Oh, it's the oppressed townspeople who team up with Bronson to reclaim the streets. The whole movie is nice, with the last half hour or so exploding in action and non-stop chaos. 9/10
