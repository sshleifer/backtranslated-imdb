May contain spoilers !!! This film does not break the mold of the horror film. Not far away. However, it creates a frightening atmosphere, quite credible and bloody characters. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and does not bother to unfold more than it should. A group of children are killed in a mining accident in the early 1900s. Since then, they have harassed and killed the residence of their sleepy little town in the mountains. <br /> Simple, they want to take revenge on the man who caused their death years ago. Naturally, his great-great-great-grandson is in town and he's a real idiot. <br /> <br /> At the same time, a mother and her two daughters inherit an old house after the husband's death. The eldest daughter is rebellious, odious ... a typical teenager. The youngest is curious, has bright eyes and penetrates with ghost children. <br /> <br /> The most frightening part of this film is the sheer indifference of children and they make their way between victims. Excellent game It was so scary! I mean, the movies of Children of the Corn are one thing ... but it has never been better than those (with regard to scary kids). <br /> <br /> A terrible look. I bought it before seeing it and I was not unhappy. But I am a horror fan from start to finish.
