Playmate Jeannie Bell (with a giant afro) really gives an ass kick and usually loses her clothes very quickly. If you do not take it too seriously, the movie is a lot of fun to watch. Stan Shaw gives a strong performance, Jeannie Bell is a little less convincing. Pam Grier, she does not do it. <br /> <br /> This is where Quentin Tarantino got his idea of ​​the light switch scene in "Jackie Brown" of. <br /> <br /> Don Julian's soundtrack is a gem and is frequently used in rap songs.
