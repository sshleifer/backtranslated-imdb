It is a little anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. It's Thanksgiving time in 1972. The place is a typical Texas suburban home. The eldest son has just returned from Vietnam and he has a lot of time to readjust to the life he has left. And the family does not know how to handle the problem. Honestly, I do not think I'm exaggerating when I say it's one of the most heartbreaking war films I've ever seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of fight sequences in the whole movie. Most of the story takes place in a house over a period of a few days. But the kind of war that goes on in this house is as intense as any real action on the battlefield. The film does something difficult to accomplish; In one way or another, Estevez and his team created a film that embodies the whole Vietnam experience. And given the similarities between Vietnam and the current invasion of Iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. Estevez does a magnificent job with equipment. He gets a lot of help from a hand-selected cast. Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates in particular are superb as parents. A truly moving film. Highly recommended
