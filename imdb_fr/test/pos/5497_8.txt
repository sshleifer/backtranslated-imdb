Clint Eastwood scored a great success in this 1993 thriller. Equipped with an absolute master of suspense, Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood delivers as he can. Moreover, John Malkovich is part of my list of the most effective screen buffs in the history of cinema As a demented assassin. As for Rene Russo to Clint's love, I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said, referring to his own career: "I'm getting older and my great leaders are constantly rejuvenating". This film is a very effective thriller with enough twists and surprises to keep you informed. Easwood and Peterson should team up more often. Film of first order.
