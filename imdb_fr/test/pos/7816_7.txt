The cast alone tells you that it will be a step up from the usual Italian western. Veteran actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy team up with Alex Cord who, at the time, seemed on the verge of becoming a star. The result is a film that is both offbeat and depressed, but it will satisfy those looking for more than a western. The character played by Alex Cord is particularly interesting. The "hero" of these Westerns is expected to be taciturn and introspective, but "Clay McCord" is an extreme example and, surprisingly enough, he has often shone in a passive or even weak position. There is great fear that he will fall prey to epileptic seizures that have immobilized his father, and in times of helplessness, he is either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him. . To emphasize his passivity, Clay McCord, do not you like that name? - is often scratched to the waist, as if it were only a beautiful toy staged. There is even a strong masochistic tendency in his nature, especially when used as a punching bag by his enemies, then suspended by his wrists and left over the middle of a street. Not only does he fail to protect himself, but McCord is just as ineffective in protecting his surroundings. Almost everyone who helps him is killed. <br /> <br /> While "One minute to pray, one second to die" is far from being a complete success, it has a depth and a tone that distinguishes it and keeps it in the memory. It's also a good showcase for Alex Cord, whose career tended to decline after a few promising years in the mid-1960s. He was about 36 years old when he filmed this - at his physical peak - and the stage where he is suspended by the wrists, bare chest and sweaty, is a memorable piece of "beef cake".
