Being a big fan of hip-hop and turntablism, I always knew that I would like this movie. However, I was not prepared for the quality of the documentary. It covers almost every important aspect of the only element of hip-hop that has existed from the beginning. "The story" begins in the early 70's and follows the evolution of turntablism as art from the beginning to the early 2000s (turntablism aficionados will highlight it as significant). <br /> <br /> The editing is almost perfect from the beginning the film. Aside from the excellent visual "scratching" techniques they used, the fast break between interviews and archival footage is excellent, setting the pace for the film when needed. The sound editing is also very good, with some pretty sweeping sounds used to facilitate transitions. <br /> <br /> The absence of narrator was also welcomed. We are not caught off guard in history, which allows the public to make their own assumptions more easily. Every DJ adds another facet to the story, and it's so interesting to hear about unknown hip-hop stars, especially those who were present when hip-hop was shunned by the music industry. <BR /> <br /> Although there are a lot of great things about this movie, I have some problems. The most important of these is the absence of several notable DJs, such as Ca $ hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, as well as outdoor DJs such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you look at the commentary on the DVD (something I highly recommend), the producer and the director explain how they regret not being able to present them. The deleted scenes contain numerous interviews with Ca $ hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and the Scratch Perverts. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the best documentary I've seen on hip-hop culture and music. It does not stop showing the true potential of turntablism; for that, I highly recommend watching DMC and ITF videos. However, it's a little hassle. I highly recommend this movie, especially for the phat soundtrack, with great music. (9/10)
