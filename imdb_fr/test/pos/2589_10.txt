Having just received the "Loony Tunes Golden Collection" (which I highly recommend, by the way), I will try to comment on most, if not all, caricatures individually. As such, the starting statement may seem redundant for those who have read several reviews. I apologize. <br /> <br /> Rabbit Seasoning is the stuff in a trilogy of like-minded shorts "Rabbit Fire" and "Duck! Rabbit, Duck." Bags and Daffy argue over Elmer Fudd's choice It makes me laugh EVERY TIME !!! <br /> <br /> My note: A + <br /> <br /> DVD Supplements: Disc 1: an introduction by Chuck Jones, the boy from Termite Terrice, part 1, excerpts from the films "Two Guys from Texas" and "My Dream belongs to you", both with Bugs cameos; bridging sequences for an episode of "The Bugs Bunny Show"; Astro Nuts audio recording session; 2 vintage trailers "Blooper Bunny: 51st and a half" with optional commentary with writer Greg Ford & stills gallery
