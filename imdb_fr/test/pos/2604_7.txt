After "The Attack of the Fifty-year-old Woman" with Alison Hayes opened the door for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other films to take over and what more than a beautiful actress that Dorothy Provine from "It's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" to play the role. The reduction is that cute and blonde Provine may be just too sweet and innocent looking to get into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with some smug sex appeal; Provine is no longer the girl next door. She may have taken and done that role to prove that she could be sexy, but the material lets her down. However, Lou Costello proves that he can make a film without Bud Abbott providing replicas. He even plays a dramatic role in some of his scenes when he does not turn to Gale Gordon as his darling gags. Gordon, however, states that it can only be windy, disturbed, and pervasive, almost the same character he will later create in "The Lucy Show." Charles Lane also plays the same role in everything he does: a straight man and his on-screen time is limited. The special effects are convincing for the time, but I wish Dorothy was a little more than cheese cake and a vinaigrette and that at least we allow her to become dangerous. As the main character of the film, she returns to Costello, who is in the whole film with Dorothy and who disappears several times as a sub-plot. The film as a whole can not decide whether it should be science fiction, a comedy or just a parody of Allison Hayes' classic. There are many good scenes, a very funny humor and a very ridiculous camp that affects the rest of the film. Nevertheless, I like this film for its empowerment of women; there are not enough movies like this one. If this movie had the opportunity to be redone today, I would strongly recommend Courtney Cox and Jason Alexander in the lead roles and allow me to completely rewrite the original script. Courtney is at the top of my list of actresses who, in my opinion, could and should adequately play gorgeous giants; although, I must admit that if any of the titanic beauties Allison or Dorothy came after me, I would go quietly !!
