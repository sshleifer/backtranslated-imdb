You should be ashamed if you assign a low note to this movie. How not to love a movie that has Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, silly rubber monsters, fights (and for guys, this woman who was the villain's maid in The Spy Who Loved Me and one of the movies of the years 70 Sinbad, not carrying much that my mother said "she was not chosen for the color of her eyes"), lava, stupid wigs and a silly Victorian-style drill machine very similar to the one used in the old Thunderbirds series? Anyone who watched this movie and dropped it was looking at it for the wrong reasons. It may be shit, but it's definitely a good shit. They do not do them as before, sigh ......
