I classify OPERA as one of the best Argento films. Draw holes and inconsistencies? Of course, but I do not think they are as harmful to this film as many other commentators seem to be. Many elements of many Argento films are a little "offbeat", but this is part of the draw for his films ... <br /> <br /> Short story: Psycho tracks the new role of the film Opera Lady. The typical Argento twists ensue, leading to a decent gain of climax. Not the best of Argento, but I still shoot this one from time to time. Well worth a look if you like his other songs - just do not confuse this one with the awful remake of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA that Argento did, this one is really awful ... 8 / 10
