Flash Gordon was a first-rate series. I know there were some blunders, however, I did not look for flaws. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a qualified actor but he gave a very good and convincing performance. Jean Rogers is pretty and at 20 years old. old has, in my opinion, a very good job. Charles Middleton as emperor Ming, is superb. He was in many other movies, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. His interpretation of "Ming The Merciless", in the 3 Flash Gordon series, was of superior quality. The rest of the cast also did a great job. Well, boys and girls, grab some popcorn, get back and enjoy. John R. Tracy.
