OKAY. Finally, a horror movie that worked well. As soon as I heard the music, I knew that efforts had been made to create what I consider to be almost a masterpiece of the common sense of terrorism. Zombies, whores, alcoholic beverages, torn up graves and many more. A big cast, well played, well directed, well written --- there was hardly any flaw. Even American actors with Irish / English accents have really succeeded. I thought that actor Larry Fessenden seemed familiar to me. It was this missing tooth. Finally, I realized that this guy was the lead role in "Habit", a movie about vampires in New York. I thought he was excellent in this role. Now, I wonder if he is American or not. His accent was so convincing in "I Sell" that I thought he must have grown up on Emerald Isle, not in the United States. Apparently, he was born and raised in New York. A great actor - really did his part in this movie. Nothing beats a horror film at the beginning of the 19th century in Europe (like Hammer's old film). I encourage anyone who wants to have a good time watching this well-designed movie.
