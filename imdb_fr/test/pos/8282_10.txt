I loved this movie and I never knew it was as old as that day. He came out the day of my birth and I am now 19 years old. I still love this movie especially the songs like "My Mother" and "Boys and Girls of Rock N Roll" and I remember as a child, I think I was 5 years old. My sister was 6 years old and my cousin (boy) was 6 years old. We pretended to be the characters of the movie. I was Eloner and Janette and my sister was British and my cousin was Alvin Simon and Theodore, it was a good time and I miss it. This film reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for these things and that me and my sister, we will not forget the chipmunk and the movie Chipmunk, I still remember the songs and the words by heart even if I have not seen this movie for 12 years, but it starts to like it again. ALVIN AND CHIPMUNKS AND CHIPETTES <3 <3 <3 <3
