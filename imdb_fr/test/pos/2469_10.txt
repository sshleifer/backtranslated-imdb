The most intense and powerful film I've seen in years. There had been other films about the Vietnamese Vet, but nothing like this heartbreaking film, because a typical American suburban family, around 1972, disintegrates, revealing the traces left by Vietnam on our collective . the souls. The cast is A ++++ fantastic with the four actors (with Kathy Bates apart) for fascinating performances. The great thing about this film is that you do not take sides, but understand the four characters and be sympathetic to them, even if their views and needs are different. Some scenes here are so powerful that family secrets and feelings are revealed (like the confrontation between son and mother) that will exhaust you emotionally and cry you with anguish. In fact, I cried in this film, something that I rarely do. The shocking end is a staggering! A very neglected film that should be seen. I note this 1996 film 10/10 a superlative. Highly recommended, especially at this time when our country is again plunged into a hideous war, our headlines shouting atrocities, and again, our young men and women returning with deep psychological scars, with their deep pain of acts done honorably. A must-see movie.
