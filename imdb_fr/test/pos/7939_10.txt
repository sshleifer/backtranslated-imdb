I saw this film with a live performance of the Buffalo Philharmonic and the music was one of two things that definitely made the experience for me; in particular, the song after the battle where the woman is looking for her husband was devastating. The other thing that struck me was the battle on the ice itself, a bit of strategy ripped off by the makers of King Arthur in 2004. In addition, the battle goes on forever (half an hour?) - painfully long. I can not think of another propaganda film that makes war less glamorous or more rewarding. I'm surprised that Stalin liked this film so much. I would not want to go out and fight after watching it.
