If you want to see a big little horror comedy with a strange sensation, that's it. If you wait for a bloody and vicious film that will scare your pants, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> For the budget in which this film was shot, the music was particularly amazing! Even though the film was shot on a budget, music and audio were significantly better than most movies on a huge budget! <br /> <br /> The story was really well done and the director deserves to be congratulated. There is an almost perfect mix of horror comedy in this movie! The acting is top and leaves room for a sequel I really like! I do not doubt that this film will become an instant cult classic. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this film tells the story of a man who enters the career of the tomb robber. It tells the story in flashback of each of the most fantastic experiences that the duo of thieves meets. From vampires to zombies and even aliens! Our stars start out as simple grave robbers who steal for jewelry but quickly become body thieves for a crazy doctor (Angus Scrim) who needs body for his medical practice. When the duo finds a way to send a vampire to his cruel employer, the grave robbers discover that the traffic of corpses of the undead is much more profitable than the mere theft of ordinary corpses. The only problem is that there is another gang, Murphy's house, which is competing for the same corpses of the undead and thats where the two devastating gangs are clashing with terrible consequences. <br /> <br /> one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedy I've seen in years and that reminds me of Evil Dead. Do not miss this one, you will regret it!
