This is a pretty stupid movie, with what might be the least erotic ever to get to the big screen (the heroine pours V-8 on herself and invites the hero to lick it - yuck!). And yet, she also stars the resplendent Lucinda Dickey in what is by far her most erotic performance. In those distant times, women - even action heroines - with real muscles were a rarity, and I still remember the drop in my jaw when Dickey took off his shirt, revealing the most powerful back and biceps already seen. Dickey's beauty and vitality carry the film: she could have been a Schwarzenegger woman if someone had the vision to promote her.
