It's a deeply stupid humor ... but I loved it. Jean Dujardin is a great actor in this film. Bérénice Béjo is cute. We make fun of all secret agents like James Bond: refreshing !!! It's probably the most hilarious movie I've ever seen. I have seen it three times and I still want to see it again. Purchase the DVD as soon as possible. You will not regret it. This is the kind of movie in which you do not have to have a good screenplay because it's a travesty. The only flaw is that the OSS 117 is too short. It's a jewel. It is not very common to see a French film succeed in the United States but I think it has everything to succeed. Believe me!!!
