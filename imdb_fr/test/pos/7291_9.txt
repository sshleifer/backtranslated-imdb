Okay, I'm 12, so it's here that you can see the movie from a pre-teen's point of view. I also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, two great movies, if you want to watch. All right, Here on Earth was a beautiful movie with amazing scenes and images, very enjoyable to watch. The author (I do not know who it was, check IMDB) worked very hard or had a good appreciation of love, poetry and drama. I cried 4 times throughout this film, once for more than 30 minutes. It was really sad, really beautiful, really meaningful. This is an excellent movie for anyone, say, from age 11 who is not a romantic comedy maniac. Yes, it's romantic, yes, it's funny, but (in my opinion), it's better than "She's All That" or "What it takes". I never cry! It's a tender story. Go rent it and paste it :).
