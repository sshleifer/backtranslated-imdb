... that maybe someday people will wake up. People who can resist the desire to separate everyone and everything and see the 60s for what they were. People who can see that it is the individuals who created these moments; not the opposite. <br /> <br /> The comparison between "Forrest Gump" is good. Both films watch the 60s, but "Four Friends" speaks of human beings, as opposed to caricatures. FF deepens the very subject that FG (with great success!) Attempts to condense and categorize as a mere background. But while "Gump" puts the 60s in an attic like old toys in a box, "Four Friends" picks up and kisses each toy, blurring the line between what you hold and what you are. If you associate romance with polish, you will hate this movie.
