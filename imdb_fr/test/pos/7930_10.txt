Eisenstein was not only one of the greatest Soviet filmmakers, Russian, but one of the great masters of film, among Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles and others. One of the greatest things in all his films was the very personal edition, and this film is exceptional. It was his first sound film and the use of the musical score of the great Russian composer Serge Prokofiev in the sequence of the battle is a perfect contrast between music and image. Watching this movie is like taking a class or a movie lesson, something that few filmmakers can afford. I do not get tired of watching REAL CLASSICS like this movie. I hope that in the near future, more people will recognize a great work of art.
