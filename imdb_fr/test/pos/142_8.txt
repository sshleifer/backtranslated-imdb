We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you have not seen Oldboy (or the trilogy of sympathy for that matter), you miss some of the best movies made in this century. But I'm not here to talk about it. I am here to talk about thirst. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what you expect. Yes, it's a vampire movie, but at the same time it's also a very twisted story of romance between a priest and a girl. I will not go into the synopsis (you can read it above), but rather tell you what this movie has to offer. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this film is no exception. With some very surreal scenes supported by intense lighting, he creates the perfect atmosphere in almost every scene. The film starts a little slowly, but I felt it was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. Once things start moving forward, the credits are almost never exhausted. "Thirsty" is above all a love story, but not in the same sense as one might think. the relationship between the main characters is very intense, but at the same time almost disturbing. Chan-wook Park is no stranger to the controversy that we know, and this film addresses the taboo almost as much as the old man. The final scene is by far the most powerful of the film and perhaps one of the best conclusions of a movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's an exceptional film that all moviegoers should see, in my opinion. It's an exciting (and certainly different) adventure in the world of vampires, and romance is far from sober or boring. This film is gritty, unselfish and beautiful of all the bad sides. Obviously, this is not for everyone, but chances are that if you read this review you are already interested. See it Do not hesitate
