As part of the BBC shooting of all classic Shakespeare plays, this version of Hamlet will not dispel my own peculiar impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most overrated plays and that Hamlet himself is not a character. particularly moving and tragic. I have no sympathy for him and I did not feel it after watching this show. <br /> <br /> Even when you have great actors like Derek Jacobi in the role of Dane and Patrick Stewart in the role of Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, this can not hide the lack of passion in the scenario. And when a good actor like Jacobi infuses passion, he makes the whole role incomprehensible. I just could not associate his materialization of the character to what he was saying, and it killed me. That said, he has the right to say "to be or not to be" because his actions with a dagger clearly show the character's suicidal intentions at this stage of the play. <br /> <br /> The secondary roles, for me, better written and, therefore, better played, are enjoyable, especially the looping interpretation of Claudius by Lalla Ward, very captivating, Stewart. <br /> <br /> At half-past four, he is very long and better watched in bite-sized pieces. Check if you are interested, but be prepared for long monitoring.
