One of the latest films directed by Lionel Barrymore, "Ten Cents a Dance" features Barbara Stanwyck as the daughter of the dance hall "Barbara" in her sixth role. Stanwyck looks rather "simple-jane" in this one and begins to get chewed by the manager of the dance hall. Then comes the rich Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to erase it. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s.) She then meets Eddie, who is very different from the dashing Carlton. Writer Jo Swerling had worked on biggies (It's a wonderful life, guys and dolls, and Gone with the Wind), so I was surprised to see that the characters and the script were so ordinary. The story begins to become more interesting mid-term and is VERY similar to "The Bride Walks Out" of 1936, also featuring Stanwyck .... T.B.W.O. is much smarter, but also more docile, because of the removal of the Hays code ...
