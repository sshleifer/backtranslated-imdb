For the most part, "Teen Devian" may seem like a simple light Bollywood musical. To a certain extent, this might even be true, especially because the producers had to be certain that the film had succeeded with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, either Sadashiv Brahmam (who had "the idea" of this story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a reversal of the usual formula and perhaps exceeded even their own expectations. <br /> This is not just a handsome man flirting with 3 women, undecided about choosing his partner for life. The character of Dev Anand was really in love with each of the 3 women at different times, and they with him, although they know about the other two. Dev Anand's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting as each woman is very dependent on him. In the body language of the stars, many suggestive teasers lend themselves to imagination depending on the maturity of the viewer. The theme is surprisingly adult and, after all, it was clear that the end was questionable, designed to please the masses and divert the critics.
