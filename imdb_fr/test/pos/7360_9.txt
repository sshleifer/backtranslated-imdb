I lit it (cable) on a whim and I was treated with a big enough surprise ... although very predictable, this film turned out to be pretty nice ... no big stars but well done and really fun. With all this oversized shit, it's very nice to have an unexpected surprise from time to time ... and this little film fits perfectly. 9/10
