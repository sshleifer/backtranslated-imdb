"The love letter" is a romantic and somewhat discreet comedy in which the use of the exact words in a mysterious love letter reveals the secret passions and burning desires of the inhabitants of a sleepy city on the edge of the sea. <Br /> <br /> This is not for all audiences. "The love letter", I think, benefits from its simple and calm tone. Never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies, it is quaint, quaint and comfortable. However, for the same reasons, many viewers will become bored and uninterested. <br /> <br /> The casting is nice. It's a pleasure to see Tom Selleck again and his role is so underrated. And it's hard to believe it's the same Kate Capshaw we met 15 years ago in "Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom". It is naturally naturally good here; improving in all the roles I've seen her since I struggled on Indy's nerves. And is it possible that Capshaw becomes more and more beautiful and beautiful with age? (What about this Spielberg?) <br /> <br /> That does not represent much; but after another noisy summer movie season, I'll probably look back with a brief penchant for this feather-light romance.
