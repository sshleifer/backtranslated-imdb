It's my favorite movie because there are so many things not to see in the beginning and so many things that make you ask, "Does Kieslowski think so or is it in my head?" For example, is the judge supposed to be God or a supreme being? <br /> <br /> Also Irene Jacob is remarkable in Veronique's double life, there may be some superficially prettier actresses but none manages to convey the beauty of the mind with the physical beauty as she does. <br /> <br /> Tritingnant is also beautiful without really saying much and the things he says are excellent such as his response to Valentine. . . "Be".
