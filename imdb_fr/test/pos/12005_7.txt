And I do. Peter Falk has created a role that will always last on television! And I am grateful for that. This is not one of his best hours, though. Columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime. Yet some villains are moving forward and think they are smarter than him. What all fans know is that Columbo needs a big opponent. Without a great enemy, how can he be the hero in his crumpled coat? It's still better than NO Columbo, and I'll also wait to watch the next one.
