One might think that a film based on the life of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima would be a difficult task, if not impossible. However, Paul Schrader has actually made a film about "Mishima", both superb and complex. Although it is not a literal biography, Schrader and his co-writer Leonard Scharder (his brother) have concocted several incidents in his life, including his sucid and have created what can be described as accidental tables, visually sparse and breathtaking. The homosexuality of Mishima is almost not there, because of the legal threats of his widow, but despite that, the film is still fantastic and one of the best movies I saw in 1985. I should also mention the An important contribution by Philip Glass is that the score, which adds an extra texture to the film, is superior to the one he made for Scorsese's Kundun. Also noteworthy are John Bailey's fine cinematography in gorgeous colors and Eiko Ishioka's stunning sets and costumes, who then crafted Dracula's memorable costumes for Coppola for which she received a well-deserved Oscar. Hope this movie will be available soon on DVD.
