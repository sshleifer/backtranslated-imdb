Covers this good comedy about an elderly father (C. Aubrey Smith) who decides to gather his adult children from around the world. Davies works as a choir girl in New York when she learns that "dad" wants it. Hmmmm, that sounds familiar. Davies' considerable talent as an actress spares this comedy as she upsets the British campaign with her brazen American personality. Not as sharp as some other Davies comedies, but still worth a look. Ray Milland plays his long lost "brother". Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Halliwell Hobbes are also fun.
