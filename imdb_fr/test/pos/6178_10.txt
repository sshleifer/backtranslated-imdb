Centers on Czech pilots WW2 ?? the old Frantisek, Karel, his impulsive boy, and in the background, Honza, who plays the piano. At the beginning of the film, we are in 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in an old monastery. In their country of origin, now controlled by the USSR, they are "the enemy of the people". Honza is severely mistreated by fellow Communists and dies. <br /> <br /> In 1939, many pilots managed to flee the occupied Europe by the Germans and made their way to England where they joined the RAF. Despite their great motivation and their great experience, they have to face the reluctance of the RAF and the British stiff upper lip. Finally, they fight gallantly at the Battle of Britain. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship seriously put to the test when they fall in love with the same woman. <br /> <br /> In terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to the Hollywood production Pearl Harbor. However, given the context of the film and the possible fate of Frantisek, it is also possible to read the treatment of women by the English woman, which symbolizes the British treatment of pilots of the Czech and Polish RAF: it is convenient to forget once the war is over. <In addition, the film is much less clichÃ© than Pearl Harbor and the characters are more fully realized. Dark Blue World also scores points for its breathtaking aerial aerial fights, which were seamlessly created using a mix of models, live aerial footage, and scenes taken from the epic battle of the d England in 1969. <br /> <br /> In short, Dark Blue World is a well-done, moving, stimulating and stimulating drama that shames Pearl Harbor. Highly recommended.
