If you like to shoot westerns, it's a keeper. I thought the movie was fun to watch and see people I had not seen in a while. I am not an expert but I liked the acting. The city and the accessories, etc. seemed to fit the time and the kind of city you would discover at the border. It's not a western, not enough people and budget. The costumes and guns were correct for the time! I expect to see the young actors in the film again in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebecca and Kirby were great. The members of SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) who contributed to this effort were extremely good. I hope to see more.
