I often watched this episode because I did not understand how Prue died. That's what happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe are trying to save their innocent, A Doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe climbs the stairs in The Book Of Shadows while Prue and Piper protect their innocents. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throws a ball of energy at the doctor but Prue pushes him back and puts him in the chest and smashes himself against the wall, as with Piper. So Phoebe goes down and says the spell, since it's Phoebe who said it and not the power of three Shax, he was only hurt. Phoebes calls Leo to look after Piper and Prue. So Leo heals them. Phoebe went to the Underworld in search of Cole, while Prue and Piper search Shax on the streets. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper use his power to blow up Shax, while a new reporter has recorded everything on tape. So, everything is in the news of the three powerful sisters Halliwell, meanwhile, Phoebe knows nothing because she is still in the underworld. There are Repoters and people all over the Halliwell House. Then a maniac arrives in the house and says, "Can I be part of your coven?" and Prue says "No, this is our house, get out of here!" and Prue uses her powers to throw her out. While the maniac comes out of the house shouting "He means witches". The maniac gets so angry that she pulls Piper through the stomach. Prue rises in her car and trays to get to the hospital but people do not let her go. Prue therefore uses her powers to keep people out of her way and encourage them to want to kill her even more. They arrived at the hospital but Piper did not succeed. Meanwhile Phoebe is in the underworld. Phoebe discovers they have been exposed. Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can turn the clock around. The Source says it will only turn the weather around if Phoebe promises to stay here in the underworld, so Cole tells Phoebe what the source had told her. Phoebe says, "What would make her think I would make a deal like this?" and then Cole says, "So that you can save the life of one of your sisters." Leo goes to the hospital to find out that the Piper is really dead, so he tells Phoebe that it's true. Then, Phoebe agrees to stay only if Cole returns to prevent Piper and Prue from the exhibitor and the death of Piper. Back in the hospital, SWAT is about Prue shooting, but the second before the hour is rewound when they were at the manor with the doctor, but this time, Phoebe was not there to call Leo to cure Prue and Piper, so the doctor will throw himself into the wall too. The doctor is dead and Prue too. But that's what I did not understand, if Piper was also thrown against the wall, how is it that only Prue is dead? Why did not they show Leo pick up Piper and Leo trying to heal Prue? If you know the answer, send me an email at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss you but I love Paige and I'm glad the show continues
