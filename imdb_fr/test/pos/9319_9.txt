Yes, I give it a 10 because I compare it not only to others like this, but also to the roadblock with which we are bombarded daily in what is ridiculously called today's "popular culture". That said, the film is beautifully presented, as has been said elsewhere, and gives us a good overview of the popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th century. It is no coincidence that many of the plays played by Olcott implied a similar plot: a boy meets a girl, a person opposes (a father or authority figure), a boy struggles, a boy win a girl. At the time, the newspaper was known as the "Chauncey Olcott Act". No coincidence, too, that John Ford led one. He called her "the quiet man". And "My Wild Irish Rose" is in itself an "act of Chauncey Olcott". Great stuff, right? Anyway, good songs, good things. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> PS - After watching the movie, I would like to know more about Bill Scanlan. I found an obit saying that he had left "Mauvorneen", following a madness (replaced, as in the film, by Chauncey Olcott) and had died in an asylum several years later. But he had been, apparently, a very big star in his own right, who wrote songs and plays and wrote plays for him. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know more?
