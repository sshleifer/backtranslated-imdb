Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror film from the late 1970s. The film is about a group of young friends who find themselves stuck in an old alley deserted by an old scary wax museum. <br /> <br /> The owner of the museum looks like a strange but harmless old man, but things go very badly when members of the young group start getting killed, who is responsible for the murders, is this the old man Slausen or his collection of scary models who seems to be alive and hungry for blood !!!! This film was good, it was fast, the performances were very good on the part of the actors / actresses (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the film was never boring, and as I said, there were very scary scenes so get ready to hide under the covers! Highly recommended to horror film fans / ghost stories! I give this film a very respectable 7.2 out of 10.
