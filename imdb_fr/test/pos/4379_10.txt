This movie was so good! It was hilarious! There are so many jokes that you can watch the movie again and again without getting bored. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were great like Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I like these guys! I love the adventures they have lived too. I really recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the music of this film is fantastic! I like singing with all the songs!
