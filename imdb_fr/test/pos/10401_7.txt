Another horror in hand means another splitting movie that fans should always be looking for and making their own idea. <br /> <br /> Imagine a mix between The Blair Witch Project and The Grudge and you're close to it all. content of this film. This is another horror videotaped, but this time, most of it came together, ready for a video document that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared. <br /> <br /> I certainly had a feeling of fear watching this movie (Is anyone doing better than our Asian friends?), but the scary moments, the truly scary moments, were unfortunately fewer and more distant than I had hoped. I also felt that I was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent "revelations" appeared, so I certainly can not recommend him as strongly as [* Rec]. <br /> <br /> That said, it would be remiss of me not to recommend any film on ectoplasmic worms, containing at least two subtly scary ghost moments and making sure I had to turn off the lights for a while at sunset. <Check if you have recently taken advantage of other hand-held genre versions. And the finale is an exhausting doozy. <br /> <br /> See if you want: The Last Broadcast, Pulse, Angel Heart.
