This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is rather interesting if you do not know anything about how the animation studios were managed. In addition to episode 3, it was probably the least risky, but he had an interest in girls, as well as a reunion surprise other previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is that it seemed a bit too short, but at the same time, maybe it was because it was the only original scenario of the series that was not based on one chapters of the manga. but that ended well, leaving us with the good impression that Kentaro is 25 years old, and that he studies constantly. Look definitely the rest of the series all along. You can buy the complete series for about $ 17, you can watch it in 2 Â½ hours or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes of free time. (What I do if I have a lunch break at school.) Have a good look, take a look.
