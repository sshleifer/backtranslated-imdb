Unlike the previous correspondent, I thought that Shoppen Munich (as it was presented with English subtitles here at the German Film Festival in London in November 2007) was very funny, very well played and very well scripted. <BR /> <br /> It's quite daring to design a 100-minute film composed exclusively and relentlessly of talking heads. But I think Ralf Westhoff has succeeded with spirit and momentum. No standard cinematographic device consisting of, for example, following the words of a character bared with meditative music composed of a seventh minor chord and long shots cut in nature. But when someone said something that revealed his souls - well, we were pushed by the man with the timer for another superficial introduction. What is of course the essential: the unbridled superficiality of thirty city dwellers, where everything is about quick answers. <br /> <br /> Maybe most of the movies are so clich√©d and stupid that we are ready to make it laugh about all the vaguely intelligent and indisputable cinemas, but I can promise you that during the projection of this At night (Curzon Cinema, Sun. 25 Nov. 2007), the entire audience yelled with laughter almost all the time. So, I was not the only one to laugh! <br /> <br /> My girlfriend (who speaks German and lived in Munich) thought it was hilarious. Me (who does not speak German and I did not go to Munich, I think) I thought it was hilarious. I would recommend Shoppen (Munich) to everyone (especially couples ...) looking for a smart, witty, original and wise movie about the superficiality of modern relationships and the amazement of the generation that feels to have missed the first time. <br /> <br /> NB In the English subtitled show in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were displayed completely under the slightly reduced image, not on the inside. I thought it was a good thing.
