I must say. It's easily one of my FAVORITE movies to watch for Halloween. The halloween party, the horrible acting, the guy dressed like and extra from Miami Vice. BIG BIG BIG !!! <br /> <br /> ************************ SPOILERS ************** *** ********** <br /> <br /> I have a huge place in my heart for the random horror movies of the 80s and this one stretched towards me and shot on my heart. I always pass this film to Blockbuster and I always laughed at the cover of the box. Now every weekend, I was taking a random movie that I had never seen before ... a weekend, it was Angelas. She seemed to be taunting me for months. So I took it home and spent it and I spent most of the film under the cover. <br /> <br /> For me it was terrifying and disgusting. And not just acting! Some of the things they imagined for this film were incredible. Honestly, I can say that the best part for me was watching Suzanne (played by comrade Iowan) put a tube of lipstick across her nipple. It was random and I loved it. Watching Angela FLOAT scary in the corridors and hearing her scary demon voice was enough to make me wake up ALL NIGHT! <br /> <br /> This is not one of the most intelligent or best-played horror movies. But its 80s cheese and all the elements you need. Goth scary kid, virgin, slut, naked girls, scary house, bad game, oh and did i mention naked girls? All the elements were there and were assembled to create one of my favorite movies. Congratulations to the filmmakers.
