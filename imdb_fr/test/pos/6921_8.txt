tell you what it was excellent. Dylan Moran is simply the funniest actor on the screen (and on stage) and with Micheal Caine as a partner, nothing wrong either, both are interesting to watch in a really funny movie. It's true that all gags do not stand out, but it's worth staying for those who do, but go see Micheal Caine wearing a dress (the entrance fees are worth it) and every time that Dylan Moran is on the screen, it's more like Bernard movie noir. The story tells the story of two actors (Moran and Caine) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters by playing different characters to trick them, but get away with another case. Basically, "the actors" is an excellent British comedy that many have missed. Seriously, if you're a fan of Moran (or if you want to see Micheal Caine in dress), you'll surely see that.
