You have to think of the Last Tango in Paris for this one because the atmosphere and the emotions go in the same direction and keep the same heights - the difference being that in this exceptional, intense and torrid representation of the love between the Dismounted Dostoyevskyian ruins is a homosexual medium - perhaps even that will disappear with time - and not the equally striking but heterosexual context of the Bertolucci film. <br /> <br /> The last third The film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema. To speak of pornography or gay self-effacement misses the purpose and the intelligence of this work. This film, although at first glance, seems to draw us into the familiar underground world and often portrays the gay street, and then precedes subverting the rules of this genre by exaggerating it to a super real degree. The result is a hyper-charged emotional impulse - an exceptional strategy that elevates the drama to one of the great universal themes and giant gestures. <br /> <br /> This film surprises with the brilliant performance of its actors, including a young Jean Hugues Anglade and staging. A tour de force of the cinema. Remarkable in ambition and he plunges incessantly into the depths of human emotion. As a contribution to gay cinema, this film conquers this difficult terrain and makes it its own triumph.
