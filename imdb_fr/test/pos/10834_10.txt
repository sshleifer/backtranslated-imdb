I noticed that people asked if anyone had this show. I have the 26 episodes that have been broadcast in the United States and I will be ready to share them with anyone interested. All I need is for you to provide the VHS tapes or blank DVDs I have on both formats and pay the shipping costs. My email is creator67@pipinternet.net, just send me an email and your request, I will inform you and we can make the necessary arrangements. The quality is very good and they are very nice to watch especially if you have not been able to see them since their broadcast in the 60's. It was one of my favorite shows as a kid and a very special place in my heart because it reminds me of many memories of my childhood as well as other series like Ultraman and Astroboy. <br /> <br /> Peter
