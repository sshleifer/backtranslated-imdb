We have just finished the screening of El Padrino in Australia. A phenomenal film work. We look forward to seeing many more of Mr. Chapa's films in the future. It was wonderful to see a film so well mounted with so much suspense and a story that will remain an instant classic. Seeing a high-quality film shows how serious Chapa is and his skills as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. Chapa has impressed many people with his triumphant performance in the movie "Blood In and Blood Out" and has now proven to everyone who has seen his work his potential to become a critically acclaimed filmmaker with true artistic control. With his lead role, Kilo Vasquez being a perfect combination of Milo Velka's "Blood in Blood Out" and Al Pacino's "Scarface", the movie will do wonders for us here in Australia.
