No matter how much it hurts me to say that, the movie is not as good as it could have been. Maybe I was misled by the countless exaggerated reviews on IMDb, but I was expecting a lot more ... <br /> <Of course, the idea is good, the violent scenes and the work from the camera are remarkable, the imagination of genius Dario is breathtaking, but the film is "dirty" by some mistakes that I find unforgivable. First of all, am I one of the few people who think that heavy metal music played in the most intense scenes tears the atmosphere? ??? With a different kind of music (Goblin ????) during needle scenes, it would have been SOOOO intense! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys any possibility of tension ... Second, the scene of the final killing and the last moments of the movie are just stupid and uninspired. I do not want to say "amateur" because I like Argento's films. The end left me feeling empty. Talk about the final impression! This is hardly what happens in most of Dario's movies! Although, certainly, Suspiria also suffers from a hasty final (although most is brilliant) .... <br /> <br /> In short, watch this movie, try to make the most of its strengths but be prepared for some bad too. It's not a perfect movie by any means.
