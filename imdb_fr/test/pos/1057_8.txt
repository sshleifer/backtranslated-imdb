It's a wonderful Christmas favorite, which I try to catch every year on TV, if I can. This is a reporter named Martha Lane, Elizabeth Stewart, brilliantly described by Barbara Stanwyck. However, unlike Martha, this lady is a sham without any domestic skills. Other cast members complete the story and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan) and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes articles about food. , posing as a married and happy housewife with children. In fact, she is a single woman living in an apartment in New York and can not boil an egg. His recipes are borrowed from his friend the Hungarian chef, Felix. Elizabeth manages to deceive until the publisher of his magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides he wants a beautiful Christmas in the countryside and invites himself to her home, taking with him a war hero, Jefferson Jones, a sailor who was shipwrecked. . Yardley demands total honesty from his employees. To get out of this difficult situation and save her career based on deception, Elizabeth borrows the country house from her long-time pretending architect, John Sloan, in Connecticut, who is a dull and difficult man who has been looking for marriage for a long time. She also borrows a neighbor's baby (many in reality) to pretend to be her and her "husband" Sloan. <br /> <br /> Of course, this scenario is very encouraging. It's a ball comedy and a charming romance, with the added attraction of a Christmas atmosphere. Every time I think of this movie, I see the snowflakes fall, the beautifully decorated tree, the crackling fire in the fireplace, the roast turkey and the baked Christmas cookies. remake? I understand that there is a 1992 version by Arnold Schwarzenegger featuring Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation and I do not wish it. This old favorite is perfect as it is and a vacation "to see" with It's a wonderful life, White Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street and of course all versions of A Christmas Carol.
