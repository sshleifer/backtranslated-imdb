I recently posted on IMDb on this series, giving a mailing address to the commercial branch of the BBD where one could write to appeal. I wrote to this address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity. I have just received the following reply: <br /> <br /> From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 13:44:00 PM To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <dear Kate, <br /> <br /> I work for BBFC, the British equivalent of MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as movies in this country. Anyway, I am giving a certificate to the 1980 "Oppenheimer" miniseries. During my research on IMDb based work, I noticed your message and thought you might like to know that the work is about to be published (hence the need for a certificate). <br /> <br /> I do not know which company distributes it, but keep your eyes open! <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> Emily ++++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> Hurray! <br /> <br /> I also want to contact Netflix to buy it. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net I recently contacted the BBC to find out if their great Oppenheimer series had already been shown on video or DVD. I could not find it. I received the following answer. If you are writing on the BBC, do not forget to mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the United States. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com and find a check box to request the broadcast by the owner (BBC) and be notified of its release. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here is the response from the BBC: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thank you for your e-mail concerning 'Oppenheimer'. <br /> <br /> I was interested to read that you want a copy of this program that you enjoyed. I checked the BBC store and the online retailers and I can not find any trace of its availability. We are not aware of current projects to publish this program on DVD. However, if you would like to make a suggestion, may I suggest that you send it in writing to the BBC Commercial Branch: <br /> <br /> Editor-in-Chief BBC Worldwide Ltd. Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT < br /> <br /> Can I thank you again for taking the time to contact the BBC. <br /> <br /> Greetings <br /> <br /> Elaine Hunter BBC Information ______________________________________ <br /> - ---- Original Message ----- <br /> <br /> {Comments:} I'm trying to find a copy of the terrific BBC production "Oppenheimer", a six-part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston of a book / screenplay by Peter Prince, which I then watched in part on PBS American Playhouse , but that I can not find anywhere in video. <br /> <br /> http://www.bbc.co.uk/
