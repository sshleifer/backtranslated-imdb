A fascinating look at how a great movie can be made if the producers, the director and the cast just "refuse to leave". These guys have encountered serious obstacles throughout the two years of the project (tiny budget, problems with the script and with the screenwriter). The finished product was therefore not what had originally been imagined, but it probably proved to be more interesting than the film to undertake, which proves that the punk mentality of "just do it". .. with or without support, money or help ... find it on the fly and do what you want. I really liked this documentary and I know that viewers will see and learn things they did not know before. This film is really "one of a kind ... it's hard to classify because it contains pieces of" science fiction "and" suspense "and also" how to make a movie. "He's telling the truth about how movies are filmed can be wrong, and how to overcome." I particularly liked the music written by Ed Ivey.These guys know how to make a good film on a shoe rope because that they are creative and know how to build props, dolly, staging, lighting with what they can recover ... some pretty incredible stuff.
