I must say that it is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge has an eye for things that nobody would ever notice, so Office Space. Take a statement on the corruption of society and the fact that the survival of the fittest is nothing but a pipe dream in 500 years. Pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy businesses tend to rule. Yes, there is a lot of potash humor in it and it is to advance the story and get its message across. But the real frustration of Private Joe Bowers' face is invaluable and we can all face it at some point in our lives. <br /> <br /> If you do not like humor, look at it from another point of view and look at it again. I had to watch it twice to really enjoy this movie for what it is ?? And with said after watching it twice ?? I'm going to read a book now.
