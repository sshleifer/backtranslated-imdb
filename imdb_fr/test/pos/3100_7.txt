The characters of Ma & Pa Kettle were very popular AND controversial. The films that featured their offspring paved the way for subsequent TV sitcoms and sought to emulate his winning formula. An obvious reference is "The Beverly Hillbillies", where the new house was purchased with oil money, but was not won in a contest. One could even say that the 'Newhart' sitcom of the 1980s takes up his idea of ​​the backward rural characters of this series. I still wonder if Betty Macdonald, the author who created these characters in Washington, did not do more harm than good. His portrait of hillbilly characters makes them jokes about their alleged negligence and laziness. (The actual family on which Macdonald founded the Kettles was successfully pursued ... claiming that she had been ridiculed and humiliated with these unflattering references). Of course, it's comedy and situations bring us lots of laughter and fun moments ... and the political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the 1940s and 1950s. But I think Macdonald could have written these characters in a more rational way and Universal International could have shown its screenwriters on screen with more dignity (the taste is in good taste). The most realistic moments are when the eldest son, Tom, is ashamed of his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings as they are. For their part, kettles must understand that they do not fit perfectly in a modern world. This is not a joke ... it's a sober truth.
