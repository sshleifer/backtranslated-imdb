This film characterizes the early eighties as well as FUN !! I remember watching this movie on HBO when I was little and it was my favorite movie. As it was a while ago, no one I met knew what it was. Then, about the time my roommate said she saw him too, and that was her favorite, they started printing again !! Fortunately, I have a copy now !! If anyone wants to see the biggest treasure hunt (cheese) that was probably the beginning of the hazing ideas for the frats, this movie is the good !!! (Watcher - must have a serious love for 80 nerdy type movies !!)
