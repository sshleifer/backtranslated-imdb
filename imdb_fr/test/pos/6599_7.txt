It's a very good documentary. I am not a skateboarder, I do not particularly like skateboarding or skateboarding culture. But for about 2 hours, this movie interested me. <br /> <br /> I would not call it the most intriguing movie of all time, but for some reason, when these guys were telling how they started their skate clubs and skating in those empty pools from southern California, that interested me. <br /> <br /> I should also add that the music of this movie was very good too. I do not dwell on wanting to hear more 70s rock bands, but that seemed appropriate for what they were talking about.
