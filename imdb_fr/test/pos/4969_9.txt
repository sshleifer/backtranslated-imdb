It's been almost 50 years since I saw "Jennifer" for the first and only time. I did not know the name of this movie before I saw it on this website, but I told many people (especially my grandchildren) that movies do not have to include graphic details to scare you and leave you a powerful impact. The story skillfully presents concepts that, if true, place Ida Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Whenever Miss Lupino discovers a new "fact", she plunges the viewer into confusion and fear. <br /> <br /> This film has such an impact on me that almost 50 years later, I still consider it one of the scariest. movies I've never seen. Yet this film does not contain the blood and blood that became popular shortly after its creation. It's amazing the impact of a good story and good actors.
