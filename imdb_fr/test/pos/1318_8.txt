The only pure life is one that ends in a signature in the blood. <br /> <br /> That's what Mishima says, a protected boy who becomes a famous author. The life of one of Japan's most famous literary voices is told from three angles: his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a Japanese military base and commit a ritual suicide (in color), flashbacks (in black and white), and scenes from his novels (shown in a sort of Technicolor dream setting, somewhere between the traditional Noh Theater and the "Wizard of Oz." These stories are often told at the same time, but are edited to reinforce, the slow merging of Mishima's life with his fictions, until the end (or early) when, like the ancient samurai whom he admires, he will have a balance between feather and sword (when his words and his actions will be the same and he and "be pure"). <br /> <br /> Paul Schrader wrote the script for "Taxi Driver" and directed "Cat People" (a strange horror movie) , who left me strange impressions as a boy) and Mishima, he gets closer to a really great movie. <br /> <br /> Whats Interesti Ng is watching the poet, the homosexual, the shy and clumsy man with a low body image that overestimates his tuberculosis to get rid of World War II (which he seems to always be ashamed), become a body building, obsessed with the samurai, sexual, media phenomena, while continuing to write prolific amounts of novels, plays and new ones. <br /> <br /> A short and nice version is that Mishima has no father and becomes obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self-destruction, in a tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than him, he was still missing. Looking at him with his suicidal comrades, you see him happy, pronouncing his great paternal speech, giving orders and loving control ... until the speech itself, the point where pen and sword meet ? Of course, this ignores the subtlety of the narrative here, which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable. <br /> <br /> Although the story, fascinating at times, this movie is not really the biggest hit. Cinematography, performance, editing, music (by Philip Glass) and sets are really what makes it worth seeing, and much more than just a traditional biopict. <br /> <br /> One day, I'm going to get a book from Mishima, he seems to have the ear for prose and staging, but for now I'm happy with the movie. <br /> <br /> Those interested in Japanese literature and postwar culture should check. Fans of inventive combinations of facts and fiction should also enjoy it.
