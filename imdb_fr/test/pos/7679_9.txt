I saw the movie in its original theatrical release in Austin, Texas. The old Paramount Theater (I do not know if it still exists.) Came out with loudspeakers around the walls precisely connected to the six channels. At 15, I was blown away. The concept of surround sound was completely foreign to music and film at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember very well at least three exceptional scenes in which the surround sound had a considerable impact. (Although please, forgive me if time has altered my memories with inaccuracies.) The first was a camera trip through Catfish Row, animated by the sights and sounds of daily activity. You first saw each of them, like a blacksmith for example, and then, when the camera passed them, their sound will continue to be heard by going left or right on the side of the theater, in the back. The second was a fanfare that was first seen in the front, then paraded past the camera, separating left and right. Not only did the sound of each instrument follow its own directional path, but it also changed timbre as it played toward you, by your side, and then away from you. And if that was not enough, they also took into account the Doppler effect for each instrument as it went. The third scene was at the end of the film as Porgy left Catfish Row for New York in search of Bess. He and about half of the cast members pass by the camera when they leave the village with the same sound effects as the band. The other half of the actors / choirs sing with them and also say goodbye to Porgy and their other friends. Answers from friends are audible on the sides and back. <br /> <br /> Surround sound has been used with magnificent effects throughout the film. I think I remember a rock or something thrown from a jetty and heard it land in the water behind me. Theater-goers were fortunate to have access to six such small chains - things that would seem trivial in theaters without it. <br /> <br /> I stayed at the theater several times. You can do it then. And I went back several times before he left town. I never saw the movie again It's literally BEGS for DVD output with restored image fidelity and surround sound. I hope someone has preserved it somewhere. Please, Gershwin family, allow it to be published before it is definitively lost to other generations.
