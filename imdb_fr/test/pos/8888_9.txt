Black comedy is not always easy to sell. From time to time, you get an extremely successful black comedy, like Fargo's, for example. But generally, they do not often find a large audience. People seem to be determined either to comedy or to serious problems. There does not seem to be a big market for a good mix of both. Throw Momma From the Train has been a pretty decent success, but few people seem to remember much about it nowadays. Danny DeVito just released this one from the park in 1987. <br /> <br /> DeVito plays a strange boy of the mother, Owen, who seeks to get rid of his outrageous and unpleasant mother with whom he still lives. . The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who died shortly after its publication, and is rather caricatural. She is noisy, ugly, rude and domineering. Although Owen seems to have trouble taking care of himself, he desperately wants his mother offended. He fantasizes about really strange scenes, but he clearly does not have the courage to do it himself. This is where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid intellectual novelist claiming that his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions. He is currently trying to write a new one, but can not even find a decent first sentence. "The night was ..." Owen hears that Larry wants his ex-wife to die in an explosion at the school cafeteria. And, borrowing this idea from Strangers on Train, Owen decides to go to Hawaii and murder Larry's ex-wife. Once he seems to have done so, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny and even poignant. It is certainly never boring and often full of surprises. <br /> <br /> The acting is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a little excessive. Crystal is as good as possible, and DeVito has always been underestimated as an interpreter. The film is based on a little physical comedy that usually works, often painfully. The film uses some really innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the offbeat tone is really refreshing. I often criticized the late 1980s as a period of artistic malaise and lazy film making. Throwing Mom Train takes risks. Both in the way his characters are drawn and in his general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered? The film is not too long and it is bursting with laughter. Writers tend to find it more interesting than the general public, but everyone can enjoy it. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hunting dog.
