What a great movie, especially since my wife and I stumbled on it, surfing the channels while surfing on a nice icy day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her best, directing a cast of very normal and human characters through one of the most wonderful films we've ever seen. It's hard to understand why this film did not receive the attention it deserved when it was released in 2002. Why was it head and shoulders above so many boring pieces of garbage released with more of fanfare and the attention is evident in the visualization. It is obvious that as a general public, we are force-fed of what has been deemed "formidable" by the powerful and influential, while true jewels such as "Unconditional Love" manage to shine through all these contenders to a really nice cinema. Rent or buy this movie ..... you will not regret it!
