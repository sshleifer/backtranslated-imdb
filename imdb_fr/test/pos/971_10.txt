I love that movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is lying, but that's why he's called "big fat liar". Even if this kid runs away to Hollywood, it does not give kids the idea that they can. Moreover, he does not do it simply for pleasure or to get away from anything, he does it to regain confidence. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's a big advertisement for Universal Studios, because I liked how it gave a glimpse of what it's like for kids who do not know how point making movies is cool. <br /> <br /> He has good music and funny characters. This family comedy is totally fun for kids and parents. He has humor, excitement and real difficulties like lying. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Big Fat Liar" sends a moral: do not expect that lying is easy.
