Black Day Blue Night was actually a good modern black. Three young nomads fleeing from their own lives team up for a road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere (as most modern blacks do). A woman finds that her husband is cheating on her, and after finding her in a hotel room, decides to start from scratch. Strangely, she travels with her husband's mistress, who is forgivable since the shoulder bag never told him he was married. And together, while driving in the pouring rain, they meet a third young man very mysterious with a suitcase full of secrets. While they are crazy and free and they are suspicious of each other, the police returned to town identified them as suspects in the death of a policeman. <br /> <br /> Black Day Blue Night begins with an immediate confrontation, and throws in a pretty good story with all its twists to deceive your suspicions from one character after another, leading to a very unusual end. In other words, the film begins with an immediate confrontation, and once you think the story is resolved, you are immediately immersed in a new trick in the plot, revealing a little more than you expected before the end of the day. movie. <br /> <br /> But, as some viewers have written, the end is a bit confusing and a little disappointing. The killer is not what one would expect immediately and, once revealed, becomes a bit confusing because of a flashback quite elaborately explained that reveals all the reasons needed to solve the mystery. But in reality, there is a finale beyond, which I think is the most interesting of the film. Because modern black always involves a circle of suspects, almost always guilty of something, it is also a genre that always involves money. The question that arises in these films is always the following: how far are the characters ready to go to get money? <br /> <br /> If you like this interpretation of modern film noir, I would advise you to watch Red Rock West (it's also JT Walsh and some events in the devastated desert)!
