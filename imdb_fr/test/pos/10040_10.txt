Although "They are dead with their boots" is not quite accurate historically, it is a very entertaining western. Flynn is not only the perfect Custer, the actors are also superb. In addition to the action part of the film, the love scenes of Flynn and DeHavilland are very touching and credible (Flynn and DeHavilland loved each other very much in real life). Flynn has always been so worried about not being taken seriously if he knew there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well!
