This film is a strange but interesting film. I'll tell you why it's strange later in this review. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting because it was the first film to contain sound. No, it may not be an hour and forty-two movie, no, it may not contain great action scenes, but it's still a wonderful movie for me. This triggered a whole revolution known if you want, sound movies. It can be a bit strange to watch, knowing that everyone in this movie is now dead, I can hear the voice of a man at the beginning who does not travel the Earth more visibly, and that the sound is cracking and broken . <Br /> <br /> I recommend this video in plain view. This created movies as we know them today!
