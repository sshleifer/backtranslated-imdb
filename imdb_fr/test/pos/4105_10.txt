The cast is admirably chosen and well balanced. This cinematography is excellent. The music is delicious, just like the music of Burt Bacharach, and it is suitable for intrigue. Making a musical version of Hilton's tale is a welcome change from a painful remodeling. We see seasoned actors who add real depth to the emotional content and meaning of each scene. I can not agree with the critics who have neglected this shimmering jewel of a movie. It's a treasure of the big screen! Find it if you can - and let its magic take you beyond the chore of daily worries, by prompting you to find your own "Lost Horizon".
