This film is hilarious, brilliant and insightful. Although history may work well with almost all ethnic groups, the inherent Jewishness of the characters gives additional meaning to the richness of a wonderful dialogue. The plot covered so many social problems that for that reason alone it would have been interesting to see; -but the real treasure was in the hearty laughter that spread throughout the grateful audience. The mixture of complex characters with their strengths and weaknesses plays their role with all the pathos and humor that one would expect from the Shakespearian drama that their lives seem parodic. It's a film about the family; - on the often fragile, sometimes invisible links of personalities and different lifestyles, in the first place between brothers and sisters and parents, then inevitably among the big family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film gave the film a look and a development that intrigues the viewer to the final scene. Peter Falk is astonishing, as always, as patriarch of the family, Morris Applebaum. The strong performances of a beautiful cast include a surprise guest. Do not miss this movie!
