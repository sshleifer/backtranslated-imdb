It is a very modest and very charming film with an excellent score of Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a remarkable number, "We are the couple at the castle", which is totally evocative of the period and recalls the Penthouse Serenade at the opening The premise (the coming of Hoppity) may well have inspired the opening of Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg (Woody's Coming) in Finian's Rainbow six years later. I totally agree with the posters that noted that if Disney's name was added to it, it would have now achieved "classic" status rather than being overlooked. It's wonderfully inventive, never more than when objects barely noticed in the "real" world take on a much greater meaning, both for and against the world of insects. In fact, it is a classic, although minor.
