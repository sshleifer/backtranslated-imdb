I watched this film in '75 and this film was a kind of open thought about the importance of taking care of Natural and Wild life. When I had a dog in 83, I called him TRUSKA (in the movie..Avakun's Dog) to never forget this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, I have a copy of this movie, but it is in Portuguese language and the quality is not as good as a DVD or a new VHS (which I recorded there there is almost 20 years and in SLP fast so the quality is not so good .. <br /> <br /> If someone wishes a copy .. I will try to convert to DVD and I can send you OKAY? <br /> <br /> Ot's a good movie and I agree it's a movie to watch constantly. <br /> <br /> Waldemar Braz - Sao Paulo / Brazil
