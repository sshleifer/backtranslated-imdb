"Traffik 1989" is a six-episode British miniseries and an Emmy Award winner, which inspired Oscar's "Traffic 2000". The five-hour film divides the opium / heroin trade for the viewer, ranging from the hand-scattering of poppy seeds in a field of Afghanistan to the "rush of the head" of a drug addict in an apartment in England. "Traffik" offers not only entertainment value through interwoven dramatic stories, it also provides an overview of the international drug trade at all levels, answering the questions: who, where, how and why ? Traffik, synonymous with entertainment and education, will be a good time for teenagers and adults. (A)
