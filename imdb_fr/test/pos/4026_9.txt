Valeria, an elegant and pretty young woman lives in a world surrounded by walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a lover of one night or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference to be completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can act to approach this special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows him to answer his questions only by a "yes", a "no" or an "I do not know" . . The way to accentuate the loneliness of the character is beautiful. An example would be the distance between Massimo and Valeria to have coffee in the same room, separated by subtle divisions and not seeing each other. I could cite several sequences, however, it is better to see the movie. It is impressive to see that no less a detail is beyond the control of the director. Although all the actions are performed in slow movements, no scream is needed, no special effects, but only a fantastic acting game and a touching and well written story. I liked it.
