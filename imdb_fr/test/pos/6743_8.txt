In April 1947, the city of New York is facing an epidemic crisis. Eugene LaBar, an importer of carpets from Mexico, had arrived in the city with the deadly smallpox virus. He stumbled into a bus, complaining of fever and headaches, and died soon in a Midtown hospital, but not before he infected a dozen passersby. The evil was already done; for the first time in decades, smallpox has invaded the streets of New York. The city's health authorities acted quickly to isolate the patients and contain the virus, launching a free vaccination campaign that enabled more than six million New Yorkers to be immunized against smallpox. Thanks to their quick response, the virus has been contained with minimal loss. The epidemic must nevertheless have left an indelible mark. Several years later, it is followed by two film noir thrillers on the same theme, in which doctors must find a single contagious carrier in a city of several million inhabitants: Panic in the Streets by Elia Kazan. (1950) 'and the small budget of Earl McEvoy,' The Killer Who Curses New York (1950) ''. <br /> <br /> McEvoy's film unfolds in an unfamiliar docu-drama style. Reed Hadley's story seems to come directly from a news film, he recited the facts as if he had read the official police transcript. This technique sometimes seems a little inexpensive, but fortunately, the narration is largely limited to the notebooks of the film, in addition to providing an explanatory supplement during breaks in the plot. The "killer" harassing New York, in this story, is not a Mexican carpet importer, but the beautiful diamond courier Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes), who has just arrived from Cuba. In a few days, Sheila has two parties that pursue her independently: a treasure agent (Barry Kelley) who is trying to arrest her for smuggling and a team of doctors (led by William Bishop) who identified her as the source of the smallpox epidemic. As in "Panic in the Streets", an increased urgency manifests itself in a routine human hunt, especially when those who pursue them initially have no idea of ​​the identity or appearance of the man. their suspect. <br /> "The Killer That Stalked New York" is largely successful in getting around its low production budget - in addition to a few selected lines of dialogue ("we have to stop it!" exclaims Dr. Wood at one point given, as if making a difficult decision), filmmakers and cast members allow the story to unfold in a realistic and captivating way.In this respect, the low budget probably contributes to the government's intentions. a film that requires a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the epidemic scenario, Evelyn Keyes is excellent in the lead role, showing stubborn resilience to unimaginable torment, and at the end of the film she seems brutally disabled by the disease that is almost painful to look at his face.In addition to the virus, Charles Korvin is the main villain of the play, as greedy and adulterous husband of Sheila who, rest assured, receive it's all that's happening to her, and if all the nurses looked like Dorothy Malone, catching smallpox might not be such a bad break, after all.
