'The Big Snit' entered my complete life by accident and left an indelible mark in my soul. A scar of love, destruction and worthlessness that will always be part of my life. This is the story of beautiful futility. We are helpless one without the other. We are helpless in the face of wrongdoing by the government. We are helpless in the choices we all try to make when we are in love. Deaf to the whispers and events of a world outside the window. Blind to an inevitable apocalypse. Mute hatred and greedy opinions of a society too indulgent. It is a story of personal commitment and triumphant love defeating the ideologies of war. Their quarrel is a sublime observation of human nature and the way love comes with its pains and darkness. Everyone has an irritating aspect to their personality and this is observed by the creators in the simplest and most fantastic way. We only travel a short distance with the two main characters, but we want to complete our own journey with some of their simple, loving and honest philosophy. I am really happy to exist in this "our time". Another 20 years on both sides of my date of birth, and I would not have seen or felt .... The Big Snit. William White. Sheffield.
