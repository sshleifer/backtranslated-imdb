CACTUS FLOWER was a charming comedy from 1969 based on Neil Simon's play about a dentist (Walter Matthau) having an affair with a free-spirited young woman (Goldie Hawn), totally unaware that her devoted nurse / assistant (Ingrid Bergman) was in love with him. Matthau can play this kind of role during his sleep and he does not disappoint as a philanthropic dentist, Dr. Julian Winston, who goes out with a woman but has no idea that he loves another. Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for her brilliant performance as Toni Simmons, the aging flower child who gradually understands that she is trapped in a stalemate and is not as dark as she is. it appears on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this movie was to play the legendary Ingrid Bergman in the role of Dr. Stephanie Dickinson, Dr. Winston's dedicated assistant, ready to bury and sacrifice his own happiness as long as Dr. Winston is happy with Tony. Bergman is bright in this film, absolutely beautiful (although the camera has always loved it) and showing an unexpected talent for light comedy. Yes, the dialogues and sets are slightly dated, but the story is timeless and the performances of the stars make it imminent.
