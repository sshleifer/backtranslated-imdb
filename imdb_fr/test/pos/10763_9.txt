I really enjoyed Fierce People. I discovered the movie by accident, browsing my lists of movies on demand trying to find something interesting to watch. The film mainly deals with class in America and quickly catches your eye. The characters are smart and articulate and the story does not follow the usual rules of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist is Finn, a precocious but disadvantaged 15-year-old who spends his summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays Patriarch Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays the mother of Finn, a friend of Ogden who is also used to cocaine and a slut. The Osbournes own a large estate and seem to live according to their own rules. At first, they seem charming and sophisticated, but the super-rich are different. They are used to making their own way. The film is nice mainly because it offers intelligent dialogue, a superb action game and a story that takes unexpected turns. It's also a R-rated movie, so it's not entirely healthy. <br /> <br /> The distribution is excellent. Anton Yelchin is credible and compassionate in the demanding role of Finn. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been so good. Chris Evans is impressive as a sneaky grandson of Osbourne. Kristen Stewart is fine as the pretty little girl. High quality film.
