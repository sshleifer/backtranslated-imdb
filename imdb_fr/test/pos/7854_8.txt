It's probably the best film of Clint Eastwood. Here, the action is minimal, but with a lot of good acting. An Eastwood Yankee soldier is wounded and taken away by students and teachers from a southern school where he is hidden and taken care of. Shortly after her recovery, all the ladies wanted to have fun with him and some of them succeeded, notably the director of the school (Geraldine Page). Erotic scenes happen until women discover that their "macho" was shared by many of them. They got angry and poisoned him at a farewell dinner. Geraldine Page, although a little older, was able to play a very suggestive role as school principal, a woman with more failures than happiness in her life.
