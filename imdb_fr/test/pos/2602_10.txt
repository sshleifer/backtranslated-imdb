This is my favorite drawing of all time Looney Tunes. It's a common plot: Daffy Duck is trying to convince Elmer Fudd that it's really the bunny season and shoot Bugs. But you can never beat that bunny! In addition to the usual cartoon comedy, this caricature is supported by a play on words that will make you roll on the floor.
