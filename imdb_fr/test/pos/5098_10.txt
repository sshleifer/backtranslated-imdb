I like this movie because every element of it is nothing less than excellent. I will quickly rent some. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his best performances as he becomes the definitive Mr. Chips. Petula Clark, has a beautiful voice and is perfect as Katharine. The director was able to display the story in a new way. Combine this with fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc., and you get a film that shows the quality of its production. I can not say enough good things about the camera's well-planned work, it moves us up and down, zooming in and out, giving us the best views and letting the scene become an integral part of the scene. Petula Clark's latest song, 'YOU AND I', consists of 3 beautifully composed long shots. In this time of 2 seconds, I can appreciate the extra care that everyone involved had to bring to make these long scenes perfect. The music is excellent and the songs move the story forward as they should. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how could someone not like them? It's a very romantic story between two middle aged people who meet each other, bring out the best of each other and last for the rest of their lives. The excellent production values, the acting, the camcorder work and the music make this film worth watching.
