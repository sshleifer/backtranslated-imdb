Antena, a daring film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, both reinvents the genre of the silent film and creates an edifying narrative. The scenery is a city in the grip of blind television, its people deprived of the power to speak, except for a lonely and mysterious screen presence known simply as The Voice. In an effort to reinforce their grip on power, the TV reporter's terribly ugly duo, Mr. TV, and the mad scientist, Dr. Y, decided to kidnap The Voice and turn its unique talent into an obnoxious goal. . It's up to a young family and The Voice's nameless and uneducated son to stop this diabolical stratagem. The result is the story of a story that sometimes baffles but remains captivating. <br /> <br /> It's a silent movie that carries a lot of its influences on his sleeve; The obvious references to big names in silent movies such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be obvious to anyone who knows their work well. But more subtle references and symbolism hide behind such tributes. I particularly like the fact that Mr. TV and his henchman drive in typical 1930s gangster cars from the decade in which the silent film era died and a very different industry began to emerge. <br /> <br /> The Antena exploits the intrigues of clich√©s and theatrical outbidding common to so many silent films, albeit in a very learned and humorous way. It's the amazing visual style of La Antena that really sets him apart from the films he pays homage to. From the hypnotic logo of the television station to the threatening hill station, this film is bursting with flashy visual inventiveness that rivals Studio Ghibli animation? and all that by using real actors and handmade sets. <br /> <br /> Moreover, even if the style is often intentionally cheesy and theatrical, it is always a troubling, provocative and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism in La Antena confers additional resonance to the struggle between the television empire and the decline of the power of words. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original, including the hypnotic tourbillon of televisions and the nightmarish food factory. <br /> <br /> I hate ending this review on a sour note, but I think the English version of La Antena is disappointed with the subtitles. The original Spanish subtitles are used wisely, with lots of play with the words on the screen. However, the English subtitles that accompany the initial dialogue are frustrating and incomplete, with omissions and errors that sometimes leave the viewer on their own. The Antena is nevertheless a remarkable piece of cinema. a breathtaking visual experience that displays remarkable energy and humor while telling a compelling story.
