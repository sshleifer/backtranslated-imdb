I was recommended this movie as one of the best love stories ever told. And since I'm a big fan of love, I bought the tickets and sat down at the theater. After 90 minutes, I left the theater with nothing but disappointment and the theme of the song as the only positive aspect of the film. I was appalled by the story itself, that two people could love each other but be afraid of never playing it. I just could not get past the language barrier and the barrier of culture. The second time I fell on it ... I was in a different mood, I had no more expectations ... and I had more patience, more relaxed spirit to "see" the film ... and soon I opened my eyes, I discovered love ... the beauty of the film. I went beyond the language and the love story and I saw the actors play (not even a moment, I never had the impression they were acting!) And the cinematography . The first time I heard a definition of what a movie was, I was told that it should be a perfectly balanced chain of photographs (shots) and that this movie fits the description. Almost every shot has an idea behind it, and combined with the music ... and the effects of light ... the result is just a masterpiece! And a masterpiece is just something you must have in your movie collection.
