This is the second Hitchcock movie on the list and the second full-length movie I saw at Hitchcock, the first being Rope, which I really enjoyed. With Saboteur, Hitchcock left more room for freedom, while Corde unfolded in one piece. I did not like this one as much as Rope, but that does not mean it's a bad movie, it looks like an average film that could have been something more. <br /> <br /> It seems that a movie Hitchcock would have a break between his more serious. As a thriller, I feel like I'm not really getting on the edge of my seat or engaging with the main character around the United States. The film's climax gives the impression of being a missed opportunity to really amplify the tension. The sound design is almost non-existent. You can hear their dialogues and a bit of the environment that surrounds them, but missing important things, stitches tearing their sleeve, the need for music to amplify tension, all missing. Intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch that we would like such a scene. Then the film ends abruptly and leaves you empty inside. <br /> <br /> The film does not have the impression of having to do it either, it is almost trotting everywhere, but it seems more confined. The scenario itself is very average and seems to go hand in hand with the most obtuse means of advancing the plot. <br /> <br /> The performances are there, but nothing incredible. Everyone plays his roles on scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two leaders is weak and requires more work. Otto Kruger, who has this rich personality, selfish and perverse, stands out. <br /> <br /> In the end, I wanted more. I understand that one of Hitchcock's less exciting films, but I had a good time watching it. I can recommend it, but not with enthusiasm.
