Great movie about an American G.I. who leaves the army to marry a German who saved her life in the last days of the war. She accepts, but does she do it because she really likes him or because he can help her with easier access to food, etc.? Meanwhile, his brother and an old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called Werewolves, which aims to drive out the occupants (you may remember the same group playing a major role in the Europa movie of Lars von Trier, Europa (Zentropa)). James Best, best known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane in the 1980s television show The Dukes of Hazzard, is as good as the American. He should have become a big movie star ?? at this age, he reminds me a lot Warren Beatty. The other main actors are also good. Fuller's direction is pretty good, because it uses a lot of long shots (although they are not as complex as in Park Row, long shots usually consist of long scenes with lots of dialogue). The only problem lies in the scenario, as seems to be the case of all Fuller films I've seen. This is not too serious, but it should have been expanded to give body to the main characters and parts of the script. Helga, the woman, is going through a major change, but completely off screen. Therefore, the emotional center rests entirely on the shoulders of Best. Fuller should also have killed the sick mother at the beginning of the movie. I hope it does not sound too hard! She does not really do anything along the film except staying in bed. She has so few lines. But Fuller continues to raise it over the film. I would have had his death solidify the relationship of David and Helga myself. And the film ends too abruptly and lacks spin-offs. These are not really the biggest faults in the world (the way I've described them makes them look bigger than they are). 9/10.
