Note: After writing this review, I see that this list is about the TV series and not the original movie. My mistake. I was thinking of IMDb for a movie database, not TV shows. But as most people will watch this movie under BAGDAD CAFE and NOT OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which, strangely, is the name under which this movie is listed under IMDb, I'll leave this comment here. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something, but when I read this review, it seemed to be entirely a review of the CBS series - which was to be loosely based on this movie. I have not seen the TV series and I may like it or not, but I'm sure it's very different from this movie. This film is NOT at all a TV show and Whoopie Goldberg is not there, any more than other famous Hollywood stars (except Jack Palance, who was very charming in his role). <br /> <br /> It's a terrible, sweet film that totally thinks "out of the box." This is not at all a Hollywood formula, which probably explains why (which is a good word for idiots?) Who decides to commercialize movies or has not decided not to commercialize it. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie captured my heart and imagination from the start. Music (which is only part of the time, so you can not really talk about music), from cinematography to really cool story. <br /> <br /> A German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and plump) argues with the other German or Bavarian man with whom she travels through the California desert and separates from him - he takes off by car and she left to fend for herself on a deserted and almost desert highway in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> She finds Baghdad Cafe, small and dilapidated but charming, in Baghdad, California, and registers. The rest of the story is magical. I do not want to try to describe this film because I want you to enjoy every surprise. <br /> <br /> Warning: if you are racist or have something against big women, this movie will not please you. The main thread is a tall woman and the characters with brown skin and red have great roles and are part of the "mix" without any racism. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 10 for originality, entertainment and pure delight.
