MPAA PG-13 ranking <br /> <br /> My ranking: 10 years old and up <br /> <br /> My ranking * 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> William H. Macy delivers a breathtaking performance the role of Mr. Neuman. It makes you feel friendly and scared for him simultaneously. The story begins as a comedy and slowly but regularly becomes almost like a horror movie with twists that Macy masters to perfection. I could not leave this movie with my eyes even after it was over, and I could not believe that the film had ended at that time. A MUST SEE. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH CAN BE CONSIDERED BY A SPOILER BY SOME <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, look at the plot this way: The Neumans are the United States The character of Meat Loaf Aday, in the United States, is anti-emetic. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice film that suits everyone I see on the street.
