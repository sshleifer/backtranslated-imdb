It was a day in 1891 when Scottish inventor William K. L. Dickson surprised his boss, Thomas Alva Edison, with his outstanding work in the development of motion pictures. After many experiments, Dickson was now able to capture scenes from real life with his camera and reproduce them through his invention, the Kinetoscope, as if a fragment of time had been preserved in celluloid. Soon, Dickson's Kinetoscope would become a huge success as a new means of entertainment, with many people eager to pay the dime that was responsible for watching people dance or acrobats performing acrobatics through the "peepshow" of the Kinetoscope . However, the invention was not complete and, to capture real life on film as we know it, sound was needed on films. Thus, Dickson continued to experiment and resulted in this short experience, the first Kinetophone film. <br /> <br /> In this experiment, the code name is simply "Dickson Experimental Sound Film", under the direction of William KL Dickson stands in front of a recording cone for a wax cylinder (the oldest method recording sound), with his violin on his hands, playing a song called "Song of the Cabin Boy". The idea was to record the song in the cylinder at the same time as the camera recorded its movements. In order to show that it was a film, two of Edison's "Black Maria" labs decided to do a little dance in front of the camera. Contrary to what the author claims Vito Russo in his book "The Celluloid Closet", this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality, because it obviously referred to the environment of solitude of the lab, similar to the sailors loners to whom the "Song of the Cabin Boy" was dedicated to (the title suggested by Russo, "The Gay Brothers", is actually anachronistic, because "gay" had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect and the kinetophone could never really produce the synchronized sound with the images. While he had the cylinder with sound and celluloid with the images, the timing of the two elements was not really effective and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re Cinematograph pushed the Edison team to focus on projection systems, before Dickson leaves the company. . Fortunately, in 1998, Dickson's cylinder with the sound of the film was rebuilt and the film editor, Walter Murch, restored the experience as planned. Finally, "Dickson Experimental Sound Film" could be heard with a synchronized sound, exactly as the inventor wanted. Although it was not a successful attempt, this exceptional film bears witness to the enormous genius of the Kinetoscope's father. 8/10
