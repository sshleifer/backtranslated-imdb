Mr. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a "light and sporty comedy", it has a comforting core as human and universal as some of the finest in Capra. At the level of the plot, you have the paradox of baseball, a good old American game, as it is played in Japan - overthrown, with American values ​​rejected and Japanese values ​​printed in the game. (Part of the superficial "sports comedy" results from Jack's incomprehensible disbelief of how "basa-boru" is played in Japan.) You also have a main character portrayed as an aging baseball star, but who is actually quite immature - the professional ball has allowed him to postpone his childhood. And you have a main character who brutally resists the changes in his life imposed on him, refusing to accept the curve that life gave him, in the middle of a new country, a new director, a new team, and a new girlfriend, who all welcomed him and tried to accept him. Sounds heavy? Not really. It is a charming comedy "clash of cultures" that takes place at national, sports, romantic and professional levels. But if you look at it with enough sensitivity, you will also find a beautiful story about a man who has to give up his immaturity and grow up too late in life (causing some personal pain), and who succeeds in places where he does not. did not wait. . I love history, but I also have great respect for Selleck's performance. he shows his temptation (literally) to portray an ugly American, insulting people and pushing angry outbursts in public, then leaving us inside that character to understand his dismay. It does not hurt either if you are a big fan of Takakura Ken like me. Mr. BASEBALL is a surprising tale of "loss of innocence".
