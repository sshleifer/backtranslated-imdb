I was delighted to see this gem of a movie available on DVD. Although it was a 16mm film TV movie, it helped to better understand the different types of people who wanted to become a "London taxi driver", as well as their weaknesses and family commitments. Even the most unfortunate of the candidates, "Titanic" with his uncommunicative wife, was able to see how Jack Rosenthal was able to create an extract of London life that is often funny and sometimes tragic in 90 minutes of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Originally created as a Mick Ford vehicle (wordplay wanted), the acting quality of a group consisting of Michael Elphic, Nigel Hawthorne, Jonathan Lynn, Lesley Joseph and Maureen Lipman (Ms. Rosenthal) made Mick stand out but had to work hard against such competing talents. <br /> <br /> Even 15 years after its release in 1991, it's still as fresh as ever!
