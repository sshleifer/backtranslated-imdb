It's one of the best musicals of the 1940s. The glorious Technicolor showcases Rita Hayworth's spectacular beauty and hair. She should have made more films in color, but Columbia was not able to spend money on Technicolor's spectacular shows. <br /> <br /> Rita is a WOW like Rusty Parker - she's more than awesome in some of the brightest numbers ever. She was also beautiful in her dresses of the century, so she was given the chance to play her own grandmother. <br /> <br /> The film begins with "The Show Must Go On" - it sounds great, but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maurine (Lesley Brookes) is determined to perfect herself and will audition at the Vanity Competition of Golden Wedding Cover Girl. Rusty is just at the auditions. In a very funny scene, Maurine has just attended a very neat audition and gives Rusty some tips to impress the judges !!! "Do not be shy and wise - chat and scintillate". Rusty does it brilliantly! <br /> <br /> They choose Maurine and go to the show to see her, but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of a man from his past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) still has nightmares after Rusty's audition. "Whose Complaining" features Genius (Phil Silvers) and dancers disguised as workers - (Rusty is a taxi driver). <br /> <br /> John remembers a long lost love (Rusty's grandmother, Maribelle Hicks) For the first time, he saw her singing "A Sure Thing" at the races. Meanwhile, Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls in their local restaurant. They then embark on the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - "Make Way For Tomorrow". <br /> <br /> "Put me to the test" is a catchy song and dance number starring Danny and Rusty. In the meantime, Rusty has been chosen by Cover Girl and Danny McGuires is the place to visit. Lee Bowman appears as Danny's romantic rival and puts a damper on things. Lee Bowman is probably the most boring man of all time - so Danny never has to worry. <br /> <br /> Rusty (nicknamed Martha Mears) sings "Long Ago and Far Away" and is beautifully danced by Danny and Rusty. The dresses that Rita wears are breathtaking. Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling designed them. Danny wants the best for Rusty but fears losing it. Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the "Alter Ego" where he dances with himself. <br /> <br /> "Poor John" is another look at the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is extremely A fun song that makes fun of rich relationships - Hayworth is gorgeous in a surprisingly scenic outfit . Look for Al Norman in "Poor John" and "A Sure Thing". He was an incredible, eccentric dancer who has appeared in several musicals, including "King of Jazz" and "Paramount on Parade". It was easy to spot. <br /> <br /> The "Cover Girl" dance is simply fantastic. Rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. After a crowd of beautiful models parading through the covers of the biggest American magazines, Rusty burst into a beautiful gilded dress dancing on a ramp overlooking the very catchy song "Cover Girl". My God, I love this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
