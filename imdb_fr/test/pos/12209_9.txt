This show has an incredible plot with good and recognizable actors (like the daughter of Boston Legal and Boris the Butcher of Snatch). Even the extras and kid, whom I thought of advertising might be a weak link, surprised me with his skill. These are just the little things that the director needs to tweak. As the guy who recaps the last episode at the beginning of each new episode has to be fired. Have a narrator who tells you what happened ruin the story. The only other problem I have is that sometimes they take too much time doing things, but not as far as some shows like Prison Break. Anyone know when they will resume the season ??
