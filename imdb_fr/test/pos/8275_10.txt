THE PROJECT IN BRIEF: Dave Seville, father figure and director of the brothers Chipmunk, Alvin, Simon & Theodore, went to Europe for a business trip, leaving the boys at home with Miss Miller as observer, much to the chagrin Alvin. who wanted to go to Europe. Brittany, the leader of the Chipettes, composed of her younger sisters Jeanette (Simon's female counterpart) and Eleanor (Theodore's female counterpart) in a fierce arcade game around the world in 30 days, they draw the attention of two perverse alien brothers and sisters who need to smuggle money and diamonds around the world, but need a way to do so that does not attract the attention of their nemesis, Jamal. The two evil brothers, Claudia & Klaus, hear the conversation between Alvin and Brittany and decide to use them as deliverers for their booty (more Claudia's idea than that of Klaus, the latter objects initially that it is too dangerous for children). The two siblings bid boys and girls - travel in air balloons at up to 12 drop points to leave dolls (resembling children) with diamonds and / or silver to indicate their arrival , with the promise that the winner wins the race will get a sum of obscene money. But as the two brothers and sisters of talking animals make their rounds, they are hunted down by Jamal's henchmen - but who is Jamal? Is he friend or foe? <br /> <br /> GLOBAL: A nice and light joke inspired by Alvin & the Chipmunks' 1980s television version. The beautiful animation is a highlight, it lacks raw humor that constantly creeps into today's family movies and engaging songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll being a star). Eagle fans will no doubt have noticed that Brittany's character drawing has been modified from the animated series, giving it a less rounded face while giving a seemingly permanent blush to the cheeks (which Jeanette and Eleanor also display). <br /> <br /> Keep a close ear to Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson.
