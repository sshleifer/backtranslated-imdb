Jean-Pierre Melville is a director I only met recently (I need to see Bob the Flambeur and The Samurai to catch them), but watching The Red Circle (supposedly based on a saying in Buddhism I realized that I was watching a detective film so clever and absorbing that I had seen it for some time. Although his film has a dialogue, it is mainly so that the scenes of the film continue to advance, adherents to the plot. What kept me on the alert, even in seemingly banal scenes / sequences, is the emphasis on character movements or their behaviors. Melville has his story exposed, and he takes care to take his time to tell it (this may seem boring for some, but it seems to work, because it puts a little more emphasis on the weight of the characters / environments compared to 'plot) . <br /> <br /> Watch each of the four main actors: Alain Deleon in the role of Corey (who has just been released from prison, presages a new flight), Gian Maria Volonte in the role of Vogel (escape and leave handcuffed prison, meeting Corey by chance), Yves Montand in the role of Jansen (a seasoned professional with many years of experience in the field of weapons, friend of Vogel), and Andre Bourvil in the role of Mattei (a experienced investigator looking for Vogel) with his internal affairs). Each of these actors plays their role accurately, detachment and each has its own kind of moments that tell the public what their personalities could be as criminals and cops. The heist sequence gives small hints, for example, how does Vogel feel about a female statue crossing the hallways, or how Jansen pulls out a jar and smells the contents (and what a dream this guy creates). Even Corey's movements involving a photo of a woman are attracting interest. <br /> <br /> As the story becomes absorbing and cool, and the skills needed to make it happen (via director of photography Henri Decae, the editing and musical score of Eric Demarsan ), it is the people on the screen who gain the fascination to stay true to their nature and their ideals. Fans of the new French wave should not miss the film. Modern crime film lovers may want to take 140 minutes to immerse themselves in Melville's work atmosphere. A sweet film that is still part of my favorites.
