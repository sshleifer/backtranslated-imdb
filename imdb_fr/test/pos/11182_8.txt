Another fantastic offer from the Monkey Island team, and while it was a long time to survive and had to survive the departure of Ron Gilbert, it's another good buy. My only complaint is that its appearance was a little short compared to the previous two, although this may be due to a glorious lack of disk rotation. Drive on MI4.
