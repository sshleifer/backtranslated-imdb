If you do not like Italian horror, you will not like this movie. On this note ... <br /> <br /> "Overall ... it was a terrible experience ... A lot of things happened, it was planned that Vanessa Redgrave would be in the movie and she withdrew. One of the actors was crushed by a car, I was betrothed, but at the end of the photo it was over, my father died during the shootings ... all kinds of things. "-Dario Argento on the set "Opera" <br /> <br /> I was really impressed by Argento and the film he shot here - especially in such painful circumstances. All the mystique of "Macbeth" and his curse on those who try to mount the piece add new volumes to "Opera." Things. Christina, a young opera singer, is harassed by a violent psychopath who forces her to witness a series of brutal murders. By killing several sharp blades on Christina's eyelids, the killer forbids her to close her eyes: "Look, if you try to close your eyes, you will tear them, so you will have to look at everything." <br /> <br /> It is clear that Argento took great care to build on the screen the fake opera "Macbeth", and his hard work pays off. Add to that several brutally unforgettable murders, an extremely tense chase sequence and the awesome use of POV to portray a character (the role drawn by Vanessa Redgrave, thank god) and you get one of the best Italian horror movies created . <br /> <br /> That said, it's still the horror of Italy. Why Christina never seems to talk about these brutal killings to anyone beyond anyone's understanding. Some scenes may be difficult for some viewers, but personally, I felt more tension with Christina and her eyes than the brutal murders of the film. The finale of "Tenebrae" had hurt my stomach in "Opera", but it's probably just me. <br /> <br /> And the last five minutes ... Argento wanted it, he filmed it, and he fought to keep it in the movie. Absolutely nobody likes it, me included, but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the movie for me. It remains one of the best Argento films to date. <br /> <br /> 9/10
