Not all, but most of this story is that Buster is confused with "Dead Shot Dan", a notorious criminal. <br /> <br /> There is really no story, but just a series of adventures to show Buster's extraordinary physical talents and comic timing. The 27-minute film is essentially an adventure after another involving mainly a person chasing our hero. <br /> <br /> Earlier, it's two police officers parading in the streets after Keaton and later, it's "Big Joe" Roberts, a round cop - and a father, a girl, interests Buster - who pursues him. These last scenes were the best I thought, with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live. It was Keaton at its best. <br /> <br /> It's just a crazy half-hour that does not make sense, but you care? It's Buster at his best slapstick, or close to him, so he serves his purpose: to entertain us. Think about it: 85 years after the creation of this movie, there are people (like me) who are still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics! Cool!
