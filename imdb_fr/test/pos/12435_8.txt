This film is simply charming. It's funny like hell and as old as the hills. The acting is superb and it is fascinating to see post-war Britain and its behavior at the time. It seems to have been a prelude to the films of St. Trinians (given the connection between Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford - there is also a very young George Cole who appeared in many films of St. Trinians) but I do not understand myself. the connection. It has been shown on BBC4 recently after a biography of St. Trinians' creator, Ronald Searle. However, I missed enough biography to miss the link with this movie. Anyway, a great movie in its own right and something that should be preserved forever!
