I do not care what some critics said, this movie was funny. The problem with this film is that you can not expect anything other than entertainment. It's not an intellectual comedy, it's a smart popcorn movie. The three main actors are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is an outstanding actor in the supporting cast, as a former TV officer, brought by the character of Russo to guide the police on how to become "television cops". These are by far the funniest scenes. If you want to have fun and sit back and laugh, then watch this movie.
