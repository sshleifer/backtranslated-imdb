It was easy to dismiss this film as a hyperbole at the time of its release. Fonda, Douglas and Lemmon were known as "leftists", but the Three Mle Island accident provided a shocking context for this fictional drama. <br /> <br /> This film works on many levels, taking pictures of both public services and television. . 1979 was the zenith of the famous "Happy Talk" television news format (see also "Ron Burgundy") and is displayed here in all its splendor. The sonic anchor sadly reads the story of a "frontal collision" before enthusiastically presenting Kimberley Wells (Fonda), telling the story of a veterinarian who makes house calls (or aquarium?). The producer of the series and the director of the station argue in bottom of content - or lack of content - <br /> <br /> There are some technical errors. The public relations campaign (James Hampton) shows Fonda and Douglas the scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant built by Westinghouse. Later, while Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (who play nicely a friend / colleague of Lemmon, caught between duty and loyalty) fight a sudden crisis in the control room of the plant, they obviously manage a boiling water plant (constructed by GE.) A small, but curious, point in view of the number of details that the writers have obtained. <br /> <br /> Like any good drama, the film asks more questions than answers. The accident in the real world at TMI proves the basic principle of the film. The working title of the movie was originally "Power", and you'll see why. As the nuclear industry prepares to make a big comeback in this $ 3 gas period, "China's Syndrome" is as relevant today as it was more than 25 years ago.
