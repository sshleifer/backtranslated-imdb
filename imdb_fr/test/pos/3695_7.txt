Without going into the details of a good ... if it is a somewhat provocative TV film, there seems to be a consensus among users to say that there is "no one to blame here". <br /> <br /> I disagree. Yes, the young lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes can be young and excited (and beautiful) because he does not get as much as he wants from his mother, that does not mean that he can climb in bed and have sex with her daughter. OK, he can use the excuse that he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I do not buy it. People must take responsibility for their actions. Not only did he "cross the line" while sleeping with a very vulnerable teenager, when he was supposed to be "the responsible adult," he added, "Your mother should never be aware of that." How responsible was he? Yes, it's a good movie, but he had what was waiting for him. Do not be fooled that what happened was "no one's fault".
