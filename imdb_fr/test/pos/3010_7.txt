This one started very well. Photography and audio are the best I've seen in years (okay, months). The use of "hot" and "cold" colors in unique sequences is particularly amazing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whispers most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that. <br /> <br /> Now, let's go to the disadvantages. The scenario was awful. Lopez's share proved irrelevant or totally worthless for the plot. She seemed to be shooting the movie only to sell and sell the photo. The three beds seemed too obvious. The infant's baptism Carl was a psychologically overemphasized way of embodying the motive for which Carl "worked". And so on .. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie had a great way of showing where Singh was coming from. Why do the most talented directors seem to emerge from India today?
