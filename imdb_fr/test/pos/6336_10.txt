This episode of Buffy was one of my personal favorites. Also number three of Joss's personal favorites too. The episode had very little dialogue and despite the fact that people at Emmy's decided they deserved an appointment. Unfortunately, it did not win. When Hush was first created, it drew about 6 million viewers, which was the highest rated episode of season four. That should tell you something. Although there was very little discussion, he managed to intrigue enough people to listen. These characters (who played my mimes) were some of the most frightening creatures the series has produced (or any network TV show I've seen). Nothing is more frightening than a group of money men coming to you with a scalpel while smiling. I think that despite the lack of dialogue, the actors did a fantastic job on the episode.
