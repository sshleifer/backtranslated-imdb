I watched this film on a stroke of luck. I was standing on 42nd Street, waiting for a bus to get home and a sister started distributing free tickets for a preview of this film. I gave a chance not to wait too long. I saw on the walls of the subway station does not do justice to this movie. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a young rocker who goes on a trip to learn the craft and art of heavy metal.I go The film is a comedy thick and fun.If you are enough old to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the eighties, you will love this movie. Jack Black is a comedian and comedian assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this movie he is also a talented musician. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D is definitely worth it!
