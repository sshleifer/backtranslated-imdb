Every episode I saw when I was an innocent child was stupid. There were funny puppets called "The Mitts" who were still discussing things from childhood. They were playing this song before "The Mitts", a part of the show that reads like this: "Let's join the Mitts ..." There was a Groucho Marx puppet who was saying jokes. Before the session, this man was singing "Hot Fudge! Right On!" There was a green puppet with teeth called Seymore. We would always see more of Seymore. He made jokes and sang every episode. There was always a moral in every episode. An episode, a man sang "Liars are losers!" Another episode he sang about sharing and benevolence. Seymore told me to talk about these two little girls "Sharon and Karen". Hot Fudge Holey Moley party has this man doing strange things and they played strange music.
