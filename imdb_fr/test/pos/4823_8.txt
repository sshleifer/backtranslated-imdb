Honestly, I found that Wicked Little Things was a very cool and fun horror movie. My friend gave me this, and I really only saw it as a horrible horror movie of bad class. Then I was very cool and very good and although Ill say it seemed a little useless sometimes, and although it may not be the best horror film of all time, it's still good I found the game very good very credible and for me very nice). And although it is a bit clich√© and above, it's good. Overall, I must say that if Afterdark Horror Fest movies are not your style, then you should only love horror movies, or a little naughty time than to check out Wicked Little Things. 8.0 out of 10 stars
