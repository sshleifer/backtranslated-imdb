Some aspects of Punishment Park are not perfect, especially some of the actors. However, I think this is probably the most important film of the era of the "war on terror". I grew up hating hippies and, in some ways, I still do it. It was only when the United States embarked on the path of an unnecessary and misleading war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is a little dated, watching it brings to the surface these uncomfortable emotions about our current situation. It is clear early in the film that Punishment Park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the "un-patriotic" elements of American society. It is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is credible. I sometimes think that the United States could easily slip into fascism. Watching this film, I could only think of the way I heard similar sentiments from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost every day. This film is a crude and concentrated synthesis of the PRESENT political scene of the United States. I am both impressed and saddened by the fact that something as relevant (and yes, accurate) was filmed more than 30 years ago. If you take a more moderate view of the film and decide to believe it could not happen here, take a closer look at Guantanamo Bay, some of our "enemy fighters", the secret CIA prisons and the many similar incidents in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1979 (8 full years AFTER the making of this film).
