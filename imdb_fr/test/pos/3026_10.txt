"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a vertiginous journey in the vast spirit of a serial killer, but also in that of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings release their imagination unhindered. It's daring at work, dismissing thoughts into formulas and clich√©s, and creating something truly magnificent. It's the best movie of the year so far. <br /> <br /> I have read many complaints about this film, whether it's about any style or substance, poorly cast characters and bad actors. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the mark. This film can be a landmark, a tradition where future films will follow, hopefully. "The Cell" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So, can we slam the door in our faces and tell Tarsem Singh, his manager, that we do not want any more? Personally, I would like more than another Tarsem film and I would love to see someone try to challenge him. <br /> <br /> We have all heard of the possibility of going into the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the "kind" is a little overloaded. The '90s were full of movies trying to describe what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But "The Cell" does not follow the same path, we have a new twist, we are physically transported in the spirit and suffer nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject ever studied. <br /> <I like the fact that the film does not take away scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez manages to penetrate the brain of another. Instead, she lies down on a lab table and is wrapped in what looks like very long Twizzlers and disappears into another entity. "The Cell" wants to let you "see" what it is and not "how," and I guess that's what some people do not like. It's true that I like explanations with my films, but when a film ventures onto a new field, you have to let it do what it wants and just take it into account. <br /> <br /> I noticed how very dark the film was showing reality, perhaps to contrast brilliant visuals when in the brain of another. Nevertheless, the scenography was simply amazing. I would not be surprised if this film won some Oscars in the cinematography, the best costumes, the best director, etc. If it were up to me, he would at least be nominated for the best image. <br /> <br /> I noticed that I was sort of repeating myself. Not because there is nothing else to say, but because I can not stress enough how fantastic I was "The Cell". If you enter the film with a very open mind and you take it with wonders and an amazing treat, you're sure to have a good time. I guess this movie was a bit too much for some people, calling it "weird" or "crazy". I love the psychology and imagination of the human spirit. It was so deep inside me. When I left the theater, I heard a member of the audience say, "Anyone who has made this film has surely done a lot of good drugs." If so, I want what he smoked. <br /> <br /> **** (out of 4)
