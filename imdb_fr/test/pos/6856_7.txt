"Anatomy" is certainly one of the best films I've seen. I do not think that "Anatomy" was above all a horror film but a film that challenged the ethics of science. If you look at it with that in mind, it becomes a very good movie. The only drawback was the awful voice doubling the English version. How can you expect a non-German person to listen to these unbearable German accents for two hours? Let the English speakers speak or use subtitles instead!
