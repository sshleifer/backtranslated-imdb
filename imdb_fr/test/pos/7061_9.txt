Seeing this film always reminds me of what I remember about summer, God! so long ago. The entire scene involving the "night" of the canoe procession at the end of the trip is invaluable, and Tripper's story about the murderous maniac is an urban legend that dates back to my youth. A very entertaining film, made several times better by the terrible consequences that followed.
