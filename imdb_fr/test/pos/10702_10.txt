Canadian filmmaker Ron Switzer delivers a flawless horror film with the awesome science fiction movie of 1991, "Science Crazed". A hideous monster is taking revenge on his mother, a police officer and tenants in an apartment building. Brilliant practical makeups and special effects create a truly terrifying monster, especially when you hide through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the apartments' sumptuous sets. The characters are beautifully developed with remarkable performances and surprisingly touching from a group. Produced by Donna Switzer, the newcomer, Ron Switzer, also wrote the script for the film, creating a roller coaster of twists, turns and terror that will let you guess at the last frame. Science Crazed will no doubt leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended!
