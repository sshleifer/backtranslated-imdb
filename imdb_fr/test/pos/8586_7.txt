It is always good to see a film that tells us about history in Africa, because they are really too few. However, the film portrays Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be identical to the former colonialist ... man. There was too little content, explaining how the man had managed to rise, and the whole context of Belgium "letting them go". It is certainly worth noting that the acting and photography are excellent, especially Mobutu himself. I would have simply liked a better political analysis.
