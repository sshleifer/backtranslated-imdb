This show was amazing, but too esoteric for most people. If you had never really seen a European variety show in the 70s or 80s (or at least a Mexican show), the whole show would probably be lost for you. If you had, this show was a dead satire of the fictional and shallow show in which these shows plunge at worst. "Viva Variety" is a variety show that tries to take off every episode, but always in the heat of the moment. and the acts went very badly. The hosts are joined by "Johnny Bluejeans", a light kick that seems to have been named because blue jeans are a very popular product in his country and that means kids will love him. . <br /> <br /> The result has been a hilarious parody of variety shows in general. Imagine the arguments that probably took place in the last days of the "Sonny & Cher Show". Now imagine that this is happening in front of you and that the stars are trying to keep calm. Now add cheese deeds and a Euro-rich mentality (tuxedos, dresses, alcoholic beverages, accents and cigarettes). You now have "Viva Variety". <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard a musician whose music was written for other musicians? Too conceptual? Viva Variety did it for the actors. Way too esoteric for the standard American public. It was very funny. And condemned.
