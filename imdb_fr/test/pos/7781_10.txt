This is my favorite love story. It contains all the elements that a good love story should have. Poetry, jazz, friendships the ups and downs of a relationship. Finally a film that shows the positive aspects of the black community. Larenz Tate was great. I can not imagine anyone else playing the role of Darius. He recited this poem as if he had written it himself and wanted to say every word. I own this film and if I had time to watch it every day, I would always feel better and that's what a good movie should do. In addition, the character of Savon could not have better deal with the subject of marriage. We would all like to find a Darius, but most of us just watch this movie. My vote is 10/10
