One of Warner Brothers' most profitable and profitable films in the 1930s was this charming family drama telling the story of a widower living with his sister, his daughter, who raised Four Daughters. But not four type girls every day. All were trained by their instrument musician father and one as a singer. They make beautiful music together even if it's for the long-haired decor. <br /> <br /> You can watch the infinite variety of roles played by Claude Rains over the years and marvel at the fact that he shows you yet another aspect. of his creative personality. The opportunist captain of Vichy in Casablanca is as different as the mad scientist in Invisible Man, as the patient and wise Job in Mr. Skeffington. All the same man and all so incredibly different. <br /> <br /> Here he raises the four girls with love, seasoned with a little discontent with their willingness to accept modern music. The Lane Sisters and Gale Page may be familiar with Beethoven, but they are also cat-cats and they can beat daddy eight at the bar each time. And if Rains becomes a little too irritable that his aunt May Robson can put it in his place. <br /> <br /> With Four Daughters, single at the time, you know that will change. All sisters develop romantic interests with Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Of course, the process of mating becomes a little complicated and one of the sisters is tragically affected, but she promises to work well at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Four Daughters is also known as John Garfield's first film. Apart from a small role in Footlight Parade years earlier, Garfield had no other role in the film. But he had been acclaimed on the New York scene for his performance in Golden Boy and Warner Brothers had signed it and had found the perfect role for a film debut as a cynical musician who just can not get himself a place decent in life. This earned him a nomination for best supporting role in 1938, but he lost to Walter Brennan for Kentucky. <br /> <br /> This film was so popular that it virtually generated a small cottage industry for Jack Warner. Suites with cast members such as Courageous Girls, Four Mothers, Four Women were all cleaned at the box office before the Second World War. And Warner Brothers does it again with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day playing roles that John Garfield and Priscilla Lane are behind. Now these two have made beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Another timeless mold was created in Four Daughters and the film lasts 70 years after its first appearance.
