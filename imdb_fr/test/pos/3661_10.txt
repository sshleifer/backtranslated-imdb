I was very lucky to see the movie Hari Om at the Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and it was such a delicious movie. It has been beautifully shot in India and I want to go now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely amazing. He was the highlight of the film. Apparently, he was also in the movie ... The wedding at the monsoon He was the star of the show. The character of Benoit made me crack ... it was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great! There were many extraordinary scenes like the one with the monkeys. And basically, I just loved the movie. Everyone who came out was delighted about it and it was certainly a highlight of the film festival. Was my favorite of the festival. He has really beautifully captured the liveliness of India and can not believe how beautiful India is. The feeling of going out of the cinema was really terrible. It's a delicious and happy film. I liked it!!
