I notice that high enough just because of Sam Elliott. I could have done without feminine nudity, but I would settle for almost anything to see Sam strutting. He manages to emit wonderfully cynical words of wit, with which I agree, and it is a pleasure to see him play a role in which he manages to emotivate instead of just scowling and manly. My boyfriend was of the opinion that this film was in many ways similar to a film in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the policeman's sense of the word!) Which was a little too demanding to prove himself. You can draw your own conclusions, but if you like Sam, you will like this. You could say that I am biased, but who is not? I would buy this on DVD in the blink of an eye!
