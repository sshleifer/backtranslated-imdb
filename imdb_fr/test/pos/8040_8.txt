It worked! Director Christian Duguay has created a very clever action / spy thriller. Actors Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn gave an excellent performance. What a shame we can not see Aidan Quinn in other movies like this one so far. He was simply the best in the role of Ramirez / Carlos for what he should have earned the Oscar. The picture was very beautiful. The scenes are fast from beginning to end and the story does not leave you a chance to get bored. The film is too underrated and I recommend it to anyone else, otherwise you will miss something big. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. That's why I give it 9/10.
