Rush in Rio is simply an incredible DVD. This concert is one of the highlights of Rush's story and they deliver their music with brilliance and with more power than ever. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to be really in this concert, and not only that, I was in the first row seizing the portal that separated the audience from the stage! This is the first and only time I see a live Rush concert and it's a dream come true for me. I do not have words to describe this experience with precision, but I can tell you that this is one of the highlights of my life. <br /> <br /> Some people complain about the sound of this DVD, claiming that it is neither very clear nor polite, but the sound you are listening to is real, true to what it was in the concert . It is raw, powerful and so authentic that every time I look at it, I go back to live this beautiful moment. Many artists record live programs and then they fine-tune their work. The end product is therefore far from what the concert really was. Of course, you can get a very sophisticated and polished sound that way, but you do not get the real thing. This is not the case with Rush in Rio, it's the real deal! I admit that I enjoy these DVDs in concert with refined sounds. I like music and sound is a very important aspect, but it's refreshing to listen to such an honest concert. You listen to Rush just as they sound in a live performance, no stuff, no tweaks. It's a real live concert DVD. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Rush in Rio, the set-list is fantastic and the performances of Geddy, Alex and Neil are breathtaking. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love Rush and sing to every song, even YYZ which is an instrumental !! I seem to be singing twice; in Tom Sawyer, I sing "always full of hope but dissatisfaction" and in Earthshine, I sing "just reflects". It's just a few seconds, but I just could not believe my eyes when I saw myself in a rush DVD! Impressive!! I hope you enjoy this wonderful concert of the largest group on Earth.
