This movie is all about entertainment. Imagine your friends with whom you love spending time, those you know about to become a little ridiculous and who maybe take a character or two. That's what this movie is about. An inventive and brilliantly interpreted scenario. It is not a question of pleasing the masses with this one, but of having fun with a group of people with brilliant talents. That's what I'm sure they all thought when they registered. <br /> <br /> The above review seems totally unfair and I think the person who wrote this was in a bad state of mind when they watched the movie. In a happy moment, there is a great dignity if you want to look. <br /> <br /> A job well done, I thought it was a good movie. I would look at this before the North American standard, whatever the day. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is not the best movie you can see, but it contains many moments. I did not laugh so long in an age.
