I loved this show. In fact, I used to leave the pub ten minutes before closing and run along the road to catch it. I remember Daniel Peacock's sketch of Gandhi in the newsagents as a masterpiece. The scenography and lighting were extraordinary, creating an atmosphere in which you felt that you were really living. V unusual for a comedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I only met one person (except the other reviewer here) who never knew this program existed. In fact, I have to thank the IMDb for being born and for proving that I had not actually imagined the series as a whole, that I was seriously beginning to believe!
