Following the last episode of the previous series Yes Minister. <br /> <br /> Jim Hacker is now at No. 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister of Great Britain, instead of cabinet minister and member of the government, he now heads His Majesty's Government. <br /> <br /> All this after some complicated maneuvers by Sir Humphrey Appleby after the resignation of the previous Prime Minister at the end of Yes Minister. <br /> <br /> Sir Humphrey Appleby is now the head of the public service. <br /> <br /> I thought that this series was better than the first series, or that it did not last as long as the first series unfortunately.
