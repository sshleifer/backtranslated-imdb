This film has everything. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy and excellent writing and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. I have seen this movie many times and I enjoy it more each time. He does not grow old, he is constantly entertaining and stimulating. It's definitely the best role of Burt Reynolds, and he's doing a great job. John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle also give great comic performances. There is no weak element in this film.
