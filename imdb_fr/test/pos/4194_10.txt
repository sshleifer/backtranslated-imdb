I must admit that I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film and after about 5 to 10 minutes, I felt like many others. I was expecting a Monkey movie similar to the TV show, but I was given instead ... well, I did not know what I had been given to be honest. <br /> <br /> However, after finally watching In this film, I realized that I had not only the closed mind in front of the brilliant he represents, but that I also found myself watching him again and even. This is the film that keeps getting interested me, simply because it keeps me on the alert as I try to decipher its meanings. And just when I think I've found something in the movie, his answer is destroyed once I watch the movie again. Brilliance indeed. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people who did not like this movie want to watch a movie with a clear plot in the first place. They want to explain everything and answer all the questions of the final. Sorry, if that's what you want, this movie is not for you. But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better still, their sequels), I think you'll enjoy the exciting and disconcerting experience this movie will give you. <br /> <br /> Think of the movie that looks like a dream. . In our dreams, things do not make sense, the things we expect do not happen, places and people do not talk, act and function the way they actually do . Complaining about "Head" is like complaining about a dream that you thought was impossible to understand. The mind is a complex system, and since a film titled "Head" is just as complex, is it so difficult to connect the two? <br /> <br /> The music (and the musical numbers) really stand out, especially Peter Tork's two compositions, which remain the best tracks of the movie, "Can You Dig It?" and "Long Title: Do I have to do it all again?" <br /> <br /> This film proves that the Monkees were much more than four zanny guys in a "prefabricated" group (as critics called in a TV show, but that they are actually much smarter and The film may contain so many messages, both about the Monkeys and the "entertainment industry" in general, that it is a masterpiece of the achievement of a film that was way ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> I think that if this film had been released as an independent piece at this stage, it would garner the respect and admiration it deserves. <br /> <br /> And a final note: <br /> <br /> That could be compared to the Beatles' Beatical Mystery Tour, because the Beatles movie seemed just as weird and weird. Notice, "Head" is way above all the Beatles put on celluloid.
