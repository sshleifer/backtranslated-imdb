Since Jason and his acolytes took over horror movies around 1980, almost every horror movie involved a group of teenagers with chopped hormonal loads, with a focus on cutting rather than suspense. . <br /> <br /> This little film is different. Made in the early 80s, it does what every good horror movie should do: bring your worst fears to life while you sit, knowing that these horrors are upon us. Then you simmer these horrors, but do not make a lesson on the biology of butchery. <br /> <br /> The story tells Meg Tilly just before she knows an ephemeral turning point with the celebrity "The Big Chill", then fell back into obscurity in the early 90s. Meg plays an excluded teenager who is dying to get into the good graces of some nasty classic girls. They tell her that she can be part of their small group if she spends the night in a crypt. The wicked girls intend to scare her away from the crypt, giving them a double reward: to continue to torment the excluded girl and give her an excuse to reject her. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the famous occultist Karl Rhamarevich died bizarre death shortly after claiming to have discovered a way to return from the grave and, on his return, command great magical powers. Her daughter does not believe it at first, but she listens to a tape about her father's experiences, including her successful animation of small dead animals and her plan to come out of the grave with the power to animate bigger game and get more out of these animations. She also learns that she may have inherited her father's power and may be the only person who can stop her if she really needs to be raised from the dead. I think you know where this story is headed, so I'll stop here. Did I mention that the magician was buried in the same crypt in which the character of Meg Tilly spends the night? <br /> <br /> I will mention that the commercial DVD containing this film has a somewhat degraded aspect compared to what you expect from you. a movie that was made so recently. I saw it on television in the mid-1980s and I remember it looked better than that. The problem is that the film's original negative has never been located and so the DVD had to be created from an impression. This means that it is a dirt and scratches. <br /> <br /> This is worth checking out by any horror fan. It was an independent film and an example of the kind of unusual things that we could often find on TV until the end of the evening, until the infomercial turns this niche into a huge desert in 1986 Only TCM Underground broadcasts this type of film.
