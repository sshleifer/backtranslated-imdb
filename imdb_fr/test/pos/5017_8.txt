What causes such opposite reactions in some films? <br /> <br /> Some people here have described the High Roller as "disgusting". Some have called it "extraordinary" (as I would in fact). <br /> <br /> Why? I think it's because films like this do not make foes heroes, nor the glamor of degeneration, and some people simply can not deal with it emotionally. They need a hero. And I would also add that if they are players or poker players, they could feel betrayed personally when their existence is not justified. <br /> <br /> High Roller in NOT a poker movie. It's a PEOPLE movie. It's not perfect, but it looks good, it's well written and it's wonderfully well done. And above all, it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection. <br /> <br /> And that may be what makes some people so crazy.
