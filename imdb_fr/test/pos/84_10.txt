A very good movie, centered on a very important question. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a very serious congenital malformation that can be totally avoided. If more families saw this movie, maybe more kids would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits plays in one of his best roles. This is an excellent film that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is reminiscent of the thousands of families that exist today in the United States. There are children struggling with this world. The really important point here is that everything could have been avoided. More people should see this movie and take seriously what it has to say. It is well done, with important messages, treated with elegance.
