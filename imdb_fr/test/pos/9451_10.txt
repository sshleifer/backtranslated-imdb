It was a fantastically written scenario when it came to perceiving things from another angle. The comedy was timely and not exaggerated, the acting was usually fantastic and the plot was intended to generate a misconception when we think of people solely by their outward appearance. The plot changes as the brother / sister character of Amanda Bynes tries to play football with the men's team in search of a new love interest. It is to Tatum Channing that lies the true misperception and that he does an excellent selfless work at first, before realizing that the most important thing in life is friendship and not attitude.
