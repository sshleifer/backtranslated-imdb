This is a typical film by Sandra Bullock in which she plays a smiling (but profane) woman who has problems but who finds a way to survive and be the hero. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> There are many holes in this story. Things do not add up and the suspense is a little tacky. But - this suspense is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story that is marked by strong paranoia. The story begins slowly but starts quickly and the rest, making it a captivating film for the viewer. That's why I give it a pretty good rating: the film commits you to it. Bullock is cuter than boring, which is normal for me, so it's my best rated movie with her.
