Watched Uzumaki last night and immediately recalled two first Australian films by Peter Weir, The Last Wave and Picnic At Hanging Rock. They were full of atmosphere but short of horror. Uzumaki, for me, seems clearly influenced by these films. There are a number of relatively mundane scenes that get bigger and bigger as the movie sucks you. There are also more outrageous horror scenes and although I do not think the film is up to these two movies, it's well worth the time of the most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily the 'horror). 7 out of 10 seem fair, but I must say that years after watching The Last Wave, the film always stays with me, and it is precisely the unresolved end of Picnic At Hanging Rock that makes it so haunting. p.s. All critics of acting ... pullleasse ... in this genre?
