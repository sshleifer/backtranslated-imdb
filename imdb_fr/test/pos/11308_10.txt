This parody is cleverly realized: songs (Express Yourself becomes Expose, as a prayer is now the party in my pants and Vogue is now vague) to the fake interviews of the cast, this film is hilarious. Do you remember that Madonna had not heard about the rainy season in Asia? In this one, she does not know the season of the volcanoes. It is a precious jewel. They have a lot of money on this parody, and it's worth it. Highly recommended !!!
