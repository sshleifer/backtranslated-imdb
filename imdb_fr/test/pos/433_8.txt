Longtime admirer of the 2001 film "Moulin Rouge" and more recent filming of Jean Renoir, I knew that I would inevitably watch his "French Cancan" sooner or later. The film tells a fictional story of the opening of the discotheque Moulin Rouge. The impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to make the laundress Montmartre Nini (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) a star of the cancan, without arousing the anger of his mistress stormy, the belly dancer Lola (Maria Felix). This is one of the many love triangles of "French Cancan" - true to the stereotype, these French showbiz people are always falling in love. <br /> <br /> Renoir directs with his gentle humor and special attention to the main characters, and also writes the lyrics of a beautiful waltz song prominently in the film. Gabin perfectly embodies the aging French playboy. Arnoul is a cute redhead who does well in dance numbers, with the exception of a few trick shots where a double is obviously used. <br /> <br /> "French Cancan" is presented as a musical and as long as there are many music numbers that take place on the stage of the club, etc., only one character, Casimir, begins to sing in the middle of a conversation. The actor who plays it, Philippe Clay, is fun to watch - a very tall, skinny young man who sings, dances and writhes. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a long sequence of gossip, as the characters learn to triumph over their problems and to make art together. The dance is much more enlightened and modified in a coherent way than in "Moulin Rouge"; In fact, if I complain about "French Cancan", it's that everything is a bit too technicolor. Even when Nini has grief or someone is singing a melancholic song, the lighting is bright and flat, no shadows are introduced. Yes, the result is a cheerful and warm musical; it's just that I can not help thinking that things were never so colorful and innocent in real life.
