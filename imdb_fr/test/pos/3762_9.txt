In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I heard it was "The Greeks do not get francs". Is it correct? I really liked this sound. I also liked "Hyde has nothing to hide" in the final scenes. Really a dope movie, but with lots of laughs and puns, visual gags and slapstick. Ms. Woo-Woo's home recalled some of the places I visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in other truly amazing works. She looks very different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity did not hurt her. Mark Blankfield reminds Gene Wilder in some ways. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.
