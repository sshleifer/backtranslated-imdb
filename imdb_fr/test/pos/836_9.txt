Since a few days, I am really addicted to the series "Female Scorpion" and I continue to hit the head because I have waited until now ?? which is way too long ?? before buying the whole box. "Beast Stable" is the third brilliant effort in a row, and the undeniable main asset of this series is the way writers have always proposed something completely new and different for each article. Never before nor after, no series of exploitation has offered so much variety in terms of scripts, sets, themes and styles of filming. The original is more or less qualified film called "Women in prison" (but already atypical), but you can not categorize parts 2 and 3 as such, because they contain virtually no sequences in the enclosure from the prison. . And the tone and overall mood keep changing with each new episode. The first film was hard and grainy, while the second was psychedelic and the third part is mostly melodramatic. Do not let this last description discourage you, however, because "Beast Stable" still contains enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage despite the dramatic mood. The opening sequence, for example, is downright fantastic. Sasori, still on the run, is literally spawning her way to freedom on the subway when there is no other option than to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman who handcuffed her. His run through the city with the cut arm hanging on his while the credits appear on the screen, accompanied by the usual musical theme, is pure and true exploitation! The story continues convincingly as our heroine desperately tries to lead an anonymous life in the big city, but the poor thing just can not escape its past, or even new types of agony. Sasori befriends a prostitute, but without exchange of dialogue, and works in a sewing workshop. His own belated brother (!) Imbues the prostitute, while Sasori grapples with the local network of pimps and pimps. It cleverly prevents a thug from profiting from his body, meets a former enemy in prison and furiously avenge one of the prostitutes when subjected to a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile, the one-armed cop continues obsessively roaming the streets, seeking revenge on Sasori. Our multi-talented director, Shunya Ito, travels a great deal through these stories to become a mighty powerhouse and never loses control over visual aspects or ingenious filming style. "Beast Stable" presents some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine, the editing is impeccable and the outdoor locations are really depressing. Those who know the character of Sasori a little know that the film is sorely lacking memorable dialogues, but this is still largely offset by the wonderful charisma of Meiko Kaji on the screen and its threatening grimaces. There is very little sleaze, apart from the aforementioned incestuous subplot, but the brief bursts of extreme violence are terrible and the twisted end is almost too bright for the words. In fact, I think the third part might be the biggest (or at least my favorite) of the series so far. My only point of criticism that is totally irrelevant is the ridiculous sounds that one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked in a cage. This bird looks like a ventriloquist manikin with stomach cramps.
