This film was made with a relatively small budget (10 to 20 million dollars?) And almost no promotion from its distributors. I knew it only because I'm a long-time fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme and I always watch his latest films in the hope that they will be at least viewable and apart from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command ), they are . This film has a conspiracy quite easy to follow and Van Damme gives a good humorous performance, but the film owes all its credit to the scenes of combat involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the last set. The editing and the camera for most of the film are quite terrible, but Isaac Florentine can certainly film a good fight scene. I am also happy that Van Damme has done better lately (In Hell, Awakening of Death, Until Death) but with the good acting, the martial arts have become less important. In the shepherd, Van Damme proves that he still has it.
