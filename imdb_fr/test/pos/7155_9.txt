In this story of a very hurt Christian family of which three of its four members are "born again" after a car accident caused by a cake, which is really striking, is how much of them most are well anchored, where there is so much potential up, and how really inspired most of the actors is. Where most of the film's moments, especially its frank and "innocent" discussions about sexuality after the guilt and shame of three of the four family members, are hilarious, it also makes you think and the characters stay with you. <Br /> <br /> How often, for example, does a character in a comedy change from a caricature to a full-bodied emotional being during a scene? How often do we see a casting that can emerge from an inflamed phrase to show a little humanity under the skin of the character? Even many "bad guys" in this film have moments of heartbreaking honesty, though much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrible. There is a truth and a story behind the most questionable acts of this film, which is a difficult task in a satire. <br /> <br /> How refreshing to see a dark comedy that can dare to be humanistic. What a pleasure to see actors so deeply attached to the character that they can dare to leave them ridiculous and sublime. <br /> <br /> And as a homosexual, I do not think I was as touched by a heterosexual sex scene as I was by the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accident. <br /> <br /> Bravo. Bravo. One of my favorites at the Outfest this year.
