I received it the other day from the Creators on DVD. I saw this ad in a free magazine while the family was stopping at a hotel and had never heard of it. After reading the film, it was filmed on the beach of Balmedie, I only had to buy it. I used to take the kids to the dunes of the movie all the time when I lived in Aberdeen. <br /> <br /> 1st time, I'm not a big fan of science fiction (except Star Wars). what they did with this filming location, I was surprised. It did not turn out to be a standard science fiction, but rather a mix of sci-fi and horror of survival. <br /> <br /> A good, different story has had a special effect on the budget. that it was produced with Â£ 8000. Playing was better than average for a low-budget movie. The way they altered the entire coastline to give the impression that the arid desert planet they were on was nice. <br /> <br /> The film's weapons were realistic and the creatures were cool, much like invisible predators. . <br /> <br /> All in all, I will buy all future versions of these guys, maybe a complete horror (Hint Hint). The extras on the DVD were very instructive on how to give the background to the producers. I would like to see some of their short films included as extras in a future DVD. <br /> <br /> Great job, keep it up.
