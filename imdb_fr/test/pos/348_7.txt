What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson movie? Are they expecting a classic cinema that exceeds expectations and will leave them with lasting memories? One might think so by some of the critics. Al Adamson's movies are trashy, shabby and tacky, so be aware that this already helps and they do not have to be taken for cash, especially when they have such unintentional entertainment value. First, it starts with extracting the final theme of Outer Limits, so you know things are promising. This is the story of a wacko cult that lives in the hills and tries to lift a lifeless body, the leader suffers a heart attack and then ends up in the hospital. Of course, Nurse Sherri takes care of her needs and everything else, and when an operation is necessary, she stays in the operating room when the guy passes, his mind invading. And the nurse Sherri starts to change. No longer the kind nurse, she develops the taste of blood and sharp objects. There are some minor stories happening, such as people trying to burn the body of the deceased cult leader and a blind football star who became the object of love of one of Sherri's colleagues who also comes from to embark on voodoo. It's not bad if you're a cult cinephile, but it can be bad if you're a fan of "Spiderman" because you will not like it. Sometimes it's really in the sense of "respectability" (for Adamson, anyway), but then, "that's not unanimous: it's a ridiculous event, if you like Adamson's movies and other similar garbage, you can love them, for all those who are looking for a lost treasure, keep digging 7 out of 10.
