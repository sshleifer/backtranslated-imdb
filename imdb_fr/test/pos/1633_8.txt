Where Da Vinci's code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his ability to solve puzzles, Angels and Demons drove the show up with a huge eight-hour puzzle. <br /> <br /> With a cast of award-winning actors Ron Howard does a good job of making a story easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code has thrown so many angles into you in such a short time that a brief break in the bathroom would leave you a little confused when you return. I did not think it was with Angels and Demons, the plot was simple and the action maintained a high level of interest. <br /> <br /> Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was by far my favorite character in the film. He described very well the elitist but misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church. Combined with the victim of his treatment, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself right after its introduction. Tom Hanks did not spend a lot of time since the film is more about story than character development, which worked well, I had enough background to the first movie. <br /> Unfortunately, I found the character of Ayelet Zurer, Vittoria Vetra, a useless assistant in the quest, because her lines were a bit limited and seemed more like an afterthought. She played a key role in the early stages, but soon lost the feeling of being "familiar" with Langdon, rather than a necessary partner. <br /> <br /> The plot is as such, one of the organizations. that the Catholic Church has wronged in the past (there have been many) has sought revenge in the most artistic way possible. Some men in the church are kidnapped and must be executed at specific times, waiting for the ultimate end of the church. Dr. Robert Landon is invited to decipher the clues and team up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed the death of a colleague in the hands of the church's enemy. <br /> <br /> The music remains relevant and the cinematography It's beautiful, I could talk about these mediocre things, but what makes absolutely work Angels and Demons, it is its conclusion. It was by far one of the most astonishingly surprising endings I saw in a movie and I was impressed to see how much I was off guard when it struck me. Like everyone else, I appreciate a good summary and this film finishes well and drops a pretty bow. Needless to say, I came out of the cinema happy to see the film in its entirety. <br /> <br /> If you are religious and do not know if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that, where the DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a group of sadists hiding concealment, angels and demons paint them with a much lighter brush. The church is portrayed as a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and wandering men who wore their colors and even some who have infiltrated their modern ranks.
