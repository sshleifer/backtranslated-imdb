It's a shame that this film was not played in theaters anymore. It's a rich, textured love affair with believable characters who are too human, too busy playing and protecting their hearts to recognize The Real Thing when they experience it. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is its setting in Chicago, among trendy, artistic, literate and middle-class African Americans who discuss poetry, music and literature. Another is his royal title, Larenz Tate - and if you're even a half-fan of him, you'll NEED to see this movie! His humor and vulnerability are perfect for the role of Darius. Nia Long also shines in the role of Nina, who wishes to tell Darius that she loves him but fears the breaking "rules". A good movie to watch coiled on the couch with your darling!
