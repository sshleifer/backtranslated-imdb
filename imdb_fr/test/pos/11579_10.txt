One of my friends asked, "Should not we be pro-euthanasia to love this movie?" Is it a mistake of the film to infer that most quadriplegics want to end their lives? Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> As far as I know (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegic who wanted to end his life in The Sea Inside. Think that Ramón Sampedro also addressed this topic in the film. He wants to die. It is he who fights for the right to decide his death. He speaks for himself and not for other quadriplegics. Although his pioneering work, according to his point of view, may be beneficial or damaging to quadriplegics, his main goal is his personal goal. But what this film does (in my opinion anyway) is that it forces viewers to ask the inferred questions that my friend has so succinctly asked. <br /> <br /> After my first reading of The Sea Inside, I came home in a conflicting blur. I had a hard time reconciling myself with this infuriating notion; why would Ramón want to die? Given the love, care and sacrifices that Ramón constantly assaulted by the people around him, why did he stubbornly cling to his hurtful decision? Then, during my second visit, a thought shared between Ramón and the lawyer entered my consciousness. She made a revealing observation: "... total dependence is at the expense of intimacy." Most human beings aspire to such intimacy. Of course, the value we attach to these "needs" depends largely on the individual. <br /> <br /> As a person with a family-oriented sensitivity, I strongly sympathized with the caregivers in this film. Why can not Javier consider the sacrifice and love of his family and friends? Is he blind to everything? I would not think. The miracle of The Sea Inside lies in its insightful description of a very humanistic arm wrestling. When we are faced with the guardianship of a loved one, healthy, but incapable, who has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intention to die, what is the right thing to do? To take care of this dear one and keep him alive, against his will, is he a godly act? Does this show the value of our love? Or is it simply appeasing our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding given to carers, would not their invalid charges, by submitting to the total dependence of others for their survival, also be an act of neglected sacrifice? Rhetoric or not, how much is "dignity" worth to an individual? Is living (or dying) with dignity a privilege or a right? If we really love and love a person, should we also respect their possible decisions in life (as in death)? A torrent of questions that the film could have asked, answers to which I am not in a position to answer. <br /> <br /> In our desire to intellectually distinguish the merits of life or choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of ​​gray that engulfs the most affected people, caregivers and those who take care. The Sea Inside has therefore tried to present the dynamics of delicate but complex relationship between them. Intuitively, this film includes one thing. that the nature of "sacrifice" is never one-way. In this tussle, we should not try to gain arguments, but to observe closely and, hopefully, to determine who is the "strongest" party to make this sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is a sobering film. It opened my eyes to things I do not want to see. And for that, I am grateful.
