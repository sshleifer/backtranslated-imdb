Park Punishment Park, which is rarely seen, is an uncompromising and brutal political weapon in an endless desert landscape. A festival against authoritarian abuses leaning shamelessly, the antics at first seem to be so militarist and disgusting that they might appear to be a distant far-off dystopian story, which Harry Turtledove might even enjoy. But once we have deepened and really paid attention to the abominable rant springing from those who presided over the tented court, as well as to the shotgun guards watching the bloody affair, our eyes are really open. Suddenly, we realize how wise Watkins' making is, as well as the kind of neo-conservative discourses on youth culture and the legality of divergent thinking by politicians today. While much of the situation was caused by scrambles at that time as well, it really shows how little has changed and shows how, in some ways, we are closer to a world where punishment parks would be a real and frightening operation. <br /> <br /> In almost all scenes, the main actors are seasoned non-actors, mainly chosen for their reckless political opinions and their willingness to show them on camera. This confers an unprecedented authenticity to the whole experience, because we never question, even for a moment, the reality of all the chaos. Filmed as a documentary with a 16mm film, this sounds like a serious documentation of a despicable government test project that was filed until it was found years later. At least he seems to have this story now, maybe not so much when it was (barely) published. But it gives extra weight to all the procedures and helps to drag you into this incredible universe of torture not so alternative to convicted dissidents.
