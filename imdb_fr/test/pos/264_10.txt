I rented this to my local because it was the only new British film available this week. Never heard of the filmmaker or his other films (thanks IMDB). At about the right time, someone did a good young British comedy without Hugh Grant or forty. The story is a story of morality, but never preached, really nice of a young and fresh cast. The cameo of Luke Goss was surprisingly good, but then he surprised me with his excellent performance in "Blade". I loved the color calibration, especially in the nightclub sequences. Good music and a really original voice at work here. Nine out of ten and well worth the rental fee.
