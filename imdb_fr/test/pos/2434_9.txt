Sacchi is the best imitator of Bogart so far ... dry and funny like Sam Marlowe. The music of award-winning composer George Duning [From Here To Eternity, The Picnic, The World of Suzie Wong], cinematography of perfect places [like the famous Ambassador Hotel] fit perfectly into the skin of famed television director Robert Day [Kojak, San Francisco Streets, The Avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a parody of every black detective film made. See this if you liked all the old movies seriously and have a sense of humor ... this one is a hoot.
