'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. This book has nothing to do with the book, which can disappoint the followers. Yet, seen alone, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting is not so bad either !! Nicolas Cage was awesome, so different from his usual action hero characters. Penelope Cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think this film should be judged as an individual project, not related to the book. Louis de Berni√®res abandoned the rights to the film's script. The film is an interpretation of the director, John Maddon. Go see this movie with an open mind, you will love it. for below is the touching story of love and war.
