Shohei Imamaura's Black Rain was released in 1989, just at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, giving the film a sense of poetry. The black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, fallout and falling water one or two hours after the explosion. There have been other books and films on the dropping of the atomic bomb, but none as unique and powerful as this one. Based on a novel by Masuji Ibuse that collected information from interviews and bomb victims' diaries, the film describes how an entire family is psychologically and physically affected by the bomb years after the initial explosion. It is a horrifying vision that resonates with deep compassion for humanity. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, as soldiers and civilians perform their daily tasks. Suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderclap is heard. Almost all buildings are destroyed or irreparably damaged. The first atomic bomb ever dropped on a city is now history. Survivors must somehow start life again, unaware of the devastating effects of the bomb. Shot in contrasting black and white, the story unfolds around Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman who is surprised by the radioactive rain as her boat returns to town in search of friends and relatives. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us indelible images that remain to us: a young boy with the hanging skin pleads with his brother to recognize him, an elderly man is in tears of his inability to free his son from piles of debris, a mother is in tormenting her as she rocks the blackened body of her child. <br /> <br /> When the family returns to their rural home, Yasuko's life is changed forever. She sees her friends dying around her and is waiting for the inevitable episodes of radiation that have already affected her uncle Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and her aunt Shigeko Shimuza (Etsuko Ichihara). Claiming that there is only business as usual, the family denies that the bomb hit Yasuko. "She forgot how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, everyone forgot about it, they forget the hell of the fire and go to gatherings like an annual festival, I'm sick of it," says a friend Katayama. Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko internalizes the tragedy, feeling ashamed to be different from the others and guilty of being contaminated. <br /> <br /> When her aunt and her uncle try to find her a husband, eligible men refuse to marry her because of suspicions about her. even though Shigematsu copied her diary to prove she was not directly exposed to the bomb. The only suitor with whom she feels comfortable is another damaged man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine. In the end, the beauty of life is fleetingly manifested when Yasuko goes to the pond and sees a show she has always been yearning for, the royal carp jumping into the water, as if she were saying beyond the despair always joy. Unfortunately, we hear on the radio statements from politicians about the use of the bomb during the Korean War. "Human beings do not learn anything," says Shigematsu. "They are strangling, an unjust peace is better than a war of justice, why can not they see?" Immamura's Black Rain has, hopefully, allowed everyone to see more clearly.
