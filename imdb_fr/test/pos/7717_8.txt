How do Asian Asians cope in a culture that generally refuses to recognize the concept of homosexuality? For millions of gays, Hindus and Muslims, there seems to be little hope of leading a life accepted and endorsed by their very close families. This is the essence of what has been explored in Chicken Tikka Masala, which is probably named after the spicy Western dish of tender cuts of chicken meat! Jimmy is a typical Asian youth raised in Britain by traditional parents sharing the same narrow and selfish views on marriage and grandchildren. Like millions of other people, he is drawn into an arranged marriage that seems unavoidable, even though he is apparently totally gay and deeply involved in a very attractive young man with whom he lives. He knows he must tell the truth, but he fears the consequences, especially since his father seems to be terminally ill. And so, he is plunged into a network of deceptions that widens as the plot develops. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully sensitive and devoid of any judgment or condescension towards the groups represented. The acting is generally excellent, although it may seem a little difficult in some places because the director tends to look for humor rather than letting it flourish naturally. There is no prize for the photograph or the screenplay, but the film is completed by the wonderful feeling expressed at the end - a feeling that all the fathers of the world would do well to learn from.
