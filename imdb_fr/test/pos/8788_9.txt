Alfred Hitchcock's movie Saboteur is not one of his most prominent films. Done between two much more popular and critically acclaimed images, Suspicion and Shadow Of a Doubt, it is generally considered a lesser effort. I agree that the latest film is revolutionary, drawing Hitchcock into the mainstream for the first time, but Saboteur is at least as alive as Suspicion; Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane, his main star, are mainly charismatic. <br /> <br /> In Saboteur, Hitchcock makes his way through America as his main character travels from California to New York in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was charged . Cummings is very young here and very attractive. His character as a boy (but not immaturity) is perfectly suited to the character he describes, and seems appropriate, because the director, although middle-aged, was reinventing himself, and an older and more established star might have thrown lightnings. The courageous heroine of Priscilla Lane, who was not typical of the director, was very common in American films of the time. and she and Cummings provide an opening and a youth that the director needed both in his life and in his work. I can not imagine older, more solid guys, Cooper and Stanwyck for example, doing better, because they would have carried away, and far too much luggage. <br /> <br /> As usual in Hitchcock's films, nothing is as it appears. Where Saboteur differs from his more well-known films is that the audience is put on the air very early. Although Cummings is a volunteer arsonist, we know he is innocent. The wicked become apparent fairly quickly; and the film is based more on his plot than on his ironies. The pleasures are accessory and the Master does not disappoint here. There is an interesting interlude, Tod Browningish, with some circus fanatics, who help Cummings avoid capture. In another scene, reminiscent of James Whale's Frankenstein Bride, Cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man, who turns out to be Lane's uncle. Has the director perhaps studied the major American films of the previous decade? Anyway, these, along with other offbeat and discursive aspects of the film, give it a playful and varied look, which, when we add the factor of heads quite young, gives the image of a young man who continues to learn his profession. <br /> <br /> The subsequent scenes of the film, in New York, are more suspenseful and typical of the director, as the picture becomes more and more Hitchockian as it moves forward. In the end, I find it a satisfying job; and since neither Cummings nor Lane has a dark side as an actor, the film does not have any. It is deliberately light, and I suspect it semi-experimental; an attempt by Hitchcock to see if he could succeed, in an American context, with the kind of story he had done so well in England. He has admirably succeeded. The next logical step is Shadow Of A Doubt, a movie in which the main character moves from east to west, with a set of totally different values ​​and projects. <br /> <br />
