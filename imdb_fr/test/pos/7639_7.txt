I gave 7 out of 10 to this movie. I think the general dislike of this film is due to the fact that people do not really understand the plot. If you think about the script of this movie is quite logical, it will never give you a stupid explanation. It is true that the special effects are mediocre and the budget seems low, but I think the originality of the plot keeps you attracted. People say that the kind of vampires is exaggerated and cliche, but with Bled, you get what you get. not your conventional vampire movie. It's a dream / alternate reality story alternating with a vampire / eternal life story. I liked it. The only thing that prevented me from giving it a higher rating is the lack of special effects and the fact that I do not like movies where most people have accents. But as I said earlier, if you really understand the plot, it's not a bad movie.
