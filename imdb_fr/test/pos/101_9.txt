It's a very very strange film ... so strange that it's better for you to see it yourself. The film begins with a jaded teacher haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as him! You can say very quickly that this man is a total cynic: he finds practically his value only in the respect of his own inner importance. Moreover, he seems tired and bored by the monotony of life. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, he tackles a robbery in a bank and manages to annoy the burglars to the point that one of them shot him in the head. Strangely, it's only half of the film and it follows a very strange narration of the last seconds of his life. That's when the film becomes exciting, because the style of storytelling is similar to one of the novels of this professor of literature - an intelligently written novel that says things like we would like us to all say it. <br /> <br /> See this strange movie - it's incredibly compelling and unlike anything I've ever seen before.
