Who does not like muppets ?! It is impossible to look at them without having some kind of warmth and blur inside. So, I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to capture very well what makes the muppets so special. I do not remember much of the details of the plot but the various moments and characters of the film which I remember very well. In fact, there was a pretty nostalgic atmosphere throughout the movie, but without any bad self-awareness. Refreshing for someone who is probably too attached to detail and meticulous technique; "magic" transcends all these other things. This is indeed what the movies are made of. <br /> <br /> How does the film get to that? Hmmm, good question! Stumped am I? Let's see. Really, I feel like it's pretty simple. Filmmakers believe in their material and do not take themselves too seriously. I probably would not say that the movie has a lot of really inspired moments, but it does have some life (it's strangely lacking in "real people" movies). A zest. You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence that makes them even more endearing. <br /> <br /> Generally, I feel that the people who made the film are not afraid to try what suits them best at the end of the film. time that gives the whole a pretty loose feeling. A bit like a prolonged jazz session really accessible and enjoyable. A lot of talent, little predictability and a lot of warm personalities to come. The cameos were of course a lot of good surprises for example. Maybe I do not think I have much to say about it because I was half asleep when I saw it (and / or at the time of writing this review). Anyway, I half repeat myself here but I really liked the sense of family that the film had. Full of love, I guess you could say. Again, a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind, that few movies manage to achieve as effectively and effortlessly. <br /> <br /> And, to repeat myself, one of the charms of the film is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like Nathaniel Hawthorne's quote on the happiness of being (like) a butterfly, The Muppet Movie largely succeeds in not seeming to try to do it. Same thing with beauty being better discovered or intact or not forced or something like that. Anyway, if it sounds bland, I also think it was hilarious. <br /> <br /> So, overall, this movie was very funny, touching and hard not to smile. Plus, it contains a lot of good music! Highly recommended to all humans, young and old.
