Remake of the classic 1951 "The thing of another world". 12 men are in a completely isolated resort in Antartica. They are invaded by something from outer space - they devour and completely duplicate everything they choose to do. He begins as a dog but stands out - and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, no one trusts anyone else - they are isolated - the radio is destroyed - their helicopter too. What will they do? <br /> <br /> The 1951 film had the idea of ​​becoming a big super human monster. This movie was scary. This one is too - but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material - the new "Who goes there?") And it's scary in a different way. The film starts right away with the extremely disturbing score of Ennio Morricone and, when the Thing is attacked, the amount of blood is incredible. There is blood and parts of the body that fly everywhere - the arms are detached, the heads are detached and - in the most powerful case - a man is devoured first by the Thing. The effects of gore are a solid and nightmarish material. I'm not scared, but I had to sleep with the light on when I saw it for the first time in 1982. The effects of Rob Bottin are simply incredible: the way in which this image got a grade R exceeds me! <br /> He also has a very scary feeling - gore apart, he is very suspenseful. You do not know who is what and the direction of Carpenter and the score really create tension. A complaint - nobody has distinct personality traits. The actors just stay face to face and say their lines. It's annoying ... but the film still works. <br /> <br /> It was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 - it was competing with "E.T." and many critics have complained about the amount of gore and the lack of female characters in the film. He is now considered one of John Carpenter's best. To see absolutely ... for the strong stomaches. NOT a date movie! <br /> <br /> A funny note: At the end of this movie, Universal sent a note with all the copies of the film. They suggested that movie theater owners play the film in an auditorium near the break rooms. They were afraid that people would be so disgusted by the violence that they had to be near a facility to throw up!
