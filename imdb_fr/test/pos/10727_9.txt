If you asked me to choose the most played movies so far, this movie would be on a short list with Streetcar Named Desire, from 1951. I guess I'll find others that qualify, but Kramer vs. Kramer is an exceptional exercise in naturalism. So it's a very satisfying experience at this level: just looking at the wonderful interpretations of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and the child Justin Henry in particular. One of the best performances for children of all time. <br /> <br /> But I also find it very rewarding to watch, because it's a very complex story that always makes me forget about my own problems. He has an excellent narrative motivation. Once you stuck Kramer against Kramer, Alice Kramer left Ted to juggle work with their young son, telling him nothing more than she needs to discover herself. And even once you know how things are going, every moment of the hike sounds so brilliantly true that it's a pleasure to see it repeat itself over and over again. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake - Kramer vs. Kramer is not light entertainment: it is a very realistic representation of the effects of divorce on everyone involved. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> For one of the best scenarios (born from the conversations between Benton and Hoffman, who was divorcing at the time) always wrote, executed and executed in a beautiful and irreproachable way. Not to mention the big story that implies. In simple terms, a perfect movie.
