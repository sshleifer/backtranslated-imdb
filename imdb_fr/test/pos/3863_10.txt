The 20th animated Disney classic is often described as "mediocre" or mediocre by many, but it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad that "The Aristocats" does not get the credit deserved. Personally, I consider it one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Although it is extremely underrated, it's one of Disney's funniest classics. It's full of hilarious moments (some of them, hysterical). <br /> <br /> Edgar, the gourmet butler, is the villain of the film but it is a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he's so funny. <br /> <br /> Every scene with Edgar and the hunting dogs chasing him, Napoleon and Lafayette in pursuit are among the most hilarious you'll see, especially the one where his motorcycle drives in the river and around the bridge , with the dogs chasing him. It's hysterical! <br /> <br /> But classic humor does not just come from Edgar or hunting dogs. Other characters also have their moments. <br /> <br /> Regarding the subject of quality, it is not perfect, but remains at a high level. Even after the death of Walt Disney, these artists have remained faithful to the spirit of Walt and "The Aristocats" is an example. They do not do it anymore like this nowadays! <br /> <br /> As usual, legendary Disney actors sing the characters. In this case we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. <br /> <br /> The characters are nice in general: Thomas O'Malley, the Duchess and her 3 kittens, the Roquefort mouse, the alley of cats, the geese, the hunting dogs and the horse. The human characters are also included: the eccentric and kindly retired opera singer, Madame Adélaïde Bonfamille, the old lawyer of the comic Madame Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself! <br /> like the theme of Thomas O'Malley (but I do not remember his name), "Everyone wants to be a cat" and "The Aristocats" (sung by Maurice Chevalier), for example. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in Paris (France), in 1910. It is above all a film happy, friendly and very pleasant. A timeless classic that is often underestimated and forgotten, but very useful. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be included in the Top 250.
