Of course, I'll think it was a good movie. I also recognized several people that I did not see during the shooting. I was the guardian about an hour after the movie started in the death row on the death row, asking for a light for a cigarette. I also changed this scene. They had originally planned to go to the playground, straighten the inmate, rotate him, and get him out. The director said "It takes too much time, what would you do Gower." I said, "We have to come in, hang our arms and pull him back so your camera will stay on his face while we take it out of the shoot." I also lived in this same prison when I was a young child, my father being deputy director of security. I am also a current employee of Tennessee Deaprtment of Corrections as a supervisor at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. Although much of the film was a joke, the part I was in was real enough. In the bar scene too, the dancer who was flying high up and leaving the stage was a real stripper with whom I worked in a club called "The Classic Cat".
