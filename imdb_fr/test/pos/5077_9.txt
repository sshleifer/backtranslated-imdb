"I'm afraid you're talking about support, where the forced men are talking about anything." This Shakespearian line from The Merchant of Venice is included in the new film Rendition, which introduces viewers to the "improved interrogation methods" that began under the Clinton administration and have become commonplace since the September 11 terrorist attacks. 2001. <br /> <br /> The film features a cast of stars, including Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metwally. Support roles filled by unknown actors also play, capturing the audience in the plot and showing how many people can be affected by terrorist attacks abroad, as well as our ways of investigating them. <br /> <br /> Rendition follows a suspicious Egyptian-born Egyptian (Metwally) led by US officials following his flight from South Africa to Washington DC in a secret prison abroad. His pregnant wife (Witherspoon) travels to Washington DC to find out about her disappearance through a family friend and employee of Senator (Sarsgaard). Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst at the detention center abroad, who monitors the violent interrogation. <br /> <br /> This film describes the emotions felt by the victim of torture (Metwally) and by those who allowed him to obtain the supposed information. Some, like the CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal), are visibly shaken and horrified by the methods used, while others, the harsh senator (Streep) and the foreign interrogator (Yigal Naor), consider it necessary and effective. <br /> <br /> The film can be described by some as a political play, but is ultimately an emotional play. Metwally's performance as a tortured prisoner is worthy of an Oscar. The film does not intend to preach, but rather to question and inform the public about a subject that does not often have a human face. Restitution is known to work, but it also produces false information from innocent prisoners. The film simply describes the emotional struggles of those involved in such serious matters, and does so in a way that will affect each viewer differently. The film will keep your interest and will involve you in the difficult situation of each character.
