I remember seeing this film when it came out and I still remember the "buzz" I felt when I left the cinema. Everything in this film is beautiful! The music is top quality and I still play the soundtrack after all these years. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times and yet, I'm always looking forward to watching it again and again. Nicholas Cage was great and every time I see Cameron Dye in something nowadays, I always associate it with this movie. It's a shame that the rest of the cast did not do more, but maybe that's the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> I will not do film school criticism because I'm sure all analysts can find fault with it if they want to do it, but what I'm going to say is that this film defined my teenage years and continues to influence my life more than 20 years later. The film "feels good" and arouses emotions when you look at it (well ... that's what it did for me) and I can not recommend it highly enough for those who have not seen it yet . "Get" the movie or you do not have it! Those of you who understand it will be rewarded with a unique cinematic experience.
