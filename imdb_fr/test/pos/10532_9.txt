"Children of wax", also referred to as "Killing grounds", is an interesting mix of genres. Some might think that the purity of the genre can only be definitive, but for me, eclectic symbiosis is very funny. It is also in its history the mixture of thriller and popular action as well as the combination of historical masterpiece and ethnic advocacy for tolerance. This film is built with the starry presence of my favorite actor, the perfect Armand Assante, but it is also marked by the play of a shooting star ?? Hal Ozan. We saw it recently in the HBO TV series called "Sex". "Children of wax" is an entertainment for the public, but at the same time, it has an eternal moral for ethnic tolerance. It's a wise way of sowing well-being. Discussion of contemporary issues nowadays can be done with attractive means in it's very positive film "The Children of Wax".
