Big Fat Liar is the best movie of all time! It's funny and cool. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves he was not lying and goes to Los Angeles to collect his paper from Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). With his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes), his life is wasted because Marty does not call Jason's father and does not say he wrote the paper! Still, everything is going well and it's a good movie to watch!
