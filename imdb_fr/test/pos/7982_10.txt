All Batman fans will know how great the movies are, they have been a major success. Batman Returns is however by far the best movie of the series. A combination of excellent directors, brilliant actors and perfect scenery makes this film worthy of a night's sleep. <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, the director of this film, has specifically ensured that this film gives a realistic atmosphere. great work. Danny Devito (man-penguin) is a man who inherited the characteristics of a penguin when he was a baby and who grew up to become a hideous and ugly thing ...! Michelle Pfiffer plays "Catwoman", an elegant and very seductive figure, after cats have passed on her genes after being bitten. The result in both character changes is excellent and Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film. The mysterious Catwoman is very entertaining to watch - her classic sayings and a fun role in which she jumps with her whip into a jewelry store adds such pleasure to the movie. Danny Devito is doing well too, his ability to imitate a strange creature was essential, and he adds a great vibe to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he lives. <br /> <br /> You can not forget. Batman though. Micheal Keaton once again performs a comfortable performance and shows us a different side of Batman. His affection is released when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film. Her encounters with her when she is a normal person, Selina Kyle, make him mislead at home. There is an intelligent part after that when they leave, and the movie is full of beautiful scenes. It should be noted that Bruce Wayne's Bat Mobile is not used as much as in other Batman films, this film being a scene of close and narrative battles. <br /> <br /> Wintertime is perfectly created in Gotham City with most scenes taking place at night and the city is full of snow. Therefore, if you watch this film during the summer like me, it does not feel the same anymore. The best watch in winter. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's an amazing movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the actors, who did an incredible job.
