A stolen shipment of Vigoroso, the Mexican Viagra; a beautiful girl trying to rebuild her life and leave her husband, boss of the Italian mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old love. This is the plot of "The Shipment", a country comedy set in the small town of Paradise, Arizona. Despite its simple and classic storyline, the film (directed by Alex Wright) has its fun moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (as Candy Porter), watching a green pill from Vigoroso, says, "What is it?" 'is a mint candy?' Or when the girl enters the sheriff's house and finds him completely naked. Or when the loading Vigoroso ends in THIS lake, to the final sequence ... The cast offers beautiful performances: of Matthew Modine as sheriff of Paradise Valley, who still loves his old girlfriend; and by Elizabeth Berkley, whose character still loves his old boyfriend ... The secondary actors, including Nicholas Turturro, Paul Rodriguez (as Mexican Jos√®) and G Michael Gray (what kind of teeth ...), are nice Work too. Not an Oscar, but not so bad. A funny comedy without pretension.
