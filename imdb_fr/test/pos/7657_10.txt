It's not "direct cinema", it's actually the opposite. The second installment of Gitlif's Gypsy trilogy, this French work produced by Mich√®le Ray-Gavras is a masterpiece of film, not a documentary or a fiction. Instead, Gatlif chose different places on the road between India and Spain, where the Roma are very present, and with the help of artistic directors, he has staged several musical numbers that tell how the gypsies live, sing, dance, wrestle and have survived. The film may have strong opposition from those who question the assumption that the Roma tribe is of Indian origin, mainly disputed by those who see a direct link to the Hebrews (so it is not surprising that they have also been persecuted). by the Nazis.) But above all anthropological argument, it is a work of great beauty, with bright colors, songs and fantastic dances.
