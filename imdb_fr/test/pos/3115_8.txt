The year 1950 sees two very different and interesting westerns: "The Gunfighter" by Henry King and "Wagon Master" by John Ford. "The Gunfighter" was historically remarkable because it clearly influenced Zimmerman's "High Noon" (1951) and subsequent Western revisionists. <br /> <br /> However, I personally find that "Wagon Master" is superior to its contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece is not so much about stories; it should rather be conceived as a poem describing Old West conceptions. Although optimistic and warm to the heart, we are deservedly naive because we have no pretentious underlining. The border landscapes are well used because they perfectly support the poetic narrative. Add to this a naturalistic photographic work and we are transported among the Mormon travelers to witness the Western folklore told in a cinematic way.
