I had the pleasure of seeing this movie at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I must say it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very entertaining short film! The script is well written and continues to escalate things. There is also a great current of suspense running through it. You do not know what will happen next, because the main character tries to understand that his new neighbor is perhaps not the most ideal person to live in front of him. The jokes are fast and unexpected. The plot prevents us from guessing. The dialogue is very real. I thought management was top notch and director Travis Davis had a lot of potential for success in the world of studio comedies. This is not a small compliment as he is also the main actor of the film. So he had to do three things: write, direct and stage. If you have the chance to see this movie on iTunes, the download is worth it. This will make you laugh a few times. And that's more than most shorts offer these days.
