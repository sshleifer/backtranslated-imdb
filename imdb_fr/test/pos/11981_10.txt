Do not be fooled by the rating of 5.9 (at the time of writing this letter on 12/08/08), it is an excellent film. at all levels. The staging, the acting, the cinematography - everything is fine. The story is interesting and original and my only idea about why this rating is that it's probably the type of movie that viewers would not normally see. <br /> <br /> play modern rock for 80 years. You may be young, have grown up and love it, but it has not been, and as a product of a different time and taste - do not care. <br /> <br /> If you like movies and can handle real people-based movies versus stupid action-packed movies, huge flashy budgets and mediocre talent, try this one the next time you will see it ... <br /> <br />
