Wow, Stella Shorts are great! Many customers of The State and Stella, the TV show. I never knew that Stella could have been better while they were in the TV series Stella or even in Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I did not know that short comedies could be useful either. My favorites were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David is organizing a meeting with his lost cousin, Greg. I think David was the funniest. It's funny when it does not make sense. I like music in shorts. It's something I'm very careful about. They have always had good taste in music. I wish they still make shorts, or that it brings back their sitcom. I hope they will continue to make a good and funny comedy.
