LIFEFORCE was one of the biggest flops of Cannon Films. Above all, he received bad reviews and did nothing to help the career of director Tobe Hooper following the controversy between Spielberg and POLTERGEIST. All this is unfortunate, because LIFEFORCE is actually a very good film. It's extremely entertaining, fast-paced, and has some of the most outrageous directions, productions, performance, and special effects to date, blowing up on screen! It must have seemed odd on paper: the producers of THE DELTA FORCE, the screenwriter of ALIEN, the director of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the composer of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, the special effects assistants of STAR WARS ... The audiences were not ready this crazy exercise in strangeness. <br /> <br /> What more do you want ??? We have an alien spacecraft filled with giant bats! We had a sexy and nude vampire in the space that sucked people's souls! We have bodies that explode! We have zombies! We have possession! We had an S & M interrogation! We set the whole city of London on fire! It is Dracula who meets NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, QUARTERMASS AND THE FANTASSIN, A TREMBLEMENT OF EARTH. This is perhaps the most scandalous and scandalous epic ever created, that is to say if there are others. <br /> <br /> Try watching this movie while chemically modified. Maybe then you will understand. A truly enriching experience and one of the most underrated films of director Tobe Hooper. Maybe one day he will find his audience.
