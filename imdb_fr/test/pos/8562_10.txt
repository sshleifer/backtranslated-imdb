I watched this movie with my family during a long Thanksgiving weekend. I'm grateful that someone insisted that we watch it, although I did not pay attention to it until the end of the film when a mowing of the head seems promised, but, alas, it does not happen . <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I watched this movie a few years later and I loved its vivacity, its nonsense, its brilliance and its pure pleasure. I think the film has a feminine tone. Women are not exploited even though I'm sure someone might think that the film is pure exploitation. I think the film plays with the tropes of the period. <br /> <br /> I still think someone should do it again. And explain some of the implications of the original.
