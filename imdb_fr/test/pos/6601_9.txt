Just there. Good times, entertaining and precise, in most scenes. Enough personality variations to cover real people at this time, without the story being distracted by the exceptions. Credits show Peralta from Mar Vista, California ... at the top of Venice Hill and south of Malibu. I lived there at the time of the Heartbreak Hotel, before Beachboys, next to surfer Bob Cooper, on Wasatch Avenue, where the driveway was used to burn surfboards that did not work. Old roller skates were used on plywood cuts to hit the pavement waves. The situation was different over the following decades: the fresh innocence of the 1950s burst into Warmth of the Sun's white-water freedom and the excitement of the electric sixties, then into resolutely innovative recreation and inventive evolutionary madness strange seventy. The film offers you a piece of this magical moment; in a place where the imaginary wave was real .. the source of important cultural influences. And BTW, there's another movie that has the same street feel at American Street, and that has the same truly unique goodness with a casual reality that helps refine that elusive and everlasting sense of cool. "Two Lane Blacktop" (with one of the best examples of freesouldoit attitude in the history of the west coast of California .. Dennis Wilson). As Monte Hellman did with this one, thank you, SP, for being on the same level as this one. GWR
