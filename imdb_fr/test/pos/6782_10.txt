This game is an action / adventure with fight. There are long periods without a fight, but at other times you have to get rid of various types of monsters. Monsters do not look like anything you would see in real life and need to be eliminated to continue your quest. The whole game is a quest. You play Adam Randall whose father contacts him since the afterlife and asks him to come and save him. The game dates from the mid-1990s and must be played under DOS. I used Dosbox and I could play the game very well. The graphics are not as good as some games of the time, mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look rather blocky, so that others look horrible, but do not be discouraged afterwards. The game is very imaginative, it is long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear from nowhere. Not for young kids who probably would not be interested anyway, but over 13 or 14 years old might like this game. It's a combination of horror \ mystery \ action \ adventure \ combat.I thought it was a great match. We had to find now. maybe Ebay. But remember, it's a DOS game and you will not be able to play it on faster computers today. It would be difficult to play fast computers unless you use Dosbox. Oh, and the acting is very good too.
