A comedy beautifully constructed and brilliantly interpreted. There is not one person in the cast who does not perform (with herself) with a hilarious distinction. However, the real star of the film is the invisible director, Frank Oz, who brings all the sensitivity and crazy spirit to this joke that he reported during the meeting of Miss Piggy with Kermit the frog. It's a film not to be missed.
