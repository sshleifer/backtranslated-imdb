I wonder if I could watch a whole musical comedy from Russia, East Germany or other countries that have been broadcasting propaganda films, anti-fascist films, anti-war films (like shows this documentary) dark and painful times under Stalin and the life behind the Iron Curtain. So it's fascinating to see the other side of the coin, the types of clowns and rebels with music by their side to try to please the masses more often than they do not end up in socialist society. One of the films seemed rather impressive, called Jolly Fellows, by the pioneer of the very small group of filmmakers Grigori Aleksandrov. According to the clip (s) I saw from this movie, I would bet it was one of the only works to come out of itself and get into a really wild, manic, done mode to laugh. But as this movie shows, if you're a filmmaker looking to entertain, it's better to use a "message". <br /> <br /> Through interviews, occasional quasi-dramatizations (type of movement of Russia / Germany / etc.) association of images) at the table of censorship, and clips, we obtain the complete picture of what it was like, both behind the scenes and on screen - to simply entertain the masses. Some of the films (well, most of them, as apparently only 14 have been screened for more than 40 years in the countries mentioned) have contributed much to the change, but for what purpose really? We are also attracted by the culture of all, its difference with the American way of "if it works, do them when they are hot". But at the same time, perhaps apart from this repression, some interesting, amusing films and (from what I've seen) were shot. They were perhaps quite typical of what had been asked to be shown to the masses, under the tender but demanding conditions of Stalin, like life with tractors. It becomes an even juicier story when we are shown how it was in the 60s, the latest wave of musicals, as the rock and roll and pop tunes finally came to the air. <br /> <br /> In short, good things ... but only if you're interested, really. I was shown the film in a documentary class and half of the class fell asleep. So be forewarned, on the one hand, but on the other if you seek it, it can be a truly rewarding journey into the history of European cinema.
