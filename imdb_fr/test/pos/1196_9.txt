I watched it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked if we would watch it. I did not want it because it was an old movie, how could it be good? I finally looked with this friend and my father. my friend and I loved the movie. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy. I guess it shows that even if it goes back to dad's time, that does not mean it can not be a good movie. I bought the movie shortly after seeing it on TV, I put it a lot and I sang with the songs. I even watched it with my classmates at my birthday party. it's a good movie, good and sometimes funny. <br /> <br /> If you do not try, you can not say it's bad. even if you think no, I'm not going to watch a movie from dad's time. try the first part of the movie that you can always stop watching if you do not like it. I really recommend it, it's great !!
