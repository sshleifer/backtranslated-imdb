Florence Vidor is the daughter of a strict and strict father who throws her out of the house when gossiping denatures her name. In the big city, she finds the dying wife of her own brother (the two had secretly married) and raise their child alone. Years later, she returns home to confront her family. <br /> <br /> This old melodrama is heavily larded with fascinating feminist themes (circa 1921, but with a remarkably modern sound). A part is troweled (as a father, Theodore Roberts gives a real physical training to his eyebrows), but it is well assembled in a dramatic and lovingly composed and filmed by director of photography Henry Sharp.
