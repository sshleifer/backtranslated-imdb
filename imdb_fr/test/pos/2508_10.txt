Director Peter Chan, The scenario Maria Maggenti. <br /> <br /> According to Cathleen Schine's novel "Love Letter", director Peter Chan's film version, released in 1999, was not a big hit at the box office, not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements. Although less popular in movie theaters, it quickly became a popular movie on cable TV and VHS / DVD. Located in a port city of the good old country (I forget the exact location), it is the story of a mysterious and passionately written love letter that arouses emotions and confusion among the main characters, each thinking that the letter is personally addressed to him. At the end of the film, we do not know who the lover is or who loves him, but the power of the letter has changed the lives of almost everyone in the small town. The troupe is made up of wonderful actors who have stood up to television and film, including Kate Capshaw in the leading role of middle-aged beauty Helen, a bookstore, actress Ellen DeGeneres in the role of her friend Janet Hall, the young hottie Tom Everett Scott in the role of Johnny, the young man under 20 who falls in love with Hellen and the oldest, Tom Selleck in the role of firefighter George Matthias, who has to compete with Johnny for the Helen's affections. The old Hollywood actress, Gloria Stuart, is best known to the modern public as being the old Rose of "Titanic" (1997) and a cameo of Kate Capshaw's daughter (with her husband Steven Spielberg), Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle includes a middle-aged woman, an older man and a young man, who are as passionate about Helen as the author of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's indecision. Will she choose the right person? Which man has the most to offer him? Johnny has a relationship with a girl of his age who loves him with a passion of his own and who, in fact, is a reminder of what Helen was at his age. George is divorcing his wife and leading a mundane and hectic life. An educated intellectual, he takes Helen to an opera date, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian hero Tosca moves Helen. There are many beautiful views of the charming coastal city, made beautifully by the director of photography Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise of romantic and charming songs - "I've never been in love before", "I'm in the mood to like" and "Only The Lonely". Ellen DeGeneres in the role of Janet Hall, who is always late for work at Helen's bookstore, who keeps coming out with men without being able to find the right guy, is simply beautiful. She did not lose her comic talent, though at this stage of her career she did not appear much on television or in the movies, as only two years before her successful TV series "Ellen", in the midst of 1990s, had been canceled because of his "exit". as a lesbian and the new lesbian subject of the series. There is even the comedian Jack Black, long before he managed to make it big, in the shoes of a fisherman. It is a moving film about human emotions and meaningful decision-making, about the human need for a passionate devouring love and the general love of escape brought not only by books, letters and music, but also through a truly loving and secure relationship. It's a great movie with wonderful moments and a contagious romantic spirit.
