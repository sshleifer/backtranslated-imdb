This film makes several headlines to various science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of the original theatrical version of THX-1138 (the BUCK ROGERS trailer, here it was clips from an old SF Japanese TV show). Then, in the foreground of the city in 2345, the dragon flies over a billboard immediately reminding BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect is even more pronounced when we meet the hero, called replicant (he is blond and is called Ryo, a tribute to Roy Batty, the character of Rutger Hauer in BLADERUNNER?). A battle scene ensues that immediately recalls THE MATRIX. The government that forces people to use drugs looks like THX-1138 and the law enforcement official, who looks like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd, turns out to be a robot, quite like the TERMINATOR. The end of the battle is reminiscent of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is hilarious. Probably not one of the best SF movies on the market, but it's nice, certainly much nicer than guts like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.
