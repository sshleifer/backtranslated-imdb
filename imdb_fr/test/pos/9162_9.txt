From the first to the last scene, this film is shot in a very realistic way, even too realistic: sometimes we can not see the details in the night scenes (it's dark as in the night), in the desert (the sun is as strong as in the true desert). <br /> <br /> The script and the actor's part are also very realistic. The plans and episodes are set up with the aim of not showing things and events "effectively", "explaining" them or, as many Hollywood movies do, "entertaining" the viewers. To publish here is to represent events as if they really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes tuned away from dying soldiers, even when the main character Major Bandura is shot and killed. <br /> <br /> Such a method reminds me of masterpieces of Italian neorealism. And the construction of the story here is based on the same principles as "Pais√†", or "The Bicycle Thief" - a chronological series of "faithful to life" episodes and some pathetic moments, which first seem to be sudden and illogical. but have internal reasons. <br /> <br /> I think the death of Major Bandura's suicide, in the back of his head, is a religious emotion - Repentance for the death of innocents (not only the accidental killing of his family in the village, but also death under his orders). He is not described as a passionate believer, but on the contrary as a responsible and tactful officer. It is precisely for this reason that his last decisions (returning to the destroyed village and turning his back on a boy, whose family he killed) seems to be an act of repentance. <br /> <br /> The Russian Orthodox choir, which sounds at the end ( "Sacrifice evening"), is another context in which the entire film can be seen from this perspective.
