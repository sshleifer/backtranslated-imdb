I am absolutely not a fan of golf. On May 26 at around 10:30 pm, the film began with a scene at the end of the 19th century. Old movies appeal to me but not golf, however, in the first scene, a young boy (Harry Vardon) is awakened by the men's voices. He goes out to ask what they are doing and they are told that they are going to build a golf course ... So, I turned off the television, but something moved me and everything turned on. The film is excellent. We see then this young boy now a man; professional golf player who is haunted by visions of his childhood. Then we meet the real objective of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. Then there's little Eddie Lowery, his caddy, with encouraging words and small efforts that are crucial to Francis's victory. I do not want to give too much. I was up until 2 am It's great to see the movie.
