When I watched the film, I said to myself "so that a film can be made like that". The magnificent poetic love story of Wong Kar Wai captured me during and even after the film. I have to admit it's one of the best love movies, maybe the best I've ever seen. The content and shape overlap perfectly. Looking at the secret love, we see the characters in delimited frames that limit their movements and feelings. Beautiful camera angles and lighting makes feelings and blues even more palpable. I would like to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee for their fantastic cinematography that creates an atmosphere of love. The music also defines the sadness of love that plays along the beautiful images in slow motion and shows the characters in a desperate mood. And of course the performances of actors who make love so real. Finally, all the elements of the film combine perfectly under the direction of WKW and give the audience a feeling called love.
