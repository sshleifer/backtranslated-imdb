I'm trying to find a place to buy a DVD / VHS copy of the movie "Is not it shocking?" I was 7 years old when I saw this movie and lived in the city where it was shot. Some elements of my family were used in the movie as props and some of my friends' houses were used in some scenes. Filming went pretty well in the city and the surrounding community. Originally, I had only seen the film once and would like to have a copy of it so that I can now show the film to my family. I did extensive research online without success and was wondering if anyone would have ideas to try to get a copy of this movie?
