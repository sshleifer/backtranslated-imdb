Please let me know of all versions of Precious Bane or Gone to Earth on the video that people may be aware of. I love Mary Webb's books with all my heart and I would be very grateful to receive information on VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I read Precious Bane and Gone to Earth, which are my favorite of Mary Webb, many times, and have collected other novels by her too. I was fortunate to find his poetry and essays "Springs of Joy", but I have never been able to see the version of Precious Bane available on Masterpiece Theater or the full version of Gone to Earth, although there had an American film The classic broadcast of The Wild Heart, which was a chopped version of the original film Gone to Earth. <br /> <br /> If anyone can help me get copies of any of these movies (full version), I'd be really grateful!
