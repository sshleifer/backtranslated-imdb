I saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on HBO and I loved it !! It was so hilarious that I saw it too many times to count. I love the Stork brothers and the pitiful Ugly dog ​​Bosco! My favorite quote in the movie is: "It's so ugly that he should be asleep." I also loved it when the little sister slaps the girls in the back and their faces are stuck. I also like John Cusack and Demi Moore in this movie. They were great. This film brings back memories of my college years when I saw it for the first time. I rented the movie countless times and watched it again and again. My roommate at the university and I just could not get enough. Who could not love this crazy movie ?! I want to buy a copy on DVD, does anyone know where I can get it?
