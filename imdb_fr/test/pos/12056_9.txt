I usually like SRK as a villain (how can you not have one?) And I think SRK and Juhi get married perfectly on the screen, because they're both prettier than pretty. <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome Look, although there are major flaws: <br /> <br /> 1) the good guy (Sunny) - not only is he much less attractive than Shahrukh (which in my opinion is so important in Bollyfilms), but its role lacks character - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we have a conflict between a personality and an average soldier <br /> <br /> 2) Kiran and Sunil's reactions to Rahul's actions are incredibly stupid and naive even for Bollywood production <br /> <br /> But all that is not so important in comparison of the wonderful melodramatic atmosphere, great songs (really really great) and (let's say it again) Shahrukh like a bad guy, I just love him when he's so pagal <br /> <br /> A must (with Anjaam , Baazigar and Duplicate)
