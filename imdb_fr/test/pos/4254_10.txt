I saw this film in his short film at the cinema "art house" in '69. I found it so funny that I literally spent part of the movie on the floor after laughing so much that I fell off my chair. In retrospect, years later, I thought it had been done by Melvin Van Peebles. When I told a friend, he said that one of his friends, Downey Sr., had practically played in the film: director, producer, etc. He was right of course, and my memory was wrong, except that it was one of the fun movies ever made. The part of "Arabic" was particularly invaluable.
