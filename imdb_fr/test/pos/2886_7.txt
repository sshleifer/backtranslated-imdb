It's an excellent concert that featured the best songs of the group's 30-year career. Lee, Lifeson and Peart were lively and entertaining on stage and delivered a great show. That said, I think the audio recording was sloppy at the mixing console and / or the sound recording process. It's not the boys' fault though. They even mentioned that the show was scheduled at the last minute. The group and its team have obviously done their best. They simply should not have put the show to public consumption. Neil's snare seems distant and Geddy's bass has good harmonic content, but not serious at all !! They should have held this concert and wait for a better opportunity. Buy this DVD only if you are a hardcore Rushian. Quality is lacking in the audio department.
