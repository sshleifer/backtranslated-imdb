While the great series "Prime Suspect" reaches the fourth part, there is no loss of speed, it is already a considerable feat. "The First Suspect IV: The Lost Child" has the strong support we take for granted in these British dramas, but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren dominates easily, our eyes never leave her while she's on screen The search for the lost child leads Superintendent Jane Tennison's DIC team to a suspicious suspect who turned out to be a pedophile convicted of a single mother and her two youngsters The understanding that we get from the functioning of her mind is one of the highlights of this mini-series, but perhaps too strong for many stomachs. <br /> <br /> The sequences of The camera held pushes us in the middle of the excitement and tension during the siege. <br /> <br /> In short, this is another police procedural drama magnificent.
