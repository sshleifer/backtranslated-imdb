A short crime series that gave birth to three derivative films (Naked Gun 1, 2 and 3) is a fast-paced comedy, with a fast-paced comedy that is more successful than misses. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent detective who manages and stumbles along with Captain Ed Hocken, his talented assistant. <br /> <br /> The stories are fantastic, at best, but deliberate, because goodness does not lie in the story, but in the constant weaving of jokes and truly strange and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> The jokes themselves come in many forms, be they word games, slapstick, puns or gags, most of them hitting the target, even if some fall a little flat. This is inevitable with this "gag order every few seconds" approach that some will fail, but the report is good. <br /> <br /> The characters are a delight. From the guest star of the week dying in the first seconds of each episode, the lab scientist who seems to lead cruel and unusual experiences on children to shoe polish that is a kind of oracle, the writing is witty and sharp cutlass. <br /> <br /> Although not particularly successful at the time, he quickly developed a cult, many accusing the relative lack of success of the series to be ahead of his time and too sophisticated for the target audience, especially among them. none other than Matt 'The Simpsons' Groening: and he should know. <br /> <br /> Dated by today's standards, if you can see through this aspect, you're in for a treat.
