I saw the movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it. Although there are many clues I could realize after watching the second time, I could not wake up the Dow Dawn affair. Maybe it was my negligence.The woman's unconsciousness became concrete with the customization. 'Let me go out, this is the key phrase of the film. Let me get out of the deepest of your brain and we both will be free.A discreet film that forces the limits of human consciousness and brain. Anyone who saw the 'machinist' would be aware of the similarities with the sunrise. A man who could not escape his consciousness (again a psychological concept and an abstract concept) body.And he will be just free to accept and realize that there is no way to escape.Also, I want to mention the performance of 'Breking Dawn's stuff'. Despite the lack of experience, actors and actresses to the director, all exposed separately. reasonable performance that created a synergy that would increase the quality of the film
