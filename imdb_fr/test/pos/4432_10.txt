I never heard of architect Louis Kahn before this documentary. In this fast-paced two-hour documentary, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores the life of his father, from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia, at the University of Pennsylvania (West Philadelphia) where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and La Jolla, California, as well as New York to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families, including his wife Esther, who refused to divorce and their daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel understands the members of his family. Louis also has another half-sister, Alexandra Tynge, from her father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow architect. Louis's passion was his art.
