Felix watches an actor repeat his lines: "A ham, a ham! My kingdom for a ham sandwich !!!" The dramatic guy who tells Felix that he will "have to sacrifice my art and go to the movies". He is in tears. Felix looks at him like he's crazy and shrugs. The old man tells Felix to "leave" and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood. Felix says to himself, "How does he expect me to get this money?" <br /> <br /> In a few minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), he sees a shoe owner selling a "bankrupt" sale. the shop. Felix offers a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat $ 500 if it works. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's the case, but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home. In a scandalous scene, Felix turns into a briefcase and that's how he goes to Hollywood, switching to a cat when they get there. <br /> <br /> We then attend Felix's attempts to enter show business. His audition scenes are very amusing, especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin. In addition, there are caricatures of celebrities and famous silent film directors. In all, there is a lot of material in this cartoon of 9.5 minutes. It's amazing how much you can win in an extra 2.5 minutes, assuming most animated shorts last seven minutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there have been a lot of laughs here and more wacky stuff. See only in a cartoon, like Felix having a duel with the sword with giant mosquitoes! Crazy stuff.
