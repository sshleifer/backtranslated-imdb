I just went on YouTube and I finally watched this animated short film directed by Richard Condie, an Oscar nominee. I had already watched his funny Getting Getting Started here. In this one, a couple plays Scrabble. The woman keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has only E. The woman goes for a while vacuuming on her bed and bath (!) Before catching her husband who looks sideways. Shortly before, the husband attended a TV show called "Sawing for Teens". The stars are doing something and the husband is getting his own saw. This program is interrupted by a special report on a nuclear war (the journalist is a skeleton here) while everyone panics outside while the husband has fallen asleep during this time and thinks that a parade then takes place that he and his wife continue to argue about the game. There are many other weird things that happen before the touching end begins. Quite hilarious and worth seeing for animation enthusiasts. I can not wait to see other animated shorts by Mr. Condie ...
