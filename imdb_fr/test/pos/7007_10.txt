From the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black, I became addicted. I went into this movie thinking it would be just another science fiction movie. Instead, I found a very entertaining action movie on the edge of your seat that provoked reflection. The film goes beyond your basic special effects movie. The actors are incredible, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and others ..) in the role of Fry is really a joy to watch on the screen, while Vin Diesel in Riddeck is so captivating that you are dying for hear him speak again. <Br/> <br /> The look of the film is breathtaking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is incredible. Followed by the complete darkness of the nightfall. I really recommend to all lovers of ALIEN movies or Radha Mitchell (that's why I went to see him) to watch this movie. I'm sure in the end you'll see black in a whole new way.
