Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. More often than not, the movies you have loved as a child will disappoint you as an adult. Although there are exceptions to this rule, it's hard to justify owning a Krull DVD, no matter how many insightful comments the director makes. But stay alert, because the dozens of disappointments that dominated your trip in the past, might prevent you from falling on one that deserves to be revisited. <br /> <br /> A surprise movie that deserves another look is that of Flatliners by Joel Schumacher. , the supernatural thriller featuring heavyweight popcorn from the 80s, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billy Baldwin. One would think that a stew made up of this cast, Schumacher's flamboyant flamboyant and the insightful eye of director Jan De Bont would produce a disgusting material, but calories aside ... The Flatliners are not at home. half bad. Even if its conception of production is inexplicably exaggerated and the photography is terribly too stylized (filled with neon-flooded streets spewing endless waves of steam), Flatliners still manages to be a really dark and convincing thriller. If there is a reason why Flatliners was forgotten, it may be because in 1990, another supernatural thriller, much higher, came out: Ladder of Jacob. <br /> <br /> If Flatliners was released a year or two after Jacob's Ladder, Schumacher's flashy thriller would probably have been dismissed as a commercially attenuated scam of Adrian Lyne's nightmarish masterpiece. But with the release of these films the same year, Flatliners had a different fate, tripling JL at the box office, although it is a diluted version of a similar project. The passage of time has not been so good for the Flatliners, it has been lost over a bunch of dismembered beasts from the 80s disposable, while JL has strengthened its reputation as a timeless classic. JL is perfectly terrifying and manages to keep the public in suspense until the last picture, while Flatliners is victim of excessive simplification and Hollywood conveniences that lead to the final act in a predictable denouement. The comparisons between the two films are unfair and ultimately ignore Flatliners' ability to portray the 1980s optimally. Emerging at the end of a decade of superficial excess, Flatliners will always be dated by its hairstyles and sartorial styles, but, in all fairness, it should also be remembered as a well-executed film at the top (or at least close) from the top of his pile of dreck. For the sake of intention, it's a fun walk in memory.
