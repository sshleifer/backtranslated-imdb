Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey deliver superb performances, while Jonathan Silverman, as Eugene, recounts his life at Brighton Beach in 1937. <br /> <br /> What makes the film so good is the relationships between the characters, which are extremely wonderful family values. <br /> <br /> Bob Dishy had a wonderful opportunity here as a father of the clan. As patriarch of the family, he gives a sober but convincing interpretation. <br /> <br /> His sons played by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger are fabulous. There are certain scenes where Silverman skates or hops, where I think of Jerry Lewis. <br /> <br /> As for Danner and Ivey, they are also wonderful. Their manners, their intonation and their idealism of the Jewish culture are beautifully realized by them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply beautiful. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Although the inevitability of war was looming, the film is full of many of the typical problems families faced at the time. In a sense, you do not have to be Jewish to live what the family is going through. <br /> <br /> A must for nostalgia lovers and those of us who believe so strongly in family values.
