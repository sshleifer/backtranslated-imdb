I watch this movie with horror in my heart because my mother too was a cracked head like Michelle. I wondered where Michelle is now. there have been times when I had to find my mother in places where I was afraid of being more frightened but no longer to leave her there! to see Michelle acting like that made me wonder where she slept all that time ?? I looked in the hope that it was never so bad for my mother! And what I want to know is ... Where did Matt and Tracy "tear that ass" ?! The worst scene for me was watching Tracy filming in an old navy dressing room !!! u never trying clothes in front of you and he looks like all but Michelle has help !!!! Where are they to know 2008? can we get an update ??????????
