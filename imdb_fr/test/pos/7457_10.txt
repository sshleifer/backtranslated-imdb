Duckman was a series that took place in the last hour or so before he could sleep ten years ago. It was a contrast with a lot of kid-like animation that I was watching at the time; I was still a minor junkie for Disney and Looney Tunes movies, and most Saturday morning cartoons were still lagging behind the peak of the Ninja Turtles and Batman era. But also about that time, I began to recognize that the satirical cartoon series were more creative, more mature, surreal, obscene and (although I did not know the term at the time) were more creative than the ones I was used to. In the days of Beavis and Butt-head, Ren and Stimpy, and even the Maxx hit TVs via MTV, the US aired two shows, one on Weird Science and the other on Duckman. I have always remembered some key elements of the series, and some lines are very useful to those who have not completely forgotten. Fortunately, I recently found a tape containing about six episodes I recorded a long time ago, and the jokes were kept very cool. And the delivery of jokes is fast often in the best episodes. <br /> <br /> In the field of voice, talent choices are first-rate for scenarios, which are usually just excuses for crude and fascinating parodies of pop culture, politics, movies and TV shows, music. , police mysteries and the dysfunctional family unit. Jason Alexander is a great choice for Duckman, and his performance is a 180-comic debut on Seinfeld (although there might be similar features here and there). In addition, Gregg Berger's undeniably monotonous and impassive Cornfed voices, Dweezil Zappa's hapless ineptness, Ajax, and Nancy Travis as sex-hungry sister-in-law, Bernice, contribute immensely. In addition to a brilliant writing - even when a joke is not safe, his mind compensates - the style of animation, although far from the remodeled and improved product of today's computer, is inventive and often abstract . It has this artisanal and grainy quality that Beavis and Butt-head or South Park would have later. And, as in these shows, if you're a little kid, I mean a little less, because you may not understand most of the jokes (there are enough references to the stripper and to VD for fill two shows sometimes). . But it is inventive to catch the television late at night and it works pretty well at this time. We can only hope for a DVD box. <br /> <br /> So for those who have hardly, if ever, heard of this program, here is a general note: think of this show as if Dashiell Hammett had met Walt Disney and decided to go to a Vegas slum with a free mini bar and do a collaboration in the vein of Luis Bunuel and The Simpsons combined. Not to mention, it is by the group that made Rugrats. (Strong) A
