I was very moved by the young life experiences of a man so highly placed in the academic world. A difficult life surrounded by the love of a close family and the extended family of fellow workers has created a person capable of succeeding in the world. As I have always observed and admired, Hispanic culture is largely represented: hardworking, optimistic and truly family oriented. The points of religious superstition were quite authentic to the Catholic Church. Without a doubt, the actress who played the mother deserves an Oscar. His prayers for his missing son moved me to tears. I will recommend this amazingly thought-out film to my friends and family.
