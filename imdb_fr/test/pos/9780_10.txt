Having captured a great-grandfather and sending him to Changi during the Second World War, I was hesitant to watch him when he was screened for the first time on television. My great-grandfather kept a diary while he was in captivity and when he died there, his comrades bought it and I had the chance to read it and have at least one idea what Changi really looked like, first-hand. <This is a fantastic account of what happened to these poor guys who were sent to Changi Prison and shows the hardships and cruelty they have witnessed in order to protect their country. It's a great story of camaraderie, commitment and the Australian spirit that will never give up. It's worth watching if you like Australian history or anything related to the Second World War. <br /> <br /> I really liked this mini-game and gave it 10 out of 10.
