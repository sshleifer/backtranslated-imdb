I spent many years studying all the great directors, such as Kurosawa, Lean, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Peckinpah, Kubrick and admiring them greatly. My favorite movie is Once upon a time in America. <br /> <br /> I only recently became a fan of D'Amato and, even though he was not a master of horror, his films were extreme, be it soft core or hardcore or extreme. <br /> <br /> Porn The Holocaust is now one of my favorite movies, its shooting is brilliant and the music is catchy. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato, it was not master of horror, he is neither Fulci nor Bava, but although he was a master of eroticism, no other director could to shoot erotic films like him, and he has never tried to make films outside of this genre either. <br /> <br /> Long live Aamto-Master Joe porn and eroticism!
