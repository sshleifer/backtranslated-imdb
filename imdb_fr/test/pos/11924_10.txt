I love this movie since I saw it at the movies in 1991. I was then 12 years old and Wil Wheaton was my favorite actor and a crush on teens. I am now 23 years old and I still like this movie. The best part about this is that I'm going out with someone who loves it too because it's a totally macho movie! It is done with enough action and chaos to keep men with the shortest attention span glued to the screen. I only wish it to be available on DVD!
