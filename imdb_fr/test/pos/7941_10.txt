When I saw this film for the first time about 6 months ago, I considered it interesting, but a little more. But it took me. This interest grew, and I wondered if my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual quality of the VHS than with the film itself. I bought the DVD box Criterion and it turned out I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is an excellent film. It's exciting, and I'm sure he achieved his main goal: propaganda against the Germans. <br /> <br /> This is the most common criticism against this film, and against Eisenstein, that it is simply propaganda and nothing else. It's wrong. He is an incredible film artist, one of the most important who has lived. To this day, the world is far enough away from Joseph Stalin to be able to watch Eisenstein's films as art.
