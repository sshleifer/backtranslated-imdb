This film is brilliant ...... without a doubt. I watched it some time ago after constantly harassing family members who are in their sci-fi movies (which I am not), and I thought it was quite good. But having recently watched some documentaries about outer space, etc., we've watched them again ... and that's fine. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is arguably one of the greatest actors of all time and I really like Jeff Bridges (Lewbowski Big, Blown, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a retirement home who claims he is from another planet. Yeah, you think ... but if his story is so credible that even his psychiatrist starts wondering if he's telling the truth. <br /> <br /> This is how the story evolves, Bridges through all kinds of situations. emotions about Prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and fellow astronomer astronomers (who, after obtaining data from Prot, pretty much admit that it might be telling the truth!) A great movie ... that asks you ..... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
