I liked the fact that the atmosphere was light and airy. I loved the fact that the protagonist is asking for guarantees as to his future and that his roommate is clarifying the situation. I liked that they approach the dynamics of how the men's group treated each other, considering that it was led by a lesbian, the whole theme of masculinity was put forward, ridiculed, dissected and put into question. What makes a man? What makes you heterosexual, gay or bisexual? You're not really sure if our main character has decided who he really wants; he lives in the moment and has thrown prudence into the wind. These and other reasons make me love this movie.
