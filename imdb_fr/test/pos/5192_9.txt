I found the film very real as well as Saving Private Ryan and I gave an initial account of the German point of view. The graphic action and the individual characters greatly contributed to the interest of this film throughout the film. Stalingrad was a very brutal battle and the scenes gave this film the harsh reality of this battle. I recommend it to anyone interested in military history. It was the second time I watched this movie in a few years and it was once again captivated by its realism. Weapons, uniforms and hearing German while reading the subtitles earned him much merit for a good military film. In fact, being a German perspective of the battle, I pleaded for the Germans, even if they were the aggressor and the ultimate loser of the war.
