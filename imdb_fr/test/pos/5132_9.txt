Hoot was great. The owls are adorable and the film highlights an interesting environmental problem that I did not know. Florida is full of fun characters and the movie does a great job putting it on screen. My children especially loved all animals, from snakes to owls to alligators. It's really a simple story, but also a story they must hear at this age. When children are young, they really develop their sense of values. One of these must be concerned about our environment and all the creatures that live there. I think it's great that the movie even got a conversation with them about the animals coming home and how to help them. It was really sweet and enduring to hear my little girl tell how she wanted to save baby birds. Anyway, overall, it was a really good time and I would recommend the movie to anyone looking for something fun and meaningful.
