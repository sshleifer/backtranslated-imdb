My Uncle Antoine looks at the steep face of a community of villagers from different angles, slowly, taking his time from the beginning, as it should, until we come out of broken hopes (and banal) in a swirling ecstasy of dreams and heart. interrupt the revelation on the terrible enigma of mortality. <br /> <br /> Pans and aimless zooms across the snowy mountain comfort the mind and hypnotize the viewer. This agitated camera work is personified by a marginal character who is also the wanderer, leaving work at the coal mine and leaving his family to cut wood, then leaving again and returning to the human hardness of his dead son. <br /> <br /> An attractive old woman cheats on her husband and a young boy dies. Old things become new and new things die. The whiteness of the snow is as impressive as the history of the cinema.
