- only few people can understand Leland's character, and doing so is probably innate to see both sides of life, and dealing with this reality is very difficult and can lead some to bad acts (as does the Leland's character), but for such a sad and real reason why his intentions were good, in that the intention was to preserve another person from physical or mental pain (in this case) over a long time. and it is really sad to see how much everyone in this movie makes a mistake, but the character who makes one with good intentions dies. The lesson of this film is that the unique person can see, realize, face and correct the real situation you see and fix, or inspire the one who can right a bad situation. but before that ... you must see both sides of something and rationalize it in the interest of a long peace and the tranquility of all human life.aka-Don't Ignore
