It was a funny, simple and romantic film. I really enjoyed it and I would certainly say to look at it and appreciate it. Will Smith was funny, clumsy, nervous, kind and just a simple guy who was hit by Love. It was cute to see him fall in love with someone and be so nervous and lost what to do or say. It was great. He was awesome, funny as usual. Eva Mendes was better than I expected. I thought there were moments in the movie where Will got the round, he was doing everything he could to be a good guy and always get mistreated. The end was romantic and happy and it was great. I have seen it many times and I would watch it again. A funny movie, something you do not see often. He had the sense of old time with a new look.
