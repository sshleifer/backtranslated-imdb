I own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. I have seen a lot and I like all the good information that exists. Only a handful of people even manage to provide information as important as this one. I have read other people's reviews on this film and I can not help but notice that the main criticisms of people are unimportant. Such as "It's very one-sided", such a pathetic criticism, everywhere in the society where you look, you'll see the other side, and if you still need help, go to globalpublicmedia.com. "These are the same people over and over again" Uh, we might think these people are the experts, so maybe they are the best people to interview. "The style of shooting is the same, shots in mind with a few exceptions" If you want to flash and dazzle, look at Micheal Moore if you want more info look at real documents like this. As you can see, none of these complaints are relevant to the information contained. I imagine these people miss the point and do not want to give up their SUVs. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: watch her. Learn and continue your education on such topics. It is very important for everyone.
