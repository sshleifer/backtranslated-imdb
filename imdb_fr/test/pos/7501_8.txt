This film contains some of the best dialogues ever written. The very good sentences are all given to George C. Scott, a man who knew what to do with a juicy dialogue. I have just seen this film for the first time in 20 years, and the dialogue is as good as ever. The bizarre events at the hospital are so imaginative that they will dazzle you. They often appeal to a poetic justice so wonderful that they are almost brilliant. I love that movie!!
