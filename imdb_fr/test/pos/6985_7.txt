* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I thought Pitch Black was nice enough, with some cool effects - I liked bigger beasts, even though they were not part of Alien Aliens series patches. The atmosphere in the atmosphere Vin Diesel had contributed to was very good. <br /> <br /> The most troubling thing about me was the way it rained. If the planet has three suns and the daylight is almost continuous, where does the moisture come from to form clouds and therefore rain? <br /> <br /> I loved the fact that Fry died at the end - it reminded me of the new Hollywood movies of the 1970s, whose main heroine does not come to the end.
