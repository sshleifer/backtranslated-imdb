This Movie Is Excellent The passion between Jade & Billy is memorable and the acting has been great, so you do not let a 16-year-old like this one alone! This shows why a single mother should not go out with a younger man with a teenage daughter in the house, because he looked young enough to be Jessy's son. <br /> <br /> I give him ten out of ten, the actor It was wonderful and the movements between the actors were correct. <br /> <br /> The age difference between Jenny and Rob was good too, because they were the same age. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's fun movie, but I think no one under 13 should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes.
