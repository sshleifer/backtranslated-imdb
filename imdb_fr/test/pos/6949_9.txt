This is one of my favorite movies. The performances of Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music, the landscapes and the reality of the film are quite convincing. A look at a real, tell it as it is, logger, mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development. The music of the Horseflies is unique and adds a disturbing quality to certain scenes. After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to go out and buy the video and the soundtrack. All in all, a type of silent movie with bursts of panic. Torn and Cardinal are very credible in their roles. I put this film in the same category as Winter People with Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis, another favorite.
