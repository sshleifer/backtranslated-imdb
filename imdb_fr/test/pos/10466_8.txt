It started quietly. If you're looking for an action-packed movie, it's definitely not the right choice. All characters are slowly represented on the stage. Blow after blow on the canvas of the stage. Nobody can entrust his hands to the priest and the dedication of the sisters to life can only stay in the village. Philippa and Martina know their destiny, belong only to the village. So when you understand that, you are on the scene of the film, in the village that becomes everyone known at that time. When no technology can let you imagine anything but the countryside, the village, the sea. You feel the rhythm of life in this ancient village. Watching the film in a cold and snowy afternoon can lead you to approach this dinner with lavish expectations ... <br /> <br /> The last sentence that gives a title to the sacrifice of Babette far from Paris: an artist is never mediocre. <br /> <br /> Superb photography. Many situations describe portraits and landscapes as they were drawn on canvases in Jutland in the eighteenth century.
