Meryl Streep is perhaps the greatest actor working today. His chameleonic representations never fail to astonish; she actually seems to be the characters she brings to the screen. In "One True Thing", she brings to life a deeply complex and deeply complex woman who does her best to play the game that life has for her. Surviving with cancer is not an easy task, and not only surviving but continuing to live one's life is even more difficult - and that's exactly what Kate Gulden (Streep) wants to do. Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") not only defends herself in this exalted enterprise but shines as a daughter of Streep, who learns to see in a new light the life of her parents and her own. Streep is a powerhouse and earned an Oscar nomination for his work here; his dialogue "I will only say that once" with Zellweger will leave you devastated. Zellweger, however, is the true revelation: her face expresses all emotions, all conflicts as she begins to learn the many truths about the strengths and weaknesses of her parents. Director Carl Franklin ("The Devil in the Blue Dress") treats the content of the story with great seriousness and delicacy.
