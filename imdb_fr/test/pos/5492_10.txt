One of the best movies I've watched ... A good script, the original plot of a man who is haunted by the assassination of JFK while he was responsible for protecting him that cold November day. 1963. Thirty years later, another whimsical anti-social murder the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner en route to foolish gunmen who plot, lie and murder anyone on his way who opposes his mission. <br /> <br /> The film is accompanied by a beautiful memorable score and a sober but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood .... which shows how difficult it is to have a romantic life in this genre working. Malchovich is great, although many other candidates have been able to play the role he has played, but how many have acted with such cunning and intellect that he showed in the film? <br /> <br /> Needless to say I thought this was a good movie ... every time it's on TV, I have to watch it..and I have it on dvd! I am a big fan of Eastwood, it only strengthened his already fabulous career and the best role of Malchovich to date! <br /> <br />
