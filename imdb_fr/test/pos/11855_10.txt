Intense, funny, spiritual and more than anything else, a social comedy about relationships and results, good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are engaged to two months from the date of a wedding, when a strange event at their engagement party forces Nicholson to rethink the relationship and go out with other people so that she does not feel as pristine regarding the sexual experience. . This leads to a disaster of events following Mohr, Nicholson and their cohorts. Very intelligent and necessary in this period of clumsy and condescending comedy, while containing your usual variety of comic, sexual and frustrated characters (especially Charles as a sexually frustrated frustrated sex demon ... very annoying) who even seem to have the commentary feeling on this heart. <br /> <br /> The movie goes like the movies should do these days, showing that guys are sensitive to the heart and have a moral. Most of the male characters are moral and upright eyes, while the woman is a fresh-faced person lurking in the street who will stop at nothing to please herself. Guys will appreciate the message to self-respecting boys, but it's easy to assume that most men who see this movie will use their message of masculine sensitivity to hide any flaw or trait that a woman might find offensive. Nevertheless, the writing formula uses this tool to pave the way for his male lead roles, especially those of Mohr, Richter, and looking for the director in a cameo as a salesman! <br /> <br /> Women are by far the most disconcerting because they only talk about pleasure and what it would be like ... with someone else. However, they have friendly features, even if they are covered by the image of sexually dominant kittens. Very fun things. <br /> <br /> At another level, the film follows part of its ensemble in different relational works. Richter meets a stressed divorced (a VERY remarkable and remarkable performance of the always-reliable Helen Slater), named Penelope, who is divorced with a son who hates her for breaking up with her father. As the two go further in the relationship, human interest is revealed and the comedy and tragedy of divorce and the new beginning are studied. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson let themselves go beyond the head to see what was waiting for them, and that's what they learned about themselves and on themselves to decide what comes next. It becomes appropriate and dramatic at the right time. <br /> <br /> The direction of Wallodorski is very well imitated when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened ... with the good end. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film should have been broadcast nationally, and I hope the Oscars are coming back ... Maybe Helen Slater will finally get the recognition that she deserves. Anyway, this movie is an unbeatable success, give it all you have in the world of romantic sexual farce, displayed in a very mature and aesthetic way. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie!
