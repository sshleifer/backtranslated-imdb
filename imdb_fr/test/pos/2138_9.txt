At the time of its opening, Heaven's Gate had become, to its detriment, more a cultural phenomenon than a cinematographic film. At a time when concerns about excessive budgets and the arrogance of management were growing, it was a convenient target, as it was a far exceeded job in the budget of the last "author" of Hollywood, who had not still proven. gave him the benefit of the doubt among the critics and the industry. As someone pointed out at the time, no one was going to jump on even more expensive and darker "Reds" from Warren Beatty, because Beatty was "one of us", while Michael Cimino had not achieved this status. <br /> But "Heaven's Gate" was also affected by a cultural change underway at that time, the right-wing political movement and more unconditional patriotism and the entrenchment of the myth of the West (and West). A few years earlier, the demystification of the border by Cimino might have seemed timely, new and necessary. But in 1980, following the Reagan revolution, the film was considered almost anti-American. <br /> <br /> Which is a pity, because the film, seen for several decades, is a fascinating and stimulating look on this time and place as a world where life was, to use Hobbes' words, "naughty, brutal and short". Kristofferson plays James Averill, an upper-class oriental who, on his quest for adventure, becomes a sheriff of Wyoming, where he faces resistance from settlers and squatters against the attack of a mercenary hired death squad. by wealthy landowners. , including Averill's best friend for life. In a more innocent period, Averill and his "army" of poor peasants would emerge triumphant; but it's anything but a traditional Western, and when the American cavalry joins the fight, it's not on the side of the "good guys". <br /> <br /> A bit like "The Deer Hunter", Cimino's The previous movie, "Heaven's Gate", spends a lot of time explaining in detail the lives of its constituents, giving the film a sometimes casual rhythm that nevertheless leads to a striking conclusion. With an excellent acting, a beautiful score and the visual texture that suggests that we really see the "old west" from a new angle, "Heaven's Gate" is a film that rewards repeated viewing. I only wish that MGM publishes a new DVD, with an improved transfer and commentary from Cimino. Nevertheless, the current version is sufficiently satisfactory to allow viewers to see what the critics of 1980, possibly blinded by the cultural sub-texts of the film, were able to miss ... that "Heaven's Gate" is a great film.
