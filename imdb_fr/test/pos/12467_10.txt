Famous director Hugh Hudson (Chariots of Fire), beautifully filmed, creates a story that brings the legend of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke and Tarzan of the Apes alive with respect and dignity, and with a reach never seen in Tarzan films. Christopher Lambert makes his debut as a young Lord, raised in the wild by a gorilla after the death of his parents in Africa. Later, returned to what is for him a foreign world, that of class and privileges, he feels totally out of place. Once he learned what had happened to the monkeys who raised him and their world, he realized he had to go back. A sad but triumphant story told against a background of fantastic views. This is one of those movies that is a must for all Cinemaphile collections.
