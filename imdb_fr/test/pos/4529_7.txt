This is the thirteenth film of Falcon. Tom Conway has lost none of his humor and style and shows no sign of fatigue. The film has a very satisfying story, with lots of red herrings, suspects and ladies. Madge Meredith is the good girl of the story, she plays it adequately but never sets fire to the screen. Myrna Dell is a bad girl and she puts on an excellent stone face, with agate eyes, and you just wait for her to kill as many people as possible to cheer her up. Edward Brophy is back as Goldie's teammate, but surprised, his role as a maniac has stopped and he is under control. It's a great tribute to the directorial talent of William A. Berke, who has made so many westerns that he was probably not prepared to take a nonsense to a Brooklyn model. The result is that for the first time, probably in his career, Brophy was sufficiently attenuated to add something to a film rather than test the spectator's patience with the irritating behavior of a retarded but undisciplined child of six. years. Everything is going very well and is very fun.
