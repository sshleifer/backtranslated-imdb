Mum should be given a different title to distinguish it from all other movies in the world named Mom or the word Mom in the title. <br /> <br /> It's a zombie movie far superior to most garbage. this is repeated over and over again and ends up resembling all other zombie movies. <br /> <br /> It's so different and refreshing that it defies almost any categorization. <br /> <br /> The kind old lady who welcomes a scary tenant, who happens to be a flesh eater, who then infects the old lady who also turns into a carnivorous zombie or ghoul, which is not not exactly defined. <br /> <br /> There are pathos in the story when her son realizes what she has become and, at first horrified, tries to help him by providing him with food. (I will not say more about it, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) This is one of those "quiet" movies, as opposed to gun shots, explosions, car chases, etc. boring, etc. but always with enough bloody moments to satisfy the horror fans, while adding sadness to the story, as well as nice touches of humor, as opposed to the stupid stupidity of some so-called horror movies . <br /> <br /> is a very beautiful atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for company and looks so "innocent" but she becomes !! Oh my! <br /> <br /> A movie gem and even if it's not your thing, should at least be viewed once by any horror fan.
