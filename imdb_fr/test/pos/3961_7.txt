It's a teen movie, and even if you watch it, expect to add foolish stuff here and there, but overall the movie is very effective. it's not like its usual and tried way. the characters are well defined and convincing. Justin stays for a long time among all the others and watches over his speech. He will eventually convince anyone with this speech that he is simply brilliant in this speech. he needs to assume more serious roles, it's worth more than teen movies. burn this film and break free
