Michael Haneke is known for his disturbing films as "Funny Games". This time he adopted Elfriede Jelineks "Die Klavierspielerin", which is probably his best work to date. Jelinek always writes about abusive behavior within families, and especially about the repression of women in a patriarchal society. <br /> <br /> Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) is professor of piano at the Vienna Consecration Center. She still lives with her mother (Annie Giradot), they sleep even in the same bed (already a hint of strange). Erika intimidates her students in the same way as her mother, secretly watching porn movies and playing sadomasochistic games with herself. A student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), falls in love with her, but she refuses to sleep with him. She wants to play games with him, but he is disgusted. He reluctantly follows his rules, which means disaster for both. <br /> <br /> Haneke has a very clear language, everything is filmed almost spartanically, so that the complex characters and the story are highlighted. <BR /> <br /> People who do not know Austria very well may not realize how important the framework is to history. Jelinek (as well as other great Austrian writers like Thomas Bernhard) suffers from the coldness and carelessness of Austrian families and society. The Austrians (at least the Viennese) are often unable to express their suffering, their wishes, they suppress their emotions, so that there is often not enough love, affection and proximity in their families . In a society, where it is more important to show a perfect facade to society (even if it means protecting the crimes within families while Erika and her mother protect the rape of Erika by Walters to avoid a scandal ), rather than dealing with your emotional problems, this is probably not the case. I wonder why Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis in Vienna. Erika has a cold and distant relationship with her mother. They only share very violent emotions and not at all affectionate. Erika replaces her hidden emotions with vows of violence in order to finally release certain feelings. But since she does not have anyone who really wants to talk about her emotions, she has to stab herself to relieve her inner pain. <br /> <br /> Isabelle Huppert shows her best performance of her career (as well as most other actresses). With a smileless face, one often sees only a hint of emotion on his face, a quick smile, a look of the eyes. And in the end, his pain is masterfully displayed without a single tear. <br /> <br /> Benoit Magimel and Annie Giradot also perform powerful performances, but the film belongs to Huppert.
