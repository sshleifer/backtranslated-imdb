John Huston, actor and director best known for his more robust dishes such as "The Misfits" and "African Queen", directs his daughter, Angelica Huston, in what would be his latest film. Indeed, the film was released after Huston's death. Inspired by the news of the same name by James Joyce, "The Dead" tells the quiet story of a New Year's celebration in 1904 in Dublin. Huston, his cast and screenwriters, including his son Tony, created a film gem. The news is one of Joyce's best works (besides being the only filmable one). The film is a tribute to Huston's genius. He took a nice little story and made a nice little movie. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston shine (although "shine" is too bright, a word too bright to describe their quiet and discreet performance). "The Dead" reflects the love of the Huston family for Ireland and is, in its own way, an appropriate final film for a legend.
