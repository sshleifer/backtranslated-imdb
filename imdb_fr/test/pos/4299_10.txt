Nigel Balchin's novel, "A path through the woods", was adapted by Julian Fellowes, who also directs this "terribly British" thriller in a living room. It's a film whose effect is based on the distribution of benign / malignant characters, and it's here that Fellowes' choices are great. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the film lies in the metamorphosis of each player, as a single incident ignites a minefield disaster. <br /> <br /> James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a Solicitor obsessed with a successful business in London, married to Anne (Emily Watson) who needs more in her life: the childless couple lives in the countryside in a beautiful property, assisted by their "cleaning lady" Maggie (Linda Bassett). They attend social outings and meet, among others, William Bule (Rupert Everett), the passive rich neighbor lazy. Anne decides that they should entertain their neighbors and against the harsh protest of James, Anne proceeds to the planning: James makes sure not to attend for professional reasons. On the night of the party, there was a hit and run where Maggie's husband was accidentally killed by a person in a Range Rover (she observed). When James returns home, he sees a scratch on William's Range Rover and suspects William of being the author. Anne dissuades James from speaking to the police with the following information: "What good could be done, but can it ruin Bill's life as a mundane and father and son of a significant descendant? From this first "lie", the virus spreads: James confronts Bill who dissuades James from addressing the police, Anne confesses that it was she who drove Bill's car and that she was responsible for it, James convinces Anne to keep quiet because it would ruin her reputation, Anne, confesses that she has an affair with Bill and all three agree that they will remain united by their big lie for the good of all. Anne finally succumbs to the guilt of not telling Maggie that she is responsible for it, and Maggie, herself guilty of a previous robbery whose life was saved by Anne's mercy for hiring him. anyway, is the agent who pulls the story from his surprising conclusion. Lies breed lies that breed lies, et cetera. <br /> <br /> The major impact of this plot is how isolated tragedy affects each of the characters involved. Everyone changes dramatically. Tome Wilkinson gives the best performance of a career filled with brilliant performances: he is able to say more with his posture and his facial expressions than any actor in front of the public today. Similarly, the talented Emily Watson adds a beautiful role to his repertoire, as the astonishing smarmy Rupert Everett who, although still a rich "gentleman" British, gives us a man both spiritual and needy. And Linda Bassett, always so fine, plays a small role and fine-tuning it, which places it at the center of the chaotic chaos of lies. <br /> <br /> Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography and Stanislas Syrewicz's score add immensely to the many atmospheres that history encounters. This set plays at its best, which always means that the director (Julian Fellowes) has a good understanding of the piece. The interaction of these good people makes the dubious story work very well.
