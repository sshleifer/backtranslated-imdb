A must see! <br /> <br /> Excellent positive African-American love story. This movie reminded me to watch old black and white movies with my dad. More faithful to the life of the characters in search of love, to be in love and to lose it. Old story new view. Larenz Tate was in the style of Cary Grant, the character may be in a difficult situation, but the actor prevented him from appearing ridiculous and look like a cardboard cut. Nia Long has always been one of my favorites. She is sweet even when she is hard, almost like a Kathrine Hepburn. This is one of his best films and shows that he is better than always playing with angry black man <br /> <br /> This film is a classic, a great acting, well writing, a real love story taking place in Chicago, no more can you ask? <br /> <br /> SuperB Black Love Story <br /> <br /> Amsterdam, Netherlands
