It's the 1920s. And a man named Walt Disney had the mission to please families and children around the world with one thing: entertainment. What did he do? He made cartoons! Whoo !!!!! And he created a character as big as a mouse ... Mickey Mouse. Ha ha! Oh boy! <br /> <br /> Mr. Disney himself drew two films: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie". This review will focus on the 1928 feature film "Steamboat Willie". <br /> <br /> Since I know this movie as a little boy, I've always wanted to see this movie. Well, in 1997, I rented an old VHS that contained a lot of old Disney caricatures, featuring the mouse !!!!! Mickey the mouse !!!!! And guess what? These shorts were there, and I loved that !!!!! Shortly after taking back the tape, it was broadcast on the old Disney Channel (note: the "old" Disney channel) early one Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a beautiful cartoon. This paved the way for other Disney products from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars, indeed !!!!!
