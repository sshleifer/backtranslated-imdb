Crack House (1989) was one of the few films of the 80s to enter this genre. What is supposed to be an anti-drug film is really just an exercise in exploiting whites in depravity. There is nothing wrong with that though. The video even presents an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show Richard "turncoat" Roundtree, <br /> <br /> The film follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is an almost tough guy and the other is his daughter. One of them is fired by a mutual friend, while the other goes to slam and is then offered a chance to find his old friends. Jim Brown appears in the movie "Mister Big", it's a nasty guy who can always punish anyone and who is very sadistic and likes to hit his shovels and beat the stick against those who try to defy his word. Luke, from the General Hospital, is also invited. <br /> <br /> If you like hard movies, then this movie is for you. Unfortunately, Hollywood does not manufacture them anymore and when they do, it is neither exploitative nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Recommended for sleaze fans.
