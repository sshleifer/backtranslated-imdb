It's a film I keep coming back to, for a variety of reasons. Witnessing the suffering endured by the simple soldier of the Eastern Front during the Second World War, it is a powerful act. The film contains a number of very powerful scenes that help capture the horror of war, such as the tank battle for example. Moreover, from what I can see, the experiences documented in the film are "true" overall - if you read A. Beevor's book "Stalingrad", you will understand what I mean. The film is also successful in that it does not allow the character or plot to dominate it - it's simply a survival story that attempts to portray the battle primarily from a soldier's point of view ( German) ordinary. I read somewhere that the original script should be toned down, which does not surprise me at all. If they tried to really show what the battle was like, it would have been almost impossible to achieve, I'm sure. Still, there are still hard times to watch - this was done before Private Ryan, but perhaps even harder to hit in places. Just a word of caution - do not buy the qualified English version, it's pretty awful and spoil the movie - try to get a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, it's a lot more powerful . You may need to buy a DVD of Region 1 of the movie in this case, as I did.
