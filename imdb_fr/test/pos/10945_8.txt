With a movie starring the Twins, Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen, no one should expect a masterpiece of cinema. However, you get a fun movie that is nice for the eyes and the brain. There are lots of vampires in Hollywood (no Chinese leeches), pretty girls, beautiful heroes and sometimes very funny moments. And Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Of course, kung fu relies heavily on cabling and computer graphics. Of course, the script reminds you of Blade. And of course, this whole thing is immediately forgettable. <br /> <br /> But for a piece of cinematic fluff really nice, it would be difficult to find better.
