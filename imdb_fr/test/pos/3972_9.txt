Creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a long time to resume, at least for me because I expected it to be a long film from America Pie. But it was slightly different - a slacker who likes to have fun, who finishes high school and goes to his own college, manages it accordingly. As you can imagine, there are many parties and pretty girls in bikinis, but this movie was more difficult than your average teen movie. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his / her students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately to "push it to the system". The humor was varied which I loved. All the actors have achieved fantastic performances - rent this one with a friend, it's a fucking debacle!
