Let me leave many comments that I read here and say that this movie ranks among the top five obligations, with His Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love, Permit to Kill, and for Your Eyes Only ONLY the time that Roger Moore actually played the role of Bond, instead of playing poker). Of course, Sean Connery brings it all together - as a co-author, co-producer and in his best performance since From Russia With Love. He is fit, energetic and obviously having fun. His game is mature, confident and humorous. This is in contrast to his mechanical performance in Thunderball, his sleepwalking through You Only Live Twice, and his playful wanking through this cartoon known as Diamonds Are Forever! <br /> This is an imaginary retouch of Thunderball, without the scenery and machines overwhelming the characters and the plot. This distribution is far superior, too. Klaus Maria Brandauer brings her unique style to the role of Largo, without relying on an eye patch, a SPECTER ring or a boring uniform. Kim Basinger is sporty and adorable, Barbara Carrera is dynamic and for once we have a great Felix Leiter at Bernie Casey. The representations of M and Q are original and adding the Small-Fawcett hump agent is fun without falling into the movie. <br /> <br /> Director Irvin Kershner makes good use of his places (Bahamas and CÃ´te d'Azur) without losing sight of his actors. Although careful inspection reveals poor special effects and failures in continuity, Kershner continues to move the film forward at a good pace, unlike Thunderball (which even his director, Terence Young, did not like). It's obvious that fans will miss the gun-barrel brand and the 007 theme, but that they ultimately belong to Eon Productions. <br /> <br /> Michel LeGrand may not have composed the most memorable score, atmospheric places without being too intrusive. Unsurprisingly, his best moments are in the south of France, with his particularly appealing French love song (at the spa). And tell me, how much do you really remember Moonraker's music? Personally, I'd rather forget Man With the Golden Gun and A View To A Kill! <br /> <br /> The people of Eon can make fun of this film if they wish. (Yes, Octopussy made more money.) At least Connery's mature 007 did not swing into the jungle with a shout of Tarzan. He did not frolic with a Bengal tiger, nor fought the "Indian" snake charmers with a tennis racket. Despite Eon's desperate efforts to stop this production, Kevin McClory and the late Jack Schwartzman made an excellent film, which Ian Fleming would probably have appreciated. If you prefer to see James Bond being kicked in the shins by a dwarf, engage in a new boring battle with "Jaws", run to bed with Grace Jones or pursue a burlesque fire truck chase across San Francisco, it's not a movie for you!
