After Ms. and Mr. Iyer, here is another very good movie from Aparna sen (mostly in English). In the previous film, she dealt with a contemporary political environment and its effects on individuals. In this film, we discuss the impact of a family member with a mental disability and its impact on the family. As a parallel subtheme, it deals with a philosophical concept about "reality". It's a sobering film after watching the film. <br /> <br /> Mithee, the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, daughter of Aparna Sen) suffers from schizophrenia taken over by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi). Mithee, after his marriage to Jojo and his separation from him, still thinks of being with JOJO and his five children at 15 Park Avenue in Kolkotta (there is no such address in Kolkotta, it seems that there are some one in New York) and she is intense. in his belief. It's almost like an intense religious belief. In the end, what is the reality? In one scene, she tells Anjali "if I tell you that you are not a teacher, but just imagine that you are a teacher". The open end reflects this reality. In a so-called search of his home in Park Avenue, Mithee is lost. The penultimate scene is that of Mithee watching a group of five children playing and watching her happily return to her family, and then she is lost. About this reality concept, I'm thinking of another 1950s film called HARRY with James Stewart. The protagonist believes that a large rabbit (?), Called Harry, is always with him and that he always converses with him. In the end, even the doctor may think there is Harry. What is the reality, is it what the protagonist believes or what others believe? Shabhna Azmi dominates the film with her remarkable performance as a strong older sister with a frustrating undercurrent. Konkana Sen Sharma gives a performance as dignified as the schizophrenic. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is not as tight as Mrs. and Mr. Iyer. There seem to be some outstanding details. And maybe there are too many characters. Those who want a closed end may not appreciate the open end here. But the end adapts to the theme of the film. <br /> <br /> Another good film of Aparana sen.
