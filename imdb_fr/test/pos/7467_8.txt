I had the pleasure of watching these two chairs from (one of?) Executive Producers of the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laughed at times very different from those of us. <br /> <br /> Filmed In Atlantic Canada, the film is about three teenage girls who, in one of the last summers of their youth, spend a lot of energy sleeping with a 30-year-old married man. despite many protests. <br /> <This is really worth watching, but the humor was oriented towards a demography completely different from the one I live (Male 18-25 years), so I shook my head before the antics of the character rather than laughing. In spite of this, the story is strong enough to stand up and make it entertaining, without laughing too much.
