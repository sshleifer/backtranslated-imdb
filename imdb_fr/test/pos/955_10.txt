Am a ardent fan of Vijay. I have never seen one of his films as good as this one. <br /> <br /> It contains all the usual clich√©s that can be expected from a commercial artist. A hero who is bad at studies, but a star in his fort is Kabbadi. His friends to fill the comedy quota. A heroine in a situation of life or death. A villain I say is the best ever described by the protagonist. High octane tracking and action sequences. A music that can make you dance. And most importantly, a perfect scenario to keep all the above factors in a nice circle. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The director leaves no chance for the audience to relax. It just goes from one nail on the head to the other. And we can see the lighter side of Vijay in this film that he rarely performs. <br /> <br /> Everything has been said ..... This film has been and will be perfect for many years to come ....
