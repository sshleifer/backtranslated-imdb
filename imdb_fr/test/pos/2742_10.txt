This Oscar-winning short film, two sequels and a cartoon series on television features a minimal animation but a captivating storyline (by Theodore Geisel, Dr. Seuss) and a more memorable and enchanting main character. UPA launched an animation style that even influenced Disney in the mid-1950s and produced some of the best animated shorts made in the late forties and fifties. This is one of the best. God to have it printed. Highly recommended.
