Jack Webb's film, "The DI", was born from a real-life investigation into the death of several trainees in a swamp of Paris Isle in the 1950s. As always, Webb, as a patriot, came in defense like all the rest of his shows. I actually found this tamed film by the standards of 1957. I served in the army and I can understand the intensity of the training at Parris Island (Camp Death by some), so this film can never approach in the same way as "Full Metal Jacket". I think it's a good movie that's more patriotic than real. But again, think about the period of manufacture (1957) and what could be allowed and said on film at that time. I have always found Jack Webb very neat and very faithful. I know that many have criticized the film as one-sided and government propaganda. If you feel that way, watch Full Metal Jacket with R Lee Ermey. I am a fan of Webb and enjoy the film for its merit and not for its accuracy. As I said, Webb believed in this country and imposed high moral standards on its institutions (LAPD-Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency, etc.). Just sit back and enjoy this one of a very strict moral time period in this country. Do not be too critical of Mr. Webb. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas ..
