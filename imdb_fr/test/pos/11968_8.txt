When I went to see this documentary on the musicals of the communist bloc, I was expecting something completely crazy, like a communist "Cop Rock". Some scenes have delivered, including a catchy clip of a Soviet movie called "Tractor Drivers." face insurmountable obstacles. And yet, one of the surprises of "East Side Story" is that some of the films presented seemed promising. One of them was an East German attempt in the mid-1950s entitled "My wife wants to sing", in which, as her title indicates, an unhappy hausfrau seeks to embark on a singing career at the expense of objections from her husband to the traditional spirit. <br /> <Another really interesting film, also from East Germany, is called "Midnight Revue". In this film in a film, producers use their own creative problem by telling the story of a group of filmmakers under the Party's orders to make a musical. (The filmmakers on screen are themselves making a musical number to avoid the "hot" subjects of the 1957 movie "Silk Stockings" which is very similar to the tone, but it's always a pleasure to watch. the person who made it all possible.)
