Caught this 1969 movie on the MTC cable one night. I remember when I saw the movie for the first time in Hong Kong, I really enjoyed the songs and performances of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. I love Clark in Francis Ford Coppola's "Finian's Rainbow" (1968), alongside Fred Astaire, Don Francks and Tommy Steele. Simply ecstatic to learn that, finally, this delicious Irish-flavored musical is released on DVD! Ah, "it's that old devil's moon (in your eyes)." <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole in the role of Mr. Chips - yes, he sang - a real deliverance. He may not be a veteran of music like Rex Harrison, but he has lived this role to perfection. The scene of his run on the grass in his a-flying cape reminds me of the PBS series "To Serve All My Days" - a kind teacher and a loving man, he is: "Mr. Chipey, Clark and O'Toole we have somehow given the right mixture of sperm and circumstances.The songs and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse are catchy as usual.The tunes of "you and me" and "walk in the world (with me)" have remained with me the most during all these years And there is "How much flowers", "And the sky smiles", "Fill the world of love" - ​​not syrupy at all Sometimes I think that if the world is immersed in the songs and words of Bricusse, we would overcome all conflicts on earth and "charming" would remain all day! Yes, "Talk to the animals" too. ("Doctor Doolittle" 1967) <br /> <br /> > Musical comedies are a blessing for the world of movie buffs, they are in some ways larger than life. and the words of the Sherman Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.) who gave us "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - who would not feel absolutely delighted to simply pronounce "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ""? Even a song and a dance number featured in the Spanish film "Km.0 - Kilometer Zero" (2000) amazed me. My favorite of all time is "Young Girls of Rochefort" (1967) by French filmmaker Jacques Demy with the colorful actors Catherine Deneuve and (late sister) Françoise Dorléac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Danielle Darrieux, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris singing and dancing The music of Michel Legrand. Long live musicals.
