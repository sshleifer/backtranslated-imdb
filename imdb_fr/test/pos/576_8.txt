I give it 8 out of 10 because it's a cult classic. It is also led by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan, who also plays Jarvis in the film. Listening to the recent blogtalkradio show called AARF (Robert Morgan is co-host), he says that because it's become a cult classic and he's doing well at movie conventions, he's planning to do a sequel to this movie. . I think he said that two of the original stars have signed and he hopes to have some others. Robert is a good man and I hope it's okay. He has devoted more than 50 years of tireless work as a researcher Sassquatch (who is also one of my interests) and author. Watch his show on the paranormal and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II in the near future.
