True stories make the best stories, do not they? A story, be it a novel, a movie or something else, always has something nice, the simple fact that it is real makes the story all the more fascinating. This film is based on a true story of two young American men, a government employee and hawk enthusiast - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) - and Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn) - is a drug dealer. These two men begin to sell their secrets to the government, mainly to the CIA, in 1975 in the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men, as well as on their growing personal issues (including the character of Penn Addiction) rather than glorifying their status as traitors in the United States, which would undoubtedly damage the credibility of the film in the United States. Boyce becomes more and more cautious and ends up becoming frustrated and paranoid as their relationships drag on and become deeper and deeper into treacherous territory. Daulton becomes more addicted and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened and more desperate to keep control of a situation over which he has no control - in addition to what he already has problems with the law. The torment of the families of Boyce and Daulton because of the way in which they lead their lives is also well described and adds to the idea that espionage against his country, even if it is believed justified, only leads to major problems and the ruin of lives? ? including the degradation of friendship and trust between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Here is the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> --Hutton and Penn have each done extensive research on the characters to capture their appearance and their personal feelings. They are therefore described with a lot of depth and realism. <br /> <br /> - The acting game is excellent. <br /> <br /> - The atmosphere of paranoia is building up very well. <br /> <br /> - The story is fascinating and, of course, as an event based on real events, she has even more talent. <br /> <br /> --Nice sets. <br /> <br /> - The Soviets working with the Boyce and Daulton are very well portrayed and are not stereotyped or given to perverse consciences for the sole purpose of making them look bad. <br /> Did not hurt It did not help me: <br /> <br /> --The music is fine, nothing perfect though. <br /> <br /> --The sound effects are sometimes a little uncertain - this was the case with many movies from the 70s to the 80s. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> < br /> --Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman we barely know. Because of Boyce's troubles with the US and Soviet governments, his life may be jeopardized, but it is not as developed as it should be. Minor problem, however. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a bit worrisome. Nothing like a state of constant non-vigilance so that the masses do not feel as safe as possible. <br /> <br /> Scene memorable: <br /> <br /> --Read the first report of the CIA accidentally sent to the wrong place with The reason is "a restless night". <br /> <br /> It was another film that had suffered considerable delays because of the controversial content of the story. The studios and producers have not seen how a film about two American traitors could be accepted by the American public. Fortunately, he was filmed and represented with a lot of class and quality. Of course, it is useful for traitor anti-heroes not to be described heroically, rather as a couple of young men who have made gross errors of judgment in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama and very well and very faithfully interpreted. <br /> <br /> Actors: 9/10 History: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character development: 9/10 Special effects / Makeup: 8/10 (small quantity, high quality) Nudity / Sexuality: 2/10 (a scene in a striptease club) Violence / Gore: 7/10 (no gore, just a little violence) Music: 7/10 Direction: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Jewelery: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10 <br /> <br /> General: 8/10 <br /> <br /> If you like movies about spying and spying, then you can not go wrong here.
