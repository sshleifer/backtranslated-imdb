Alejandro Amenabar, the young and talented Spanish director, shows us clearly that he is a serious filmmaker. Anyone who doubts, should take a look at his latest movie "The Sea Inside". It's a film that has been honored with numerous awards, not only in Spain, but around the world, wherever this wonderful film was presented. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you might like to stop here. <br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro is a man confined to bed. Being quadriplegic, it depends on the kindness of strangers for everything. Since his accident, Ramon thinks only of one thing: to put an end to his days! This is the moral question at the center of the story, based on the real life of Ramon Sampedro. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view. There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part. After all, he relies on facts well known in his country, as this case has become a "famous cause" in favor of euthanasia, a theme that no one in this country has wanted to treat in Spain. <br /> <br /> As a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Spain has become one of the most democratic societies in Europe, a most notable distinction due to its long years of dictatorial rule. However, despite the progress of this society, the idea of ​​committing suicide is not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens, who still considered this topic as something that could not be done in their country. <Br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro was a man who loved life. As a young man, he lived an intense life when he enlisted in the navy to discover the world. Having no money, it was the only way for him to see other countries, to experience other cultures. The love story between Ramon and the sea is something Galicians learn to love from their childhood. Imagine how this same friendly sea is the one that kidnaps Ramon's life, as he knew it! In an instant, Ramon goes from a vibrant young man to a vegetable! <br /> <br /> Ramon's family is upset by the experience. Suddenly, they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home. His brother and sister-in-law are stoic people who manage the situation. Their life becomes an afterthought, because Ramon's life is paramount. They take care of the patient without protesting or blaming Ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive. <br /> <br /> That's why, in their minds, the Sampedros can not understand Ramon's wish to end his life. all. Have not they abandoned a normal life to care for him? This moral issue weighs heavily on these simple and uncomplicated people, because in their minds they do what has come naturally. <br /> <br /> The second subject of the film is the legal problem of euthanasia and well-intentioned people who suddenly enter Ramon's life in their desire to help him end his suffering. There is Julia, the lawyer herself disabled and suffering from a rare disease. There is Rosa, the fish curator who is passionate about Ramon. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, makes a brilliant Ramon Sampedro. His transformation is total. We do not doubt for a moment that there is no one but the paralyzed man on this bed. Mr. Bardem can only use his face to express all the emotions trapped within Ramon. Mr. Bardem makes this man real. This is perhaps the best role of Javier Bardem of his career. He surpasses his own award-winning performance as Reynaldo Arenas, the last Cuban poet he described in "Before Night Falls". <br /> <br /> In secondary roles, Belen Rueda makes an impressive appearance in the role of Julia, the woman who fights for her own physical problems. Lola Duenas is as efficient as Rosa, the soul mate who loves Ramon deeply. Celso Bugallo, as Ramon's brother, shows a man at a turning point in his life. Mabel Rivera is a compassionate Manuela, the sister-in-law who never asks for anything of life, but tends towards Ramon without wondering why she should do it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar also composed the haunting score of the film. He is a man who keeps on surprising. We wonder what will be his next project, but we wish him success in all his projects.
