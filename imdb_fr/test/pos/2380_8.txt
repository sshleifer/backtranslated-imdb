Mexico's monster, I agree, is the weakest of Scooby Doo's modern films, mainly because of the weakness of the plot and the predictability of it all. However, the monster of Loch Ness represents a considerable improvement, with a superb animation. Honestly, Scotland was beautiful. The music is good and the plot is well thought out. In addition, there are very good dialogues and dubbing is fabulous. Casey Kasem is a constant pleasure in Shaggy and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten a pleasant surprise in a guest performer role. In fact, my only criticisms were strange accents in one or two members of the cast, with the exception of Easten, whose accent seemed authentic, and the Loch Ness monster was not as well designed as he was. potential. Overall, a Scooby Doo movie sound and nice. 8/10 Bethany Cox
