It took years for Bruce Campbell, cult icon, to launch this project - but he finally did it, it's here - and what a great show of schlock! Looking at the plot; it sounds like two things. An ideal base for a very ridiculous movie B and an unscrupulous excuse for Bruce Campbell: what he does best - the wacky humor of Evil Dead II style, and this film takes into account the two points. The man with the screaming brain is nonsense of comics - but there are some very beautiful scenes, and it's almost impossible to get bored with this movie. Bruce Campbell wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this movie - and while it's not quite Citizen Kane, it's a feat for the most famous man in the world. is beaten on his own in a wooded hut. The plot follows American businessman William Cole on a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend. The trip goes bad, however, when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead; thank you to the same woman. The mad scientist Stacy Keach is about to merge Cole's brain with the taxi driver's brain; and we have a cult gesture on our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is fun and has some laughter; but once the main plot point has been executed; the film really resumes. Bruce makes the best use of the screenplay in all sorts of silly situations, whether it's changing clothes in a garbage bin or deciding (with the taxi driver in his head) what to eat in a restaurant. The humor is mostly burlesque, and anyone who appreciates Evil Dead II (which should be the one who saw it) will probably benefit as well. It seems that Campbell is working a little too hard on this whole project, but if you listen and do not see Bruce do what he does best, a disappointment will follow. On top of that, no lack of respect towards the man; but he has never been the actor with the greatest range. Despite being very funny; the film is not great, it sometimes becomes a little too silly; and there is a whole sub-plot with a robot that I did not like; But overall, The Screaming Man is a movie we unfortunately do not see much nowadays. The film is a flawless B film. and he deserves respect for that if nothing else.
