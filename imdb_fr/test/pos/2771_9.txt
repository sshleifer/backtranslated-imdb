does anyone know where I could get my hands on this video or film? I have been looking for it for a long time to show my daughter to show it to her and I can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they had never made DVD, VHS or idk. <br /> <br /> I saw this straight from Disney in 1996 and I think it would be the best video to show him. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the film. also has a lot of actors who started their career with this movie. If anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and is willing to sell it to me for $ 50 or something, please call 201-566-0148. Thank you
