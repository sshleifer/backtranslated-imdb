I saw this film in Buffalo about 30 years ago, on television, late at night. I'm dying to see him again before ... well ... you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) "captured" his prey (Anne Jackson) during a failed kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. The portrait of a dean (?) Or a neurotic university department head by Charles Nelson Reilly is priceless. How many films can you name to enlighten humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end? This film reminds us that we are all in the same struggle, regardless of class, race, sex or religion. And who can forget the scene of the owner of the suburb on all fours that attacks these few small herbs that dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicured lawn!
