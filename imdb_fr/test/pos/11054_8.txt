This is a surprisingly well-filmed adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill play. The major disadvantage is the static camera, and as a result a part of the film is filmed, which is a shame, because it is a good primitive film, made at a time when the sound posed all sorts of things . technical problems, and therefore most of the films were experimental, whether or not the intention of their creator. Garbo is as mysterious and charismatic as in his silent films, and his entry is still classic. His voice is strangely deep, almost childish, which only reinforces his character already seductive and eccentric. As a boyfriend, Charles Bickford is decently manly - he is apparently a rugged born - and the perfect equivalent of the divine Garbo. His Irish style is not bad at all and he always seems to be a natural man of the sea, very similar to O'Neill in his independent and dark nature. As a (very) confused father of Garbo, George Marion really seems from another era. He has the kind of face and voice - open, without manners, totally meaningless - that has disappeared from the earth. Marie Dressler is also in the O'Neill things swing. Her empty expression and intensity around the eyes speak volumes, as she plays her arrogant woman character on the verge of psychosis. Poetic license, perhaps, because it is not in the script, but we can forgive the excesses of Miss Dressler; she is too good not to do it. The story ends with a move toward the next thing, as opposed to the resolution, which is not the author's cup of tea; and those who love their carefully crafted films at the end will be disappointed by the lack of real surprise. In Anna Christie, we find ourselves in O'Neill's country, a place of sea, storm and fog, a pervasive and damnable sense of uncertainty that we would now call Ambivilance or Anxiety Neurosis. Rather than analyze this state of mind, the author presents it simply and wisely, while the weather, the land, the ocean and people intertwine and address each other in a unique language that we feel privileged to have heard.
