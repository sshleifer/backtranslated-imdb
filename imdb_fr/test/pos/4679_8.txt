- surprising film - <br /> <br /> - A group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg robbing a gold safe in Italy and, fortunately, the flight is successful and they are doing without big problems. Before the band can celebrate, Steve played by Ed Norton decides he wants the gold himself, pulls a 'Ta' on the band and shoots one of the limbs. He and his accomplices leave thinking that the group is dead but fortunately, the group is not dead. A year later, we find the story of the group that found Norton and decided to recover the gold and spend the rest of the film to prepare a plan to recover their gold and settle their account. <br /> <br /> - It was a surprise for me, it was all necessary to be a typical summer movie, but it was memorable and really fun to watch. What I like is that the film's shots are smart and well thought out and that the film is realistic. Watching the trailer would make you think it was a stupid action movie, but in fact, there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are all really well done. This last action scene lasts 20 minutes. scene that has one of the best car chases of all time. I like how real the pursuit is and how old things are, without the help of CGI. Personally, I enjoyed this car chase more than the CGI hunt in "Matrix 2". I remember watching music videos from director F. Gary Gray and always seeing how well they were made and thinking he would make an excellent filmmaker. In fact, I was always right and he proves it here. I can not wait to see what he does next. <br /> <br /> -The actors are also doing a decent job, Seth Green being my favorite of the group. The other thing I liked was John Powell's excellent score. Since I heard his score for "Robots" this year, I'm a fan of him, I'm very attentive to his music and this man is really good. It does a great job in avoiding all the typical musical snaps of the summer action movies and provides a very well done score. I have not seen the original on which this is based, so I can not really say how much it compares to that one. <br /> <br /> -So yes, it's an excellent popcorn movie that actually has a brain unlike most of the shit of summer movies that comes out. Has great characters, is funny like hell and has an incredible score of John Powell. If you like burglary movies, then you'll love this one <br /> <br /> - you know, if I was in the band, they would call me nice mike
