Vidor shines in the role of Judith, the only truly strong and compassionate member of a strictly patriarchal family. His brother, David, is so oppressed by his father that it is a surprise that he can even tie his shoes, rather than ask his father to do it for him. <br /> <br /> Other critics have already described the plot, so I will not dwell on it; I will point out, however, that Nan, who is pregnant with David, is also married to him. This is not an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which would have been horrible by the standards of 1921. The two are secretly married, but Nan's father, paid by David's father, tears up their marriage certificate. <br /> <br /> The scene of Nan's death, in the presence of Judith, is a truly heartbreaking and extremely emotional experience. This scene alone is worth watching, but the plot is much more than that; why on earth are modern films not done with the same attention to history?
