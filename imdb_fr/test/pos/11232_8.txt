When Northfork debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, many people did not like it because they found it boring and too slow. Although I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest movies of the year), it was not boring. As Roger Ebert said, "there has never been a film like Northfork". I do not generally agree with Ebert, but for once, he's telling the truth. Although John Sayles' Sunshine State may have some of the same immediate themes, none of what I have ever seen or known can even compare to the striking originality of Northfork's Polish brethren. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a perfect example of how often it is better to walk a few more minutes to go to an art house movie instead of the latest Jack Black movie. The plot is not a used plot, a biscuit mold; it's so original. Northfork, a small town in Montana, has a nearby dam that is about to be demolished. Therefore, the whole city must be evacuated. Some people, however, just do not want to leave. In an annex plot, a young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very sick and bedridden; he is supported by father Harlan (Nick Nolte). The boy imagines himself, as it were, as a fallen angel who helps him out of his illness. <br /> <br /> Although most of the film is simple, some of it could give David Lynch the courage to run. money. There are strange weather conditions, a weird, wooden dog, huge, and a symbolism that would make Fellini proud. It's not as confusing as a Lynch movie, but it's still pretty strange. That's what makes Northfork so great: it's so amazing and yet so simple and plausible. <br /> <br /> Northfork has a magical atmosphere: it's almost as if you're looking at something you're not quite sure what it is, but you're fascinated by it. As I said earlier, I agree with Ebert about the similarity of this movie. However, I do not agree when he says it's not entertaining. He goes on to say that it is "exciting". Maybe he just thought he should give good reviews because everyone does it, but instead of saying how slow he was, I always thought it was a lot of fun, something that a lot dramas can not do now. It may not be the fastest film or the most popular film, but if you get to it and you go through it, you'll be extremely surprised, like me. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> PG-13 rated for brief sexuality.
