I lived in this area (Hoboken and Jersey City) for about ten years. This film certainly captures the feeling of that time and this place. The dialogue is very good, the music is correct and the scenarios are realistic. As another poster says, it looks almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I love the way he humanizes these kids, who would probably have preferred to be born in Westchester, but who fall into what they fall. It turns out that the region is quite rough. <br /> <br /> They demonize the cops a bit, but that's to be expected. I would say that the acting is good in all areas. <br /> <br /> This gives the viewer an idea of ​​how this idiocy is caused and is exaggerated. Hopefully the new mayor of Newark is progressing.
