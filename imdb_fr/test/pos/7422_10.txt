Terry and June, in my mind, is a classic of all time. In the ranks, bless this house with the late sid james and the late diana coupland, but terry scott will be sorely missed even though he died in 1994. dvds to the press and I look forward to getting the 9 , I would also be delighted to see the DVD "happy after ever" published on DVD <br /> <br /> June whitfield continues to be powerful and Terry Scott will always live in my memory <br /> <br /> terry scott rip there are not many comedies today that I can think of that will remain in the list of legends and yes, the middle class is coming up on some wicks, but that does not bother me, I think it would be great to see a celebration of terry scott's life
