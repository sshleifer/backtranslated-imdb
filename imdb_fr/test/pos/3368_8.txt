I did not know what to expect from THE BOX. I'm a big fan of Darko, but I also saw the mess that has become of Southland Tales, whether or not it's a botched studio, who knows. With the box I was pleasantly surprised. It was a return to classic sci-fi paranoid movies that evoke sneaky events that are much larger, but centered on an intimate character. <br /> <br /> The slowness and the terrifying tension were very effective for the tone and the theme. of the entire movie. Any change in such a rhythm would have led to the typical Hollywood style or "MTV", which simply would not have served the purpose of this story. Everything from the strange extras who staked out all the way through the score, through the lowest score, to the minimal explanation of exactly what was happening, added a whole thread of fright under- lies and the feeling of hope more and more reduced for our greedy meaning, main characters. It was something well thought out and implemented by Richard Kelly, from the first act to the end. The story of Richard Matheson, on which it is based, NOT the Twilight Zone ep, which was another version of the story, was one of morality and greed that were still the central elements of THE BOX. Having only 8 pgs long and turning it into a substantial feature would not have been an easy task, but it was done with style, originality and gives the viewer long reflections on the film. Many compared this to DARKO and compare it to see if it's so deep, but I found it to be a completely different film, thematically and emotionally. His tone is completely different, as are the messages and intentions of this film. Where Darko has left us questions internally, THE BOX is giving the viewer more external questions, involving the world around us. For example, knowing human nature, would the BOX test finish? Decent acting, beautiful scary graphics and a menacing atmosphere add to the slow pace. It's not for everyone, but for those who come from where it comes from, it's a treat.
