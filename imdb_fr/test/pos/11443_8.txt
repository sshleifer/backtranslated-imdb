Night Of The Demons is definitely one of the eighties horror movies in the same vein as the brilliant Evil Dead and Demons movies. This film combines teenagers and demons with overflowing sexuality in a fun movie. A welcome addition after the 80s has been invaded by slasher movies. It was nice to see something a little different. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenagers who all end up for a Halloween party at the hull house. was once a funeral home organized by Angela. About 40 minutes of alcoholic beverage and sexing eventually lead to a demon or demons coming out of the furnace and each having teenagers. Add some attractive make-up effects, lots of cool and cool demons, and get a sweet 80s cheese treat, rated as one of the best demon movies in the list of horror movie fans. <First of all, I loved the scenery of this movie. "Hull House" is really scary and scary. This is the perfect setting for a horror movie. Moreover, when the demons emerge, the action really begins and becomes a night of terror and fear. This film spawned 2 sequels, the first in 1994 which was acceptable, but nothing was compared to that, and the third titled Demon House was absolutely horrendous. This is one of those horrors that has stood the test of time and remains a jewel for many years to come. <br /> <br /> In summary, a fun and fun movie about cheese with Demons is definitely worth the detour.
