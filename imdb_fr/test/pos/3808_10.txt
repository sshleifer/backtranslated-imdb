It's a surreal and entertaining road movie. It was written by Joseph Minion, who also wrote After Hours, the excellent surreal film by Martin Scorsese. The film follows the adventures of a ten-year-old boy, Gus, who drives a red Ford Mustang in fictitious states with names such as Tristana (a tribute to Luis Bu√±uel's film, perhaps?), Essex and South Lyndon , looking for eight elusive Motorama gaming cards from various Chimera Company gas stations. The film has a surrealist feel because a lot of things are unusual, like money for example, that looks like blank paper with numbers. <br /> <br /> Most characters are mean with Gus trip. They tattoo it, strike it, but it does not stop the child in his relentless pursuit. Some strange actors, like the current David Lynch, Jack Nance, Meat Loaf & Flea, also make appearances. Jack Nance plays a motel owner who, in his first meeting with Gus, says, "If you see squirrels, give them to me." It's a movie where a man and his wife give up their young children because he owes Gus $ 100; and a mother encourages her son to speak louder while speaking roughly. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and surreal movies, you'll love this. A strange little gem of a movie.
