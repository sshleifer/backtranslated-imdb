Naked City: JWAB does a great job balancing his two A - B stories, even though I do not really like multi - plot movies. And Scott Glen and Courtney B. Vance make a good duet on screen. However, I'm not sure what kind of message a movie sends when two barefoot country girls can escape murder and robbery, and to top it off, win a free return flight-at least the appearance of their clothes anyway). Gee, I guess this wall of blue silence is still thinking about it! <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
