I watched the external critics (Ebert, etc.) of this movie and they were all rather negative. However, after reading many of them, I noticed that they all had the same argument. Critics were annoyed by the fact that the film revolves around what appears to be a senseless murder of an autistic child. It is certainly a disturbing image. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective novel that explains why the murder took place and outright blame the culprits. They want blame to be cast and resolved. Well, this theme of the status quo is a little what the movie parodies. Like society, the critics wanted a very fast resolution so they could move on to their next tragic opera. Perhaps there is no simple question to answer here? There is much more to what has happened than to what is on the surface. The film does not seek to rationalize what is happening, but to understand why. The thing that bothers me a lot in these silly reviews is that all they see as performances is Spacey and Cheadle, both of which were awesome (and usually are). But there are other great performances at work here besides the two current Hollywood icons. Gosling gives an incredible performance that only a person of his extreme talent could offer. In one way or another, Gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child friendly. That irritates a lot, I'm sure. However, if we look at the film, we see what is the motivation of Leeland, it's wrong, but it's not bad. Malone is also at the top of her game as a confused young character. Basically, the murder of the child in this film is not the main theme of the film. The main theme is life itself and the way people go about it, the ups and downs, and the way they sometimes try to help others cope with their lives (which does not seem like very well work). There is a lot of good and bad in this world and the way we treat each one has a direct impact on the growing number of good and bad, and sometimes a confused attempt to do good can lead to much more bad . I think it's one of the most memorable films at one time and its end is as touching as anything in the recent history of cinema. I firmly believe that people should see this film with an open mind.
