It's hard to know what to do with this strange little Australian detective film - on the one hand, it's a nice little movie with a great sense of humor; but on the other hand, it simply lacks something that guarantees that the film never goes beyond its limit and keeps it trapped in a simply "interesting" territory. That said, Two Hands is a well-planned film that juggles perfectly with several stories at the same time, allowing several small climaxes throughout the film, helping to prevent the film from becoming boring. The absurdity of the events, the thick Australian accents and the weird character set help to make the movie entertain as well. The plot follows the story of a young doorman who thinks he will go for bigger things after accepting a job from the local linchpin. He does not do it; his work only embarrasses him when he wants to swim and stupidly leaves ten thousand dollars on the beach, which is quickly stolen by two children who spend their lives shopping. However, not everything is rosy for our hero; who must find the money or face the consequences ... <br /> <br /> The film is composed of a distribution of unknowns; at least it was in 1999, as Heath Ledger is today a name. It does not impress too much here, though, as its performance is mostly from note to note and does not constitute a very compelling track. It corresponds to the film to the extent that it is Australian and looks naive; but beyond that, it's not the best role I've ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Bryan Brown gave the best performance here. He may not have much time on the screen, but he steals all the scenes in which he is and it is he who gives the film a lot of humor. However, it has nothing to do with the best sequence that probably takes the form of the most hilarious bank robbery ever filmed. Overall, I can recommend this film to fans of original crime movies. as the strange is abundant, and the manner in which events take a turn for the strange is pleasant; but if you're not a fan of this kind of movie, I can not really say that Two Hands will float your boat. It's not a must, but if it's your thing and you have a chance to see it ... you probably will not regret it completely.
