15 Park Avenue Aparna Sen is a film about the nature of reality. <br /> <br /> A delirious girl, prone to imagining things and hearing voices, perhaps out of sheer boredom, is considered schizophrenic by her learned father and educated elder sister-in-law who is keen on control . Controlled, frightened and treated as an invalid (even if out of love and affection), she has a chance to develop as a normal person. When a boy proposes to marry her, her father and half-sister passionately try to convince him not to take such a step. A traumatic experience, caused mainly by her existence at the shelter, finally prevails on the line of no return and she lives full time in a delirious world. <br /> <br /> The family and society around him do not tolerate his delusions and want to suppress them with drugs, electric shock therapy, everything, even if they all have ideas delusional. <br /> <br /> His mother does not see the irony of letting a ghost treat him with illusions. Her half-sister is a professor of physics and taught, among other things, quantum mechanics, a subject in which many experts accept parallel multi-universes and many more dimensions in space than the previous three. A friend admires an experience with a holy person who claims to hear hallucinatory voices. Far from it, George W. Bush has real or false illusions about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction and is allowed to invade Iraq. <br /> <br /> As some viewers have already pointed out, Aparna Sen has refrained from attacking the mother of all illusions - the dominant religions, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> In other words, the accepted reality is what an influential majority or minority believes. This has been the case since the beginning and many more people than Mithali in the film, including Bruno and Galileo, have suffered as a result. <br /> <br /> The controversial and difficult ending of the film was necessary to show that it was a film about the nature of reality and not the case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> All the actors performed well, but Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma excelled. Aparna Sen produced a remarkable philosophical film.
