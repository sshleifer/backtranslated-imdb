It's a piece of cinematographic beauty, and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work from the beautiful province. This entails everyone in a first-person experience of culture, to the point that you want to stick your hair in place and live, breathe and eat everything from Maurice Richard. The book does this as well as the short film, and I am happy to note that during all the time I spent studying French in high school, I had to read in both languages. <br /> <br /> I thought it was brilliant. that Roch Carrier tells this story. His thick molasses accent brought a lot of realism to the story. The animation was good too, very surreal, which draws attention to the fact that it is a phantasmagorical daydream dreaming of beautiful days. <br /> <br /> Once again, a symbol of Quebec culture, it is unmatched. We almost feel the pie baked slowly on a wood stove. All this film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be Canadian, and encourages us all to enjoy the good things of the family and our roots. I come from Ontario and this film made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard will always live in our hearts.
