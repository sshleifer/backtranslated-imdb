For most of us, life is a developing love process. For others, like Soo-mi, however, he is dominated by darkness and fear. Based on the Korean folk tale Jangha and Hongryun, Kim Ji-woon's brilliant Gothic horror tale A Tale of Two Sisters revolves around two sisters, Soo-mi (Lim Su-jeong) and Soo-yeon (Mun Geon-yeong), who are part of a dysfunctional family living together in a Victorian mansion. Feeling remote from the world, they unite to survive with the old Soo-mi who obsessively protects the young Soo-yeon against danger. For Soo-mi, however, not accepting the circumstances surrounding the death of her mother means a mental illness and a mind that contradicts reality. <br /> <br /> Although we can recognize commodities such as haunted houses with apparent appearances, A Tale of Two Sisters admirably explores the deeper psychological meanings, including the inability to unleash inner demons and the misplaced desire for revenge. Soo-mi says, "Do you know what's really scary?" You want to forget something, totally eliminate it from your mind, but you can never do it, it can not disappear, you see. he follows you like a ghost. " There is a timeline but the viewer has time to get rid of it. The plot can not be summarized, only suggested and the movie keeps asking us if what happens on the screen is objective or subjective. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, Soo-mi, a visibly disturbed young woman, interviewed by a doctor in a setting that looks like a psychiatric facility. When the doctor asks him to describe what happened "that day," the film quickly comes to mind when Soo-mi and Soo-Yeon return home to their father Moo-hyeon (Kim Kap-su) and his wife. mother-in-law Eun-joo (Yum Jung-ah). The mother-in-law is hostile and resentful and the father is passive and distant, but it is obvious that it is Soo-mi who is really suffering. When girls try to readjust, they are constantly frightened by a presence in the house, which can be a nightmare or a supernatural event. <br /> <br /> Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed that hovers over her. and dripping with black blood, a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and convulses, a monster emerges from the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear photographs and numerous other manic schizophrenic devices so that the spectator remains suspended on the edge of madness. Although we feel that much of the story is a projection of someone's mind, we do not know who and the film constantly challenges us, at least until a clue important is offered in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> Filmed in beautiful low light cinematography, A Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and worldly beauty that transcends all fears, and there are many. It haunts in more than one sense of the word and its images can look at you when you least expect it. Although the film does not offer much light to the weary traveler, it shows us where we can meet if we opt for darkness. According to a wise observer, "Blame is never the answer - whether to blame or blame others, the solution is to get out of judgment, to yourself AND to others." understanding have great healing power.
