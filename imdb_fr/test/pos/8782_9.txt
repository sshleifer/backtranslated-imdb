Ah, Hitchcock! It's hard to find a bad Hitchcock movie before losing it after THE BIRDS (1963) and SABOTEUR proves the point. Having admired most of the director's work for many years, I had been able to ignore it, perhaps because of Priscilla Lane and Robert Cummings' lack of interest as key players. Of course, I knew the high point of the Statue of Liberty after seeing it several times in movie retrospectives, but I mistakenly assumed that the story that preceded it might not hold my interest . I was wrong! The intrigue full of suspense begins to wreak havoc through a chance encounter between Bad Guy Saboteur and the protagonist of the man accused wrongly, and continues to sneak through a series of new fortuitous encounters and small escapes. The familiar Hitchcockian elements are all there: the innocent person wrongly accused of a crime; people are not what they seem to be; dramatic or improbable places that intensify the suspense scene that unfolds in them (an airplane hangar, a ranch, a bridge from which the handcuffed hero throws himself to escape the police, a sumptuous charity ball in a sumptuous palace, a skyscraper upper floor and finally the torch of the Statue of Liberty). <br /> <br /> Throughout the humor provided by the players, generous dolls of social commentary from the beginning of the Second World War, moments of human warmth where suffering people find it in them lend hand -strong to help another human being without getting anything back? In short, there was always a fundamental humanity at the heart of Hitchcock, regardless of their appearance - a sensational cast of supportive players, mostly Otto Kruger, the meanest villain on this side of George Sanders (his Broadway credits include the main role in Noel Coward Privacy (and that says it all) and weaselly Norman Lloyd as a saboteur holder, not to mention Alma Kruger ?? no relationship with Otto ?? Dowager of the leading company involved in the plot of the fifth column (his character prefigured that of the mother of Claude Rains in NOTORIOUS) Priscilla Lane does an excellent job with a difficult role.For most of her first scenes, we can not say if she believes that the hero is innocent or guilty and she seems to constantly change her mind, not bringing her anything next to him before the end of the proceedings, we can not know if her game is at fault or if we are my supposed to stay in a state of uncertainty, but the developments of the plot are so fast, fun and smart that we really do not care what she thinks. <br /> Then there are the special Hitchcock touches that have nothing to do with the plot. Twice Lane's character pauses to get money for a quarter ?? once to pay off his captors for an ice cream soda and again to make a call from a payphone. One wonders why these scenes have been inserted, perhaps to make the film more realistic and thus increase credibility and suspense? Or maybe give the audience a moment to catch their breath? Some of the characters are above ?? the maddened trucker, the unbelievably kind and confident blind man who lives alone in an impeccably maintained log cabin, the "human skeleton" of political philosophy and other members of the circus caravan who hide the protagonists from their pursuers.
