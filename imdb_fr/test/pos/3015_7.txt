I went straight to the big screen to see this kicker. It's the only movie I know that Tarsem Singh did, but damn it was intense. This film was a total stimulus for the mind and one of the best special effects of this type. <br /> <br /> The characters were vibrant and only created beings in your mind or in your nightmare. This film is scary and interesting and totally bombards the senses of fear and exaltation. This movie does not look like anything else I've seen, other than the level of being wonderfully weird. In this respect, this is a pretty big step above "A mechanical orange". See this movie on the big screen and do not wait for it to be recorded. This film will not be as good as on tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not to panic easily. This will disturb your mind and leave you with images that take a long time to forget. But for those who like to be panicked ..... Enjoy!
