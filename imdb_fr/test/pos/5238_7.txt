Sweeping and still awesome early Western Talkie of the early days; Other contemporary films in the same vein include: THE WAPON COUVERT (1923), THE IRON HORSE (1924) and CIMARRON (1931) ?? I did not watch any of these videos, although the latter is in VHS. It was simultaneously filmed in "Standard" full-screen format and in a large-screen experimental process called "Grandeur", but only the first was published on the "Fox" basic DVD; we can only assume what it would look like in a broader report, but the framing neat ?? not to mention the magnificent cinematography ?? is pretty obvious even in the "Standard" version. <br /> <br /> The young John Wayne dominates surprisingly in the lead (a role that, however, did not lead to the expected celebrity, as he languished in the B westerns for most of the next decade , before John Ford comes to his rescue with STAGECOACH [1939]!); anyway, he and Marguerite Churchill (of DRACULA'S DAUGHTER [1936]) form a beautiful couple ?? despite its character a little tedious. Supporting characters include a variety of action types: Western veteran, comic relief acolyte (with a penchant for making noises with his mouth!), Mighty beefy and rude (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!), His two sticky cohorts (one and a Southerner, the latter also playing the role of Wayne's rival for Churchill's hand), etc. Among the members of the Carriage Party, there is also a shy Swede (full of optimism for the promised land, but who is continually shot down by his irascible mother - Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The episodic narrative is solves in a number of vignettes alternately cornball, lyrical and action-packed as we see potential settlers fighting the elements, the Indians and themselves, however, the film has a completely authentic feel that softens its quality essentially dated and static.In addition, the editing is a bit jerky (especially during the second half) ?? This is not surprising, since the DVD edition of the film only lasts 108 minutes, while the full version of "Grandeur" of 158 minutes!
