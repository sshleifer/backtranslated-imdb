Anthony Wong plays Lok, a husband whose wife is seriously ill. Poor Lok, he has been deprived of sex for a long time. That is why he is subject to a series of nightmares involving nurses and schoolgirls. "Erotic Nightmare" is a fun Cat III movie loaded with thugs and thugs. There is also a bit of gore because the first part of the film shows some heinous murders committed by the character of Wong under the influence of the mystical powers of the monk.The sequences of dreams are quite erotic. Of course, those who expect a horrific Cat III horror in the tradition of "Serial Killer Diary" or "Red to Kill" will be disappointed, but lamentable exploitation movie buffs should give one a look.7 out of 10
