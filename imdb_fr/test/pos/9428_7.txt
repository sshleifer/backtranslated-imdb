For propaganda purposes during the Second World War, Sherlock Holmes was transferred to the present. One of the results is "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon", with one of the best Holmes, Basil Rathbone, alongside Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne. Holmes' mission is to deliver a scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.), and his weapon to the British government, before the Germans can find him. Once the man has arrived in England, his problems are just beginning. Can Holmes decode the message left by Dr. Tobel before falling into the hands of the vicious Moriarity, saving the weapon and perhaps the scientist? This is an effective story of Holmes, which takes place in the atmosphere of Switzerland and the blackout in England. The series has worked well nowadays. It was not without problems, but these problems had nothing to do with the period. Who had the idea of ​​making Watson an idiot? Nigel Bruce's characterization - aided and encouraged by scripts - has always been a false note. I much prefer the characterization of Edward Hardwicke in the Jeremy Brett series Sherlock Holmes - he is attractive, intelligent and a credible companion for Holmes. In the Rathbone series, Holmes is often patronizing and treats Watson as the idiot he is. However, in this film, Watson has a chance to be very useful in many ways. <br /> <br /> I admit to being a real comfort to Richard II's recitation of Rathbone - "... this blessed plot, this Earth, this England" - I can not imagine how much it meant for the British to watch the movie in 1942. Sherlock Holmes really served his purpose.
