Why should I say that? Because when the movie finished, I was in a good mood. So many people exclaim in the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those of you who think that he has learned to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new in his career. He won the Best Actor Award in a comedy series before Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, the sky has learned to drop snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was hilarious. What bothers me in the head is that other reviews on this movie claim that there are no lines or memorable scenes. Spoiler ... <br /> <br /> The waaaambulance? I am not a loser? Have you ever seen a grown cry that I'm not a loser before? <br /> <br /> I found this movie awesome. It was funny, it was never boring and, in the Disney spirit, it made sense. Something to do with life and of course all the children's movies that try to do this is above his head, but for once, I did not care. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched it. Do it You will love.
