This is the first American film I've seen this year and I think it will be the best because of his feelings. As an American teen singer, Aaron is no longer as pop as before, most Americans I met said his song was wrong and he did not even know how to rap. But beware, everyone is a child, how many people can understand it. Being a pop fan is difficult, and being a pop star is more difficult. I think this time, Aaron (JD) has shown something real to us. And I think people should learn to understand each other. On the other hand, I really like the music of the movie. I remember that the first song of the movie is "Saturday Night" and that it also includes a real live show of Aaron. The second title is "One Better". Think that if you like this movie, you may be a fan of pop too. Finally, I hope you'll have a good time ^ ^ A voice from a Chinese boy.
