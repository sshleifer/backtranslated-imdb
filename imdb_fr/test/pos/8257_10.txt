I saw this film about 4 times and each time, I am impressed by the work of Second Camera Assistant. It seems banal but there is something very professional, competent and talented. The film as a whole suffers from other problems, as indicated by other comments. The importance of the issues is therefore as relevant today as it was 40 years ago. The acting is a little tense, but the work of Second Camera Assistant is remarkable! This person needs to go back into the business - maybe lead? What is this person waiting for? I will look, I will wait and cheer on the sideline! - Bob
