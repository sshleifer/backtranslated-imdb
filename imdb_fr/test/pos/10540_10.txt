(This review contains a huge spoiler, but I do not know how to explain how cool it is without revealing it.) I saw "Pinoccio's Revenge" some time ago. just a scam of the child's game. Indeed, there are similarities. <br /> <br /> However, Chucky was a possessed doll that works independently of the kid. It is POSSIBLE that Pinoccio be possessed by a demon or cursed or something of the kind. However, the puppet itself is completely inanimate. The KID is crazy, and the KID is the one who kills people! Everyone, including the audience, the survivors and the Kid herself thinks it's a doll. But it's the KID. <br /> <br /> Nudity is almost a shame, because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it, because it's really an interesting horror movie.
