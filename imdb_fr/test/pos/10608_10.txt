I just finished watching Marigold today and I'll start by saying that I found this DVD on the shelves of Blockbuster. As I walked around looking for something new and good to look at, Ali Larter's photo caught my eye. <br /> <br /> After drooling on Ali Larter, I picked up the blanket and kept looking at it. From the appearance, I thought the costumes were a little exaggerated. And then I saw the other Indians on the cover and I thought it was some sort of parody film or something. <br /> <br /> When I returned the synopsis part and saw Salman Khan, I made a double take. . Salman Khan in an American movie with Ali Larter in a Blockbuster DVD? Because Salman Khan is a Bollywood film, just like Mel Gibson is a Hollywood movie, I was expecting a lot from this film: it had to be good! I am very happy to say that Marigold is a phenomenal movie! This far exceeds all my personal expectations! <br /> <br /> I guess a movie like this is what happens when you have a decent storyline, a talented, experienced, knowledgeable, goal-oriented director, two incredible actors playing the lead roles and just a very hard support cast and the team! Khan and Larter seem to have a very good chemistry together and both shine on the big screen: they are really beautiful together. The music numbers were not bad at all, which was surprising considering the musicality and length of the Indian movie musicals. And you'll be happy to know that the Indian costumes are very far from being as tacky as you will do. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film was rather slow, the medium was really good, the scenes leading to the climax were quite dramatic, but the end was just great! I have some problems and complaints about the DVD, though. Although I liked the DVD's widescreen format, I did not like the fact that many other things were left out of the DVD. For starters, there are no subtitles. Now that English is my mother tongue, it's not a problem. However, when some Indian actors and actresses spoke, it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were saying; subtitling would have helped. <br /> <br /> Another thing I would have appreciated on the DVD would be a devastating or some sort of outing collection. And finally, what about a menu feature that would allow us to jump directly to music numbers? Dude, some of these songs were really good! On the other hand, I really enjoyed watching the filming of Marigold. <br /> <br /> I have a lot more to say about how awesome this movie was and how much I liked it, but I do not have the time or want to continue writing why I liked it so much? I hope that Salman Khan will make more English movies in addition to his Hindi films and I certainly hope that this Hindi film will not be Ali Larter's latest film about Bollywood. And I encourage the director to continue producing Bollywood hybrid movies starring Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other famous actors: just make sure that the scripts are original and quality. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - it's a great love story movie that your whole family can enjoy!
