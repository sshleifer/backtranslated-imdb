When I first learned that this film was going to be made, I was very excited to see it. The ideas for making a movie of this caliber, no matter how good, must have been very difficult. I was not sure if anyone could cover all the incredible qualities of the pope in a film, but the film did justice to his memory. In my opinion, the most important task was to reveal to people who was the pope. Until his last days in the Vatican, Poland, this film has followed every aspect of his life. Thomas Kretschmann, the man who played the pope in his adult life and after, did a very good job of passing the emotion. Overall, this film was educational, but also very entertaining.
