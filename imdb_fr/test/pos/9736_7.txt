I was a child when I saw this drama, shortly after Buck Rogers, the two characters played by the same Buster Crabbe, and I must admit that these movies have always been part of the best entertainment I have ever had. The fight against the Ming emperor was one thing, but I was more interested in the final fate of Flash's love triangle with Dale and Aura. Barin came and persuaded Aura to forget Flash, a very innocent ending of his obsession with the beautiful Flash. The soap opera has no offensive scenes and really violent and can be watched by all audiences. Another thing is that I learned to float in the water looking like Crabbe when he fought shark-men. The soundtrack was also nice, although it had already been used in another Frankenstein film by Boris Karloff. It would be nice to have the DVD of this series provided that it is provided with subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).
