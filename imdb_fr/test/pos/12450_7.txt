I remember seeing this movie at the theater in 1984, at the age of 6 (you do the math). I really loved that. I was in Tarzan for two weeks after seeing him (climbing on furniture, jumping from one sound to another). It started a fascination for Tarzan and the monkeys, but curiously a more lasting love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw Highlander very soon after). In 1984, I saw this film for the last time, about a month ago. It was on the cable while I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 and although it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 9:00, I stayed up to watch this movie. loved as a child. <br /> <br /> Watching it, I realized it was not a great movie, and even stranger, that Andie MacDowell's voice had been dubbed by someone else . Ian Holme was of course strong as usual, and surprisingly, the monkey still fits, but what was most surprising was how good Lambert was like Tarzan. He was great! The depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primordial body language and, above all, his ability to bring this character through his extremely large arch, were simply extraordinary. but I am used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film, he was really very good and it is a pity that he never had the opportunity to represent a character with such depth. <br /> <br /> So, to make a story too long, I was a little disappointed that the film was not good, but I was happy to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret stay until 6:00 am to see it.
