I just saw this wonderfully filmed film that captures the essence of <br /> <br /> NYC, or any major mid-century American city. The colors, the cars, the clothes and the advent of the women's movement. It reflects the comfortable <br /> <br /> attitudes of men and women in the business world <br /> <br />. In some ways, things have changed and in others, they have not changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but they now have <br /> all kinds of equality laws and mandates to get them. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, beautiful women will still let themselves go in pursuit of men <br /> <br /> in the pursuit of their goals! The laws we have now against harassment and all <br /> <br /> all have been adopted by unattractive women who want an equal chance to <br /> <br /> compete with prettier women who could possibly get the posts alone <br /> <br /> Based on their looks and put them out! The real competition is not between <br /> <br /> men and women, but women and women! I liked the appearance of the film but the world has not changed as far as what is real
