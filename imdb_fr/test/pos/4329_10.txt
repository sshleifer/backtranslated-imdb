After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ("Three Minutes"), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid develop a plan to confront "The Others". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael in "The Others", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret while they are in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to know that the time has come to know what will happen if the "button" is not depressed. However, Mr. Eko's determination to continue to press the "button" is surprisingly strong. So, when Locke devises a plan to lock Eko with the help of an ally, Eko makes surprisingly desperate efforts to prevent Locke from committing what he thinks is a big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is a classic episode of Lost, full of secrets, suspense and very few answers to the many questions it poses to its viewers. However, some of the secrets revealed by this action packed episode will be really shocking for the fans. There is also an end-of-season cliffhanger, a hallmark that achieves the feat of being both shocking and extremely confusing. One thing is guaranteed, it will keep you guessing until the end, and you will always be frustrated by other bewildering questions while you wait with anguish as the Third Season begins.
