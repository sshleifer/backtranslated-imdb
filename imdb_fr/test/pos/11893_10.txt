I absolutely recommend this film to all those who want to be entertained.The realization, the acting and the story are brilliant. Finally up there with movies like Scarface and godfather. This film makes your heart beat. The casting was amazing.I would certainly rent this movie.Damian Chapa deserves an Academy Award for his acting and for the way he described the life of a gangster.This film will soon be a classic and a movie brilliant -making.I loved it and gave it 10 stars.In a sentence the only way to describe it is a film without any flaws. Watch this movie and you will see what I mean. 2 bravo !!!!!!!
