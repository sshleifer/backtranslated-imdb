Radio is a true story about a man who did what he thought was in his heart the right thing to do. The viewer will have to wonder what he would have done. The adversity that coach Jones and Radio faced was both tragic and predictable. People did not understand; they did not want to understand either. But in the end, the power of the situation forced people to understand and appreciate much more than they had before. The radio is a young mentally disabled person who understands very little. In addition to three of the most important things, they are too often forgotten as we grow: intuition, compassion and love. Coach Jones is a high school teacher who can not ignore the tragic fate of the underdog who is simply trying to play the best card game in the best possible way. It was sad how the coach Jones and Radio met. The practical joke that terrified Radio's life was enough to make you want to punish severely, not just the boys involved, but all the boys who knew what was going on and who were not doing anything. However, on the plus side, the incident created a friendship that would influence so many lives the way most of us think only happens in movies. This film is a true fairy tale not to be missed. Ed Harris was his usual genius. Gooding was flawless. The radio is an inspiration.
