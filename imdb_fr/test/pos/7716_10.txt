Wow, it's been a long time since I've seen anything so mysterious in his description. <br /> <br /> A detective story uses old black-and-white images to portray a private investigator wearing an old trench coat and hat. The theme of this animation is reminiscent of Sam Spayed, who was briefly mentioned by Ash. <br /> <br /> Tired of spying on unfaithful housewives because of his clients, Ash had the opportunity to find a "computer" hacker ", which he considered a good chance to win a sum four digits that he could not refuse and the rest belongs to the story. <br /> <br /> The end was a little bland, but it's okay For those who love old fashion stories, it's the one that suits you.
