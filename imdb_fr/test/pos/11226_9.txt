The austere and cold landscape of Big Sky Country, with its majestic snow-capped mountains juxtaposed with arid plains, is used poetically here in this lynchian fable / slide show on the death and melancholy of young and talented independent film lovers in the strange and fascinating film "Twin Falls Idaho" - a film about a young woman falling in love with two Siamese twin brothers). A small orphan is dying and a city is about to be flooded in the name of progress (in the form of a damn hydroelectric power station). With his surprisingly pleasing sheet music, minimalist dialogue and character development, and fantastic sequences featuring unique angels, the Polish brothers focus on what every good movie artist knows a movie should be, moving pictures ... the images, the scenes ... deep beauty paintings captured on celluloid. It is best to be seen late at night so that the haunting imagery can stay in your mind and overwhelm you while you fall asleep. The fact that all this was done with a budget of less than two million dollars is enough to shame Hollywood with its excessive film costs and hollow film and suggests that something great will come from the Polish brothers at the time. to come up.
