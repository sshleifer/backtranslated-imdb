it's the best movie I've ever seen !!!!!! I just love them !! I watch it every day! I have episodes of the internet! here in Romania is broadcast the 6 season! I'm happy to have seen the show since the beginning and I'm happy to see Season 7 on the Internet. So far, season 5 is my favorite: I love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. I also liked Dean, but Logan is the best. I wish Lorelai stayed with Christopher because he's so beautiful. This show is good for all ages and is worth seeing. I really want DVDs, but I think Romania will never appear because they do not even know they have fans here. but whatever happens, I'll look at it. goodbye!!
