I agree with all the strengths mentioned in the other reviews, but it lacks some rhythms that keep it firmly in the genre of crime drama or film noir and prevent it from being a great drama beyond the "elements". "That make up black film - not to say that big black movies are not / can not / should not be as big dramas, but this one is not. <br /> <br /> Another note, the music in the film is used sparingly but I would say that it is used to emphasize the action more often than the elements of the woman. <br /> <br /> Superb setting up this film passing with a kind of abrupt end that ends either right or left depends. <br /> <br /> The developers follow certain details. <br /> <br /> The big turning point in history concerns children who see their mother die, or it should be the highlight. But we never show children that they react in one way or another. Neither crying nor asking their father what happened, children are good actors and the father's reactions are, I guess, what matters, but it's a big misstep. This is the heart of the story and the reaction of children is usually left blank. In fact, they simply do not have one. In the next scene, they look as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> In the same way, there is a link that is created between the characters of Belmondo and Ventura. Belmondo says he knew the partner who was killed - but this is never explained and has no dramatic impact on Belmondo or whoever it is. Belmondo's romantic sub-parcel also undermines credibility even though it acted convincingly. The character of Ventura simply lets Belmondo involve a stranger in their escape plan for no reason. He does not even comment and does not even seem to notice. Another flaw. <br /> <br /> The end of the film, and I will not spoil it, the end is happening on the screen with a superficial voice to tell you what happened. I imagine that it tries to make life more true, but again, as with these other mistakes, the drama is left out. <br /> <br /> Why not solve these problems? I do not know, except perhaps that the film's objectives were limited to giving the audience what they wanted a police melodrama - suggesting deeper elements, then move on to ignore them. <br /> <br /> Too bad there are many things to recommend in this film, Ventura is really good, but too bad it could have been a fantastic drama and a crime story - as with the IMDb's favorite movie of all time, THE GODFATHER. This film had potential. It would make a good remake, but if it happened in the US, the film would probably lose depth, but it would be a good remake in the hands of the good director, but it is unlikely that the performance of Ventura is surpassed. <br /> <br /> So interesting to see but frustrating as a whole
