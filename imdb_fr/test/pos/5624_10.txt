Chris Smith's American film is an insightful examination of the American dream. The film focuses on Mark Borchardt, an independent director from Wisconsin. Mark has dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since his teenage years and his blurry hi8 camera. The film follows Mark in his attempt to make the feature film of his dream, Northwestern. There are a number of hilarious scenes in the film while Mark goes through Northwestern pre-production, and then his short film, Coven Use to Raise Money to Complete Northwestern. The insight and humor of this film are tied with Roger and Me, Michael Moore's big movie. I first watched it during a chaotic screening at the Sundance Film Festival that revealed the spirit of the film: a giant air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie, hit seven people and caused a delay twenty-five minutes; Halfway through the movie, the sound began to pulsate and the projector had to be shut down to repair it. In the last twenty minutes, the projector has stopped and the film has burned. Despite the delays, the audience stayed through the film and cheered on it. American Movie also won the Jury Prize for Documentary at the end of the festival. I highly recommend this good film, which deserves to be presented through an infernal projection.
