The first half hour of "Homegrown" was rather boring and not very absorbing, but as the movie progressed, my interest in characters and plot increased. Several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters to which you are really attached. The story is about three rented hands at an illegal marijuana farm hidden in Southern California. They witness the murder of the owner of the farm, Malcolm (John Lithgow), and take care of the weed themselves. The three rather simple-minded farmers find themselves quickly immersed in a scary world of mafia and local interest, while trying to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the film had several flaws and a slow start, it proved useful. 7/10 stars.
