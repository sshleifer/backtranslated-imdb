I give this film a score of 8 compared to other feature films of 1930. According to the standards of movies shot a few years later, this film could receive only six or seven votes, mainly because the sound quality was mediocre. so poor. Now, it's possible that the movie sounds better and that the Fox Movie Channel has a degraded print (it has a lot of lines and stripes), but I guess the sound problem was still a problem. Indeed, the sound in the movies was still new in 1930 and many of the talking images of Hollywood sounded terrible - the background characters often drowning the tracks, the characters being grouped together to make sure they were picked up by the microphones or of varying quality (such as what was seen in THE BISHOP MURDER CASE, HELL'S ANGELS and other movies of the day). That's all that got worse in THE BIG TRAIL because most of the film was shot outside - something incredible at that time. An innovation, but also something that really stretched the talents of sound technicians! So, while the film was very difficult to listen to, I realize that I had to start somewhere, which I can forgive, especially since the outdoor scenes are breathtaking, a major innovation for 1930. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite similar to CIMARRON - a western released the following year and won the Oscar for best film. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not a very good film and I like THE BIG TRAIL because of the scope of the film. While some might be reluctant to the slow pace of THE BIG TRAIL, I saw it as a great history lesson about the hardships endured by those traveling west by train. In addition, everything seemed so beautiful, because the director Raoul Walsh had a lot of trouble filming on the spot and THE BIG TRAIL looks almost like a filmed version of some prints of Ansel Adams. <br /> <br /> Regarding the acting game it was very good. This was an important break for young John Wayne, as his previous screen appearances were, at best, minor and mundane. Here he had the direction and did a dandy job - though he's obviously young and a little less "John Wayne-ish" than he was in later films because his character on the screen was not yet well established. Tyrone Power II (the father of Tyrone Power) also played an interesting role. He looked nothing like his very handsome son and almost looked like Bluto from Popeye cartoons! He has made very few sound films - he is dying after only a year - making it a rare opportunity to see and hear this once-famous actor. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is still worth seeing, despite some sound problems and some scenes too long here and there. For 1930, it was a remarkable achievement - much more than the much more famous and award-winning CIMARRON, made the following year. Most of the reasons why THE BIG TRAIL did not win an Oscar are probably due to the fact that ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT was released the same year and it's really one of the best movies.
