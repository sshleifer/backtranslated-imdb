Christopher Nolan's first film is a black and white film "without a budget" about an unemployed writer who starts following strangers, leading to theft and violence. It is very good. <br /> <br /> As in his last film "Memento", he does not present the story linearly. Instead, it jumps up a bit and you end up being really tempted to try to put everything in order and early, apparently, the plans take on importance as the movie moves forward. This style also means that touch-ups are much more effective. <br /> <br /> It's really worth seeing if you have the opportunity (especially if you like his latest movie and / or Black Film)
