Years ago, when I first read The World According to John Irving's Garp, I was amazed that most of the young adults with whom I had contacts did not like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was a question of age and experience. While reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers, I experienced a sense of déjà vu. To fully enjoy Separate Lies is surely a question of age and experience. <br /> <br /> In this film, the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he is a successful attorney - she is the perfect wife of a lawyer. They have a townhouse in London and a house in the countryside. All is well until the "villain" enters the skin of the son of the richest man in the village. This guy seems to be a guy from the word "Go". He is disdainful of everything, including his own children. In the traditional form of nice guys finishing last, the lawyer's wife engages in an affair with the border. You see that the lawyer is really a nice guy but with the murderous trait of an organized perfectionist. Even if he really loves him, he bores his wife to death. The bad guy is much more exciting. <br /> <br /> All this is entangled by the death of a man from the village, where all the facts suggest that the driver is the driver of the vehicle. . <br /> <br /> It is easy to see that this film does not end well, but ends in a very satisfactory end in that the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and probably will be able to to lead their personal lives in a more successful way. <br /> <br /> Three great actors play the main characters of this film, and these are performances that make it all enjoyable to watch. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as a husband. His portrait shows us a kind man who controls his emotions so much that he lost contact with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman who has become so entrapped in the role of perfect woman that she almost lost her knowledge of passion. This passion is reborn under the character skillfully interpreted by Rupert Everett. <br /> <br /> If you have reached the stage of life where you understand that everyone has their feet in clay and that everyone, even with the gifts of opportunity - makes many bad decisions, then you will probably enjoy watching these excellent actors create the lives of three of these people. This is an adult movie beautifully played and directed on realistic adults.
