Yes, it's not a big film success, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and entertaining film. The young cast did a great job with the drama and comedy aspects of the story, and I particularly liked Shawn Phelan as Derek / "Yogurt". I have seen this one many times over the years and I will probably see many more. Just do not think about it too much and you'll love it - enjoy!
