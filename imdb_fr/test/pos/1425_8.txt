This film was never designed as a big budget movie, but was a pretty little picture that everyone could appreciate. It probably will not change your life, but it is certainly charming and engaging. <br /> <br /> Clifton Webb plays the role of a curmudgeon (which is certainly not new) and has a television. However, his grades are failing and he is worried about the cancellation. So he decides that maybe he's too out of touch with the kids - like he and his wife have nothing in their turn. So he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing it almost immediately! Remember, he is a curmudgeon and does not particularly like children. To make matters worse, one of the kids really loves him and follows him like a lost puppy. No matter how indifferently he acts towards the child, the child just wants to spend time with him! The kid is cute and almost steals the show alone! <br /> <br /> What will happen next and you will have to inquire yourself. Understand that it is a light, cute and not disgusting film that you will probably enjoy.
