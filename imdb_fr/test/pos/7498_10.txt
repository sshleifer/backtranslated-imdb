For those who do not know Paddy Chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. While Chayefsky discusses the reality behind the myths of many things, including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic about how medicine unfolds today, two decades after filming and more than a decade after his death. Beyond that, certain aspects of Chayefsky's vision of life in general are also "slipped" into the film. The 20th century may well be the first and last century of the United States in the history of the world. If it turns out that the US contribution to the arts was part of the "film" dimension, it is an excellent example of this art.
