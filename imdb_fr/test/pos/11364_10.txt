In 1961, this series was broadcast on local television here in southern California. For many years, myself and many others have practiced BBC for tape or DVD. Now suddenly, here it is on Amazon. I pre-ordered in January and now here on March 30th he has arrived. It was a long wait (48 years). Was it worth it? So far, I just watched Richard II (I have the DVD for 2 hours) and I can really say YES! totally worth the wait. The acting, the staging and the production are superb and even better than in my memory. The production is in black and white but it is fine. The video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. An additional proof of the timelessness of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I gave these 10 stars even though I saw only 1 piece out of 8. I'm sure that when I've seen them all, I'll change my note to at least 12. <br> <br /> <br /> It is currently in stock at Amazon (US region 1) at a reasonable price. <br /> I better stop now to get back to watching. Then Henry IV, part 1 of which is my favorite Shakespeare play.
