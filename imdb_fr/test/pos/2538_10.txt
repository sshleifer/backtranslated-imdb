"Pixote: A Lei do But Fraco" deals with what is perhaps the greatest Brazilian theme: poverty. And with poverty, the other unnatural feelings and actions it engenders; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder. <br /> <br /> Brazil is a country of paradoxes and its social problems are everywhere. The difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the deepest human decadence. <br /> <br /> "Pixote" is one of the films that dares to touch and open these painful wounds, without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrait of a country that, like Pixote, - even, is already lost.
