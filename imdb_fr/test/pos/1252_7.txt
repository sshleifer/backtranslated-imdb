By way of explanation, Disney's "The Kid" has nothing in common with the 1921 Charlie Chaplin classic of the same name. What we have is quite pleasant, although incredible, to feel good in a family comedy that only Disney people can offer. <br /> <br /> In a change of pace, Bruce Willis plays a stuffed shirt an "image consultant". He degrades not only his clients, but also his relatives. You know he'll have to change before the final credits. <br /> <br /> In his life, Willis plays a chapter of his past in the form of the nerdy 8-year-old character, played with conviction. by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). This forces Willis to become familiar with his past and to fully understand the rest. <br /> <br /> Willis's love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as executive assistant. Both have little to do because most of the film involves an interaction between the Willis and Breslin characters. <br /> <br /> "The kid", although the biggest Disney movie is not the one you can sit look with your family and go away with a feeling of warmth.
