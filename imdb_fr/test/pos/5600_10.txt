In the Book of Life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who arrives at JFK Airport on December 31 to inaugurate the new millennium by fighting with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds (Kurt, Amateur's accountant) as a compulsive gambler and homeless. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary created in a strange way and from another world flows with art. framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes filled with a dazzling shade and light. As usual, he introduces seemingly extravagant details early and then brings them back into hilarious and unexpected contexts - the humor is simple, but dizzying and irrepressible. Hartley has an astonishing ability to build small, delightful moments that are both worldly and outrageous. As usual, he creates a blas√© and weary tone, but at the same time vulnerable, open and honest. In a few minutes, he goes from tumultuous humor to a metaphysical and poetic language. This type of writing is so impeccable and perfect that it is difficult to hold back tears despite the absence of obvious emotion. Another awesome and very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The Book of Life is shot (with a digital camera?) With a fuzzy effect: a feeling of the heavenly hand with an imminent destiny and a hyper-consciousness of the present as fragile and fleeting in his last moments. All Hartley's films have a way of giving priority to the present, but this unique effect only complicates it because the images are shockingly displayed on the screen, but become more and more beautiful as you you install there. The final shot is spectacular. All of this may seem valuable, but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself while making fun of the concept of Armageddon, the Day of Judgment and "urbanity". Although it is actually quite deep, moving and full of life affirmation, it is mostly light and playful. The cast of actors is flawless with respect to the kind of moderate tone that Hartley has developed in his films (a tone that some people do not understand and which drives them to judge such a role as hollow - the same people who have a negative answer to Peter Greenaway). As always, there are bound to be people who react with cynicism and contempt to this film - people put off by Hartley's abrupt changes and what they consider to be pretentious or mannerist techniques - but all Hartley fans will love this movie. (if they can have the chance to see it, it's the case). It's hard to say what it would be on video.
