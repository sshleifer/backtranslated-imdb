A light film, edifying and engaging. Watching Irene Dunne is a delight! Looking at her, she ceases to be Irene Dunne and becomes in all respects Paula Wharton. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Irene Dunne in all the movies I saw and it would be almost all. What a pity that most of his films need so much to be restored. I really hope that Ir√®ne Dunne's films will be restored before it's too late, they are such treasures Thank God, this is not the case with Over 21. <br /> <br /> C is a must if you like the superb spiritual comedy serious connotations. I agree with a previous comment on the speech "The world and apple pie", it was one of the many highlights of the film. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne had helped write this speech with director Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and this certainly seems to be reflected in her films!
