The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle resumed almost unhindered where The Egg and I had stopped. For Kettles' first solo adventure, a new writing and direction team is presented. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was the producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many characters played by the same actors and actresses, the Macdonalds' focus on the Kettles works very well. My fighter Birdie Hicks is referred to for the first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I. The prize money from the quilt contest was to be used to send Tom Kettle to the 'university. In this film, Tom returns home as a graduate student. <br /> <br /> Two intrigues are closely related in this film. One is the comedy of the simple mountain family who settles in a modern ultramodern house. The second is a lightweight moral game about how the environment affects growing children. <br /> <br /> Pa Kettle (Percy Kilbride) wanted a free bag of tobacco to enter a contest and ended up winning a house. His disappointment at not receiving the free tobacco joke is a game that makes you laugh a lot. When Pa plays with dynamite, he is totally unaware of the explosion. Kilbride never flinched on the scene when the debris of the explosion fell around him. He played the role perfectly. In his autobiography, Jack Benny mentioned how impressed he was with Percy Kilbride's flawless accomplishment. Kilbride has brought this comic device to a high level of perfection. <br /> <br /> Ma (Marjorie Main) and Pa move into the new home with modern conveniences that confuse Ma and Pa almost as much as they help. Ma adapts much faster than Pa. Modern amenities include a television, a brand new domestic object from 1949. Mobile walls, hidden beds and plumbing fixtures are used as comic accessories, but attention is focused on Ma and Pa , never. the accessories themselves. <br /> <br /> Tom Kettle (Richard Long) meets Kim Parker (Meg Randall), a magazine editor who believes that hygiene and the environment are essential for children to succeed in adulthood. Tom is a brilliant and autonomous man who contradicts the theory that success can only come from a pristine environment. This subject is briefly discussed in some scenes, but remains weak. It was also the only serious discussion in this whimsical film. <br /> <br /> Seeing the Kettles come out of their old dilapidated house to settle in a new home would be almost a disaster without the characters staying true to themselves. Ma was the practice, just like she had been in The Egg and I. Pa was the fish out of the water that provided the best comedy. He never felt at home in the new house, but the actual location of a comfortable bed would never concern him.
