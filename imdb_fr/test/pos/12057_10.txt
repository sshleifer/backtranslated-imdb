So many times, Bollywood has tried to redo Hollywood's successes, only to produce failures. Fortunately, the interpretation of "Sleeping with the enemy" by Yash Chopra is an extremely elegant and well done film. <br /> <br /> Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (who is looking for her best here!). When he realizes that Juhi has a fianc√© to Sunny Deol, he will stop at nothing to make sure she gets it. <br /> <br /> Every image of this film is a pleasure to watch. Shah Rukh singing his trademark "I love you, K ... k ... k ... kiran!" or the difficult scenes between Sunny and Juhi (which make a perfect match), you do not feel like leaving your meal in the boredom. <br /> <br /> Every song of the soundtrack is nice to hear, especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Mother Samne. As I said, Juhi looks like a goddess in this movie. Darr may not be SRK's best movie (this honor goes to Baazigar), but it's certainly one of his most perfect performances! Sunny is OK. He has previously held similar roles before, but he is good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Darr is g ... g ... g ... awesome! ;)
