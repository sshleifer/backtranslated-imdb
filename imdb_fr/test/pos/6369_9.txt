As a fan of Dan Aykroyd, I watched this movie when it was recently aired on television in the middle of the night. As I did not expect much, so I am very surprised to love him so much. <br /> <br /> This is the type of movie that Dan Aykroyd seems to like to do. A chance for him to "take risks" and not take things too seriously. If you like it in The Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters, you'll understand what I mean and you'd better have a look at The Couch Trip. <br /> <br /> Passionate fans of Aykroyd will also have fun to spot them. Tiny links to his other movies in the script! <br /> <br /> I can not describe this film without spoiling it, so I can only tell you to check it out. I can not say enough good things about this movie and it's time to release a DVD!
