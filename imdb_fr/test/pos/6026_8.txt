I came across The Last Stop one day at a video store and they were selling it for only $ 2. I decided to try and bought it. It was pretty good, I enjoyed it. The story is about several people all captured in a cabin somewhere in nowhere because of a raging blizzard. There is a policeman, Nancy, his ex-girlfriend, two brothers who have just left prison, an older man and his lover, a black man and the couple who own the cabins and their new son who never speaks . Suddenly, someone is found murdered and a bag filled with money is found. Everyone is a suspect. The Last Stop is a very good thriller, I would give it 8/10
