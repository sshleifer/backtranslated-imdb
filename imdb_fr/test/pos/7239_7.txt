A very strange story evoking the tragic love story of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The Que family and the Capulet family hate each other for a long time, which often leads to violence. Hate has something to do with a movie company and the fact that everyone is pretty crazy. Tromeo and Juliet are at the heart of this madness. They are the most famous lovers of literature. They fall in love with each other. Problems arise when they realize which family belongs to the other. <br /> <br /> The film follows remarkably well the basic plot of the original piece and the key scenes even use the original lines or close to them. But the infamous Troma strangeness imbues the film from start to finish. This is a film that is not suitable for all tastes, but still quite inventive. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly amusing death scene. 7/10 <br /> <br /> There are many versions written and classified differently. Each contains violence, blasphemy, drug use and sex, all with a great deal of weirdness.
