What a shame that this film has never been released. (He is now playing on the cable.) I got in tune because of my great esteem for the stars and I was rewarded by seeing a much better movie than the ones I was paying for going into theaters recently. I like to be surprised. Oftentimes, movies are marketed as "staggered", but are actually more of the same old recycled film. This film is really different, with a comforting message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel. Even if he is bound by the plot to sing some of the most insane and sentimental songs ever written, he does them so well that it does not bother him. Cathy Bates and Rupert Everett are remarkable and beautiful actors, but a newcomer in the role of Cathy Bates' daughter-in-law steals every scene in which she finds herself. Give this film a chance.
