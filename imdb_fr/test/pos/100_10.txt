The most beautiful short film I have ever seen. Some commentators suggest that this could have been lengthened due to the density of knowledge it offers. There is irony in this comment and little merit. The acting of actors depends on Noonan and he bears perfectly his ungrateful character. I might have preferred that the narrator be less "recognizable", but the loaned gravitas is perfect. This is a shortcut for people who read, for those whose "bar" is high up and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge opposing and bitter defenders of beauty. A beautiful short film. FWIW: Picasso's reference appealed to me, because I had already thought that Picasso was just a fucking little art talent; I guess most people - until the day I saw drawings he made at the age of 12. Picasso was a better draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age that many artists will never become in a lifetime. I immediately understood why he had to do the art for which he had become famous.
