*** SPOILERS *** Well done and interesting movie about the alienated youth of America in the 1950s. At the time, many parents were trying to make a lot of money and live high in the blood, forgetting that their children, especially teenagers, needed much more than a car and a large allowance to be able to feel part of the family. They also needed love and attention for their growth problems, which 16-year-old Hal Ditmar, James MacArthur, never received from his father, the successful movie producer MrTom Ditmar, James Daly. <br /> <br /> Never really in touch with his father, Hal becomes more and more distant from him and his caring mother, Helen Ditmar, Kim Hunter, as well as from society. After his father had talked to Hal about wanting to borrow his car, a luxury sedan, he and his friend Jerry, Jeffery Silver, drove into the Hal record and the 1930s operational barley went to the local caterer for catch the latest western movie. <br /> <br /> Want to hit the world, Hal behaves like a real first-class fool clutching his smelly feet almost on the faces of a couple, Eddie Ryder and Jean Corbett, sitting in front of him and Jerry trying to look the film. This brings Hal, along with his friend Jerry, not only to be expelled from the theater, but also to silence the director of the theater, Mr. Grebbs, Whit Bissell. It turned out that at least Hal was ready to leave the theater without even getting his money back, but when Grebbs tried to catch him, Hal turned him around and hugged him around his neck. . <br /> <br /> Hal now in lukewarm water, he is accused of assault and battery, he plays his role in "James Dean" at the local police station. almost knocked out Mr. Grebbs teeth. That's when Sergeant Shipley, James Gergory, announces to Hal that his father picks him up when he ends up sobering up for what he did. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film asks Hal to try to recover but is unable to do so because of the low esteem his father has of him. Asking his father to understand that what he did, what he did by sticking Mr. Grebbs, was in self-defense. Hal's father acts as if he were there, at the theater, and saw the whole incident with his son Hal acting like a street thug instead of a young man caught and pushed without provocation. <br /> <br /> Not excusing what Hal did, showing Mr. Grebbs, he was actually willing to admit his rogue behavior but he wanted both Mr. Grebbs and his father at least treat him with an iota of consideration; Gebbs in the fact that he provoked Hal and Mr. Ditmas not to bother to hear it! Feeling like a criminal wanted without anyone, but his mother, to turn around too much, Hal loses it slowly then to have both Sgt. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agree to abandon the assault charge. One might think that Hal finally learned his lesson, but the real lesson, more than the length of a sentence behind bars, which Hal so badly needed was a lesson his father totally ignored! Being there when his son needed him the most and Mr. Ditmar was failing brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Things are not really settled for everyone in the movie until after Mr. Grebbs gets fucked, Butte of a minnow, still of Hal who, returning to the Grebbs Theater, tries to convince him to call his father and tell him that Hal only defended himself when he first shook him, not the second time. In the end, Hal learned to get along with people and not let his problems become the problems of other people. But most of all, Hal's father, Mr. Ditmar, learned the most valuable lesson in understanding his frustrated and insane son and acting as a father to him rather than a prison guard and a sugar dad. As the song "All you need s Love" says to put things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son Hal that Mr. Ditmar, until the very end of the film, was missing the more.
