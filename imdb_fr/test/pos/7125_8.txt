There are few movies that have made me wait and wait for the release more than this one. This is the latest film from The Dead Gentlemen, responsible for the original Gamers movie and Demon Hunters movies. This group has not been very active in recent years, but this film is a definitive reason to continue to follow the evolution of the situation. <br /> <br /> This film follows a group of players trying to finish. a campaign led by a general manager frustrated by his group's disregard for his story. With the help of a new blood, they are trying again the campaign in the hope of ending this season. <br /> <br /> This film is a breath of fresh air in the film community and a clear improvement over the original. The film shows respect for the game much like the original movie, but in addition, this film shows a dramatic improvement over the special effects casting it above the simplicity of college films. The acting is pretty good and the jokes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most jokes are jokes. Therefore, if you are not a player, you may not find the film as funny as the others. That's why I give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 I originally thought of. In all cases, if you are a player or if you know the game, check this one, you will appreciate it.
