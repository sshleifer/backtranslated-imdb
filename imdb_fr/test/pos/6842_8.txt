I came across this movie recently after hearing about it for so long. This is an excellent non-pretentious movie for those who love literature and film noir movies. Not "camp" but humorous. <br /> <br /> GREAT CAST! From beautiful Carla Gugino and Emma Thompson to German superstar Til Schweiger, this film is a feast for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very funny as a gang antagonist. I would love to see a movie with this character and Emma Thompson resolve the cases and the arguments between them all the time (like Tracy and Hepburn, etc.) <br /> <br /> Do not look if this is not the case because the compositions are very rich). <br /> <br /> A sexy, sexy and very funny evening. <br /> <br /> The best use of Just Like Heaven by seeing to believe!) <br /> <br /> ********
