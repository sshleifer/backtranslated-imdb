I think all the critics who criticized "Tommy Boy" when it came out in 1995 should go back and watch it and learn that it's not a bad movie at all. All critics have criticized the films of Chris Farley and David Spade. Yes, "Coneheads" was funny, but there was a joke and "Black Sheep", I agree with critics, it's one of the worst movies ever made. But "Tommy Boy" does not fall into the category of "Coneheads" that could have been a bit funnier and "Black Sheep" which is a piece of tripe. It's very fun and fun. I agree with the critics that Chris Farley was neither John Belushi nor John Candy, because he claimed to have idolized these guys and these guys had a comedy genius, but Chris Farley was very funny and I would like it is longer to prove to critics that he was neither John Belushi nor John Candy, but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are hilarious and the principle is also crazy to laugh. It's very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh but we have movies like "Tommy Boy" to remind us how funny he really was. "Tommy Boy" is one of the best comedies of the 1990s.
