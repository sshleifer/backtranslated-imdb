"A Tale of Two Sisters" is a brilliant South Korean psychological horror that left me speechless. The film offers delicious moments of horrible horror and is extremely scary. The small group of actors is really excellent. memorable in the lead role. The management of Kim Ji-woon is well managed and the cinematography absolutely magnificent. The plot is slightly confusing, but some scenes are wonderfully weird.The action is quite slow, but I was extremely curious and intrigued.The house where the film unfolds is incredibly menacing and isolated. "A Tale of Two Sisters" is with "Ringu" and "Kairo" one of the most original Asian horror movies I've ever seen. See this masterpiece as soon as possible. My rating: 10 out of 10.
