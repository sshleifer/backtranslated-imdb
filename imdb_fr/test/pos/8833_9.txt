I was part of the Space Odyssey cast, playing the role of FIDO in the control of the mission. I just want to say that none of us, actors, particularly those who control the mission and who had to react to a green screen most of the time, had no idea how that was going to happen. I knew it was going to be good, if only for the camaraderie and professionalism that the Impossible Pictures production team had provided to all concerned. but when we all saw this for the first time at the Curzon Mayfair screening, well, I felt very proud. I was so happy that none of us are like Star Trek. Joe Aherne, the screenwriter and director, is the most extraordinary man to work for. He is pretty much a good team and just wants to do what they do on their own. I'm really lucky to have been part of this show. Who knew something so epic and complicated to understand would prove so attractive to watch. and my god is a beautiful universe there.
