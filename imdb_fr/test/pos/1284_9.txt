Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspiring writer who has not published anything yet. Bill also has a strange and strange habit, he likes to follow people. <br /> <br /> Bill chooses a stranger in the street dinner or on the subway, in the subway, and follows him as if he were their shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him get inspired to write the great novel he's dreaming about or have an article published in a big magazine? Maybe it's due to the fact that it has a purpose in Bill's solitary life and even makes the curiosity of the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd paying attention to him? Or maybe it gives Bill someone who cares and who is responsible? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when following someone: after following him to his home or workplace, you stop. <br /> <br /> One day, Bill follows Cobb, Alex Haw, to his place and instead of following his stopping rule, he continues to follow Cobb. Bill will soon realize how much he was right with this rule that he had set himself by following people and at the same time how wrong he was in raping her. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly good low-budget film directed by Christopher Noland in 1998 before hitting hard in Hollywood with his innovative and original cinematic film "Momento", two years later, which has already become a major film worship. <br /> <br /> "Follow" is actually a much better movie than "Momento" because it is a classic story and easy to follow. Compared to "Momento", which was both confusing and then, when you realize what the film tells you in its backlog scenario, it is very complicated. What makes "Follow" so much better is simply because it's simple, but at the same time smart for those watching it. The film is much more direct and devastating and you do not need to see it again and again to get what it was trying to tell them, as did "Momento". "Follow" is a story in a story in a story with one of the most surprising endings and most simply manipulated, if you watch the movie again and notice the clues you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Made with an incredibly small budget of $ 6,000.00, less than most Hollywood movies plan for coffee breaks, with an unnamed black and white distribution and a little more than one hour, 71 minutes. Hollywood as well as the film industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland about how a person without talent or imagination can achieve what millions of dollars can not in most cases; to make a film that is both intelligent and penetrating with almost nothing in money and no big star.
