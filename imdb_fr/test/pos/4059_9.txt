Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, which team. While Rene Russo, William Shanter and this guy from the Everyday video are next door for the ride. It's a funny and awesome movie. Not only that, but it's a good friend movie. <br /> <br /> Tom Dey (Shanghai Noon) makes this hell out of a movie. From beginning to end, it was a masterpiece. No great humor here. But the good old days laugh. Make fun of all the other movies (to name a few deadly weapons, the Beverly Hills cop, fifteen minutes, etc.) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie, see this one. You'll love it. He has a wonderful cast and crew. So, stop watching ** "COPS" and watch "Showtime" for a detective movie. And remember, they will protest your neighbor to uh ... hmm ... oh! Friday night at 8 am (everyone says I'm a bad writer).
