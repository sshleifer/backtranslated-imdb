A sentimental and sensitive family film that takes place in England in the 1920s. A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter the Grand National; Fortunately, ex-jockey Mickey Rooney is here to help Liz. Director Clarence Brown demonstrates remarkable control with material that could have been excessively cursed in someone else's hands. He and the writers Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves take great care to establish real characterizations and to develop the story naturally. While there are one or two scenes that seem a little forced, but overall, it's quite touching and beautifully filmed in Technicolor. The race itself is exciting and, like so many other great classics, there is a wonderful fade to three handkerchiefs. Liz proves that she was a real soldier from the beginning and Rooney - which I usually find rather boring - is surprisingly mastered and really very good. Donald Crisp is terrified by Liz's gruff father and Angela Lansbury is a delight only by her older sister, crazy about boys. Most congratulations for the acting, however, belong to Anne Revere, who won a well-deserved support actor, Oscar, in the role of Liz's wise and considerate mother.
