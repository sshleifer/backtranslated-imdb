this film explores if not creates a brand new genre with perfect imperfection - hilarity, truth, entertainment, talent and circumstances that make MAGIC. <br /> <br /> creative musical numbers to the unusual comedy that incorporates the best actors, if I had not known better, I would have thought that there was a scenario developed here. <br /> <What do you get: a powerful wind meets conversations with God meets something so fresh and new and so nice that it becomes its own entity. <br /> <br /> peers and fellows give both outstanding performance and train you immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts ....... but only small actors and everyone involved here should be caressed in the back, out for dinner and be considered for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> bravo!
