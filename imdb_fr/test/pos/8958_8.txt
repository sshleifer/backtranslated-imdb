A very good movie story of a cheerful and cheerful old gay star, who is waiting now. Sexual ambiguities are explored here in a realistic way and with a real human face. This, and run a serial killer on the run, and you have LOVE AND THE HUMAN REMAINS. A well-depicted drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. The scenario is fluid and credible. The performances are well above average and the twists in the story are very clear. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not the ideal notion of film for everyone, but for those who appreciate something different worthy of your time. Highly recommended.
