Shadows breathes the scent of the streets of New York like no movie has gone before. This kick-off of Cassavetes' filmmaking work is as atmospheric as it is political and constitutes the initial spark of a revival of American cinema. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is desirable to watch Cassavetes' first work in a double feature with another beginning, Godard's Out of breath. Both films have shaped their country's film production beyond decades, and both have a particular lightness and lightness that has rarely been realized by these filmmakers in the course of their careers. <br /> Ben Carruthers), Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) and Hugh (Hugh Hurd). The story takes place in New York jazz and the catchy rhythms of the soundtrack play a vital role in the feverish, sometimes almost dreamlike, atmosphere that runs through the film. There is not much going on in the plot. The daily life of the three siblings is defined by problems of relationship or work, but at both levels, normality is misleading. Without moralizing gestures, Cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion in both public and private life. It was, in regard to the cinematic representation of racism, a revolutionary film in the United States. <br /> <br /> This film also owes a lot to the performances of the three main actors who were almost completely unknown before. Above all, Ben Carruthers has established with his energetic portrait the image of a new conception of young urban blacks in America, an image that characterizes the Spike Lee films of the 80s and 90s. Most tellingly, none of these three actors talented could not start a great career afterwards. Hollywood was not and is not ready to ethnically expand its celebrity system, which is why Goldoni, Hurd and Carruthers later found only small artistic niches in television and independent films. <br /> <br /> Maybe Shadows is one of the least "beautiful" movies ever shot, and one of the most beautiful at a time; a film of nuances and spaces, with a camera that only looks at the flow of life in crowded street corners, bars, hotel lobbies, apartments, causing an intriguing walk in the bustling streets of New York.
