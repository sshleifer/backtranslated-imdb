This grumpy and annoying film goes against the war in which it unfolded, but also throughout the war. He does not care about the war. It may be the most moving experience I've ever had with Ingmar Bergman's work. There is no face to the two main characters of this striking drama, which is not part of the ceremonial symbolism as usual Bergman, but clearly shows people and their lives and exercises what Bergman has already proved that he understands the reaction of a person. At the movie theater. <br /> <br /> Regulars of the greatest shooters, Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow, play an intimate but bitter married couple who was once an orchestral musician. Now, they live on an altered farm on an island. Part of the construction-related frustration we are developing to share with these two people is a source of detail that nothing in their home seems to work. Nor are they lonely intellectuals. It is a fairly familiar marriage, more or less resigned from life and essentially apolitical; they only hear distant rumors about a war that has been going on forever. Ullmann is concerned about the danger to their lives and his desire to carry children. Her husband, Von Sydow, does not know that the war will be over. Their serenity is interrupted by screaming fighter planes flying over their house, the assassination of a paratrooper, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisition and capture by what appears to be the local party, but loyalties have since long broken. <br /> <br /> They are sent home, witness the free destruction and suffer the vindictive consequences of a mistrustful marriage. This, one of my favorite efforts among Bergman's efforts, is the study of a couple jarred out of their unconscious lives and raped by a manipulative desperation, testing them both to reveal who they really are. She lacks compassion to a certain extent, too interested and agitated to have the least patience for her capricious crying fits. His repressed emotional problems led to the repression of the initiative itself and the enthusiasm that attracted them. The immense last twenty minutes, sporadically interrupted by images of the immense gray sky, are among the emotions closest to the real emotion that Bergman has ever filmed. <br /> <br /> All systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists of this downbeat portrait. The essentially clear personalities of Ullmann and Von Sydow characters are projected into the degenerate world of war because they are accused of being "sympathizers", but the film, shot on the small island of Faro, the city of Bergman, gives no information about where or when it is defined, who are the two sides and what they are fighting for. For an uninvolved civilian caught between the two, the knowledge base will probably be very similar. <br /> <br /> Ullmann and von Sydow are not sympathizers of the apparent enemy, but supporters of their apparent party. This reactive allegory of 1968 could concern the common non-combatant citizens of Iraq, Kosovo, Vietnam, Israel, Palestine or ...
