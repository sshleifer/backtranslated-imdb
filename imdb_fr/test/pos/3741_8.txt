NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings to the screen two talented actors from Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply magnificent story of a man and a woman who are hungry for something more in their lives than they currently have. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical, from the first scene of the film to the last embrace. The places, the beauty of their mutual attraction when they unveil themselves at their first meeting, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel each other, are real public fondly. James Franco in another micro-role is just the right cast, and the elegance of Lane in combination with the beach house, is a real film from the fall of 2008 to remember forever, just like THE NOTEBOOK.
