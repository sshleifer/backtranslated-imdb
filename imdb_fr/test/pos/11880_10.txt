Critters 4 is a good movie. A bit of a twist to the series, because it takes place in space, not in a terrestrial community. The good effects and the game make this film a must. I would recommend this to Sci-Fi and horror fans around the world. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this one should visit their website, Slumber Party Massacre and other Full Moon Pictures movies .
