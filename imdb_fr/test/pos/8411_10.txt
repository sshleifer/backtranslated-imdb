I have always loved "Gone With The Wind" and have seen it many times. However, his end left me not only "suspended", but depressed, with a desperate feeling. Finally, in "Scarlett", Ripley led us to a very plausible and satisfying end of the original story. <br /> <br /> It follows that a person of Scarlett's obvious intelligence (as originally written) would eventually grow up. Although, like most people, I fell in love with Scarlett in GWTW, I grew weary of her constant insipid infallibility to the point of exasperating, and I was disappointed that Mitchell did not show Scarlett use this obvious intelligence to even try to develop emotionally. . Fortunately, someone finally did it. (After all, is this persistent immaturity that contradicts his beauty and intelligence the very reason that Rhett finally abandoned it?) I think Ripley did a great job in describing this long-awaited process, and Whalley-Kilmer did a superb job representing him. Joanne WK has all the fire, exuberance and intelligent spark of Vivian Leigh, and she is certainly at least as beautiful, if not more beautiful. <br /> <br /> There has never been a single Clark Gable. However, if I had to choose an actor from the thousands I was exposed to represent in his biography, it would certainly be Timothy Dalton. Dalton has the same elegant charm as Gable, essential for Rhett's character. I can not imagine anyone else approaching him. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were both very talented and were the only actors who could play Scarlett and Rhett. I think their performances did justice not only to the late actors, but also to the spirit of their characters. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the whole cast. Julie Harris was her usual presence and Jean Smart was an adorable kick! Even the character of Ashley was well interpreted by Stephen Collins, and the progress of his relationship with Scarlett was completely credible. <br /> <br /> History has become a bit complicated in Ireland, but so is life, after all, and I found it entertaining. <br /> <br /> In the end, I really enjoyed the fruits of Ripley's imagination. I wish I wrote it! <br /> <br />
