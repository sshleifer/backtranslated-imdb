RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt very hot and sparkling when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) decided to take revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and devilish. For me, she deserved that Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him. However, I liked his castle as well as the rest of the decor. Also, I thought Lurky (Pat Fraley's Voiec) and Murky (Peter Cullen's Voiec) were diabolical. Before closing, I would like to say that everyone was perfectly launched, that the direction was perfect and that Disney was a great success. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to all those who have not seen it yet, especially to the hardcore fans of the television series. I guarantee you will enjoy it.
