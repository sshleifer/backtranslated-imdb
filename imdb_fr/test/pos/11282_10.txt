It's not a story. It is a group of psychic needles reaching your subconscious. If you wait for a story, you will be bored. But if you do it, you will be in the world of your dreams within 10 minutes. The vague but disturbing images of pain and torture in a desolate landscape give way to your own fantasies. The strange soundtrack that gives you the feeling of isolation, the visual echoes of the crucifixion of Christ, the pulsating light and the deep black shadows, all reach your subconscious to fill this mental space. I found myself trembling and unable to escape in front of my TV. It was like dreaming with eyes wide open. A strange nightmare, a bad trip, a religious experience ... it touched me deeply inside and marked me for life. This released my mind and gave me one of those rare experiences of personality loss and fusion with the world of archetypes. A little freedom for the soul. A violent freedom however .... Not a nice film, but very strong and unforgettable. Literally my text does not have any spoilers. For me, the big surprise of this movie has been its incredible intensity, and to describe it can be understood as a spoiler. The less you know about this film, the better.
