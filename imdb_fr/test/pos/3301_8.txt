Looking at this hilarious and retro, but very entertaining, career tale, I was impressed by Joan Crawford's first appearance. All I could think of at the beginning was: "My God, it's the same face as Michael Jackson on his notorious booking picture!" <br /> <br /> About 34 minutes into the movie, Diane Baker and Hope Lange get off a taxi in Greenwich Village. As they walk down the street, you can see part of the sign behind them for the Stonewall Bar - scene of the period "riots" that are seen as the trigger of the modern gay rights movement. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Baker and taxis, I had to laugh when she got one and said to the taxi driver, "56th and Sutton Place, please - and watch out for bumps." Can you imagine a driver's reaction to Manhattan today ?! She says that, of course, because she is pregnant and does not want to hurt the fetus. But that does not stop her from jumping out of a car when she discovers that Bob Evans wants her to have an abortion! Well, they had to find a way for her to lose the baby (1959 and all). <br /> <br /> Sue Carson is lovely in the role of Mary Agnes. Why was it his only movie? There is no biographical information about her in IMDb.
