It was good to see John Denver again, although he passed several years ago. I found this film very comforting and an excellent film to go by the fire on a cold winter night, reminiscent of what Christmas is. The scenes in Georgetown, Colorado, were beautiful and made you want to settle there immediately. While sitting here in my own mountain seen in California, I loved the story and the plot. I hope that everyone who sees this film a little older will appreciate it as much as my mother and myself. Merry Christmas! A great movie for the whole family to see too. Enoy and talk to others. Thank you for the memories. We must have more movies like this one in Hollywood.
