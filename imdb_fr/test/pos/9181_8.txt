OK, OK, I must say that I was impressed. It's hard to say what I'm most impressed with: my ability to choose the right romantic comedy to watch so I do not break my eyes, or the film itself. Anyway, "Hitch" was really good. Hey, that was good enough for me to watch twice. Will Smith was funny and good. Kevin James was just hilarious, and absolutely essential for the movie. As much as this film centered on Hitch (Will Smith), without Kevin James, it's just not the same thing. <br /> <br /> The story is this: Hitch is a matchmaker who helps the guy to woo the girl. Her job is to give the girl the chance to notice the boy when she would not do it otherwise. After the meeting, the rest belongs to the guy to make or break the relationship. It works only on reference and remains largely unnoticed during the process. Albert (Kevin James) is Hitch's project this time and Albert is staring at Allegra Cole (Amber Valleta), a Paris Hilton type figure. While the plot unfolds, Hitch himself has his eyes on Sara (Eva Mendes), a sharp, independent and hooked gossip columnist who does not want to have anything to do with a relationship. <br /> <br /> Both stories create fun moments they bind together for a bit of a quagmire. Of course, no love story is complete without the misunderstanding, the misunderstanding or the misfortune that was required to send the guy hunting after the girl. Fortunately, they make it short and impractical. Hitch was a funny and fun movie that ran very well and rolled without a hitch.
