Not your ordinary movie, but a good one. Billy Bob is very funny in this film, his way of speaking, what he says, etc. I was a little surprised to see it because I thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that. There was a very good story, good characters and a good balance. <br /> <br /> Favorite Part: Probably when Billy Bob runs in dress and shoots rippers
