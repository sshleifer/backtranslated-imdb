Amateur camera aside, I thought this movie was very different, and unlike all the blogs and posts I've read, I have something totally different from the end. The premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church. They have to respect all the rigid rules and regulations, but the girl seems to have a hard time staying on track, with bad thoughts from others and her vulgar language. Still, she prays a lot, just like her family. Then one day, they go to a picnic at the church and suffer an accident. From there, the parents and his brother change. what to be stunned and "saved" by Jesus. WARNING: MAJOR ALERT OF SPOILER. Or we are led to believe. I think that if you watch this movie from the girl's point of view alone, then be very careful in the end, you will see that what we, the public, think, is a real event with the parents and the son, is in makes everything a dream, and POV of the girl. This would explain many of the actions described by the parents and the son, which were totally opposed to the ones they lived before, especially sex, and would also explain why Peggy fled with the murder, etc. Look how perfect this pie is but go back to see what Betty is doing. That's unless Caroline removes all the evidence that the pie was laced. And also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents, lying in their arms, and her brother, all of whom seemed to die very peacefully, even poisoned, corresponds to a dream sequence.
