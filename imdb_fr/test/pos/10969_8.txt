The remarkable, sometimes exasperating, often brilliant films of John Cassavetes occupy a unique place in American cinema ?? Small budgets, partly improvised, inspired by the documentary of the cinéma vérité and related to the underground cinema, they nonetheless managed to reach a large and deeply appreciative public ?? <br /> <br /> After his theatrical studies, the young Cassavetes quickly established himself as an extremely refined and unusual actor, often appearing in films about rebellious and rebellious youth, such as "Crime in the Streets" and "Edge of the City." <br /> <br /> By creating a workshop for actors, he works to transform an improvisation experience into his first feature film ?? The result, "Shadows," took three years and is partly funded by his performances in Johnny Staccato's television. This is a breakthrough in American cinema ??

The parcel was minimal, the mood and the apparent emotional truth were all ??
