Even after almost 20 years apart, the first members of Black Sabbath have lost nothing. In this concert, they perform their best songs of their time (1970-1978), including "NIB", "War Pigs" and "Paranoid". <br /> <br /> Are also included invaluable recordings behind the scenes with interviews and retrospectives in their days as the first hard rock band on the planet. Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward's comments are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous performances on stage. <br /> <br /> A must for all Sabbat and Ozzy fans.
