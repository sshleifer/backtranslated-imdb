At first, I could not tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The next day, I had a unique film after a taste experience or a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. Lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us, he wants to become rich, laugh, travel, eat and be entertained. It moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive, but only to pass the time and be entertained. In the end it's too late. Since my first visit to the United States, it had become a bespoke dream, where life on Earth was just a strange experience. I am an artist and a Buddhist and this film has been communicated to my senses. It was an ideal embodiment of impermanence. It may seem strange, but one way or another, this film has been able to touch me more deeply than ever. I recommand it.
