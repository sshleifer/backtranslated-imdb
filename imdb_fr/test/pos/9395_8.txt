OK, it's easy not to confuse this with the lame film of Stuart Gordon called "Death Bed" which came out a few years ago, because this one is "The Bed That Eats". And how can I even begin to describe this? Well, for starters, of course, there is a bed that eats. This is the result of demon tears, which of course affect most things, I suppose, in a negative way. The bed is in the quarters of an old servant or something and was the cause of the disappearance of many people in his day. We have a narrator, who is a ghost who sits in the wall behind a painting and collects all the inedible objects (jewels, etc.) that the bed transmits. He died of consumption, one of the few people lying in the bed that was not eaten, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, as we see him sowing blood in handkerchiefs ... bleah. The thing about this movie is that it has a very strange sense of humor, but it's quite played. The film is divided into several "acts", I suppose, "Breakfast, lunch, dinner and just desserts". For the fans of what is unfathomably strange and weird, well, that might be fine for you. All I can say is that you have to see this one to believe it, that defies the description pretty well. 8 out of 10 stars.
