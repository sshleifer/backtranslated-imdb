I loved the movie "Northfork". I did not know anything about the movie before watching it. Therefore, I had no outside influence or information to guide me in what I saw happening on the screen. In retrospect, I would advise anyone interested in the film to watch it, if for no other reason than the quality actors on it. Do not read anything about the plot, the story or the evaluation of the film. In fact, STOP reading anything in my comments, even though I think they are general and would not spoil the movie for you, I do not want to diminish the value of the movie for you. Find your own way of meaning in this film or its potential is diminished. <br /> <br /> In general, I found the 3 benign Northfolk strangers confusing. As the film progresses, they could be described as three fun escapees from a psychiatric hospital or dreams and hallucinations of a sick and feverish boy, or three angels "sent" to find "the lost angel ". <br /> <br /> The sick and possibly dying boy works to convince the three "strangers" to abandon the search for the lost angel, to become his guardian (mother and father) and to take him to good distance from Northfork (not less than 1,000 miles). He even declares that he is the lost angel to try to manipulate them all to make him his guardian. Only one of the three responds positively to the boy. The other two have no enthusiasm or passion for this commitment. <br /> <br /> The priest who cares for the sick boy shows a deep concern for people and a deep belief in his faith. It transcends the desolation and emptiness of Northfork and its people. he is the light of kindness and hope for Northfork and the spectator. <br /> <br /> Near the climax of the film, the boy and the new guard go on the mainland to a field where a plane is waiting. They embark to find the other two foreigners also on the plane; in fact, we are the pilot. The engines start and the plane takes off. <br /> <br /> Who are the 3 strangers? If only one stranger was interested in helping the boy, why were all three on the plane? Where is the plane going? Did the other two find the "Lost Angel"? Is there a lost angel and if so who is he? Who are the six men dressed like funeral directors? If all this is only a feverish dream of the sick boy, how did one of the three strangers end up reaching out to help one of the men dressed as a funeral director when he jumped and s 'is banging the head men)? <br /> <br /> One or two sentences written under the title, explaining to visitors what this film is about, is a tragic mistake (it is not a spoiler, but a statement concerning only the publicity). So, if you have not seen the Northfork movie, the above questions only show some of the interesting and fun forks on the road of thought when you watch the Northfork movie. If you read the movie's plot summary before looking at it beforehand, maybe you should look at some of the above questions and look at them again ... I know I'll do it. <br /> <br /> Terry
