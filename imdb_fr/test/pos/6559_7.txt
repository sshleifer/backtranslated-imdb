<br /> <br /> Horror movie time, Japanese style. Uzumaki / Spiral has been a delight from start to finish. Fun fun, but sometimes it was a bit too kitschy rather than horrifying. The story is hard to summarize succinctly: a normal, carefree teenager begins to come face to face with extremely disturbing events, as the small town she lives in seems to be under spiral control. Spirals are everywhere, in the air, clouds, dirt and everyday objects. Spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them. Oh, something else, people turn randomly into snails. Why? Who knows or cares, people turn into snails, that's enough for me. It was not as scary as just scary, because there is not much suspense or jarring attacks as horror movies often do. Uzumaki prefers to crawl and crawl (like a snail could!) Rather than shake. A favorite scene: A woman is sleeping in a hospital room when the long, centipede creature makes its way into the room and slowly rises the bed, through the sheets, over the pillow and into the bed. his sleepy ear. I squatted and curled my toes. Uzumaki has a handful of very violent but humorous scenes too. For example, a man is obsessed with spirals, he enters his machine because he sees a spiral when he turns, he commits a spiral suicide inside the machine. The last shot we see of him is that of his spiral, rubbery body, a spiral of human flesh with a blinking eye blinking in the middle of the puck. A weird picture. Uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic orientation that adds to his charm and pleasure. I like horror movies like this one. It's not about killing, not about slasher movies, but about a force of evil (the spirals!) Who takes hold of you and tries to kill you, forces you to kill others. Movies like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror movie and, thank God, for that
