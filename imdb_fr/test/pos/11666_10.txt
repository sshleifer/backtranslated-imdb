In a world where questionable and misunderstood topics can be enumerated endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes one to the top of the list; moreover, it does so objectively and realistically, and with a sensitivity and sensitivity that make it a really great film, every time. And to add some irony to all this, even the subject of this film has been largely misunderstood, as it is poorly perceived as a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it's not. At the heart of Tim Robbins' "Dead Man Walking" is a subject that is perhaps the most misunderstood of all, and rightly so, because it may be the most difficult thing for a man to do. To be human. - and really-- understand. And this is the very purpose of this film: forgiveness. True forgiveness; Do not excuse an obnoxious crime or its author, do not say that what happened is acceptable, but find the strength to continue and choose your life. <br /> <br /> Director / Writer Tim Robbins and Sister Helen Prejean, a faithful adaptation of the novel, recount her involvement in the death row inmates to whom she has entrusted her faith in God over the years. As the film reports, what was to become for her a permanent quest for justice, but also for human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death row in Louisiana State Prison in Angola. Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) was addressing anyone who wanted to hear him, when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself venturing on a territory had absolutely no knowledge or experience. And Robbins has managed to succinctly capture Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey, while managing to keep him free from all maudlin sentimentality, which makes him not only real, credible and credible, but a poignant and deeply moving experience for him. the public. Through cinema, what was once a personal and meaningful emotional experience for Sister Prejean is also becoming an experience for all who see this film. <br /> <br /> For her moving and passionate portrait of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon has rightly won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Sensitive and emotionally charged, her performance is incredibly touching and real, particularly in the way she portrays the underlying natural fragility and vulnerability of Sister Prejean, tempered with the harshness she needed to pursue his efforts on behalf of Poncelet. (and in fact, five in total since the beginning). Whatever your point of view on the issues discussed in this film, Sister Prejean is unquestionably an individual of heroic proportions, which Sarandon personifies here brilliantly. and it does so without resorting to an unnecessary melodramatic, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very credible expression of the characterization. It's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn, who has been nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet, is also better than his current career (he was defeated by Nicolas Cage, who won the Las Vegas Award ). Perfect for the play in all respects, Penn just was not better, neither before nor after. He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person, rather than an exaggerated caricature of a monster capable of committing the crimes described here. Not that it makes Poncelet less despicable; quite the opposite, in fact. It's really disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things. And that's the strength of Penn's performance-- it's so disturbing, presented with depth and nuance; you only have to look in your eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul. A fantastic performance, and - as good as Cage was at "Vegas" - Penn should have been awarded the Oscar for that. <br /> <br /> In another remarkable performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in Earl Delacroix, father of one of the victims of Poncelet. With a short time on screen, however, he develops his character so that you can empathize with him and with Sister Prejean, because it is through him that we learn how complex his situation is and apparently tenuous. , at least on the surface. Barry presents Delacroix to provide the balance and perspective necessary for the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps emphasize the message of the film. <br /> <br /> The secondary cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille) Poncelet), Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is unlikely that this film will change one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention. what was planned was to make a stimulating and moving film, which is exactly what Robbins accomplished with "Dead Man Walking". Whatever your personal point of view, this film will have an impact and, hopefully, open the mind to the true nature of forgiveness. As we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not a simple decision, but a task that can become a work of a lifetime. And it is perhaps one of the most difficult things in life to accomplish effectively; and you come out of this film with a recognition for people like Sister Prejean, who devoted his life selflessly to helping those in need, and to filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon for having lived it for millions of years. people who otherwise would never have known her. I note this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
