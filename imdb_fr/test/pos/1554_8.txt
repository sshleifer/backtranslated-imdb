I also saw this film during a festival but, unlike the previous poster, I found it interesting and original. In a sea of ​​terrible features, shorts are often twice as painful for the budget and mediocre players, A.W.O.L is however a small thriller tense reminiscent of "The Outer Limits". The performances are solid, not what one would expect from Morse or McGinley, and the staging is clear and profitable. Personally, I have trouble reconciling the comments of the previous poster with the movie I saw. A.W.O.L is fairly well written by Shane Black who, as usual, plays the genre, paying tribute to the sensitivity of the stories, while winking at the audience and never taking himself too seriously. In total, A.W.O.L proves to be an extremely well executed and entertaining film.
