Meatballs is a classic comedy with so many laughs that it's impossible to count. <br /> <br /> In what was only a precursor to what was coming, Murray led the screen in what can only be described as comic. Tripper Harrison is one of the greatest characters in comedy of the past 50 years. Sarcastic all the time, clever when it is necessary, severe when it is necessary, and attentive when it suits him, Murray breathes to Tripper this SNL gleam in the eyes. <br /> <br /> CIT's are simply amazed by Mr. Murray's comic genius. <br /> <br /> Summer is not summer without a projection of Meatballs. One of the best comedies to ever honor the screen.
