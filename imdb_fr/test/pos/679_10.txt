Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or made a film in the '30s,' 40s and '50s, it guaranteed you excellent entertainment, even if the image was black and white. Ida managed to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the end of her photos. Helen Gordon, "High Sierra", 41, with Robert Ryan (Howard Wilton), "Golden Gloves," 40, lets you guess how much the relationship is going to be and how good a wedding can be and happy with love and real affection. If you liked Ida Lupino, who could play the role of criminal in a prison for women and a prison guard who was hated, here is the movie you can enjoy. I sincerely believe that Ida Lupino did not receive the credit she deserved for her great talents in the film industry!
