This episode "TFTD" of Season 1 ironically titled "Answer Me" is a memorable episode and well done, which takes a shocking turn in the end. You have Jean Marsh as actress and actress L.A. who moved to New York for an audition and lives in an apartment provided by an old friend. Oddly enough, she is awakened every night by a phone ringing in the next apartment, but strangely enough, the home where the ringing phone continues to ring is unoccupied, the guests having been dead for many years. Finally, she must give in, but she should have followed and not answer the phone with anyone at home, because it is bad to be caught in a phone that has a life of its own! Overall, it's a good, strange episode about a supernatural phone, but it's suspensive and goes well in the end.
