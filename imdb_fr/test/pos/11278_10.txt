This kind of anguish can only be in a young person who is very serious about his religion and his place in this world. As the text of the beginning of the film indicates, these images are dead: they already belong to the past and exist from the moment the product was ready. But this is only for the manufacturer of these "products": Perhaps for someone who is in the same state of mind (I think a lot of people, at least those who are seriously interested in religion , live the same terrible anxieties and doubts in their personal development). And this is of course the reason why art is made in the first place: identification and consolation between human beings. <br /> <br /> This film uses very well the "classical" techniques of experimental cinema. And this is where I think these techniques are the most useful: as tools to tell stories and create an atmosphere, not just pure abstractions or an end in itself. These "tips" have already been made many times. "Eraserhead" and "Nosferatu" are other films that I imagine that have influenced / inspired this director. It is interesting to see how these techniques make this film totally timeless: There is nothing contemporary about this film. Or nothing of any other specific moment either. It could have been done a thousand years ago. <br /> <br /> It is interesting in this story to see how these people treat this born holy child: they use it in a selfish way for their own purposes, and do not even try to listen to it. They beat him, snatched his intestines and castrated him. They drag their body (alive) from one place to another by force. And they do the same kind of violence to his mother. The story also reminds me of Borges' news "El inform de Brodie". Criticism of the practices of Christian institutions also reminds me of the great "El Topo". <br /> <br /> An unpleasant watch sometimes, but beautiful. Very simple, thoughtful and focused. Very strong film, almost too loud. All human energy has been concentrated on that. Plus, this movie shows that when you have passion and ideas, you can make a movie with a zero round budget. <br /> <br /> But I must admit that it was a bit difficult to watch a "contemporary" viewer like me, because of the experiment. It was so slow and demanding. But after all, it's worth it. I have to give ten points just for the effort someone makes this kind of movie.
