I remember going home from school to watch and come in it was the story of a black family coming out of the ghetto to become a higher class community the family was Wilson Frank Wilson they had 3 teenage children Kevin Valerie and Marcus. It was a very good show. it was educational without being preached. the show was well written. This show gave us a glimpse of an African-American before the Cosby Show. A black actor appeared in this Eternity series to David Hubberd and 227 Stonnie Jackson, to name a few. If you are able to find this show on DVD, you should have it for all your family
