Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager who is spending his holidays in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the gorgeous Julie Delpy) from suicide in Eiffel Tower and has a crush on her. He does not know she's a werewolf. They go to a clandestine party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is injured and becomes a werewolf. He is told that the only way to get back to normal is to kill the werewolf who attacked him and eat his heart. This film is a violent film of black humor. The special effects and the soundtrack are excellent, highlighting the song of the band Bush. I do not know why some readers compare this film with the masterpiece "An American Werewolf in London". The stories have nothing in common (only an American teenager, werewolves and a city in Europe). Highly recommended for fans of movies about werewolves and black humor. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomem Americano em Paris" ("An American werewolf in Paris")
