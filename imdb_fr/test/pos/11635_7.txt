Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short films directed by director Leo McCarey with Charley Chase. What a dandy it is! Charlie and his wife both undergo plastic surgery to improve their hideous appearance. They then meet at a party and get caught for each other. Now, they can no longer afford to discover that they are cheating. This is the absurd premise of this frenetic joke. Vivien Oakland, one of the few comic shorts to have a successful career long after the silences, is perfect as Charley's long-nosed woman. Charley has an awful case of prominent teeth that are quickly shipped to the dentist. After a police raid on an evening for no other reason than this, Charley and his wife are desperately trying to avoid their homes, lest the changes to appearances be known. Both were photographed with their new features at the party. The hilarity at home culminates when Charley tries to teach a no-good-nick cheat lesson with his wife. Of course, this is the new Charley, which his wife understood long before Charley gave a lesson in loyalty. This is one of Charley Chase's best efforts. *** of 4 stars.
