Michael Jackson is the greatest singer and the greatest dancer of all time and this film proves it. It's great to watch and the dancing is fantastic. When Michael turns into a werewolf, it's a bit like a room on the edge of your seat the first time you look at it. and the rap of vincent price adds to the fear when all the zombies come out of their grave. if you like that, I suggest you buy 'Michael Jackson's Making Thriller' which contains the movie, and then do it. the production shows an incredible performance of michael's "Billie Jean", at the time when he made the moonwalk for the first time on television. Look at this.
