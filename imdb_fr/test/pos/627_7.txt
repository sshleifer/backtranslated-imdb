I waited 9 years to watch this movie, simply because I have never seen it advertised on TV. Finally, I caught him and it was worth the wait. It's a lot better than your over-excited scream or garbage last summer because everything is happening at a fairly fast, streak-free pace, slipping through the house towards cheesy musical scenes. Only bad dubbing drops a little, but do not be discouraged in any way. What is hidden below? Mute witness - small budget, not excited at all and very good.
