I like this film, even if I do not like the way they conceive the Egyptians, being myself an Egyptian citizen! <br /> <br /> The relationship between Augustine and the leopard is delicate, and of course because of the solitude and the fact that she lived in this cave for so long, it develops a kind of madness. and passion for this leopard. <br /> <br /> A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch the reaction of Augustin .. <br /> <br /> In the end, I find it pleasant and I look forward to reading the news of Balzac.
