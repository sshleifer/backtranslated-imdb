Many experienced and excellent actors have been involved in the conspiracy of an incomprehensible part of the Second World War on the Eastern Front. Well represented and unforgettable characters. An episode lets you wish for the next one. Pay attention to the closing credits showing the thousands of Shtrafbat battalions. An unprecedented story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always filled with real people and dialogues. Produced with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most terrible time. I want to buy a copy for my own collection so I can enjoy the show several times.
