It sounds like your T & A movie for a regular teen audience, but the feeling is incredibly dark. If it were done today, it would be considered a home-made art film. This goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid, but the result of his efforts is hard, cruel and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> The whole formula of the film for teenagers is respected, but nothing happens as before. you would expect. Imagine a directorial film from "It's a wonderful life" where, in the end, James Stewart was not allowed to return to the real world. An incredible film that subverts all expectations of the genre. It feels dirty then: there is no redemption for the characters. I am surprised that this has never been done. The eighties version of Detective Story.
