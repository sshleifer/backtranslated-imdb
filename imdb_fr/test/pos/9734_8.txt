Six shots, Sergeant Tunnel, Dr. Death, Pinhead, Cyclops and Blade help young Andr√© Toulon to defeat Sutek's servant Egyption in the best sequel to this series. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master is atmospheric with many decors, quality of play and some fun effects on puppets. What is missing in gore is offset by an interesting plot and well paced. <br /> <br /> Best Quote: Dr. Death: "You do not know, my friends, smell the sulfur, see the smoke ..." <br /> <br /> It's easily the best movie from Dave DeCoteau I saw. The actors do more than credible work: Jack Donner in "Azfel" turns into an inspired performance, and young Toulon is doing well with puppets. Oh, and the ring needle is cool. <br /> <br /> John Massari's score is a beautiful symphonic interpretation of Richard Band's original Puppet Master tunes, which keep the film both playful and mysterious. It's rare for a Full Moon score to add anything to a movie, and it does. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dave Allen did not seem to be cheap enough for Band and Co. in the late '90s and beyond, so all puppet action was done in a baguette. There is no stop motion like in the famous and fun scene of the original where Pinhead is looking for his pinhead. And of course, as with all Full Moon dishes from this era, RPM was shot in and around the Castel studios in Bucharest, so most of the roles were turned to Romanians: hearing their "Parisian" accents was a bit boring . . <br /> <br /> In total, it's probably one of the top 10 Full Moon movies. It is certainly the most inventive of Puppet Master's suites.
