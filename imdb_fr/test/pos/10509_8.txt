I do not see why everyone is bombarding so much. I thought it was a fun time, but unfortunately not popular enough to be so famous. Believe me, I saw a lot more serious than that. If you want a bad movie, go see Blood Shack, Alien Dead or something. So what is a normal fare, but better than most others. And it's watchable. This film also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard. Part of the music is very suspenseful. And the death scenes are cool too. We see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words SOLD written in the blood on the mirror, and we also get a cool double strike by a toilet piston! with razors attached to her! It was a good 80s fun slasher that is well worth it, despite what others are saying.
