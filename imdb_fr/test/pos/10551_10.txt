This is one of my favorite movies EVER ... I've seen it about a million times and I would never refuse the opportunity to watch it again. In fact, I love it so much that I really wanted to take a look at the station where it was filmed during my next vacation ... Does anyone know the name? If so, please email me !!! I watched this movie for the first time when it was released. I was about Nikki's age and I asked my father for a long time to take me somewhere because I was expecting the same thing to happen to me! It's just such an amazing setting and such a cute puppy love story. It's a must for DVD collectors!
