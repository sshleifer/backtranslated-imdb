Being myself Russian, I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reference jokes about celebrities or celebrities on American television. Apart from that, Family Guy is the smartest, funniest and most politically incorrect series in the world. The dubbing is excellent and sounds clear enough, even for another anglophone than me. The animations are good too, maybe even too good for a TV show. We have here the equivalent of the Adult Swim Channel, but nothing compares simply to this jewel. Not even the Simpson or South Park. I hope the creators will continue to entertain and entertain us. I do not want to see all this turn into mediocre entertainment.
