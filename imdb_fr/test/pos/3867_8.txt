SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I like the Simpsons and I've seen all the episodes of their lives. I must admit that Season 1 is by far the most underrated season and is the most underrated episode of Season 1. The episode starts with the Scrabble Family Game to prepare Bart for an intelligence test that he must undergo at school. . He says the game is stupid and he does not want to play it, but he has to do it. He utters a word that annoys Homer and pursues Bart around the house. The next day, Ms. Krabappel reassures the class: the test is not part of their score, but a test that would tell them what their future would be. Bart can not answer a question. He thinks quickly. He quickly changes test with Martin Prince, the smartest in his class. Later in the day, Marge and Homer are called to the director's office to discuss Bart's behavior. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the school psychologist comes to tell Skinner, Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and that he should attend a special school for the talented. Bart agrees to leave because he does not need to do homework. The next day, Homer leads Bart to the new school. It is presented to everyone and everything. Unfortunately, his day is not very good. Smart students take their lunch intelligently, he can not read any comic book, but he does it anyway, and he is criticized by his comrades. Fortunately for Bart, Homer and he start having fun together, but Marge bought tickets for an opera. They go to the opera and make fun of it. The next day he goes to his old school but his friends make fun of him. They call it a dextral point. At his new school, Bart is invited to do a chemistry experiment. He hurts it and blows up school, leaving himself green. The psychologist asked Bart to tell him why he did it. Instead, Bart tells him that he wants to go undercover and return to his old school to observe other children. The psychologist is intrigued and asks Bart to explain it on a piece of paper. He finds it too difficult and instead writes a confession that he is really not a genius. He gives it to the psychologist. All that interests him is that he has badly written the word confession. That night, Homer bathes Bart and Bart tells him that he is really not a genius and that he cheated during the test. Homer gets angry and pursues Bart around the house while Lisa and Marge look at them casually. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very underestimated season 1 episode. <br /> 8/10
