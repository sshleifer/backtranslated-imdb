It is true. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me the most is the message that this film could address to all of you present. And the message is sad. He says it's very difficult to do anything incredible or even genius without obeying the governments, institutions, and other personalities of this world. And even if you try, you may not be able to stand it. This is the battle of one person with a system. With many systems. <br /> <br /> An excellent film of this wonderful Korean director. Please see if you have an opportunity.
