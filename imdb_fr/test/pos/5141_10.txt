I took my younger niece to an early concert and she LOVED it (I also loved myself). I do not need to explain the plot, because the film is totally faithful to the award-winning and well-sold book by the famous author Carl Hiaasen. The film takes the popular book and superimposes it with a beautiful cinematography (I want to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to funny-man, Luke Wilson and some newcomers) and good music! I have to get a CD from Jimmy Buffet now! I know a movie is good when I end up having goose bumps. Overall, it was a great family film in which I felt comfortable with my young niece. I would recommend it to everyone.
