I hope the series did not end so soon. Although acting is perhaps not the best in the world, it ends on a positive note and teaches morality and values ​​to viewers. Hilary Swank well represented a high school student who had lost her parents, etc. Miyagi was great, as in the previous 3 !! If you are not in the right end, this movie, like the previous 3 in the series, is not for you. On this day we live, you can not say enough about the bad guys who get what they deserve and the good guys who come first. The Bible teaches that good will always triumph over evil. This is exactly what happens in this one. It's a good family movie. Please see if you do not have it already.
