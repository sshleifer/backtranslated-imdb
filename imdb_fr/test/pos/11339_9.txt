WHAT IMPRESSIVE FILM !!!!!!!! I left the theater, stunned. The film I just saw is one of the best movies I've seen in my life. My eyes were on the screen. It is very symbolic, visually lush, beautifully shot and beautifully told. They are essentially two people who move into an apartment and live side by side with their partners, who are supposed to liaise with their respective partners. Assuming that, our two heroes play what they think their partners are doing. There is an obvious repression of feelings towards one another, with the use of varied photographic work, body language and symbolic stairs. It's a visual feast, and hard not to like. Part of the story becomes slightly confusing but it's nothing. The end is one of the most beautiful (and anti-Hollywood) I have ever seen in my life, and visually stunning. The haunting film adds to the mood. I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind and respect. What a superb movie.
