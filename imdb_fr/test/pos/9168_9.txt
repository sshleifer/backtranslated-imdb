As I said in the title of this article, it hurts me to say it, but "the team" reaches the zenith of what Hollywood romantic comedies can hope to aspire. I've been a critic of the genre and his name for as long as I can remember, but on an almost tragic note, "Hitch" made me go somewhere in the neighborhood of two hours of my life with a ridiculous smile. stuck on my face. <br /> <br /> This film can be misogynistic and presumptuous sometimes, but it nevertheless has a certain humor whose subtlety can only be described as British. It is a wonderful attempt by Hollywood to make (or redo as appropriate ...) a film that appeals to all our wishes for a romantic comedy that can make us think and laugh simultaneously. Reluctantly and very evasively, I give this film a score of 9 out of 10 ... Something you will hardly see me doing for a romantic comedy in the near future, or at least, I hope.
