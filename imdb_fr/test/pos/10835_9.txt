I do a thesis on the blur: the female transvestite and uses Tipping the Velvet as a main book, any comment on gender and sexual identity, gender and sexual confusion, genre as performance, genre as fiction, the gender imagery, disguise as an erotic fantasy and as a revolution, the effect of the male costume, etc., would be much appreciated! But a little off topic, did anyone see Sergio Toledo's 1987 movie Vera? This is a young transsexual transsexual lesbian ... I'm dying to see him because I think it would be really helpful ... Does anyone know where I could get a copy ? I tried Amazon and some other sites but no luck ...
