This film has all that is missing from typical horror movies. Although some things are fantastic, we take care of quality engineers. The only insight I can reveal is that I can not wait for Jackzilla. Dare I say winning Oscar. It's a perfect date film. I advise all men for a nice romantic surprise to see this movie with this special person.
