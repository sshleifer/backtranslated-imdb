Biodoc on the enigmatic singer / songwriter who, according to friends, would have spent the last 15 years of his relatively short life apparently in a self-destructive mission. He died at age 52, suffering from heart disease, overweight and dispelled, after having long drunk into excessive consumption of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, partying loudly and making blatant abuse of his instrument voice (he confided to a friend shouted his words during a performance with such force that blood still splashed on the microphone). <br /> <br /> All this despite the fact that he was: (1) widely regarded as having perhaps the most talented pop singing ability of his generation; (2) successful after years of industry acclaim - a Grammy, an Oscar, a decent recording contract with a leading label and at least two outstanding albums - "Nilsson Schmilsson" ( original) and "A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the night (norms); and (3) very happily married (for the third time), with a young and pretty family that he seemed to adore. <br /> <br /> The highlights of the film begin with the completeness of his account of Nilsson's life, including a great use of archival footage and many images of Nilsson; the editors are doing a very good job in bringing motion to still images. We learn his close ties with John Lennon and, later, with Ringo Starr (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). <br /> <br /> Even more impressive is the talking head, often the weakest aspect of the documentary. We meet people like Perry Botkin, Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams, all of whom tell amazing stories about Nilsson? far too funny, others deeply pathetic - and all who express their deep affection for him. The interviews with Nilsson's women are just as informative and moving? Annie and Una, his son Zach and his cousin Doug Hoefer. Best set of heads that I can remember in a biodoc. <br /> <br /> The biggest drawback of the film is that it explodes Nilsson's music. Even the performance of his greatest hit, "Without You", is brief after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for that, not since the movie lasts two full hours as it is. If we lose a few shots in the head, we would at least have heard this song, and maybe one or two others, like "One" or his cover of "Everybody's Talking" at the Oscars. "The filmmakers are just too concerned about Nilsson's psychological, mystical and not paying enough attention to his music My ratings: 7.5 / 10 (low B +) (Seen at the NWFC Reel Music Series, 01/07 / 07)
