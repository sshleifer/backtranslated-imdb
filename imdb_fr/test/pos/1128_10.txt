When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time, I did not expect a show with complex characters, intriguing intrigues and impeccable writing ... but that's exactly what I got. <br /> <br /> Greek follows several students belonging to the Greek system at the Rhodes University in Cyprus. Rusty Cartwright enters Rhodes (Cyprus) as a specialist in polymer science who aspires to be part of a fraternity. Her older sister, Casey (the center of the show and soon president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious campus sorority), does not exactly support her projects. In fact, none of her friends even knew she had a brother until he set foot on the college grounds! In addition to the fact that his younger brother was forced to return in his life, Casey's boyfriend, Evan Chambers (soon chair of the THE fraternity, Omega Chi), cheats on her with a new commitment from ZBZ (Rebecca Logan ), ZBZ's devilish president, Frannie, urges her to stay with him and she still has feelings for her lazy ex-boyfriend, Cappie (the president of the party house on campus, Kappa Tau). These characters are joined by Calvin Owens (a sporty and intelligent friend of Rusty's, who happens to be gay), by Dale Kettlewell (roommate and best friend of Rusty and possibly racist) and by Ashleigh (the best friend and eccentric confidant of Casey). <br /> <br /> Throughout the two Greek seasons (or four chapters), viewers are often reminded that university life is not black and white, but "in shades of gray from now on". Each character makes a lot of mistakes, but each of them has redeemable qualities. Casey and Cappie have a complicated, but beautiful, relationship throughout the series. The friendship between Rusty, Dale and Calvin is not always perfect, but they manage to overcome all the obstacles that are thrown at them. Even Frannie, Rebecca, and Evan (the "bad guys" of the show) appear from time to time as human beings. <br /> <br /> Greek shows show university students what they have better, worse and in between. It is a show that reveals the college as what it really is: a four-year adventure in which morality, beliefs and will are tested, compromised and sometimes even changed. <br /> <br /> The Greek has at least a season left, if not more, before the end. I can not wait to see where the characters will meet next. Greek is not your typical sitcom of the ABC family. If you want to listen to a show that shows the truth behind human motivation, Greek is the show you need.
