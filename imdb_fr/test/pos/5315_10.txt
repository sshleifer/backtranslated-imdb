I enjoyed, enjoyed, revisited this film because I'm sure there are subtleties that I missed. Wonderfully cast, no performance or complicated scenario, or clich√©. Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships, how people involved in each relationship are connected (or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each occupies in the relationship, in life and how they handle confusion, joy , the pain and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceive. At first, I thought there were "observers" and "observers", but this is not the case, we are all bound in one way or another and our perceived separation is only very weakly. I recommend the film to everyone, especially teachers, social workers, religious councils and all other people who breathe.
