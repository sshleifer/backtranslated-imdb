mondovino is a moving and enriching documentary. in the world of wine, there is a huge difference between the big and the small vineyards. it's not just about the size of your vineyard, it's about the amount of money and power you have. If you have enough money to place ads in Wine Spectator and hire a "wine safe", no matter how big your domain. Moreover, in today's business world, wine must often be sold in bulk and adapted to everyone's tastes. which means many times the filtered wine of its origin. mondovino shows the commercial side of wine in that of the mega-producer Robert mondavi and Michael Rolland, the oenologist who shapes the wine to the taste of today's critics, like Robert Parker, who also appears in the film. now these men are neither bad nor bad, for they have done a lot of good for the wine. but they have power on a large scale. as we all know, power corrupts. Mondovino also has small winemakers such as Aim√© Guilbert from Languedoc and Hubert de Montille from Volnay in Burgundy. These vine growers are not hungry winemakers, but they know, like all the great winemakers, that it is the origin of the grapes. the best example of this is explained not by a winemaker but by a Haitian working for Neal Rosenthal, the wine importer. the region where the grapes are grown is the terroir that counts, which makes it important for a real wine.
