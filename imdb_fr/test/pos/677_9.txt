When I first saw this film, it was around 1956 and although I saw it recently, I have not changed my mind about it. I think it was Robert Ryans' best film, because he described someone as my father and he was schizophrenic in real life (my father) although he never murdered anyone but he was more touched during the second world war which aggravated it. Having to just have fun to get by and get through the day was so conducive. (My mother and my brother had to do it.) When I saw Robert Ryan representing this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and I was impressed.
