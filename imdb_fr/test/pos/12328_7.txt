Lightning flashes; a sprawling cemetery; The name of Adam 'Batman' West: everything appears on the screen before the end of the opening credits, and yet, despite these rather disturbing elements, One Dark Night is not as cheesy as it sounds At first glance. <br /> <Meg Tilly (Jennifer's sister) plays the pretty student Julie, who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation to the exclusive clique of The Sisters High School. What Julie does not realize is that the other 'sisters' intend to panic with macabre pranks or that the last body to be buried in the mausoleum is that of 'psychic vampire' Raymar, who feeds on life forces young frightened women. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not the most original of configurations, but fortunately, there are enough inventive touches to help put this film out of competition, my favorites being the macabre. the sight of everyday objects encrusted in the walls of Raymar's apartment, and the frightening manner in which moldy cadavers float in the cold marble hallways of the mausoleum during the excellent finale. Hal Trussell's impressive steadicam cinematography and Tom Burman's wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the scary atmosphere.
