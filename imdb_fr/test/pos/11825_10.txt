The Cure is an exceptional drama of real life that deals with a very sensitive subject. This is the story of the deep and dear friendship between two boys, Eric and Dexter. The latter contracted AIDS during a blood transfusion. Thus, he and his mother (Annabella Sciorra) became outcasts, were rejected by the public and considered a dangerous undertaking, mainly because of a common lack of public knowledge about the disease. <br /> <br /> When Eric (Brad Renfro, known to 'The Client' and 'Apt Pupil') and his mother move into the next house, he faces public insults and the fear of catching him. AIDS itself. However, Eric overcomes his fear and risks everything. At first, he starts talking to Dexter, but eventually climbs over the fence and joins the witty boy (played by Joseph Mazzello of Jurassic Park) and his games. Very quickly, he develops a true friendship with Dexter, who is delicately built and fragile because of his condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the film? the theme that makes it authentically improbable and tragic at the same time ?? Here's how Eric and Dexter are trying to find the ultimate cure. At first, they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves. which is very naive, but also authentic at the same time, because it shows how young children deal with such horrible diseases and how much they still believe in the magic of the world. When they hear about an alleged cure developed in the South, they do not hesitate and embark on an adventure that will bring them closer together and symbolize the ultimate quest for hope. <br /> <br /> Hop aboard a raft and head south on the Mississippi River. What begins as a real adventure becomes a dangerous undertaking, both moving and informative. The scene where Dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, Eric hands him his basket, a symbol which, wherever the boy is obliged to go, will be and always be with him ; he will never be forced to be alone. This sequence, which is one of the most convincing of the film, shows a very convincing interaction between the two actors, who manage to avoid the clumsy and nerdy dialogues and to offer a very authentic performance which ends up breaking his tenderness and his honesty. I will not go further in the description of the plot, because I do not intend to give too much information. However, the end is emotionally hard and makes the public so much of the tragedy that everyone watching the movie will feel personally touched. This aspect makes this film so strong, so remarkable and so convincing. The emotional burden on all characters is so real and so heavy that even the most difficult members of the public may need paper tissues. <br /> <br /> A 10 does justice to this film and does not have a note too high. There is virtually no film in my life so far that deals with such an emotional problem with so much wit and sensitivity. This is the story of how two boys enrich each other and enrich their lives. Thus, Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness and Eric learns what really matters in life. and both realize how true friendship is a gift when it comes to the most difficult moments of life. <br /> <br /> This film is tragic? but his message is pure inspiration.
