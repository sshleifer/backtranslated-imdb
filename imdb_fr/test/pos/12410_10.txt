My wife and I loved this movie. Smart dialogue, great characters, construction of intelligent plot. The rhythm in this film is nonstop. I could not even go to the kitchen to eat a piece. We have never seen Corey Feldman so funny. Taylor Nichols plays a good Fed ... my wife loves him on HBO's "Married Man" show. The actors were all strong. The twist in the end encouraged us. That's why we give this film a "Standing O."
