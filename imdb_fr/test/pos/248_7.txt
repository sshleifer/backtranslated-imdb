It is truly an exceptional music of 1944 with big and young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth (Rusty Parker), "Charlie Chan in Egypt", sang and danced with Gene Kelly, (Danny McGuire), "Anchors Away", Danny McGuire owned a nightclub in Brooklyn and was in love with Rusty Parker. was a dancer of his club with Phil Silvers (Genius), "Coney Island", who was the comedian of this picture and who also worked and danced with Danny Rusty. Otto Kruger, (John Coudair), "Duel in the Sun" played the role of promoter of a cover-girls magazine and decided that Rusty Parker would be his best model. The music of Jerome Kern is heard throughout the image and the song "Long Ago & Far Away" is the theme of this music. This film was nominated for numerous awards and was a box office success during the Second World War, keeping the minds away from the war that was unfolding at the time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly have been instant successes and their careers have exploded on the big screen for many years. Great Musical and a movie you will not want to miss, it's really a great classic movie. Enjoy
