Conseguenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully directed film that implements meticulously placed steps that must be savored to be appreciated. Contrasting landscapes in the closed world that the hero lives, we are supported by the director and controlled from the entrance to the hotel. Like the hero, we will never escape the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his mafia-driven criminal world. The fact that the film resists stereotypes of the mafia, while feasting, makes the success even greater. The concrete tomb, the inevitable brutal executions and the overwhelming masculinity are exposed and exposed to what they are. Just brutality and business, and no more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine of organized crime and not about loving or living for yourself, your family, or others. Our hero is indeed a hero in the sense that he abandons his life for the simple touch of the beautiful waitress, the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbors in the hotel and to flee his decorative prison. The consequences of love are really beautiful and brutal at the same time. To see him !!
