The surface is one of the biggest serial movies I've seen. The acting is great and the story captivating. Each episode left me barely able to wait to watch the next one. I especially thought Carter Jenkins, who played Miles Bennett, did a great job ... he's a very talented actor and I hope to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> I can not believe Surface has had a season ... again, the audience let me down. It's hard to imagine a big show like this being canceled, while shitty reality TV shows continue year after year. Whoever made the decision to cancel this show really dropped the ball on this one.
