It's a real gem of a TV movie. Based on a completely false story, he follows the course of the depressed football league club through his career in the FA Cup, where chaos ensues and players all styles of the seventies. The end is unexpected, the performances are excellent, and Nick Hancock shows that he CAN do something other than sports shows. My only regret is not to have recorded it.
