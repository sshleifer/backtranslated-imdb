The movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last suite. The third was dark and semi-interesting, but it was not as fun and enjoyable as that. It's full of comic lines about Martha Stuart, the doll's anatomy, masturbation, and it's done effectively with terrible and disturbing images. The film was neither scary nor suspensive and I'm sure it was not the intention of the director. It was fun because of stupidity, Jennifer Tilly and her sexy performance. The puppets of the dolls were so well handled, the movement of the mouth, the lips, the tears in the eyes, a knife in the chest and the costumes. The dolls were just wonderful and it made the horrible deaths more manageable because they were made by wonderful dolls. The new look of Chucky was great and Tiffany was very cute. Some scenes with Chucky hugging the human Tiffany even made my father smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly good, very attractive and the special effects were cool. The end was so unsuspected and the fact that they can make another good is quite unlikely. It may not be as exciting as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it's certainly more fun !!!
