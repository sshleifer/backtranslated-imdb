I came across this film while surfing on a channel and I was blown away. It was broadcast on a less known short film program here in Australia. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I've been so impressed by a film, especially a short film. <br /> <br /> The power of history, the quality of acting and the stunning cinematography ... Wow! If it were available, it would be a valuable addition to my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely impressed and I'm looking forward to Joshua Leonards' next film. <br /> <br /> An exceptional experience 10/10
