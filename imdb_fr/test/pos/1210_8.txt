This event has defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, in my opinion, is not matched today. The colorful characters - in their stereotypical costume - brought a certain charm to the show, which has since been violated by society and overexposed. The fight had a little innocence at the time. A child could watch it without watching an episode of Jerry Springer. <br /> <br /> Looking back now (I was 5 at the time), although I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think Warrior pleased me more because of his mysticism. Hogan was the brand hero who had built an impressive public image. The Ultimate Warrior, on the other hand, was a masked man of few words - a hero out of the spotlight, aimed at a different audience. <br /> <br /> This rivalry was so exciting in its childhood because of that duking duking duality for each fighter. I had a place for both. Because this long and heavy battle had also shed blood, the stakes were huge - at least for me, child. In the same way, because of Hogan's defeat, it made him more human - I remember feeling a little sorry for him. <br /> <br /> All these emotions involved in the boy's soap opera have made Wrestlemania VI such a good time to watch this game.
