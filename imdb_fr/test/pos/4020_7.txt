Hi to all the scammers, you stone foxes, you mean the guys. Be careful, Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a funky and awesome movie to watch sometime, it's just perfect. 'Slaughter' is back and tries to relax after his adventures in Mexico. But if you're a narrow-minded gangster like "Duncan," you're forced to seek revenge. Why I do not know. Was Hoffo his first brother or what? Anybody. The film begins with the old "plane assassination" routine. We all know it's THE most effective way to take a guy out on a picnic. Needless to say, Slaughter survives the test, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, sorry George Gaynes, I mean is not so lucky. SLAP !! Also, Slaughters' best friend, Pratt, is killed. It's the beginning of a great adventure filled with the hippest and most fun music James Brown has to offer. It is true that "The godfather of the soul" put his mark on this naughty boy. In addition to Jim Brown in the lead role, this film is filled with the biggest names in the blaxploitation scene. What about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters? In other parts, we see none other than Judith M. Brown and the last but still less the fantastic Don Stroud as a wicked henchman.
