Anthony Quinn has a perfect command of our heart and our sympathy. He portrays a Romanian peasant with a lower than average IQ, harassed by his wife to do more. It was the Second World War and the Nazis invaded his country. Soon, he finds himself digging entrenchments in the hope of getting rich in the eyes of his wife. The Nazis have different ideas. Over the next few years, we see the events unfold through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. His manipulations and bad luck simply put him in the hot water. Finally, without any fault on his part, we see his picture on the cover of "Der Spiegel" as the perfect Aryan. The war ends and the allies bring him to justice for war crimes. But all our peasant wants to do is go home to his wife.
