This film is superb! Wesley Snipes plays Blade the vampire hunter with a pure class, he strikes the buttocks in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The film is a thrilling action race and beautiful waterfalls. The first and last action scenes are remarkable and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs sweeping through all the black heads. The script is very good and there is a lively dialogue too. Wesley should have done more action movies than him, I know he's a very good actor and in this area he's not as impressed as in his comic or drama roles, but in is the stars of the action, he is the best actor. all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and maybe Tom Cruise (if he counts as a star of the action) are getting closer. As good as Wesley being of quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the villain. It was an unexpected surprise that someone small compared to Snipes becomes threatening, but that's the case. Overall, the film is sharp, elegant and I hope the sequence is made with the same rhythm.
