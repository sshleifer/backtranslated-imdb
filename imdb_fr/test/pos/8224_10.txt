The Regard of Flight, written and performed by Bill Irwin, is a true classic play that translates very well on the small screen. Filled with quick and glittering dialogues and some of the best physical comedies of the decade, it exceeds 99% of "Comedy" as it is presented today. I'm sure he will one day take his place with shows as great as "The Fantastiks" and "Waiting for Godot". Why it's not yet available on DVD is a mystery and a tragedy.
