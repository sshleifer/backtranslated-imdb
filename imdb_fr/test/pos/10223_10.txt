This is Clive Barker's masterpiece in my opinion. The film has a beautiful story and makeup and incredible effects. The only thing I would like to see happen is a sequel. The film was prepared for a sequel and with improved technology, the second movie could be amazing. David Cronenberg must appear in a sequel as well as Craig Sheffer. But this movie in particular was an excellent, creative and entertaining idea, and I could watch it again and again. Cronenberg was perfect in this movie and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the movie.
