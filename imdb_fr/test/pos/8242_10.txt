Having grown up in Sydney in the 1950s, I can easily identify the content of this film. Every week, I went to George Street's Wynyard Newsreel to watch Cinesound shorts (and usually 3 Stooges). There has never been a better mix of black and white and color in a movie. Irreproachable production values ​​complete an unforgettable cinematographic experience.
