I just watched this movie during its first night out of curiosity and nostalgia. I liked (not loved) "Mork & Mindy" when I was a kid, especially for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This film reminded me why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised, I was expecting nothing more than a painting by numbers, chronological review of the series (which was one). But, of course, the focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from a struggling street jester to a national movie star and how such a radical difference had affected him and his long-suffering wife. And my hat is to star Chris Diamantopoulos as he described Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even impeccable. (On a separate note, I noticed that Robin's struggles in some ways resembled Andy Kaufman, who was underrated by network television and creatively restrained, but it's the biopic "Taxi" in Behind the scenes.) <br /> In summary, it's a very enjoyable film in which I felt I knew a little more about the man behind the Orkan. The acting was solid - never melodramatic as I supposed - and the story is moving forward. The performances that were particularly good were those of those playing Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was funny!). This is not a great masterpiece (I would have liked to know a little more about Pam Dawber), but you really have to watch it, especially for the fans of Robin Williams and "Mork & Mindy" . Nanoo, nanoo!
