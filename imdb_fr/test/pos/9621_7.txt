Martial arts films became huge in the 1960s in parts of Asia, but with the growing popularity of Shaw Brothers' infamous films, the United States was inevitable. This film was the first to be presented in America under the label Warner Bros. It actually triggered a craze that flooded the '70s with martial arts movies. Most of the movies to follow are unlike anything, but some are great and many, like Enter The Dragon (released soon after this one), have become huge successes and have made them superstars. <br /> <br /> Fast almost 40 years later, this film still stands. Most of the Shaw brothers' films are as good today as they were then and, to tell the truth, no such films have been made to compete with those made by The Shaw Bros. time. <br /> <br /> I like I think martial arts are like porn and no one's watching porn for the plot, but the same goes for MA movies and most of them are only very nice fights with a little story, this one is an exception. There is no incredible story, but there is one here. <br /> <br /> The main character played by Lo Lieh stands out among the heroes of karate movies. He never brags and never fights just because he can, he is often perceived as a weak fighter and less fighter than most others, but when he has to fight, he is damn the greatest alive. I really liked this character. Many villains were memorable and the fighting scenes had just been presented so amazingly. Even a small role with Bolo Yeung can be seen as a huge Mongolian, and Bolo is in my top 5 of the greatest martial art movie stars of all time, he was also in the movie Enter The Dragon mentioned above. above. <br /> <br /> the production, as I've said over and over again, is beautiful, you can not beat the Shaw, the direction was something different from what I saw a lot in the films from the 70s, the use of color was well placed and made this film isolated and rising above the others. When the light shines in the hands of Chi Hao and the Iron Fist, it's all its beauty. <br /> <br /> The music was superb too. The martial arts films were for Asia what the Westerners were in Italy, two distinct art forms that have so much in common. The countries that made these films had all genres, but Japanese films were the ones that made waves, just like spaghetti westerns in Italy. With their many differences, the styles of these two genres were neck and neck. As seen in films such as 5 Fingers Of Death, the fights were easy to compare to Sergia Leoni's cowboy fights, and the music tied the genres so well. The music here is a little borrowed from Ironside, but it remains very original. <br /> <br /> Many films are inspired by this one and, when I look at it, I can see everything from The Master Killer to Bloodsport, after being influenced. The most obvious film to have been influenced is Kill Bill, who is for me the greatest of all time. Many decors used by Quentin are complete replicas of those seen here. He used the music in this film, even though it was borrowed from Ironside. And the fight scene at the end of Kill Bill, vol. 1 with The Bride and O-Ren is sometimes accurate compared to the fight with Chi Hao and the Japanese thug at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> I've seen many martial arts movies, some even better, but it's a must for fans of the genre. You can not go wrong here. The film starts slowly but after 15-20 minutes, it starts again and does not slow down.
