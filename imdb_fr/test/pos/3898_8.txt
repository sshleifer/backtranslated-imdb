"A slight murder case" is an excellent TV movie that is well worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is excellent as a film critic who accidentally kills his mistress and then tries to conceal the crime. Although it may seem dark, the film is rather light and funny, with many memorable phrases ("Playing is harder than I thought - you've never seen BODY HEAT, I think I have to apologize to Bill Hurt" and my favorite "For next week, answer these two questions about the film noir, what do they do during the day and why is it still raining?) to see for fans of Macy!
