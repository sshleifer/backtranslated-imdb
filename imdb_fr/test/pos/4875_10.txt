I watched SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was the feature film of the Festival and won the Best Film Award on a few hundred entries. The director and some stars answered the questions after the screening. A star, Suzy Lorraine, was even hotter in person than in the movie, and she caught the eye in the film. <br /> <br /> This film is independent, but it has many cinematic keys that are worth it. a feeling of quality. He even has an original musical score of classical style. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Savini and he's the bad guy here, in black cloak he's more of a perverse force than a real person I think. He sucks people's souls and uses them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the Kingdom of God on Earth. According to him, Christ was all about suffering and Savini intends to make everyone suffer. <br /> <br /> The main story that holds your attention is that of a young doctor, Stefan, who is responsible for investigating the strange events of Savini. causes in an isolated city. He offers to an aristocratic girl on the way but his father SOB tells him to get lost. Then he meets a strangely possessed but seductive country girl. I think she falls in love with him, but she is also trying to kill him, just like a number of exciting women in the film. <br /> <br /> I found the scenes shot in the most scary and catchy woods, with strange people along the way (the evil twin girls scared me). <br /> <br /> The film has a lot to do, too much to list. There is a lot of blood, torture and gore. Hot chicks licking blood from guys' fingers. The head of a terrified girl explodes. It was unexpected. The throat is sliced. Crushing knocks. <br /> <br /> Then they sometimes play for fun, having fun a bit of the crazy kind of the black forest. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Hammer and Ingrid Pitt's films, it's fascinating to see her in this movie. She unchecks one of the tracks by plunging a cross into her skull. Excellent. The guy who played "Multiple Miggs" in Silence of the Lambs is awesome in an ax fight. <br /> <br /> The film is surreal and with the end, I'm not sure that the events happened or if they were in Stefan's head because of his rejection by his future fianc√©e. He comes back in revenge and this scene is brutal. <br /> <br /> The director also discussed the theme of the misuse of religion to support wars and killings. I can see that Savini's vision of religion was frightening. <br /> <br /> It was a strangely exceptional movie with stars like Savini and Pitt, with lots of good actors, including hot babes, great bloody scenes, action, and all the time you wonder what happens and what will happen next. <br /> <br /> It deserves ten stars because it's an excellent independent film, I do not think so It was a small budget, but it was a lot less than the budget of a studio, and yet they have managed to create something truly attractive, unique and stimulating.
