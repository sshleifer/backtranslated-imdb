He is a modest, unpretentious, traditional Westerner who offers a conspiracy based on fierce opposition to pastoralists and farmers in the city of Liberal, Kansas. The story is essentially routine and portrays a number of classic Western conflicts. There is a breeder against a breeder; there is the conflict between cultivated land and "civilizing" tendencies on one side and the ethos of wilderness / frontier on the other side and what this ultimately stands for is the opposition of two value systems - democratic and community values ​​opposed to robust individualism. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott plays the legendary Bat Masterton who goes to the Liberal Party at the request of a land agent (Robert Ryan) to help him unravel the bad guys who are very alcoholic cowboys and brawlers. The two men quarrel but meet to face the troublesome elements of the city. <br /> <br /> The scenario is cliché but the action is vigorously propelled by director Ray Enright and solid In addition to the robust performances of the main male protagonists, a comical relief is offered by George Gabby Hayes, an oily villain played by Steve Brodie, and attractive contributions from Maggie Meredith as an award-winning Eastern star courted by Ryan and Anne Jeffreys as a singing salon. As long as you do not put a price on originality, it's a good entertainment for western lovers
