This first film of the future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenus. In rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children in freedom. Add to that a range of familiar characters for fans of cinema giallo ?? a mad woman, a journalist, an ineffective police, a sexy siren, a priest, a dumb girl, a lonely man with a mental disability, etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's. <br /> <br /> Exceptionally for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which changes from the point of view of women more typical in danger. The fact that it is the children who are the target of the maniac only makes things a little more uncomfortable. Fulci pushes the envelope a bit here and goes even further in a gloriously scandalous PC scene where a young boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy nude girl (Barbara Bouchet) to whom he is entrusted. She shows herself openly and actively invites the young person to watch her. in the end ask him if he wants to go to bed with her. Although she plays clearly with him, the scene remains quite unusual. Admittedly, there are one or two pieces of dialogue that are unintentionally funny here, but it is very well photographed and Barbara Bouchet has a high level of confident sex appeal. A standout stage. Even if you feel a little bad looking at it! <br /> <br /> With Barbara Bouchet, the other outstanding performance is that of Florinda Bolkan, who embodies a crazy accused of murdering children. She is not directly responsible, but it is up to the viewer to decide if her dark magic may have triggered or not the next murderous madness. Independently, she is pursued by a crowd of lynchings and whipped to the chain, while a car radio projects rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. His wickedness indicates the path that Fulci's career would follow. <br /> <br /> Despite the visceral impact of the aforementioned murder, it is perhaps a little surprising that the other murders are either bloodless or off-screen. The only other scene of death comparable to Lynch's crowd is the end of the murderer at the end of the film, although this sequence is a bit silly. The plot is complicated and flooded with red herrings, although personally, I found the killer's identity a little predictable. This weakness is however less problematic during subsequent viewing ?? Like most gialli, Do not Torture A Duckling is wonderful to be watched again. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is well shot with an impressive camera work, a solid interpretation and an effective music of Riz Ortolani ?? An unaccompanied recurrent female song that sounds like coming from a distant hill is particularly interesting. Of course, Fulci has made horror movies that are more graphically violent, but here he shows a talent for smaller films. It's always a wild thing and it is highly recommended to fans of cinema giallo.
