This film should be as close as possible to perfecting a film like John Ford did. The film is magical, a masterpiece, the reason why Ford was, well, Ford. If you want to know why Ford was so good this one explains it. <br /> <br /> The photography is of course superb, in black and white as in black and white, great shots, not a conversation over the shoulder, pure Ford, great moments, big and small. The famous torn pants of Ward Bond. Apparently, two dogs continued to invade and fight, so Ford wanted to use them on the fight scene, but instead of fighting one dog ran away and the other attacked Ward Bond and tore him apart. the pants, which caused Ford an end of joy. A whole scene around braiding a rope. The way Ben Johnson burns then took his rope, a wonderful foreshadowing and anticipation of the finale. Harry Carey naively courts Prudence. The usual line of the ford about fear and rejection Bond's horse accidentally falls into him and stays in the movie. Johnson and Bond are fantastic in this scene. Lord, help any Ford player who does not stay in the character while the camera rolls, even if a horse falls on you. <br /> <br /> A couple of very sweet novels, not disturbing the focus, two very nice tracks, not to mention for girls, the number of times the cameras focus on the rather charming back of Ben Johnson. <br /> <br /> Many old-time stuntmen getting lines and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Wonderful character studies, mostly faces, villains and main stars. A set of villains to compete with any group in any western. <br /> <br /> Numerous Fordian shots of faces, groups, children, women, little things going on, foals in the background (Ford seems to like foal images), women in aprons, letting the moment pass where the wagons cross the rivers and where the camera hangs. <br /> <br /> This is probably not a western as much as an artist's painting placed to the west. <br /> <br /> Fortunately the film was shot in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine that such a film could be redone, but it is such a work of art that it would be a sacrilege than to tempt him.
