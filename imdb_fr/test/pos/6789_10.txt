I hope our society will never be too cynical to appreciate the simple beauty of this film: beautiful to look at with its romantic English campaign and beautiful with its message of faith and loyalty. Look at this with your children, especially your young girls. Velvet Brown is a wonderful model for girls. It was one of my daughter's favorite movies. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a best-selling book by Enid Bagnold about a girl, Velvet, whose entire life is his horse, Pi, and on his one mind pursuing his dream "impossible" . I will not say more about the plot, unless I spoil it for viewers. She lives with a big loving family in a small coastal village. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that made Elizabeth Taylor a star. To see the film is to understand why. She is a natural actress who exudes an inner beauty that matches her outer beauty - confident, passionate, innocent - she is the emotional heart of the film. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney gives a magnificent performance as Mi, the young man who comes to their door one day, stays and helps Velvet to form the Pi. This is one of his most beautiful performance. Anne Revere, mother of Velvet, also stands out in an Oscar-winning role. Her strong, loving, and wise character understands that life does not have much value if you do not follow your dreams: "We are alike, I too believe that everyone should be lucky enough to have a craze for Breathtaking once in his life. "<br /> <br /> I highly recommend this very sweet and inspiring classic from Hollywood's golden age.
