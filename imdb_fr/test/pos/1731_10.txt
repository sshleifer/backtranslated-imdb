Doctor Who is amazing. It's everyone's cup of tea. This must be. Boys will love monsters, action and adventure, and girls will enjoy the emotions and feelings that surround them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was amazing as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real. <br /> <br /> David Tennant is also witty and fun, and it's so nice to watch him. <br /> <br /> But now, Billie is gone and Rose is stuck in a parallel universe with her occasional boyfriend Mickey and her father and mother (he died when Rose was a baby but this Pete Tyler is from parallel universe). It will be very strange that Martha is the new companion, as I have never seen her with Rose (except the Runaway Bride with Catherine Tate). <br /> <br /> Freema would be better to be good !!! <br /> <br /> But no one can beat Rose !!!
