It was probably while watching this TV movie that I became interested in the debate as to whether "Anna" was really the daughter of Tsar Nicholas, Anastasia. Since then, I have made a point of watching various documentaries and buying a book. Despite the evidence discovered since the release of the film, I still think sometimes it was. Such is the power of Amy Irving's action in this somewhat liberal two-part text with the historical facts, but filled with crushing drama and compelling performance of Irving. <br /> <br /> I was not conscious I already knew Irving, even though I saw it without realizing it in "Carrie" (another favorite movie). In "Anasasia", I never felt for a moment that "it's just a movie". For me, this woman was Anastasia, and when the first part ended in the railway car, bringing together members of the royal family, I knew that, whatever the moment, I needed to see the second part. I just wanted to see how she would prove she was what she claimed to be and, throughout history, I've felt an intense hatred for the character of Rex Harrison, although I admire him greatly as a actor. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie in the TV guide, I convinced my mom that we had to watch it, and she thanked me for doing it, being almost as excited as I was I had watched part 2. Then I bought the video and can totally recommend it. "Anastasia" is one of those rare TV movies that you simply have to watch for the biggest pleasure of watching the best acting game I have ever seen on TV. It does not matter if you believe the legend or not.
