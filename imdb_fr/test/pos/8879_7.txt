Now, Throw Momma from the Train was not a good comedy, but it's a fun load that makes you laugh. The title may seem a little strange, but the whole movie is not literally about it, although it's something equally sinister. <br /> <br /> Danny De Vito basically wants to kill his domineering mother, and fast forward a bit, random and fun events take place. The principle is quite funny and the things in which Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito get started are excellent. Some scenes did not seem to fit me, but that did not make this movie a bad movie. <br /> <br /> For what it is, a crazy comedy, he's doing well and should be seen once again just to say that you've seen him.
