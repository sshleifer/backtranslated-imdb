Stewart's age did not bother me at all in this film, although he described a much younger person. I still remember my fascination with Lindbergh's story and although I was fully grown up at the time this biopic was created, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> Not only does this give Stewart a great performance, a lot of fascinating technical data, making them understandable for those with technical challenges like me. And the look of the plane itself was superb. <br /> <br /> I loved this representation of a period before my birth and it awakens my childhood love for airplanes and the idea of ​​flying.
