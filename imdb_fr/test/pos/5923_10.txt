A great movie about the triumph of all the followers who are trying to kill your mind, realizing the impossible. I'm not going to talk about it except to say that I liked to think about the film when I faced a particularly daunting task and that I realized that if Lindberg could do what he did, I could certainly face the task who is waiting for me. Certainly a movie "feel good". <br /> <br /> See. You will not be disappointed.
