Despite its old-fashioned appearance, "Inki and the bird Minah" is, in my opinion, a nice and charming cartoon. The artwork is not extraordinary, but sufficient. This cartoon has no dialogue, just sounds and music, but this combination works pretty well. The cartoon itself is good, funny, old-fashioned, creative, entertaining and fun. <br /> <br /> This cartoon also makes the difference because it focuses on 3 characters at most: Inki (the little black girl), the Minah Bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion who wants to take Inki and Minah at breakfast - he pursues them both for most of the caricature. <br /> <br /> I actually find this lion very beautiful, hilarious and cool. I really like this lion. This poor lion is so stupid and losing that he must be pitied. For me, the real enemy is the Minah Bird, not the lion. At one point, the lion eats it almost - a pity he can not swallow it because he deserves to be eaten. <br /> <br /> Back to this animated short, there is not a single boring moment game. At least for me. The only thing I find stupid is the end, because the bird must fight violently with the lion, steal his teeth and put them on himself. Apart from that, I have nothing major to criticize about this, apart from the fact that the steak should have gone for the lion and not for the bird. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a very forgotten and underrated little gem that should definitely get more credit.
