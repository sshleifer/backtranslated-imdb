It's one of the most humble and humble vampire tales of all time! I really like this movie. The character is great, even the place and the story. Indeed, Picture is not a big budget production, but it is definitely worth the detour. <br /> <br /> OK, there are flaws (especially the names of the castle and places) in this movie, but such mistakes typically and almost in all horror movies. <br /> <br /> The landscape fits perfectly with history and is close to reality, I can say honestly, because I visited once when I was in Romania during my vacation. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best part of the subspecies series.
