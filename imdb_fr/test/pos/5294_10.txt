The cartoon legend Hayao Miyazaki, I had heard about this movie, and I wanted to see it so much. But I was lucky to see the movie online on YouTube; After watching the movie, I knew it was another Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli classic. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by my favorite fairy tale, "The Little Mermaid", talks about a 5 year old boy. named Sosuke and his relationship with a goldfish princess, whom he named Ponyo, who aspires to become a human being and to be with Sosuke. I will not give you more details, you will have to see the film for yourself. So, all in all, one of the best animated movies ever, with lots of fantasy, adventure and humor ... I loved it!
