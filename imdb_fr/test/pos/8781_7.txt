Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes in search of the real culprit. The familiar theme of Hitchcock of a man wrongly accused of a crime is well played in this entertaining tariff which contains elements of "The Thirty Nine Steps" and "North by Northwest", although it is not as good than any of these classics. There are impressive plays, including the final on the Statue of Liberty. The plot is implausible and unconvincing and, after a fantastic start, it seems to run out of steam. Cummings is nice but a little stiff in the head. Lane is the blonde but not the cool variety of the director's latest films. Support roles are generally well played.
