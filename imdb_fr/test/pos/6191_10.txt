Beautiful description of the situation in the United States, it explains different types of Islam, not just terrorists and extremists. Islam can be more than killing, they show why some people become terrorists and how to become Muslim without being extremist. This is a big series that Muslims and non-Muslims should see. We now hope that other series or films will be made to change the idea that all Muslims are terrorists and that all Americans want to destroy Islam. It made me want to discover what exactly Islam is and what the US and European governments do to promote coexistence between people of different religions.
