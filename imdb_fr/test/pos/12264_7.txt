James L. Brook is one of those directors who always seem to have an odd look at life. He is not only the producer of "The Simpsons", he has some classic comedies to his credit - "Broadcast News" is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although this does not correspond to his last effort "As Good As It Gets," "Broadcast News" is still a very intelligent, funny and witty movie on a TV channel and all Their problems. There is a beautiful, humorous sequence of physical humor where Joan Cusack walks around the building trying to get a video diary into the editing room in the space of just a few minutes before it is broadcast live on television. <br /> <br /> This is not only very truthful about the way radio stations are exploited, but also a clever and honest representation of human beings. <br /> <br /> A discreet and subtle movie with good acting (especially from, which I do not always like so much) and proper direction.
