I saw this film on television in the UK about 25 years ago and it has touched me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by the visit of Hilton Head - the next island above "Yamacraw" (Daufuskie in fact), and by reading Pat Conroy's excellent "The Water is Wide". Thanks to the knowledge gained, I reassessed Conrack and I consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures Conroy's spirit and the film's atmosphere brings the book to life with some precision - a rarity in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Three things strike me again in this story: 1. The issues of education for the poor and needy and inclusion remain the same. 2. Education is not limited to reading and writing. 3. These children were my peers. I was six years old in 1969 when Pat Conroy spent his year at Daufuskie. <br /> <br /> Why has not it been recorded on DVD yet?
