I had never heard of this film before it was broadcast on cable television and I do not understand why. Geena surpasses Arnold as action hero in this movie! Geena is a former CIA assassin who has been brainwashed and has acquired an identity as a teacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues this life for 8 years with a husband and a daughter. Clues are starting to come to her, that she might have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she was never dead and want to make sure she is. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, a former police officer. Together they make a couple as entertaining as Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. When Geena finally finds her memory, she turns into a killing machine, with the song "She's Not There" playing in the background. What follows is that Geena and Samuel must go after the villains and hope to stay alive. Throughout the movie, Geena has to decide who she really is. The machine that kills insensitive? The mother / teacher of quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially that the bad guys catch Geena's daughter. Beautiful action scenes that rank among Die Hard!
