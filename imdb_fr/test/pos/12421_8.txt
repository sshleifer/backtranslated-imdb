It's a surprisingly cheap horror / comedy movie, it's funny and pretty well done, with good performances and a really cool ending! All the characters are pretty cool, and the story, while not original, is very good, and Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) have a fantastic chemistry. One of the funniest moments of the movie for me is when Adam is stuck in the bathroom and Harry wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to take some pictures in the truck. Aimee Brooks is just sexy! Plus, it's one of the best low budget horror movies I've seen in a long time. It's very gory, but in a comical way, and I thought it was very well written as well. In addition, Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as a Monster Man and had a shabby makeup! It looks like movies like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc., etc. There are moments of suspense here and there, in addition to the effects gores are really well done. Horror / Comedy is surprisingly cheap and on a budget, it's funny and pretty well done, with good performance and a very cool ending, I highly recommend this one! The direction is very good! Michael Davis makes a very good one! Work here, with a good work of camera, good angles, good use of colors and a good frame, besides it kept the film funny and very fast. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of gore! . We have bloody bloody nose bleeding, bloody stabbing, bloody knives, a guy cut in half by a monster truck, human remains in a cooked stew, tripe everywhere, tripe fallen, a pencil in them. eyes, bloody throat, group of people walking around without limbs, dead bloody squirrel, crushed heads, cut limbs, bleeding, mutilated body, decent amount of bloodshed, a very bloody scene at the end and more! <br /> <br /> Playing is very good for a low budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam, he was a nerdy but a very nice man, he had a fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, nice lines and I loved his character, he also seemed to have fun, and he was especially good in the end! Justin Urich is excellent as the ass of a best friend, however I could not help but love him because he was very funny and often stole a lot of scenes, I really dug it! Aimee Brooks is beautiful and did very well what she had to do. She had good chemistry with Jungmann and, like Jungmann, she was particularly good at the end, because I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is wonderful as The Monster Man. He looked very scary, had great makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers! The rest of the cast is doing very well. <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 out of 5
