Meatballs have been a staple in my family for over 26 years! We saw this movie when it came out and have seen it dozens of times since. Bill Murray is at his best and is very moving in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre-adolescent and befriends him, while leading his CIT into a mischievous project after another! The characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another teen sex festival, stupid, stupid. It's funny and sweet and fun all around. Anyone who sees this is going to have fun. It is to see absolutely. Watch out for Spaz - he is by far the best character! (Especially during the social camp - while Bill Murray takes care of the camera - watch Spaz behind him dance with the poor girl he's dancing with!) By far, one of my favorite comedies of all time!
