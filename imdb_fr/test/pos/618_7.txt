The first half of the movie really scared me and normally, I'm not easy to scare, but the second half of this thriller did not work very well, but still very scary! A good thriller, that use simple means to make a good horror. Lowbudget, located in Russia, unknown distribution and manufactured in Europe. but still very fun, and yes there are some laughter for good things too!
