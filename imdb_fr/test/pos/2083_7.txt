At the age of 30, when he dies of a brain tumor, Zachary Scott makes 70 films. It was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulesco's "The Mask of Dimitrios", where he played Dimitrios. The following year, in 1945, he made three films, including this one. The filmmakers remember him as the star of Jean Renoir's film "The Southerner", one of the 1945 films in which he played a sympathetic role. However, he has often played terrifying characters, and in this film he kills women as a sociopath for money. So what's going on here? He lives in a house with three women, so beware! Faye Emerson, who also played in 'Dimitrios', plays the eldest of two girls in the house. She falls in love with Scott and they become secretly engaged. Then her "cute little girl" sister (played effectively by Mona Freeman, who looks like Bonita Granville both in appearance and behavior) comes home from school and casually reveals with Scott that she has inherited a a small sum. on her instead, with all the hot jealousies bubbling up in the household and that it had to wake up. Things tend to stretch, then stretch out. Meanwhile, murder plans are moving forward in Scott's mind. But it turns out he is not the only one to have such intentions. He is also wanted after his latest murder, with which the film was opened, so that we know his story. James Wong Howe effectively combines this film with the black film, directed by French Robert Florey, who arrived in Hollywood some time ago. The film is an effective psychopathic mystery at home that can cause slight wear on the edges of some seats, for those of such inclination.
