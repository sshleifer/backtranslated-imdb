The third film of the Polish brothers is their best film, the most beautiful and the most imaginative to date. Although many audiences have a problem with Northfork's lack of traditional dramatic structure, "Stick to it, Jack!" The plot is hard to summarize, so just know that the story includes: agents trying to evacuate a city, God wearing a cowboy hat, selling angel wings and a sick orphan (but everything works fine) The extraordinary photography of Mr. David Mullen makes almost every image fascinating and wonderful to watch. The performances of the actors, who work with the inspiring and offbeat scenario of the Polish Brothers, are perfect and give the film its emotional impact. The mythology and folkloric tale of the story, the comic and moving actors, and finally the incredible courage and incredible sense of Michael Polish's command behind the camera, will touch the viewer. Again, all these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements combine wonderfully in one of the most incredible things to live and live. A super, super, super movie !!!
