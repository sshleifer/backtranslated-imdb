I really hate musicals because music numbers are just starting with sudden and often spoiled scenes, but this one is completely different - it's just brilliant. The plot may not be a challenge for viewers, but the simplicity of people's lives makes this movie great. <br /> <br /> I've seen it at least a dozen times and I'm still not tired. , characters or music (I love the soundtrack - it's the only soundtrack I really wanted and will probably be the only one I should). <br /> <br /> For me, it's a must - seen kind of movie, great characters compiled with fun songs and lots of things to think about after the movie ends.
