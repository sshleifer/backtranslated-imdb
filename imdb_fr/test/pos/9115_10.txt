If you are like me and you bought the new album Tenacious D the day of its release and you entered the film knowing all the lyrics of all the songs, you will enjoy this film. Yes, I am biased as a big fan of Tenacious D, but I really liked this movie that made me laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> This film was pretty much everything I expected. A comic genius supported by an excellent composition and superb cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I particularly enjoyed the role of Tim Robbins. <br /> <br /> If, however, you are not familiar with the HBO series and Tenacious D's first fantasy album, it may not have the same comic impact. I would still recommend going to see this because it is always worth every penny of the price of entry and will make you smile even if you do not stay in the mesh all the time.
