It's the best period of comedy. It's so underrated! Intelligent spiritual humor, big casting! Jerry Stiller is the gem of the show, he's incredibly funny and offbeat, just a comedic genius! Doug and Carrie have excellent chemistry! Everybody loves Raymond, he is SO MUCH over lame jokes of forced humor and especially no spiritual show, I do not remember laughing in more than one episode. King of Queens is a rare comedy that contains all the ingredients necessary to make you laugh, which is normally caused by Arthur Spooner. I think it's time for this comedy to get the hype it deserves and not the lame Raymond & CO.
