French cinema has always been very good when it comes to presenting historical subjects. 95% of the time, they never make mistakes. This film is one of the best of its kind, due to the strong interpretation of Depardieu and Pszoniak. Wajda's work as a director is truly a marvel. Everyone should see this great movie.
