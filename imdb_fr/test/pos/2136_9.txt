I only saw this film once a quarter of a century ago, but its impact has never left me and I still remember my reactions to this film. I was fascinated by the scale and beauty of so much of photography. I was amazed that an American studio could produce such a European film with its slow pace and unfocused plot. The absence of strong characters gave me the impression of being a defect, but I unleashed against the completely useless end on the yacht, which seemed to have been welded to give a kind of cohesion to the plot and which was in total contradiction with the style of the rest of the boat. It was also refreshing to see a western that does not claim the brutality and exploitation that were so often the unfortunate detritus of the American dream. Western scenes and sets also had an authenticity that was totally new to me and that foreshadowed the film. The film was massively cut for the American public and it's really my wish that during these days of Director's Cuts, Michael Cimino is offered the possibility of a new editing in the light of reflection - a cut that could transform this wrong film destined to become the masterpiece that he had the potential to become. I have now seen the original first cut and the network of relationships is much more logical, although Christopher Walken is primarily responsible for its execution. If only De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson had played the lead role! There was always a huge concern to create reality and atmosphere at the expense of a good script. Nevertheless, the work of the camera was so cleverly managed that you could sometimes believe that you were yourself in action. And there have been many special moments. All those who argued in the hall in different languages ​​and tried to overcome their national differences and seek unity of action in the face of the impending disaster gave a glimpse of the difficulties facing United States welding: especially when the threat came from the old elite and money. Nate's hesitant approach to Ella during her first visit to her cabin contrasted with the violence that would follow and was another. I had a special screening with a large group of friends to see the new cup and we all enjoyed this experience, while having varying reserves. This revisionist and much closer to the version of the truth was probably too much for Americans when the film was first released, but we all felt he had tremendous merit and that his place in film history also deserved a major revision.
