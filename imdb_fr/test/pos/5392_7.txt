Gary Cooper and a Marshal change their identity, as they agree that Cooper would be more effective in dealing with outlaws. What is remarkable in this film is the costumes, those of marshal and Steve Cochran who is the villain. Cochran carries his arms upside down, probably to cross. The film begins with enthusiasm with a clash with Wild Bill Hickok. Ruth Roman, very pretty is the fiancee of the marshal. There is a lot of action, never a moment of boredom, but you have to concentrate, because the story is a bit complicated. Good entertainment.
