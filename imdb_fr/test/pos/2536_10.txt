It's a difficult film to watch, and it would have been even more difficult if I had known that the actor playing the protagonist had actually been killed at his home by the police at age 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a child of the streets of Sao Paulo who is caught in a raid by a murder in which he has no involvement. He is incarcerated in a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens find it hard to believe does not exist. When he finally escapes, he and three comrades survive by the only way they know, namely crime. What makes the film so heartbreaking is that Pixote and the actor who represents him clearly do not want to be the characters that the circumstances of life have created. Pixote tries to trust, love and bond, but there is simply no room in his world for the sweet side of human nature. In the end, it only remains to want to do something for the Pixots of the world, but what? Building more juvenile prisons with higher walls is definitely not the answer ...
