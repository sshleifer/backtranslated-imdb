Very good guys, here's the problem with this movie. it's not the best, but for all of you, the children of the 80s, it will bring back good memories of your childhood. Personally, I love this movie. I still love Rainbow Brite and the care. so, in my opinion, if you are not a child now or if you were a kid who loves and / or loves Rainbow Brite, you will not like this movie at all.
