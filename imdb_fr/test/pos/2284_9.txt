I am an Australian currently living in Japan. I saw this film on television here and I was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in representing Western and Japanese ideologies. Anyone who wrote the screenplay and directed this film must have a good knowledge of the lives of foreigners in Japan. The only part I thought was too Hollywood was when Tom Selleck's character kissed the woman in the middle of her office and she allowed it. Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally a film that highlights the true experience of "gaijin"! 9/10
