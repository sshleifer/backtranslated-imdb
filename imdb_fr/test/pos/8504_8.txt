The famous French detective Henri Cassin takes his first vacation in eleven years at St. Margot, where he meets Nanette, the daughter of the owners of the holiday resort. Despite Nanette's promise for her childhood, Léon, Henri and Nanette fall in love and decide to marry, despite Nanette's father who opposes it because of his age. On the day of their wedding, Leon returns and Nanette pursues him. We do not hear of the two men until they are both found dead and Henry swears he will not rest until he can find the murderer. The only clue Henry needs to work with is a fingerprint found by Leon, but he also receives written warnings that others will die soon. Soon, Nanette's mother is found dead and Henri has no idea of ​​the identity of the murderer. Believing himself a failure, he returns to Paris, then realizes (and fears) that the murderer can only be one person, even if none of his colleagues can believe his explanations. Mystery of unusual murder that does not really match the formula proposed by Columbia or other studios B. The credit certainly goes to director Lewis, who manages to turn this film into a film noir despite the setting of the film, which benefits also a good job of the camera and the light. Geray probably achieves a very good performance with his only main role and the rest of the cast is able to achieve his performance. Note, 8.
