Let me first say that I am a big fan of the original Lonesome Dove series and the book on which it is based. I pushed back this sequel for almost 10 years because of the bad reviews I had heard about. If Tommy Lee Jones did not play at Capt. Call, I did not understand why. If Larry McMurtry was not involved, why should I care? As I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is in many ways a worthy follow-up to Lonesome Dove, perhaps even more than the dark mood of Streets Of Laredo. History, acting, production, cinematography are all first-rate. Of course, the script is not as colorful as Lonesome Dove, but it has its moments. And, to my great surprise, there are Lonesome Done pieces in this series; the relationship between July and Clara, completely discarded in the previous one, is evoked here almost identical to the book, a welcome surprise. The story is not only pink, it also has surprises. By far the biggest surprise is Jon Voight's performance of Capt Vo Call. Although it's not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones, his is both loyal and unique to Voight's credit. The cast is fantastic in all areas, and I do not think Rick Schroeder has done a better acting job than in this series. Oliver Reed almost steals the show here, he is superb in a role that makes you love his character as much as you hate him. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching if you do not know it. Bad reviews, especially since the DVD is so affordable (I had the game of 2 discs for $ 10.99, you can probably find it cheaper). This is in no way the disappointment that Dead Man's Walk has succeeded (well, it was for me). And MCMurtry was involved in that one!
