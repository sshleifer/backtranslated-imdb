Gen-Y Cops ... since I heard about the release of the movie, I wanted to see it because I loved the Gen-X Cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse did not come back and B) too much burlesque. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the following, because it may not be good as a first film, but it is good in its own way. <br /> <br /> Stephen Fung is back in the role of the ultracool lady Match, who has a solid Oli girl (NOTE: Where is Haze?) and Sam Lee returns to alienated Alien (this time wearing a mohawk and speaking a lot english !!!!). The new star of the movie is newcomer Edison Chen. He replaces Nicholas Tse very well as ... Edison. I also enjoyed the performance of Paul Rudd's agent Curtis ... he seems to be a tough guy, a smart FBI agent you'd like to hate ... but you'll soon love his character. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are much better in this one ... although there are very few of them, but they are excellent, courtesy of Jackie Chan's stuntman, Nicky Li. <br /> > <br /> Look for a cameo from Ron Smoorenburg as a caged fighter who has a tiny little fight with Match. Smoorenburg is also doubled for Rudd. <br /> <br /> If you liked GEN-X COPS ... you'll love GEN-Y COPS !!!
