When people insist that they "do not make them look like they used to be," simply point them to the incredibly funny and quaint comedy horror of author-director Glenn McQuaid. <br /> <br /> It's a story of graverobbers (interpreted by Dominic Monaghan and Larry Fessenden) who discover more than mere still and silent corpses. After the initial shock, they quickly realize that they can really benefit from the situation. And that's just what they are trying to do. Notice, it looks like things may not have gone as planned. The young Arthur (Monaghan) tells his story to a priest (Ron Perlman) before being taken to the gallows. <br /> <br /> Looking at the details of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have taken most of his first short film and extended it to this feature film, which is not a bad thing. Fessenden is coming back and doing well. Monaghan is one of those guys who can still make you love, while he's dealing with the nasty case of stealing dead and other favorite genres such as Perlman and Angus Scrimm on the stage of this movie is a lot of fun for genre fans. <br /> <br /> It also has a unique and supportive design and look, sometimes switching from EC Comic style panels to real action (at the Creepshow) and always feeling authentic enough in his feeling of Hammer Horror. Maybe everything is covered with such a quantity of dry ice, but that does not go without saying. No matter what has been done to capture everything on a movie, it works. That works well. <br /> <br /> There may be no panic, but this film has a good deal of dark humor and definitely permeates every minute of its execution in a macabre matter that should please everyone who has patience for a little more sober horror and that really feels like it could have been done in Hammer's time. <br /> <br /> See if you like: Flesh and Demons, Doctor and Demons, Horror Show.
