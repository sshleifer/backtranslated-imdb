I just finished the first part of Zombie Bloodbath on the incredible DVD of the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy of CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead is the following. Now, this one left me a little puzzled because of some holes in the plot and some puzzling twists here and there, but it's a better multi-level movie. Director Todd Sheets really shows a major breakthrough in style and talent between the two films. Again, this is not for people who want glossy horror movies and Hollywood style, it's for those who love their zombies bloody, raw and grainy. From what I could tell, the story was about two thieves who, in 1945, were trying to rob an elderly couple to find out they belonged to a cult. One guy is simply killed and the other, the boss, is turned into a scarecrow and crucified. They hold him in the next field, still alive but dying. Even today, a van filled with college kids collapses near a farm. At the same time, a group of convicts escape from a nearby prison. Both groups end up in the same house. The house was the one in which the elderly lived and when one of the condemned turns over the scarecrow and takes his jacket, the scarecrow wakes up and he in turn brings back the members of the sect from the dead. Sensational. And all this in the first half hour. Another plot is also taking place in the city, where two types of serial killers took workers hostage in a deli. In reality, it works because the people trapped in the house eventually escape and end up in the same store. Most twists work well, but obviously the movie was too complex in some places to be useful. It all ends with a showdown with the remaining heroes looking for a delivery truck or something full of flasks of flesh-eating bacteria. Of course, they throw it on the undead and cause a large melting and a few heads to explode, then we get a strange end, causing thought. First of all, let me say that although it was not always easy to follow, I still had a great time with this movie. It was fun and the acting was devilishly good for a low budget endeavor. It was obvious that Todd Sheets was really trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie movie, and in that respect he succeeded. There were better special effects than the first film, a good rhythm and nice music and visuals. In addition, there is a real stop for a shot from inside a mouth when a knife is stuck. The care was taken here and it shows. The weakness lies in the scripts and in some of the more lazy performances. Again, I recommend you listen to the commentary track. It was even better than the first and I learned a lot. It's like discovering that some of the scenes were shot on Super 8 to get an effect and that the movie came back to ruin from the lab and they could use it. And they were already editing the movie by the time they got it back. The confusion comes from the fact that some scenes are not in the film. Plus, I learned that Todd Sheets really had the passion and love to make horror movies. This shows. The film is a good example of a budget-free movie that could have used an extra rewrite, but still shines with more style than most of the DV movies I see. Not as much fun as the first movie, although a better film technically. I really admire Sheets as one of the true innovators and pioneers in the field of DV cinema ... and this one is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!
