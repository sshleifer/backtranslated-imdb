First, do not be fooled by my last name. My mother was Italian, so I know Italian families very well, and I LOVE gangster movies, even the funniest ones like this one. <br /> <br /> For those who have badly touched this movie (you know who you are) you should have your movie privileges of you because you do not know what is good. It's a damn funny and stylish movie. The fact that almost no one is Italian is part of the joke, as far as I know. And what heterosexual man with red blood could complain about spending an hour with Michelle Pfieffer? Puh-lease! When I saw this movie, I was seduced by the opening song of Rosemary Clooney, who was as Irish as possible, but her pronunciation of the Italian words in "Mambo Italiano" is flawless and sets the tone for that who will follow. (Hell, I even bought the record the next day because of that.) Just the look of every screaming thing in the apartment that I personally saw in my parents' homes, although not in the same place (that I found hysterical) sold it for me. <br /> <br /> This film is like Goodfellas laughing. I'm just wondering why there is no Burger Worlds and what became of the foods that these guys were supposed to have? In my opinion, the crew ate it. "The fries are crispy, the shakes are creamy." I water almost as much as I think of the magnificent Mrs. Pfieffer. (And anyway, I've never trusted clowns.) And the three best things about this movie are Mercedes Ruehl's dreadful comic wife, Dean Stockwell, her husband, Tony "The Tiger", and last but not least, Oliver's grand offense. Platt who should have more comic roles. And notice to myself: know where went this black girl. Ouch! Why does she work so infrequently? This image is right next to the big crowd movies, as it should be.
