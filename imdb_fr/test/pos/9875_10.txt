Wow, "The curse of Michael Myers", what a great movie. Suspenseful, entertaining, creative and a smart plot that I like. Many hate the concept "Thorn", I love it. I think this gives a plot to the Halloween series. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and performs an excellent performance, especially for her first film. Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are also excellent. My only complaint is why was not Danielle Harris in this movie as Jamie? She wanted to come back, but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. Still, I love Halloween: The curse of Michael Myers. I think The Shape's mask looks the best in this movie and George P. Wilbur is Michael Myers best. Incredibly scary and suspenseful, Halloween 6 rules! <br /> <br /> I love this film very violent, but extremely pleasant. The Halloween horror series - by far the best of its kind. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
