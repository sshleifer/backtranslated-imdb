I found this film filled with irony. But by watching the movie, you can almost see what will happen. Leila is a confused and bored housewife in constant search for happiness. When she thinks to find true happiness, she clings to it, leaving behind everything she knew. But she is almost comparing notes between her ex and her current husband. She learned that if she had simply communicated more about what had bothered her during her previous marriage, it could have been saved much easier than expected. She realizes that words are nothing without action, but she learns it too far in her second marriage and finds herself looking back and hoping for change once again. The main conflict in this movie is Leila vs herself. You can not have true happiness without being really happy. I liked this movie, but I would only recommend this movie to women, I can not see a man really enjoying this movie.
