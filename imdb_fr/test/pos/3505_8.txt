Ali G Indahouse must be one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and the portrait of a British gangsta by Cohen is hilarious. This movie has a cult classic written on it, and it has some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a festive film that will make the audience laugh from beginning to end. Vote really Ali G and keep it real.
