Looking at "Plots with a View" (called "Undertaking Betty" in the United States), I had the feeling that we needed to film more movies in Wales. He represents a woman (Brenda Blethyn) in a small Welsh town trying to get away from her deceitful husband. So she and the director of the funeral home (Alfred Molina) make a plan ... but there are probably some problems along the way. <br /> <br /> I would even say that the character of Christopher Walken is the cleanest in the film (how could it not be?). But overall, the idea is a very neat idea, stacked with moments of "uh oh" ... especially the scene of the haunted house. This is the kind of movie I would like to enter, just to experience it. <br /> <br /> Also with Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles.
