It's a movie so much fun and fun. Very entertaining at all angles. It presents a strange range of memorable nuts, psychotic but adorable. We have; the judge, the buck, the kid, the scary old lady, the bitch, the clown. And unfortunately, they all live in a big house that has no lock and is understaffed. So, to our delight, we see them running, playing games and being dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way ... never give an ax to your patient! <br /> <br /> It was before the nest Cukkos, AND surpasses it. At least on the level of pleasure. He even has his sweet moments. "Love is pure, love is grace, love is strength, you love me, your love is pure, you still love me." Now who could resist that? Nuts are humans too. Just some loose threads. Be careful, otherwise you will have an ax in the back! The children play. Eh eh. <br /> <br /> The phone repairer was really funny and his reactions to and to the bitch boss were really sincere. All the characters in this movie are extremely well played. And I really found them funny. No, hilarious! They can even give you dirty thoughts about how you can take advantage of it. Or how they can enjoy you. <br /> <br /> It's actually a very smart movie. There is a brilliant end of twisting. I must say that I expected it to be good, but I never expected that it's horrible. "The court has made its decision, you are no longer in control!" I like that. The end is so, so perfect ... you will shed a tear. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy after seeing a movie like this. I will never forget it now. It's not just a cult ... it's a CLASSIC cult. Whatever you do ... do not look in the basement !!!
