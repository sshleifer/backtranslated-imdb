My wife wanted to see this movie and I followed it reluctantly. I have never been a big fan of biopic - believing that cinema is more exciting when it is not structured in non-fiction. Beyond that, although I like Ray Charles's music, I do not consider myself a fan of him or his music. <br /> <br /> I was expecting to suffer or to go through this movie. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a captivating story told in a classic cinematic style. Realism is in the nuances - the tilt of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes as they sing. I literally discovered myself involved in this film during its visualization. <br /> <br /> Jaime Foxx, who has been talked about a lot, is at the head of a cast of immaculate re-creators dating not at the time, but also of the, a life that has never existed for those under forty. This film immerses the audience in time without the gadgets and grandiose panoramas of the Titanic or other period pieces of this ilk. This film does not present the music scene of the 50s and 60s, it takes you there. <br /> <br /> It's a film about Ray Charles, but your appreciation should not be limited to the story of his life. It's the kind of movie, like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, that does what a movie should do: take you to another place, another time.
