"Checking Out" is a very spiritual and honest representation of a strange family that happens to be Jewish. Judaism plays virtually no role in the film, but the culture and behavior of American Jews are completely transmitted ... lovingly. I hope the film deals with the religious perspective on the topics it explores, because I think it would have been interesting. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan of Columbo, so I did not know Peter Falk - it's a lot of fun to watch. It is a pleasure to see Judges Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer again. Why do not they work more? They are all hilarious. The script is great with lots of memorable monolines that I will not fail to use with my own family. Watch Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing!) As porter.
