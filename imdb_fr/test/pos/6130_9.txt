"Pink Flamingos" is a cult classic. The plot of this film revolves around the challenge of the supremacy of Divine as the dirtiest person. "Pink Flamingos" contains scenes repugnantly disgusting like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where Divine eats Yes, the film is both shocking and amusing, but the biggest laughter comes from the replicas of actors. especially this replica of Divine: "Kill everyone now! Conduct to first degree murder! Defend cannibalism! Eat s ***! Dirt is my policy! Dirt is my life!" Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Its slogan "An exercise in bad taste" must be taken to heart and even those who are accustomed to the brutality of today's movies can find this jewel difficult to digest. Strongly recommended.
