The black film meets the anime ... great! It was one of the highlights of Animatrix's amazingly creative short films. It was one of my favorites, if it was not my favorite (I also loved World Record). It is essentially a reference to the crime novels and films of the 1940s classic black films, with the exception of the animated film and the film Matrix. But being animated, he is able to bring the extreme angles of the camera, the detective lifestyle, the shadows and all that is film noir to a whole new level. The femme fatale? Trinity. The detective in this story seems to live in the 40s in his mind but stuck in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents when a mysterious black woman enters his office. . . <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
