Great movie, a very good 7/10. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was at his best, the congressman who drank and saved Afghanistan from his communist oppressors! Based on a true story, it tells how the West throws money and weapons on a problem and expects it to disappear. Well, he's gone, albeit temporarily. Look who against us (the British, among others) are now fighting the same people to whom the United States gave arms, training and money in the 80s. <br /> <br /> people who look, but it portrays a very beautiful story. However, once the main objective is achieved, namely to rid the communists of Afghanistan, we realize how quickly the fate of people is forgotten. <br /> <br /> This film was good, it was well deserved 7/10. He told the story of the communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent US secret operation and was dramatized. Although this is a good movie, I will recommend it to other people, but some people will not particularly like it to be a serious movie about the good (US) v evil (Russia), this is not your taste!
