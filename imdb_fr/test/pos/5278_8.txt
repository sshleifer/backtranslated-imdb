Rendered in beautiful watercolor colors, Ponyo At The Cliff is truly a sight to behold, vaguely remembering the trailer, but I did not find it awesome, I was surprised at the beauty and the accuracy of its content. This film has just covered me with its purity. <br /> <br /> In the center is a young boy who comes into contact with a marine creature and his relationship that carries the film. Miyazaki masters both the creation of memorable images and the presentation of credible interactions between young people while keeping their quirks intact. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I did not like at all. It would be a euphemism to say that the music of a particular scene "resembled" "Ride Of The Valkyrians", it's a shame because a film as precious as this one can not afford to take liberties and harms a scene otherwise really great. The antagonist and his background have never interested me either, but I guess he has served more substance than anything else. <br /> <br /> Anyway, great movie. The scenario of the boat trip with all his images and his sea creatures stood out, he tells me. Pure and magical. And yes, the manual illustrations are more intimate than computer animation, I'm really excited for Princes And The Frog now.
