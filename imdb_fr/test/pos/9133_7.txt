After finally catching up on this "masterpiece", it seems to me that he must have looked terribly clever in his day. It's French, arty, sub-played to anguish, and finally morose. But seen for 37 years, it is also a bit empty, pretentious and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Others have summarized the story, but I do not think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw. At the heart of this film: the main characters, Corey and Vogel, really do not deserve what they have. They play the rules of the game in their code, never hurt those who do not ask for it and show great courage and initiative. Moreover, Corey in particular is a victim of his former "friend" of the gangland, who stole his daughter and repeatedly tries to have him murdered, apparently just because he ("Corey") dared to "borrow" some thousands of francs. These are guys who really should have a break! Instead, things are much worse for them than they really should, in the logic of history. <br /> <br /> One could argue that this is the whole problem: that the real bad guys never get caught; they plot with the police if need be, sell their friends and always win. But that's not shown either. Corey's old gangster friend is not accused of colluding with the police. Nor does he show his victory with jubilation. In fact, after having materialized several times when he needed it, he was not found at the end, leaving a dramatic tension (his quarrel with Corey) completely unresolved! <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I would say that this film is worth seeing for its beautiful photos, its slow and deliberate cadence, its great unrestrained performances, its elaborate flight sequence and its encapsulation of the style of art film of the late 1960s.
