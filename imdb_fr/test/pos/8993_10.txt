I wonder how someone could oppose this film. It is based on a real story. It's not necessarily about "Rugby" itself, so for anyone who posted on this site, they need to do a "real" rugby movie, you missed the point. This is not another typical sports film where a team is bad, they hire Emilio Estevez and overthrow the team to win the championship and give everyone heat and fuzz. He focuses on a story. This shows that someone can change their life for the better. Nowadays, movies only talk about sex, drugs, parties, etc. It's Hollywood. I'm a big fan of movies, but I have to say it was an inspiring movie with a good message. If you consider yourself a "tough guy", do not watch the movie, it will not live up to your expectations. If you want to watch a good, inspiring movie, it's a good movie.
