I think it's a fabulous movie ... I watched it constantly from the age of 4 when I was 8 years old ... However, watching it caused many nightmares. I particularly attracted them to the guy who always looked like "the other world" and his friends. I am 12 years old and still have nightmares to date. I can not fall asleep now because I think about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! However, I love this movie, I have great memories. Kate is very good at playing in this movie. Surprisingly, I never realized it was her! I also think that the graphics were of very high quality, contrary to what some people think.
