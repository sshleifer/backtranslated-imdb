Kate Gulden, performed by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century and one of the most talented actresses, Meryl Streep (Out of Africa). She is wonderful is every role she plays. The Yale graduate is the pride and joy of American cinema. <br /> <br /> Kate's health is deteriorating and her husband, George, has evolved into the role of the brilliant actor and also an Oscar winner, William Hurt (Smoke, Kiss of the Spider Woman) has a lot difficulties with the deterioration of the state of health of his only real thing, and asks for the help of his daughter. The poor girl, Ellen Gulden, Renee Zellweger (Jerry Maguire) has waited far too much for her. No breaks! The story takes a very realistic view of a parent's illness. In this film, the only girl has to put her life on hold to support the needs of others. There is always one in every family that faces this kind of responsibility. Ellen is angry at the beginning of the film, but over time she comes to understand his mother's dedication to his family. She even asks her mother: How do you do everyday without anyone noticing? That's what women do, a lot of what I call invisible work. In addition, we clean, we repair, we repair, we stretch, we celebrate, we are the best friends, we are confidants, the mistress, mediators, disciplinary, sensitive people. Some of us, like the two women in this film, have a perfect education, are the psychological pillar of the whole family and also do all this invisible work! Kate Ellen and many women in our society. Many of us have already gone through this phase of life when our parents have aged and died. I was there. They just went too young. I thanked my parents, but I never understood them as well as when I had to play their roles and I had to walk in their place. This film reflects the reality of life. It may be sad, but that's how life is, sometimes. George, a Harvard professor, is a complicated person who seems to think that his work is more important than anyone else and that he has a "master / servant" mentality that is very close to the women in his life. He is not strong enough to cope. If you want to see a good acting and the reality of life, do not miss this movie. Favorite scenes: The restaurant that arrives at Kate's, the violins and all. The manufacture of a broken porcelain table. That I am so symbolic! We are all broken ships! Favorite Quotes: George: "It's only by going up, that you realize you're really going downhill." George "You have an education at Harvard but where is your heart?" <br /> <br />
