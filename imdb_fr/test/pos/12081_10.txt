I saw this film when it was broadcast on television in February 1983. I was at the hospital and I had just given birth to my first and only child. I will refrain from telling you how moved I am. Suffice to say that the memory of the film stayed with me until today, almost 23 years later. I hope I can find a copy of this film, if ever such a thing had been done. This film should be remembered by everyone who has seen it before. However, I must admit that the fact that it remains a little obscure suits me perfectly. In this way, it will always be a little secret for me and for those who have also been touched. I have never seen Mrs. Margaret play a better role. I have never seen her in a more convincing role. I will always respect her for having accepted such a beautiful game.
