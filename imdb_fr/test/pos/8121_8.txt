After a long wait, "Bedrooms and Hallways" went to the Perth movie theaters - not a commercial, but I thought it was fun, honest and I took a look at these bands. "tribal scream" running around trying to find meaning in the rocks. and 'what is behind my eyes'. It's packed here because it tells a story, it has a fantastic actor act and it says something about the human condition.
