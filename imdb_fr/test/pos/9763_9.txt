This notice contains what could be a spoiler if you never read the book or see the cover of the video box. So, if you want to approach the film without knowing anything, except that I like it a lot, stop here ... <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are not first rate, but the game of actors is, and they give the romance between them more life than Shute in his novel (although I usually prefer the novel). My very weak objections to the film, unlike the book, is that the film portrays certain relationships with secondary characters and between the main characters in a scene near the end of the film, so as not to give realism . dramatic tension and as a general conspiracy device. All this is treated much better in the book, with the result that I find the end of the book a little more touching than the end of the film.
