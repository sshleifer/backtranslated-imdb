François Truffaut, Young Jerk of "Cahiers du cinéma", the main bastion of the so-called Nouvelle Vague, made a great demonstration of the hate of this film and even accused him of having dragged French cinema into mediocrity. Truffaut, who was finally sexually repressed, was jealous of how Carne could make a story that was so successful in silencing all the good buttons of his audience and getting him involved in something important with all the traps and the seduction of sensuality. In other words, when the general public and many critics saw a perceptual sociological analysis wrapped up in a beautiful film, Truffaut saw "Girls on the Loose". <br /> <br /> Carné, after all, had all that would be sorely lacking in the New Wave: intelligence, refinement, humor, a great talent for storytelling, a great ear for dialogue, a dazzling technical brilliance, the ability to force his actors to do what he wanted them to do, and a good dose of good taste. In comparison, Truffaut is a provincial nuisance that has nothing to say. <br /> <br /> The tragic remake of the 50s of "Pride and Prejudice", the French answer to "Rebel Without A Cause", an updated version of "Children of Paradise", "The Cheats" tells the story of the story of a disaffected Parisian youth who has lost their way in an atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and disrespect for traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics have perceived Carne's point of view on the subject as the moralizing point of view of an "older person", whereas I think what happened, quite the contrary, is that Carne being homosexual and knowing a thing or two about repression, felt sympathy for the iconoclastic youth in his story. Moreover, as this is a French film, there is no doubt that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, which still had to be decoded in American films such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One ". <br /> <The young people of Carné are all supreme, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. They are gods and goddesses. They drive the latest Vespa and good cars. The cut of their costumes, their dresses and their duffle-coat was a highlight of the fashion of the last century. Their haircuts are always stuck to the wall of your local hairdresser. Their body shape, which they have reached and maintained without effort, remains the modern western ideal. They listen to the best jazz musicians. They know how to move, be sexy and make love ?? even if the pill has not been invented yet. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are defined and live by the code of the band and their own heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and make a sin of romantic love. The only thing wrong with them is that their elders do not talk to them and vice versa. The incidents described in this film have long been the talk of the amorality and nihilism of youth in France, while making a huge public and critical success. <br /> <br /> This film is so elegant and stylish. I suppose that the older viewers who watched it would have liked to be like the people described in the film and that many young filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers like Truffaut have come up with a bad case of jaundice reflecting the fact that they could not never design a movie as sexy or as sexy. popular like this one, although they would be very good at finally targeting the nihilistic bits. On the other hand, given a certain cliché of the scenario (misunderstanding in love leading to a medical emergency), one can only marvel at the horribly pious and puritanical mishmash that the Americans would have extracted from the same basic scenario if they had dared to approach the subject. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film was shot in the same basic locations as the American musical "Funny Face" a year earlier. Where Hollywood has seen the picturesque aspects of the Left Bank and existentialism, Carné has restored its tragic and ironic dimension. Watch this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
