The first thing I wanted to do after watching this movie was to watch it again (because I missed a lot of laughs with all my laughs). I am European and I studied abroad and I almost lived with Spanish, French, Italian and German. The film was full of stereotypes, which, most of the time, jarred people, and by reading some of the other reviews, I see that he puzzled people. But this film is so stereotyped that I can not blame him. Except perhaps the way in which French has become a drunken partygoer. The English guy was the perfect stereotype of "geezer". Drunk, boring, insulting but shining at the end. In addition to stereotypes, the film also corrected the emotional aspect of studying abroad. At first, he is shy, knows no one, misses home, does not know how to go about it. As time goes on, it becomes his home and when the time comes, it is extremely difficult. A feeling that people can only understand if they have experienced it. I highly recommend this movie.
