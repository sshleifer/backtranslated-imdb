The films belonging to the genre "black film" generally contain similar elements: a plot "deus ex machina" which leads the main character in the bed, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, a lot of money, a lot of brutality and usually a denouement in the desert. Think "High Sierra" or "White Heat". <br /> <br /> There are a lot of bad hard black films. But when the film is good, you can not leave the tracks of the human life. <br /> <br /> This is the last tradition to which "Blind Spot" belongs. The film follows Danny Alton, a troubled teenager (superbly played with depth, grace, emotional integrity and pure plaintiveness of James Franco, who throws himself into this role) who fell in love with Darcy, the rough-edged streetkid. <Br/> <br /> From the beginning, you know that it will be bad. <br /> <br /> Darcy invites Danny home. But the house is empty and for sale, and a bloody check of several thousand dollars is on the floor. Danny gets robbed of his clothes and belongings, but uses the check to find suicidal April, Darcy's other lover. When they reach Darcy's real home, they find Wayne - a hooligan chasing Darcy for the money he stole. Together, they manage to locate Darcy in a dusty and dilapidated desert motel. But this is only the beginning of the story, as plastic explosives, drugs, rifles, a funeral, bisexual murderers and a solitary half-finished house in the desert cause an explosive head in an alley in front of a living room. tattoo in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> This film contains some of the best black cinematography I have known in years. In one scene, Danny walks through the desert to the halfway house of the desert where he thinks Darcy may have been taken away by criminals that evening. A very long shot with bright light effects shows Danny - arms and legs restless, palpable fear engraved on his face (visible even at this distance), a cloud of dust trailing behind him as the wind whipping in his direction - crossing the desert. towards the house. Danny's loneliness, desperation, despair are shocking. There are many scenes of this type in this film, beautifully designed by the experienced Maximo Munzi. This is an Oscar-winning material. <br /> <br /> The edition is just as amazing. The film contains small moments where the characters acquire a glimpse of themselves or their situation. A short time, where memory and feeling come back. At these times, quick montages of images scroll on the screen. This is a superb edition of director-writer-publisher Stephan Woloszczuk. In a first montage, Danny describes the wonderful feelings he feels now that Darcy has entered his life. Quick images of Danny's diary scroll on screen: the words "4 lives", "lucky" and "safe" stop momentarily, while page on page, the contents of a human heart scrolls on the screen - blurry, too fast to read. It's like the flow of emotions that Danny himself feels. <br /> <br /> The flow of images reveals something else about this film: The beauty of Nathaniel Waters' scenery is magnificent. Darcy's quonset-hut home is the perfect marriage between high-tech and slob (a tribute to Kimberly Foster). The beautiful scene of the desert house is downright scary. The motel in ruins where Darcy hides can be found in any small abandoned town in America. The frightening (and incredibly enlightened) funeral home where the intrigue takes a frightening twist mixes the sharpness with the veil of death that hovers over the entire film. (It's unfortunate that the director of the lighting of the film is not credited.) This film has a superb conception of the production, which highlights each image and the performance of each actor. <br /> <br /> This is the fourth element of this film that makes it catch you and hold on to you: the acting game. James Franco is a superb actor. Even in "Spider-Man" - where he was hardly given anything to do - Franco showed that he understood human emotion like no other actor of his generation. He is not a handsome boy who sneaks up like Brad Pitt. Franco portrays a deep emotion with force. His performances contain pure human heart. Consider the scene in the phone booth outside the funeral home, where Danny collapses after telling April and Wayne that Darcy is dead. The small actors could not take away the complete emotional collapse of a human being. Franco does it. <br /> <br /> Shawn Montgomery, in his first film, simply amazes you with his interpretation of suicidal April. Deeply in love with Darcy, suffering from a huge depression after having to bury his unborn child alone (after the fetus aborted spontaneously) in a perfume box in the woods, his life of luxury and perfection has become a disaster: April is one of the best characters drawn on the movie I have ever seen. While the relationship between Danny and Darcy is slowly revealed during the film, April's nervous breakdown is only revealed to the public. Neither Danny nor Wayne seem particularly interested in her as a human being. The desperation of April when she realizes that Danny is also Darcy's lover is poignant and powerful, even if he is truncated by the character's complete inability to feel any emotion for a very long time. Montgomery brings in April a pathos that puts your heart to the test. <br /> <br /> Mark Patrick Gleason is entrusted with the most difficult work of the film: To aim to create something human and real with the thug, Wayne. In the beginning, Wayne is simply one of the many violent, crazed and obsessed drug gangs / drug dealers who appear in many movies (from "Kindergarten Cop" to "Beverly Hills Cop 2"). Gleason is doing very well with what he has given him, but it does not really happen where you feel so much for Wayne. It's hard to say if it's Gleason or the material problem. There's a moment - where Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, though neither Danny nor April know it) reads Danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional connection between the two men - where you just know Wayne will become homophobic Danny's ass. But the explosion never comes. (Thank God, conspiracies are the death of the film noir.) Once the revelation about siblings has arrived at the end of the film, the audience is astonished enough to realize the breadth of love and compassion that Wayne really felt for Darcy - so deep that Wayne accepted. Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother. But all this is happening off screen. Gleason never has the opportunity to play Wayne's feelings. The story is rather inventive, although the contraband instrument seen at the end of the film probably recalls "Diamonds Are Forever" (yes, James Liaison). A traditional narrative voice over (which proves that Franco is both a vocal talent and a physical actor) creates a fantastic atmosphere, although it tends to sink in Schmaltz a few times towards the end of the film. Terrible places play a key visual role in the film. Congratulations to the local scout for finding such amazing buildings! The end of the film seemed a bit hasty; not too much, but a little too firm for my film noir tastes. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen the public hate or love "Blind Spot". Modern viewers, exposed to the most extreme brutality and violence, often struggle to understand the subtleties of film noir. My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who do not see ridicule, emotional hopelessness, hopelessness or depression. Take them to a small theater where they can boast about the spectacle of the film's vision, but where their viewing will not be spoiled by a crowd of people who will not recognize a good movie noir. Give them some popcorn (trust me, they will be so absorbed that they will not finish it), get them a soda and let them be submerged. Then go to a bright and happy place, to wash the dirt and sadness of your soul. Because this movie is so good to make you feel, you will need this restaurateur.
