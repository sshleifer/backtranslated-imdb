If you are tired of the same repetitive and unintelligent material as that published by the traditional film industry, you will enjoy "You Are Alone". It's provocative, well shot and captivating. <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything you will not discover in the very first minutes of the film, this is the story of a young high school white middle-class upper middle class woman who works as an escort and is discovered by his neighbour. The vast majority of the film is spent in a hotel room where he hired her. <br /> <br /> During their discussion, you explore two changing points of view about prostitution, depression and loneliness. Still, the movie is not depressing. He speaks of black things without being depressing. <br /> <br /> As a spectator, your emotions and preconceptions are moved, but gently. You come out with a lot of things to think about. I like it in a movie.
