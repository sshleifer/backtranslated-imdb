Although the film has its flaws, it highlights some of the problems of living in a country without democracy. It gives you empathy for the people led by such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives, their struggles and the presence of a potential leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. One may wonder why our government will intervene in places where we are unwilling but who do not know who is asking for help.
