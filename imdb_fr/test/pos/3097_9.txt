"Fata Morgana" by the famous director Werner Herzog is breathtaking and unorthodox. Although characters appear from time to time in the movie, there is no real story. The film is not an educational or historical documentary either. It is a film without accompanying scenario. <br /> <br /> The film consists of a curious background music and a somewhat illogical narrative VO, whose combination covers a long series of images of the Sahara desert, mainly, but not exclusively. . Some images are wonderfully strange and out of the ordinary. The camera captures ghost images, or mirages, optical illusions that fascinate and hypnotize. <br /> <br /> This general cinematographic trend is punctuated by occasional occurrences of observation on fortuitous subjects. For example, in a sequence, a man wearing goggles gives us a mini-tutorial on lizards. And in what was for me the most captivating and bizarre sequence, a small room contains a man with dark glasses who sings in a voice totally distorted by the microphone he uses, accompanied by an old lady who plays a percussive melody on an old piano. Neither the man nor the old woman seem to appreciate what they do. How baroque. <br /> <br /> "Fata Morgana" has an underlying concept, a concept that unites the wide range of strange images and eclectic sounds. But this concept is so subtle, so opaque that you will never discover it without help. From this subtle theme, the film makes sense Without this point of reference, however, the film may seem tedious and endless, a useless parry of random terrestrial images and esoteric mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> Flawless redundant, thematically confusing and kinematically heretical, "Fata Morgana" will probably make you pale with joy, or make you vomit. You can either capture the Zen qualities of the film, or be tempted to break the DVD into a thousand pieces. One thing most viewers will agree on: "Fata Morgana" is ... different.
