Well, this movie was certainly in sync with the current weather. No happy ending, superheroes or miracles here. Just realistic fiction to stimulate our minds about terrorism and what it is. Congratulations to Percival and Mickery for a great script and a great direction from Percival. Movies like this are necessary to keep us informed of what's going on. If all peace-loving men and women on the Earth have reported suspiciously suspicious activities, I am convinced that terrorism will not prosper. This film showed how difficult it is to subvert these terrorists, even with good information. Even if the film is a little propagandist against Islam (the use of a Muslim police officer as the main character), I think it was quite realistic. The bombing was shocking. As a very smart tool to relay the humility and indignity of the people involved in such an attack, they showed all the nakedness of women decontaminated after the attack. It did not take me long to realize that this was supposed to make the viewer even more likely to think, that is, we did not control everything in a situation like this. Although this was done in London, with the usual high-level British acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world. Great movies do not have to be epic productions to success, and this film is really worth watching.
