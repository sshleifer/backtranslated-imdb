Although someone who likes to travel at 120 km / h on the highway, eat McDonalds and run the air conditioner twenty-four hours a day, and watch Fox News without interruption, I found this documentary interesting. One thing I remember, when they talk about North America, I guess this documentary is Made In Canada. I'm going to let Bill O'Reilly go after Canadian criticism. <br /> <br /> The consequences of the depletion of oil reserves will affect everyone, especially the people of the great countries of Australia, Canada and the United States. I'm sure Green Peace no longer encourages gas, means more SUVs, without realizing that people living in sub-zero temperatures could starve. <br /> <br /> As a student studying economics, I know for a fact that we live in a world of limited resources. I will give the documentary props to try to present a balanced point of view on the depletion of oil. However, I am studying a degree in journalism, this documentary is full of loaded messages - Republicans as warmongers. What did the Democrats not send troops to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> If you plan to present a documentary on economics and resources, it is best to leave out political criticism, as this could result in the total closure of a potential audience member. Focus on the issue of finite resources. At the end of the day, it is best to open the mind of the general public, because it is not good to preach to the tiny choir. <br /> <br /> I really like watching documentaries such as Fahrenheit 911 and End of Suburbia, not for their political bias, because they remind us that the world is not so safe. Of course, I like to shop and junk food consumers as if there is no tomorrow, but if the world ends tomorrow, I would prefer to die of wealth and consume the live beep. <br /> <br /> For potential documentary filmmakers, simply give facts to people and let viewers make their own opinion. If you try to present your political views as a balanced documentary, people will smell a rat a mile away.
