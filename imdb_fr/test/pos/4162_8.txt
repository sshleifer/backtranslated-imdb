Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with one of those movies that stuck in your head for years. It was Respiro (see comments and summary here in IMDb). <br /> <br /> Now, carrying the beautiful young talents he had for the first time on screen, he takes the audience into an obscure void. A literal dive in dangerous waters. The subject is migration. In this case, from Italy to the New World (the name of the film). A big deal calling him for his American release "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest - that is, their life, for a dream. <br /> <br /> I hate spoiling the series by telling the story, so I'm going to dwell a little on the work that Crialese and his team did brilliantly. <br /> <br /> First, choose to stick to what he knows: his live as much as possible. It means the whole movie. The textures, the pain, the nuances of reality are always mingled with smells, heat or cold, sweat and blood, life and death, as alive as in real life. <br /> <br /> Creaks of bent metal and crushed wood, the infamous wind drone and the ominous sounds of big engines and boat horns are some of the things that make this film so compelling. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present from the first shot (again, almost the first shot of Respiro) and permeates throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible feeling of despair. The dark tones and the very gray and sinister representations of people who suffer from the narrow and dirty boat in which they sail hope to fascinate. <br /> <br /> Light is little used, almost to discover each character in the dark. The beauty of each shot and each scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical characteristics of the actors. <br /> <br /> Once again, as usual, Vincenzo Amato is really alone. He plays the father of two sons (the same actors aged fifteen and twelve and now aged nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gainsbourg is so-so. I guess she never achieved the perfection she achieved in The Cement Garden and in her very first film, The Shrewd. <br /> <br /> It may just be that she seems a little embarrassing in her role. <br /> <br /> The places and the sets are hard and convincing, almost playing a character on their own. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most remarkable character is he played by Filippo Pucillo, the young dumb son. The contrast here with his first role is complete. Then he played a supercharged kid who was as implacable as anything around him. Now, his character is all expression. And just that: no words at all. His eyes tell the whole story with sublime power. <br /> <br /> It may be one of those films that will not be very well received in the United States. It's absolutely Italian in everything. It's so Italian that most of the time, language is one of many dialects much older than Italian itself. In the United States, this film may be a bit too expensive for Americans because of the subject. But anyone who remembers the story of their families upon their arrival in the United States will see these films with dread. <br /> <br /> And, again, the minimalism that goes along with the ideas of Crialese is back with a stage fence in the water. Only this time, he goes from underwater photography to aerial photography. <br /> <br /> All in all, another great and very well told story of this filmmaker who has collected 6 awards and was nominated for the Golden Lion Award. Not a small act!
