Evil Ed is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (of course) and his collapse into total madness after he made a series of horror B movies known as "The Loose Limbs". Ed gets so angry that he thinks he's seeing demons and monsters, but he's actually people he knows and people close to him, like his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in 1998 and was confused by what I had seen. To this day, I consider this film to be one of the darkest comedies ever. As the film is almost awesome with its gore scenes, there are still some scary moments. <br /> <br /> It's a cool movie, but do not expect something wonderful. It's just a fun movie that's good to show some of your friends for a few laughs. 8/10 stars
