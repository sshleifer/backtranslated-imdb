It is rare that a film takes you into his universe and leaves you wanting more once the credits reached. Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo is such a movie. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a young goldfish named Ponyo who wants to become human. She is swimming towards the shore and is found by a young boy named Sasuke who promises to take care of her. The father of Ponyo Racing, a green-eyed wizard named Fujimoto, tries to prevent Ponyo from becoming human in order to maintain the balance of nature, which is finally overthrown when Ponyo finally turns into a little girl, causing a massive typhoon. <br /> <Ponyo is a very rich movie. He is full of wonderful fantasy, adorable characters and sincere heart. What director Hayao Miyazaki has done here is telling a little story while creating an authentic movie magic. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is an enchanting experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. In the same way, the ecologist within Miyazaki is still as obvious in this film as in all his previous works. Miyazaki shows the dirt and grime that falls into the ocean in an almost startling day, not to mention that Ponyo's father has an obsolete mission to clean the world's oceans. Although the story is simple, Miyazaki manages to add this extra layer to provoke thought with the skill of an expert. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful work of art, each hand-drawn cell looks like a wonderful pastel painting. The film looks very different from many other Studio Ghibli productions, but the artistic talent is still spectacular. The underwater scenes are simply beautiful to watch, Fujimoto's underwater fortress is very inventive and the sequence where Ponyo crosses the fish jumping into the typhoon to reach Sosuke is iconic. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's thanks to his wonderfully executed characters make this movie a memorable experience. Sosuke is a boy who acts older than him and the energetic Ponyo is funny for a minute. Each character is so nice and memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ponyo is a wonderful experience, enchanting in every way. Although the film may be sold as a children's fairy tale, I think that many adults will be swept into its fantasy world with their children. Although the film may lack the density of some of Miyazaki's previous works, he keeps it here pure and simple, staying true to himself, delivering a film that is both funny, comforting and entertaining. It's a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I give Ponyo a perfect 10 out of 10!
