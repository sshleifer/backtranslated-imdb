Incredibly stupid anime, only six episodes in the long run, on an unfortunate delivery man called Kintaro (well, he's called a delivery guy, though he's supposed to be in his twenties), and the adventures he's had during his travels. Each episode sees him arrive in a new city, acquire a new job, develop a kind of love interest before the end of the episode. <br /> <br /> Gently sexist, juvenile, very immature sometimes, it's a kind of anime that just puts a smile on the face. <br /> <br /> This is not a good start if you're not a fan of anime, because it certainly will not convince you, but are already converted, it's a down entertaining.
