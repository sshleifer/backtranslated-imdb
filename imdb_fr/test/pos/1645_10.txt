A diverse team between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot and the guy who plays Bana on Seinfeld, go to a research station in the Arctic where all the members died while sitting down or sinking. They discover that there is a worm - a virus - that parasitizes to madness and death. The problem is that after a certain dog has been unleashed, everyone could be infected, but who? This is not only my favorite episode of Season 1, but also one of my favorites of the series. The arctic environment contains the characters and, of course, like Carpenter the Thing, it is very amusing to watch these equally temperament characters suddenly start appearing in dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are tacky, it did not bother them at all. The drama between the characters ends up working more than usual because of the tension and the fact that all the actors (including the guy from Bana) understand what is happening in the story. And, as usual, I loved the ambiguity of the end. Highly recommended.
