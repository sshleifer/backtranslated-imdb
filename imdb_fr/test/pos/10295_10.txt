I watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before ... <br /> <br /> There are more than a dozen superb and modern French films, going from winter to three trilogy colors and all are special. This film is one of them. A true delight with so many beautiful things ranging from the homage to Hitchcock to the two beautiful ladies of Romane and Monica. While Monica is very beautiful, Romane is a very sexy woman and steals a lot of scenes in which she lives. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why people think this movie is complicated as the scenes are a perfect mix of the past and present acting as a counterpoint to the remarkable journey of the characters, the film flows simply and you hardly realize that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery amazed and delighted the audience. <br /> <br /> Like most French and European films, this story would never be translated across the Atlantic, no studio can capture the magic without strangling the life with the bleaching Hollywood common to most lost movies in the translation. The Americans make brilliant films, but not of this type ... maybe if they let someone like a young Polanski work on it, then maybe they would not completely block an English version ... <br /> <br /> For those who do it. Do not watch subtitled movies, you will spend your life in an ignorant happiness. For those who can read, you would like to miss films like this ... <br /> <br /> I would describe this as a neo-Franco-Black, but only to finish with the critic who qualified this elitist film. I think I saw him make an announcement for eighty pies. He thinks that Romane Bohringer is a type of French mayonnaise ... It's artistic as Pulp Fiction is artistic ... but with more Gaulish sensations ... <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 with every look .. and someone has Romane's phone number ... she's the perfect French vinaigrette ...
