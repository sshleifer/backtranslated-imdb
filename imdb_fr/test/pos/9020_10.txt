I saw this film a week ago and I had to convince my friend to accompany me because this film seems to receive such bad reviews. Of course, it is not about "human traffic" or "lock, store ...", but this is by no means a flop. I think the fact that there are so many big-budget movies right now means that this has been ignored, but that should not be the case. I think he's trying to do what he wants: entertain us for an hour and a half and leave us happy and happy. I would much rather go to "The Mummy", which looks boring. And no, I'm not a teenager. Do not listen to critics, not Star Wars fans. This film is definitely worth seeing, if only to see the beautiful Luke of Lacey and Rupert Penry-Jones. Go see him!
