Watching the works of Jim Henson years after his death is like looking at another era. Because unlike most creative creatures who tried to sell to children, or even worse to exploit them with cynicism, Jim never really seemed to forget what it was like to be a child. And if there's been a moment where he's shown it, Labyrinth aside, it's the 1979 film Muppet. Filmed as an allegorical account of how Henson became a puppeteer on children's television and ended with a half-hour TV show in prime time, The Muppet Movie ends with an assertion of all that is more progressive kids who have not quite satisfied the expected standard in the 1980s. And while we enjoy the fruits of a time when we are gagged and required to talk about anything for fear of hurting someone, the open celebration of difference or diversity that was a big part of the Muppet Show is proposed here. I said it in other comments, but I have to say it here. The day Jim Henson died, a great light went out. <br /> <br /> The film Muppet begins with the cast of his cast to attend the premiere of what was about to unfold for about eighty minutes. In short, precise blows, we are introduced to the main actors as well as some of the minors. And when the story begins, begin to give us a great song to get us into the present moment. Rainbow Connection painted a beautiful and sad portrait of the Muppets, especially Kermit. It was not just a group of felt puppets with a singular personality who came together to create a show. They were living beings based on a part of us all, but written with much more audacity than we are used to. Each Muppet being presented to us in turn, we saw another reflection of a part of ourselves and, of course, the children of the public would respond differently to each character. Therefore, everyone had a favorite. When Animal appeared behind a battery and tried to eat a cymbal, I knew I had found one. Nowadays, I'm more of a Swedish chef fan, but damn it. <br /> <br /> To complete the characters, there was a series of musical numbers that developed their motivations and personalities. Can you imagine that? shared a glimpse of Dr. Teeth and his group as well as Henson's creative soul. But the most relevant song for me was Gonzo's number, who asked who he was and where he came from. Many of us have spent their lives star gazing and, like Gonzo, saying that we knew we would go back some day. Not that all the songs were so serious, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after deciding to combine their talent (or lack of talent) and hit the road. If it were necessary to prove that the current "musicians" have lost the ability to use the structure of pop to create something to listen to, that figure would be the same. Never before and never before have the group dynamics of a cast and the music complemented each other so well. With puppeteers and dubbers so perfectly at the top of their game, human actors had a lot to live on. <br /> <br /> What makes it even more surprising that the human element has lived until the end of the transaction. Cameos is literally sprinkled with the film, from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas to lend their support. Even Richard Pryor, the last man you would expect to see in a movie about the Muppets, seems to set up a hilarious moment. Mel Brooks' cameo troubles me just as much as I was when I was little, but I guess that's because Henson knew why I would find him disturbing now. The great acting force, however, comes from Charles Durning, who, as Doc Hopper, embodies all that Henson and his audience are determined to resist. Hopper always offers Kermit the chance to sell and betray his species. Or maybe the offer ceases to be the right word when Hopper's attempts to ensure that Kermit's compliance become more and more violent and violent. It's a great metaphor for how each artist is heartbroken by the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, Animal is also showing us that even if our friends are neither nice nor cuddly, they are less of a friend. In fact, Animal turns out to be Kermit's best friend at that time. And that's the central message of every good show or movie Henson has been in since. Refusing or rejecting others simply because of language or aesthetic differences could literally be the worst mistake. There is little doubt that in the world today, where a cretin dressed in a purple suit can tell my sons that they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not under serious investigation by child protection authorities, Henson's creature workshop may never have taken off. To quote wrongly the title of the album, to dare to be stupid is one thing, but to impose one's choice on others is another. The Muppet movie shows how Henson dared to ask us all to think, both inside and outside the proverbial box. There will never be another one that really looks like him, but he would never want us to stop trying. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the movie The Muppet is the quintessence of a film in ten. If we were to send a film into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being erased, that would be good.
