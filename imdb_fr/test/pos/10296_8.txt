Forget the recent dramatic American remake that tarnishes the reputation of the French original because of the participation of the director in these two events. It's a romantic black of the 90s skillfully drawn with many twists and turns. It works better as a Gallic ode to Hitchcock's rear window, because the notion of voyeurism is the constant theme that triggers the complex scenario. The story is incredibly accomplished, like a Picasso painting, offering several perspectives on the same event and requiring the spectator's participation. The arrangements, the music and the spellbinding score are fantastic, as well as the excellent contributions of the actors. Look at it more than once.
