"The Saint Takes Over" stars George Sanders as Simon Templar, aka "The Saint" in this 1940 entry in the series. It also stars Wendy Barrie, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guilfoyle. On board a ship en route to the United States, the Saint meets and tries to gain time with a woman (Wendy Barrie) who gives him the brushstroke. Simon comes to New York to help Inspector Fernack, now completely discredited by a gangster-mounted coup. $ 50,000 was found at home. The gangster, Rocky (Roland Drew), of course, was found not guilty at trial, and he and his comrades pay the bill for the lawyer's picture and representation - $ 90,000 in total. Today, you need it to defend yourself against a parking ticket. It was a murder. <br /> <br /> Rocky sends his bodyguard, Pearly Gates (Guilfoyle) to the lawyer to steal the $ 90,000 from the safe. The lawyer caught him in the act and sent him back to his boss with a message. Seconds later, he died. Rocky meets a similar fate. And so on - who kills this group of gangsters? The saint must make one of them talk about Fernach being released - can he tell anyone about it before he is murdered? The woman he met aboard the ship reappears and occupies an important place in the case. <br /> <br /> Few actors have the same tone with a replica like George Sanders. Perfect for Simon Templar. Paul Guilfoyle provides some humor to Pearly Gates, nervous and drinking milk, and Jonathan Hale is great as Inspector Fern exasperated but worried. Wendy Barrie, who has appeared in many episodes of Saint, is very good as a woman who captures Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very nice.
