I like Breillat's movies, but this one is the best I've seen to balance the heat of animals with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electric and the scenario is incredible - especially since it is supposed to take place on the set of another film of Breillat. You do not have to agree with her to take all she has to gain. It made me think a lot about vulnerability and power. Try to imagine a director with the opening of Jeanne - not impossible, but a bit scathing. Unannounced sexual currents that are always present when humans come together to do something are projected in bright light, but not in a cold light.
