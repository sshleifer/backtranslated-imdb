I love Aaron Carter, but even though I was expecting the pop star to be predictable, I was so wrong! Aaron Carter was really funny and an excellent actor! In addition, the actress who played Jane was a brilliant actress! Everyone who watched it loved it! <br /> <br /> The music was also very good! <br /> <br /> My favorite lyrics of the movie are "You can not send me a public school mom! I am a CELEBRIDGE !!" and "Take your time, it will come to you!" <br /> <br /> Although the ends are pretty lame, all the good girls movies are! This movie is great, and a good movie of Chick that I can watch again and again!
