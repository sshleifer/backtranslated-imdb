I just saw this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival today and I liked it. Our synopsis was indicated in our program as "an old Shakespearian actor invites his three children to his suicide party". I did not know if I was going to see him because when I read this text, I liked the idea of ​​a "suicide festival", it seemed very interesting, but "the old actor Shakespearean "made me fear that the film is kind of dry and boring. But I decided to try. I'm glad I did it. It was not at all dry and boring, this dialogue was great, fun in an intelligent way, but not pretentious and hard to understand. Peter Falk was great in that role, he stole the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by the performance of Laura San Giacomo. In general, it bothers me, but I enjoyed watching it in this movie. I think Judge Reinhold's role could have been better done by another actor. Sometimes he looked a little lame and he seemed to be acting, not like you were watching this character. But the film was so good that I could forgive the clumsiness of an actor. I would recommend this film to anyone and I have already told a few people to see it as soon as it is available to the general public. Who knew that suicide could be so hilarious?
