Wicked Little Things is a very good movie. I would say that in some parts it seemed really incredible and in others it seemed that there was not enough thought in the actions of the characters, but overall it was exciting and entertaining I do not understand why the movie is so low. I also do not understand why all the votes of the movie Afterdark Horrorfest are so low.They are B-Movies people and nothing more.They offer quality entertainment and most of them Wicked Little Things is the one of the best 1st annual Afterdark Horrorfest movies, and compared to many other movies in the series, this is one of the best in the whole.
