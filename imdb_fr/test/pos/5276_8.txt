Okay, if this movie was shot much later in the history of cinema, it would not be particularly useful. However, in 1898, the films were in their infancy and they were almost all rather boring and had no story to tell - they only showed ordinary people doing their daily activities. If seen today, almost all are desperately dull and very, very short - often less than a minute! And so in light of this, this short film excerpt is a good thing and could make you laugh. Two guys, a miller and a chimney sweeper cross each other, falling and throwing flour and coal dust together as they argue. IT'S ALL - the movie is over before you know it.
