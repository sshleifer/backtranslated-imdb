This show is really great. It's smart. It's funny. It's great to play and write. This show is really the fastest show I have ever seen. The dialogues are really funny and well played. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have excellent chemistry. You really believe they are mother and daughter. This show has really shown that mother-daughter relationships do not necessarily have to be only a mother and a daughter, they can be better friends, but at the same time, it shows that it is very difficult to be sometimes more than a mother and a daughter, especially with Lorelai and Emily. Just watch this show, I highly recommend it. It's great and certainly the best show on the air. Season 7 Stars Tuesday, September 26, 2006, 8 / 7c on the new The CW
