It was one of the few shows that my wife and I had agreed to watch. I was shocked to learn that the program had been canceled, particularly because I did not realize that the ratings were so bad. As far as I know, a lot of viewers were doing well. Almost all my friends and most of the people I talked to watched the show. Now we are stuck watching programs or DVDs. How was the show? Does anyone know the real results of the views? I know that when it was Thursday it was harder to catch for me. Thank you G * d for DVR! <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was really a surprise to know that there will be no more "home war". If other networks see this, PLEASE PICK UP THE SHOW !!!! PLEASE!
