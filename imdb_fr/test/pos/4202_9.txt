Very good movie of 1939 where John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks that he has committed a murder. The problem is that the murderer and Garfield's daughter, Ann Sheridan, were killed while trying to escape the police. <br /> <br /> Twisted lawyer persuades Garfield to flee New York. He lands in Arizona and meets. They were sent there by a funding program to prevent them from further trouble. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garfield discovers a new love interest but must conceal his identity because everyone thinks that he was not only the murderer, but also the victim of the car accident. <br /> <br /> May Robson is fabulous as a guy with grandmother at the head of the band for the lost kids. Claude Rains also plays the role of the detective who suspects Garfield of being alive and pursues him when a photo of him is taken in Arizona. <br /> <br /> The film really deals with Garfield's relationship with boys. Although the end is good, you want to see Garfield return to New Zealand to proclaim his innocence.
