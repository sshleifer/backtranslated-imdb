The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: far better and deeper than Rom√©o & Juliette by Luhrman or Titanic by Spielberg. The love of Gerda impresses me every time, his search, his battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong and affectionate woman throughout the film. Kay is the poisoner of the dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for ONLY ONE, for the sake of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the key words of this movie. I cry every time I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay. And I wish that it ends soon ... Snowqueen says that my life, I identify deeply with the story and the characters. Thank you at least to Hans Christian Anderson and the director.
