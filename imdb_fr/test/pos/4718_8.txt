It was high time to shoot a film about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Initially, I thought Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and add the typical Titanic-type Hollywood pimento between the leading heroine and the Burmese lead who happens to be an old man. Fortunately, nothing like this was in place - which may also explain why the film did not have financial success. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was honest with God and I was happy with the accuracy of the events described. . Aside from the fact that the shoot was shot outside Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand and I missed the exotic Burmese places, I did not find much to complain about in the film. <br /> <br /> You can not blame the film for the desperation of people and the overwhelming actions that result. After all, these are the real events of a civil war. The music of Hans Zimmer is undoubtedly the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection with it. <br /> <br /> I was only one year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this tumultuous time. When I heard a movie about my actual experience that I was too young to absorb, I had to get the DVD. Needless to say, I could hardly complain about this film, because it's a miracle for me. .
