This film is not for those who expect a martial arts extravaganza. As far as historical accuracy is concerned, I will leave this question to those who are better informed about it. I thought the performances were wonderful. Gong Li never disappoints as the ingenious and (initially) faithful husband of the King of Qin. Fengyi Zhang has shown a lot of flexibility in describing a rule that falls into madness. He chose the path "Hannibal Lector" rather than resort to the diatribe. For me, the best performance was that of Zhiwen Wang as super marquis. The character seemed very fat, but in a subtle "Sir Humphrey Appleby" - Yes, kind of minister. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the peculiarity of this film. The scene when the marquis and his men stormed the palace was breathtaking. There are also a number of marvelous battle scenes. Therefore, this movie is highly recommended on the big screen.
