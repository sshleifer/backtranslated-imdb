I rented this obscure Australian relic a few years ago to present it at a friend's house and it was an instant success. The classic tale of the oz wizard with a decidedly Australian touch of the 70s. is not exactly shakespeare. the company here, but later, Bruce Spence, star of "Mad Max", is a beautifully discreet scarecrow and surfer. Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsay play remarkable comic roles. musical contribution of Ross Daddy Cool's former singer, Ross Wilson, on the title track. In the same vein as later Australian comedies, such as "Priscilla queen of the desert". Good fun.
