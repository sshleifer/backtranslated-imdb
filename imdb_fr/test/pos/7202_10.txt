I must admit that I slept at the cinema while watching the first film of Asterix ... but this one is simply FANTASTIC! It's really funny and it leaves the first kilometer. There are many funny gags and situations that made me laugh from the first minutes of the movie and I stopped laughing only when I got to the car to go home. I repeat: this film is spectacular ... Obélix is ​​really funny and Cleopatra is a real baby!
