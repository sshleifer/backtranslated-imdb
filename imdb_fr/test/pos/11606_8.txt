I saw the 2 hour version of Choker Bali. I can not say it's long. The film has a certain natural rhythm and does not seem to lag behind at any time. The costume and the decor are reminiscent of what we saw in old movies. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai did a good job. It is indeed a mature role with enough leeway to act in the story. The script also supports the story very well. Aishwarys acts as the unfortunate widow whose husband dies during the first year of marriage. The film deals with the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict she faces with the conditions of misery of widows at that time. <br /> <br /> Her best friend in this movie is played by Raima Sen was also well -handled. Her innocence and admiration for Aishwarya's ability to speak English and behave in an educated way went very well. These are indeed some of the mentalities that prevail at this time. We can see how far we have come from such a time! <br /> <br /> The film speaks of the liberation of women as a subtle line of history. I found the development of the story very similar to Ghare Bahire, also written by Tagore. It is part of the struggle for independence and contrasts the struggle for Indian independence against the silent struggle for women's rights. <br /> <br /> A well done movie that really deserves to be watched. The acting game of Aishwarya: par excellence. Rituparna treated the story with great care. Another classic Rabindranath Tagore.
