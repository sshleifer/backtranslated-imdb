The Stepford Children, in addition to being a very good movie for television, shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination. This is quite an affirmation of how acting within the boundaries of what is considered "good" behavior can destroy everything that makes a person unique and an individual. I think it's a movie that parents who wish to keep a semblance of thought that the slime in the heart and mind of young people should watch with their children and discuss what the film says. I do not know if this was in any way the intention of this film, but I always thought it was one of the best ways to film against the desire to get kids to conform to an unrealistic and domineering pretext for what to see. the best interests of anyone other than the children themselves. I hope to see this movie on DVD one day. I'm at the starting gate ... waiting.
