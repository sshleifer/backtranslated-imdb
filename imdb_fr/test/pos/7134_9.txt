I'm definitely not a player, but a few people in my family and my boyfriend are. So, with a little reluctance, I decided to find out what the problem was with the "fantastic material". I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was HILARE! It's great, but not disrespectful to those who like RPGs. In addition, and more importantly, people who have never played before can enjoy it and not feel left behind or lose trying to understand the plot. The acting was awesome and the shots on the pitch / set were believable. It makes me want to see other films from this production company. I can not wait to see what the future holds for this group! Three cheers - bravo !!
