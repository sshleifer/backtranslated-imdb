"Tourist Trap" is a strange thriller released in the 70's. These are 5 friends: Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott), who stumble upon a ruined museum of SLAUSEN'S LOST OASIS, a curious and strange museum by the side of the road. Slausen (Chuck Conners), an eccentric but apparently innocuous mannequin, manages this gold mine of dilapidated but strangely realistic models. Slausen has a warning to give to young people: stay away from Davey, the lonely and disturbed brother of Slausen. <br /> <br /> The curiosity of young people wins and they go on an adventure. The trap is out! Among the flying objects, the slamming doors, the strangling sashes, reinforced by a hidden force, the trap closes slowly on the group. The "creature" Davey and his army of murderous manikins do a quick and brutal job of friends, until only one remains. <br /> <br /> Although not a Slasher movie, "Tourist Trap" still contains elements of slasher movies such as chase scenes, stalking and the fact that the killer wears a mask . <br /> <br /> The seemingly telekinetic abilities of the killer to lock locks and animate wax mannequins are used wisely. What is perhaps the most scary in this film are the models, certainly scary enough to start, but are rather scary here. The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of a budget obviously thin. These wax figurines are simply plastic mannequins - but that only makes their eyes that move with an incredible human being even more strange. The acting game is actually pretty good, Chuck Conners gives a well-rounded and terrifying performance like Mr. Slausen, Jocelyn Jones tall as the main female.
