During the Second World War, Hollywood created a large number of films. After seeing many, they start to look alike. OVER 21 is however unique in many ways because it shows a facet of war that you will not see in other movies - it's worth the detour, even if you've seen the bazillion of other movies! <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays the main male role, but the real main role of the film is Irene Dunne - who looks great for a 47-year-old woman (yes, I checked - she was really as old she did the movie). OVER 21 YEARS, the couple plays husband and wife. He enlisted in the army, to the dismay of his father (Charles Coburn) and owner of the newspaper where Knox is employed, and the bulk of the film takes place while at the school of candidate officers. The film shows little of Knox at school, but instead focuses on Dunne, who lives in a spartan housing nearby for the spouses. Meanwhile, she (as the British say) keeps the "stiff upper lip" and makes the most of it, even if she is not really a housewife, but a famous professional writer. From time to time, her husband, in a hurry, makes brief visits, but most of the time, he takes care of the housework and defense of Coburn. Eventually, she decides to keep Coburn from phoning all the time (he ALWAYS complains that his diary will not survive without his son) pretending to be Knox - writing wonderful editorials that everyone just assumes they've been written by him. <br /> <br /> Although this film is not overwhelming, it's a very interesting slice of life. In addition, the acting is very good. It is interesting to note that this film is a fictional recasting of the experienced Ruth Gordon (a famous screenwriter) and her husband, Garson Kanin (also famous writer and director). When Kanin joined the army during the Second World War, Gordon quickly wrote and interpreted the role of this film. <br /> <br /> By the way, I noticed that some critics really liked the speech at the end of the film. and were inspired by her. Although it was very good, it was also very sad because all this hope for a better world after the war was short-lived.
