Adam (Eric Jungmann) and his obnoxious best friend, Harley (Justin Urich), drive to a wedding. Along the way, they meet the sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Then, for no reason, a monster truck tries to drive them off the road ... and maybe kill them. Who does this and why? <br /> <br /> A very good horror movie. His energy and full of flashy direction that puts you right in the action. It's also a horror comedy. Most of the humor is childish and REALLY rude but actually somewhat funny. Plus, this movie really makes waves - but it's a good thing! The acting game is OK - Jungmann is a bit over his role as nerd; Urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the filthy best friend obsessed with sex - but does it; Brooks is also good in a limited role. <br /> <br /> BUT I could see that the "twist" ended well before that happened and the logic disappears completely at the end (especially the rescue). It's still a bloody horror movie, sometimes funny and sometimes scary. I give him a 7.
