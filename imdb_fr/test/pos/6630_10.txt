It's a heartbreaking film, and it moves relentlessly. Yet it is quite unique among war films in that it focuses exclusively on the civilian experience, the loss of humanity experienced by ordinary citizens in wartime. The two young married musicians undergo a process of slow and brutal degradation in the hands of both sides of a civil war. Totally devoid of sentimentality, the film offers a dark vision of the modern world, and I think it is particularly recognizable by many Europeans. With courageous and intense performances of Liv Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (similarly). For my money, the most indelible film that Bergman ever created.
