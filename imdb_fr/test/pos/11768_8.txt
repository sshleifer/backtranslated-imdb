A funny gambol ... a lot of good twists! <br /> <br /> I did not know that this movie existed until watching the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD ... (oddly enough, he was there with The City of Lost Children and the Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen) <br /> <br /> The plot leaves you perplexed. <br /> <br /> The acting game was awesome ... Hank Azaria shows his talent again, Bill Bob is Billy Bob ... (wecis?) <br /> <br /> It's really worth it to watch.
