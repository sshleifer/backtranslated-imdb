I really enjoyed this movie and I usually do not like moving pictures. But I thought the cats were attractive and the story was charming. There is a good song called "Everybody wants to be a cat", it's a lot of fun. There are funny moments and an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be a passionate cat lover to enjoy this movie.
