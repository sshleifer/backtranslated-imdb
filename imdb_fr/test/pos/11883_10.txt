Critters 4 is one of the greatest movies of the twentieth century. The classic word has never been used as well as to describe this breathtaking epic. I agree that the original version of Critters is the best in the series, but the claustrophobic tension of the space station in which Critters 4 is located must really be perceived as such. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in one of the major monuments of the twentieth century.
