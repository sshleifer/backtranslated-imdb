I do not really know when TV channels started to prefer having handsome men as journalists - regardless of men's IQ - but that was clearly a problem when "Broadcast News" came out, and the film did a very good job. good job to watch. Representing a love triangle between air-boy journalist Tom Grunick (William Hurt), intelligent but nervous journalist Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the film has nothing to complain about. The best sentence in the movie is probably when Tom says something like, "I do not really understand what I'm saying." And in the era of FOX News and the like, a movie like this becomes even more important. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a film that I recommend. Also starring Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson in a supporting role as presenter.
