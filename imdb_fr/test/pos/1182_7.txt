A competent comedy that makes fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau laugh. I guess this film was made for those who liked both GRUMPY OLD MEN movies, as there seemed to be a group of those friends that featured the comedy duo in their twilight years. The idea is certain: Matthau, a feeble gambler who owes thousands of dollars, invites his unsuspecting friend, Lemmon, to take a free cruise with him to meet old and rich ladies; The problem is that they have been registered as dance hosts and that Matthau can not dance. <br /> <br /> OUT TO SEA is a fun movie, and not all laughs are graciously offered by Lemmon and Matthau. I found Brent Spiner (better known as Data from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION) very humorous as coordinator of the posh ball-busting dance. As the leader of the two aging actors, he managed to match them to the laughter department. Although the film does not really need it, there is also a love story to tell, involving Dyan Cannon (who looks very pretty for his years).
