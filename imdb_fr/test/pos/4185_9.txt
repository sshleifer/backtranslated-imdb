Pity the monkeys. People always accused them of being made (what they were) or of being nothing more than an American Beatles simulator (again, what they were), but for the children of the time, they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who was better The Monkees or The Beatles were common in schoolyards, but critics had never really accepted. Despite the recording of very catchy classical melodies, Monkess do not have much respect for their albums. Unfortunately, their vehicle to a film has suffered the same fate, despite the fact that it is the best film of the group. Beatles fans might argue that "Hard Days Night" was better and I'm sure many kids think "8 Mile" was better but none of these movies were as bold and inventive as "Head" and it was is probably why he failed. <br /> <br /> If Head had told a direct story of type A to B, he might have seduced the young fans of the group, but pushing the limits and taking the opportunity to make fun of them. own picture, they really sabotaged the film. their fans. Can you imagine that Eminem is turning to the camera and actually talking about the sadness that he is the best-selling guy in a genre in which only 5% (and I'm generous) of the actors are white. If you can imagine that, then you will have an idea of ​​the audacity with which the Monk dared to sing "Hey, Hey, we are the Monkees, you know we like to please, a manufactured image, without philosophy". When you have a movie in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on dance, and more on music, it's clear that there's a lot more going on than expected. <br /> <br /> The story, which exists, concerns boys who are trying to escape their manager, who forces them at some point to play film in an advertisement, but each time they flee they find themselves in a box. I do not think you need to be Fellini to understand the symbolism of this element. Davy is a boxer who has to give up the violin to plunge into the big game and Peter who refuses to throw an ice cream he does not want because there are hungry children. waste food, but the real selling point of this film is the music and some of the best that the band has ever recorded. Even if the story disgusts you, you can listen to fantastic music. <br /> <br /> Any movie that starts and ends with a suicide attempt by Mickey jumping off a bridge (in the end, the band follows him) will never be a classic, but if you are a fan of the band or the experimental cinema of that time, you will appreciate this film.
