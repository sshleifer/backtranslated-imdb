How to summarize this film? it's simply impossible. Why should you see it? perhaps for the story, most likely for the actors (Giorgio, Catherine ...), especially for the universe and poetry. It's a tale. Sad, sometimes dark, but a tale. I like this film !!!! I'm just waiting for the DVD !! Thank you Mr. Boutonnat.
