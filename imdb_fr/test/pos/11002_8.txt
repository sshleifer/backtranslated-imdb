In "The Squire of Gothos", Kirk and his team meet a powerful super-being who keeps the captain, "Bones" and some captive crewmen for no apparent reason. I could be wrong, but I think it's the first episode of Star Trek I've ever seen and the program that made me want to have more. This is not one of the best episodes, but the immovable premise of an alien putting the Enterprise team in a corner is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch. In a way, the superhumanoid anticipates one of the most famous characters in Star Trek, the enigmatic "Q" of Next Generation. This episode is also memorable to create a unique situation: this is the first time that Uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see what character attaching Uhuara can be when the story allows it. Too bad the show has never fully explored this iconic figure.
