Why all the negative reviews ??? You did not expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece, would you? What we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me. Not an Oscar nominee, just entertainment. You can really see how the movie has aged, especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays. I still remember the first release of this movie and that the network was still new. Crazy and frightening thoughts when I saw this for the first time; I was 15 years old and I seriously thought that someone could get their information on a computer and destroy you. But who can say that it can not happen ??? I'm not the kind of person to crunch a movie to death, to analyze it until I turn blue. This is not my style Average game, suspensive and again, very fun. Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so cute. This is my favorite film with her because she is like the genius of computer science, which I find very attractive. Of all the films released in 1995, this should be my favorite, even though I did not see it before 1996. My rating is 9/10 because it slowed down a bit.
