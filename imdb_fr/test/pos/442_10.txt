This is my favorite Renoir of the fifties. This is the story of Henri Danglard's construction and launch of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. we see the workers blasting on the site to start the construction work and train the dancers. Finally, the vertigo of the opening night and the long sequence of dancing cankies. The financial problems and the ego demonstrations of the performers are described. <br /> <br /> Gabin is in great shape because Danglard is an easygoing man - see him treat Nini's violent boyfriend with humor. Gianni Esposito behaves like the melancholy prince who is courting Nini. Maria Felix, with the body of this amazon, is as imposing as the selfish Lola, the first lover of Danglard. Finally, Françoise Arnoul in the role of Nini, the washerwoman who ends up dancing for Danglard and become his daughter, is simply beautiful. Its charm and charm will seduce you. <br /> <br /> A bonus: we have Edith Piaf, Patachou, André Claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of the last century who ruled the Moulin Rouge.
