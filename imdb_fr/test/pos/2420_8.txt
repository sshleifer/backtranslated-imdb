I read a few reviews of the film and felt that it was not as good as Karate Kid's previous installments. Although my favorite is always Karate Kid II, I felt that this fourth part of the film series was consistent with the others and that we had some important lessons to share. Unlike previous versions, the karate student is a teenager who follows a somewhat different path of learning, rather than a teenager. Maggi finds it a little more difficult, but shows up. The plot twists are credible and predictable. I have found that the bad guys are a bit of a size, but this weakness is present in all installments to varying degrees. The work of the camera is impressive and passes from time to time in beautiful landscapes. The Zen monastery is both austere and charming. Zen monks add a little humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the scenes of "Zen Bowling", which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious scene of zen archery earlier. The quality level of the film is like a good TV series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band playing "Listen to Your Heart". The lessons of the film are valuable and worth learning. They feel faithful to the spirit of karate and take care not to over-glorify the fighting. Overall, I liked it.
