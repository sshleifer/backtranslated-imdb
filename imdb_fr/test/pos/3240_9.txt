I had this movie with my BBC "Jane Austen Collection" (5 DVDs of old adaptations of the BBC) and I did not like it at first. It's completely different from the others and I miss it, or at least I thought so, one of the qualities I appreciate in all the other Austen films: common sense. The nightmarish scene in which Ms. Richards apparently sewn the fingers was particularly disturbing. <br /> <br /> I still do not like to watch the sewing scene on my finger, but I like to hear Mrs. R. dreaming. as she sews, "My only knowledge ... tore my dress." This film is now my current favorite Austen. I have watched it 7 or 8 times so far. The acting game, in my opinion, is incredible. The way I notice that I play well is when I look up looking at everything I do (sewing, but not the fingers together, with a little luck, neither shit, nor anything either) to watch the character deliver his lines. It's the turn of the expression, the composition of the posture, that gives life to the words - that's what makes the quality of the game, as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Well, I watch almost every part of "Northanger Abbey" because almost all actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of fian Bathian and true male hero - you do not know until the end if he's looking for Catherine's money or not. I like his accent touch (Welsh?). Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming: the combination of their behaviors - especially Mr. Richards' deep voice, a counterpoint to his wit and wisdom - makes them so real. General Tilney, as a hard-hearted father who could be a murderer, is also fascinating. And Captain Tilney, the smiling rake playing so clearly ... and the money-hungry sister and brother I can not remember the names - they are both so perfect, both intelligent and frightened . <br /> <br /> The other reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of Jane Austen's adaptations. I know it was one of Austen's weak points (well, that's my case): even though all his novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that his heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they are not really in love, then what's the point? All other adaptations I've seen (with the exception of Olivier / Garson at the beginning) have pretty kisses of cold fish at the end, if they kiss at all. I do not like sex in movies at all but it's really necessary to have a sincere kiss at the end. And the ultimate kiss in Northanger is a doozy. <br /> <br /> The over-the-top approach to costumes, music and lighting works very well in my opinion. And the scenario is extremely intelligent - our way of being educated about gothic romance, highlife in Bath, Cathy's normal education in the country, etc., is very well done, as is the case in the productions of the BBC. Also, I like the game when the little black page makes the wheels. And the Marchionesse, I think, was a storage device quite appropriate and very intelligent. <br /> <br /> Some people have objected that this version was the opposite of what Jane Austen wanted to do in Northanger Abbey - she wanted to make fun of the gothic romance, not promote it. But I do not think she meant "Mysteries of Udolph", etc. She was just making it clear that we had to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this is said when Mr. Tilney scolds Catherine in her mother's room. In addition, General Tilney was a villain, although prosaic. This point was supposed to be done, surely.
