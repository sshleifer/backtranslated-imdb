I just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it absolutely idyllic, some scenes that I could not help but laugh! Dennis is so incredibly thick sometimes, and just says the most severe things ... but at the same time, he's just cool to impress his girlfriend (who gets arrested anyway!) The beach scenery is very quiet. .. until Robbie Coltrane comes ...! Not the best movie of all time but one thing to think about renting on Saturday night when you do not have much to do (like me). You may need to search for it - I was lucky, as my local video store stores it.
