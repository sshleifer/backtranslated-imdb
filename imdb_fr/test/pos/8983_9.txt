This film captures open scenes and never lets go. You observe with indulgence the excitement of Janos Szaby at the idea of ​​coming to America. He is a nice man. You can not help but love him, even when his ardor is replaced by bitterness as his fate turns. You know that in his circumstances, you would be forced to make the same choices as for your survival. This film comments on the social cult of beauty and all that is superficial and is only true in the culture of the twenty-first century. Janos himself is the victim of this philosophy when he tells his blind girlfriend "you are young and beautiful, if you could see, you would have the world". And like many modern gangster movies, when his security is threatened, he takes a powerful revenge. His innocence is not lost, because he claims a price just as high, knowing that he deserves his fate. <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre is in great shape in this role. Only a few actors could convincingly transform this innocent character into an embittered criminal in sixty-nine minutes. Lorre is well supported by all actors, making it a real big picture and not just a vehicle for a star. With a little less predatory dialogue, this film would be a 10. Highly recommended.
