Can it really be a Troma movie? Some scenes have almost an "A" movie look. The play of the actors is generally competent (the two chiefs and the nurse-surrogate were particularly good, and I liked some of the clashes between the young Capulets and Ques); the scenes were edited smoothly; the plot is consistent. It's funny. It has an original and original soundtrack. <br /> <br /> He has the usual big imperfections of Troma and his weak humor, but I do not think Shakespeare would have bothered him so much. In fact, I think he might have laughed at it. <br /> <br /> It's a good DVD. There is an alternative soundtrack with a very informative commentary by the director, several deleted scenes and the usual collection of Troma's self-derogatory nonsense. <br /> <br /> I will not tell you it was citizen Kane. but it's a rather inspired and low-budget movie.
