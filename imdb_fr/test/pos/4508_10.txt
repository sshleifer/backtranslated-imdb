I read the book and saw the movie today. The scenario is so powerful that almost all scenarios and scenarios could have been useful to him. So, not much there. However, it's still a beautiful film because it makes you think and feel just like the book. Looking at it is not like watching a documentary about a failing state and feeling compassionate about those who suffer under an oppressive regime, it's like watching the story of every ordinary man unfold, from generation to generation , on all continents. Amir's cowardice, his guilt, his dilemmas and finally his choice of a means of redemption could have been a story of all of us. There is not one infallible character to watch and idolize, but all are gray, just like all of us. <br /> <br /> Another important observation is that the film does an excellent job of chronicling the lives of Afghans through some twenty years of turbulent political scenarios. The vibrant and careless childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and the city's desolate and torn remains echo what the Taliban have done to it. <br /> <br /> The children actors deserve to be congratulated forever. . They can shame any mature actor. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie yet or read the book, enter the theater with the idea that you will witness a multi-layered story. on a multicolored fabric of emotions and human feelings. This film is not intended to arouse anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban sentiments, but to feel the trials of human existence. <br /> <br /> I read some of the external reviews related to the site and I must admit that I do not do it. see the meaning of criticism by writing reviews that summarize the plot as a distant viewer and point out technical details on astonishing cinematography or something similar. At least for this film, one must try to connect to it rather than judge it objectively.
