To tell the truth, I went to see this film only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People may not agree, but it also performs well in both good and bad movies. I had never seen a movie with Penelope Crus, so I was anxious to see if she was a good actress. So here's what I think: <br /> <br /> The movie is good (I did not read the novel, though). Some moments were really exciting and ... unexpected. Overall, you will find the plot quite simple. Thus, the only thing that could save the film, which (an experienced spectator will know from the beginning) would end tragically or happily, was the performance of both Cage and Crus. And it was awesome, awesome, awesome !!! In the last part of the film, I even liked the actress's rather broad accent (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek, that's good, she even looks like a Greek). Overall, the film is very nice and has a lot of irony (classical music lovers will surely have fun at times). <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10. You should see that!
