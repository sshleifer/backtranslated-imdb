The end of the suburbs, as it should please citizens in general and mass consumers, is likely to become a cultural reform. The film uses the super-cynical analysis of authors, political decision makers and social philosophers of the paradox created by life in the suburban - mainly in the post-war era. <br /> <br /> What we have created in America is a place with "none of the conveniences of country life, nor any of the amenities of urban life". This is the prescription that is required for the suburbs, and the film focuses on the singular idea of ​​"oil". Generally speaking, in the most general sense, the world is approaching or reaching its peak oil production, and when we are fully aware of it, major changes in our way of life will be in effect, whether it be our best interest or by the force that is imposed on us violently. to live even the slum dwellers of Calcutta could not describe us. <br /> <br /> If nothing more, the end of Suburbia will siphon the viewer by giving him goosebumps, creating a nauseating feeling. This is bound to happen. It's a dark perspective on our inherent way of life. The ambivalence lies particularly in the critical analysis of the film by each spectator. I expect many unprepared viewers to slander the film as a bland Liberal propaganda - like a Michale Moore movie. What they fail to take into account is that such a reaction is quite normal when such a message strikes the way of life of the vast majority of the masses in an incredibly difficult way. <br /> <br /> That's the truth, and as a student in urban planning, I can tell you that we need to better prepare ourselves now, because the poor chance we have to maintain the quality of life in this cloaca of altered resources less and less disappears slower than the populations hit by the black plague.
