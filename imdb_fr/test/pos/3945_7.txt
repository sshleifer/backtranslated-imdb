Another tour with the king of the monkeys heading west .... somehow. <br /> <br /> Starting in the middle of an action, the movie starts from the first frame. <br /> <br /> A The monk and his three disciples go to a city in search of sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once translated and spoken to the world. But a perverse force intervened and removed all the children from the city. The force of evil wants the monk because if you eat it, you will live forever. The assistants fight the forces of darkness before sending the monk forcibly for his safety (the monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the wicked). The monk ends up with a group of leprechauns lizards planning to eat at one point ... but the bad guys arrive and he comes out of an odyssey with the ugliest of the lot. <br /> <br /> Can a movie that starts off the rails off the rails? Do not get me wrong, I liked this movie a lot, but its scene is so scattered and everywhere, the plot and the logic simply disappear while some scenes are simply in the middle of the action, with no way of knowing how we got there (The final battle save the disciples is completely out of the left field). It's one of the most messy movies I've seen in a long time, but it made me laugh and smile like I was not out. The movie starts and you do not know where things are. What you see on the screen is interesting or fun, and you do not lose it. How can we go from thing to thing often exceeds me. It is full of strange helpers and strange references, from heaven to the ocean, through the space and the rib cage of a mythical beast where God knows where. This film floats everywhere, which keeps the pleasure of playing because you do not know where it will end (and that's why you keep the details to a minimum). And it's funny. Very very funny sometimes. <br /> <br /> And the action is very good, even if a good part of it is a flawless CGI animation (which provides cool images, the golden rod, the formation of attacks of spiders, the angel in flight ...). Action and comedy aside, it's actually a wonderful love story. This is the story of an ugly goblin and a monk who end up falling in love (and having other complications). It's an interesting look at the nature of love and its truth. You will be moved. <br /> <br /> In spite of his great satisfaction, I was always annoyed by his construction in dispersed plan. The film's inability to keep its ideas together and tell a complete story really hurts the film and takes away from the fun every time we meet a bump on the road, these bumps make you out of the movie and make you realize it. how much does other sources cost? <br /> <br /> Absolutely to see, because the moments of choice are not lacking. Be prepared to face bumps and you'll have a good time.
