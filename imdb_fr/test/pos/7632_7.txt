Surprisingly good film made in the wake of the exorcist about a young woman who becomes possessed by a spirit after visiting a desecrated church to restore a size and a life as a crucified man. The coin was Christ and the two thieves, but Christ was sold a long time ago. The problem begins once the figure is removed from the cross and it seems to come alive and seduce the woman. From that moment, it becomes a battle for the soul of the girls. Scary, scary and much better than you think, the film works because its casting sells events that are decidedly adult. It helps them to be real imperfect people, so it's easier to understand them. I really liked this film, and seeing it for the first time in at least a decade, I was shocked by its quality. It seems that it is definitely better than any of his innumerable schlocky titles.
