So good, the acting, the cut, the staging may not be the best of all time, but the dance, movement, heat and passion of this film are definitely the best (well ... at least for me ^^) it really touched me, inspired me to learn to dance. I have even subscribed to this site so that I can vote and support this film. for this film, he literally gave me goosebumps when I watched him. I like that. Jennifer Gray is so pretty! Patrick is so sexy in it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the first thing I'll do tomorrow, on the way to college, will be to go to the video store, buy a copy, watch it again n until I'm old, no longer to be able to dance with the film. before I have to learn all the dance moves there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
