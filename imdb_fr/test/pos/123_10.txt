A surprisingly well done movie, with actors, directors, writers and exceptional photographers. <br /> <br /> A bride discovers that marital life is not what she hoped for and begins to question her duty to herself and her duty to society. With her sister-in-law, she radically derogates from conventional roles and mores.
