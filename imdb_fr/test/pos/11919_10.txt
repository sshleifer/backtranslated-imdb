This movie not only has a great title, but is simply the biggest drama I have ever seen. Sean Astin, Billy Tepper, is brilliant, with important supporting roles from TERUSSELL, Wil Wheaton, and Shawn Phelan, the advice and leadership of Gosset's The Astins characters make the movie a lot better. As time goes on, the film continues to gain ground and disappointment is that none of the young actors made themselves known in the film industry after this wonderful film.
