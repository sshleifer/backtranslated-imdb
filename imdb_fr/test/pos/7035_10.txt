This summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can not even count how many times I have seen Dirty Dancing. It's a movie I could probably watch every few weeks and I'd always like to love. <br /> <br /> This film has something timeless. I loved other "hit love movies" like Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think they are up there, but there is something about Dirty Dancing that makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Gray, the direction of the film, the INCREDIBLE dance, the warm summer atmosphere, everything about the naughty dance is absolutely perfect. It's an instant classic and I've never really seen a movie like this before or since. <br /> <br /> I do not think there is one thing that makes this movie so popular, but many are mentioned by many critics. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, languid and summery vibe, realistic characters, an honest message, coupled with incredible music and dance, and one of the best dance sequences the film has ever given us. <br /> <br /> This film is still on television and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I will mention that I have no interest in seeing "Havanna Nights", this one that they should have left alone.
