A smooth production that arouses interest from the very first scene where Max chooses a ring in a jewelry store. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's "Dream of a Summer Night" in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's friends. Here, Max and Lucien, both predisposed to love at first sight, mingle with Lisa and Alice, and Alice complicates things when her name is Lisa. In addition to this merry confusion, Max is inclined to get involved in incidents that bring back memories of two years ago. And since Max has many of these dream episodes, we are subject to flashbacks, too much in my opinion, because at the first viewing of the film, I did not know if I was in the present or the past a lot of corridors, stairs, doors, elevators, etc. I accept all of this in a fast-paced movie, but must so many people run into each other? After four collisions, it will have no impact, if you excuse the pun. Excellent notes for artistic design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor, but I wonder how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in Paris. It is always exciting to save a person who is determined to commit suicide by jumping out the window. It is also in this film that Max comes out almost at the same time. However, a kiss or two soon make him feel better. If you manage to make your way through all the flashbacks, you will end up at the airport where the devoted sister of Max gives her a most affectionate kiss. It can be said that it solves the complications of love, like Puck in "The dream of a summer night".
