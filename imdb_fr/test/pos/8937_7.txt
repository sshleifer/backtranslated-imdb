"Plots With A View" from 2002 is a delightful little comedy as only the British could do it. The sense of humor of the film is both mildly morbid and black and yet very kind and sometimes very awkward. It's the only film I've seen from director Nick Hurran so far, and although I do not intend to watch any of his other films yet (I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies), this one is very nice and very funny. The film takes place in a small town in Wales, where Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn) is married to the drunk and adulterous major of the city (Robert Pugh). The street man Boris (Alfred Molina) is a desperate lover of Betty since his childhood, but he has always been too shy to tell him his love. In addition to being hopelessly in love, Boris has other problems, since the eccentric American death man Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) opened a thriving business in the same funeral in the same city ... The strange spirit and The film's very British should entertain everyone with a sense of humor, and the story sometimes becomes quite weird. In addition, "Plots With A View" enjoys an exceptional distribution. Brenda Bethlyn, who has already proven herself in "Saving Grace" in 2000, plays the lead role, and she is once again very funny and very kind in her role. Alfred Molina, who plays his shy admirer, delivers a great performance as always and Robert Pugh fits perfectly into the role of Betty's sullen husband. The beautiful Naomi Watts is also great as a "secretary" of the husband, I become a bigger fan with every movie in which I see her. The biggest role, however, is played by the incomparable Christopher Walken (one of my favorite actors). Walken is brilliant as he has always been in the role of the eccentric Mortician who organizes rather unorthodox funerals. Overall, "Plots With A View" is a very entertaining little British comedy that I highly recommend!
