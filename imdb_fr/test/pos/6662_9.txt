Anthony Minghela's Cold Mountain (Screenwriter / Director) is a carefully constructed, sensitive and intelligent drama set in the social context of Confederation during the Civil War, which deals with the politics of war in a very subtle and realistic way. Although it accurately portrays the brutality and inhumanity of this war, it also does something that many films of this period do not deal with as effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context of the interior and portrays the changes in the non-slave owners the people worked by the war. And, almost exclusively, Cold Mountain does not over generalize southerners, northerners, or anyone else. <br /> <br /> The film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a moment of boredom. It's a love story, a story of war, an action fiction, an adventure and a historical fiction perfectly integrated in this story. <br /> <br /> The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are fond of each other for very simple reasons. As this young novel begins to emerge, Inman engages in the Confederate army, taking with him a book that Ada gave him and a picture of her. The character of Ada is one of the brightest aspects of the film, which is important because the viewer sees this film from the point of view of the third person, but the story is clearly his from the beginning to the end. Ada is a smart southern belle and the daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as Daddy's daughter, mastering many arts that Southern women surrounded by servants had to learn most of their lives. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she perfectly masters all that is useless. <br /> <br /> Ada's father dies and she has to manage her modest estate herself. Having no experience of this kind, she struggles and survives with the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the scene as a tough young woman brought up by a drunk and careless father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities that Ada lacks and, becoming inseparable business partners, they learn to love each other as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but looks like a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends being killed for causes in which they do not really believe and decides to desert. No one he meets comes to his rescue as he takes a thousand-mile walk to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he encounters die. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place during Inman's long walk, as a result of which both protagonists live, learn, grow and change. An act of will continually born of despair preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure despair. For Ada, it's about the same thing, but also a symbol and remnants of the old South, a world that passes quickly. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful Appalachian landscape shots that give the film a keen sense of history. The script and writing are also extremely powerful - highlighting the expanded class and educational differences reflected in the southern middle ante bellum dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing less than perfection should be expected. And the casting, most of the time, shows up. My only criticism, however, concerns the accents adopted by the characters of Kidman and Law. An Australian and a Brit should not be expected to faithfully reproduce the Southern US discourse, but there are some occasions when these two exceptionally talented actors produce distracting vocal glitches. I admit my hypersensitivity to this and I can say with some assurance that it will not bother most people. The performance of Zellweger is exceptional and it creates a character that I will remember in my senescence. <br /> <br /> Very strongly recommended.
