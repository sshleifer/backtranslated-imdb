"Tipping The Velvet" is one of the modern television productions that proves that some TVs can be as good or even better (than these), compared to what you see in your local theater. <br /> <br /> If you want to read the graph, read it and if you want more details, go on to the next paragraph. This is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional girl named Nan, naive until she discovers her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty who dresses man for his stage craft. The girl quickly joins the act as another male imitator and is a great success. Soon, they are both embarking on a tender affair. Kitty ends up wrapping herself in a marriage of convenience and ravages the heart of the young Nan. From then on, Nan introduces herself as a prostitute like men who seek to have sex with boys, then she becomes the sex slave deprived of the diabolical and sadomasochistic Diana, where she undergoes severe emotional abuse. When that ends badly, Nan is back in the streets where she remembers a young woman named Florence; a heart-loving socialist who had the potential to be a great partner. This is where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn to make itself known. <br /> <br /> The transfer of Region 1 is of exceptional image quality. Here you will find a very good selection of scenes, an eloquent photo gallery and a funny interview between the novelist Sara Waters and the writer of the film Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> The sets, the costumes, the cinematography and the music are magnificent. The acting, the writing and the staging are extremely strong and imbued with realism, class and originality. I loved the movie and the novel. Section III of the film is very different in the film than in the novel, because section III of the novel is very well written, but does not contain any material on screen. I will be brave and say that I like the interpretation of movies much more. <br /> <br /> This breathtaking story ingeniously combines theater, comedy, eroticism and romance with vibrant perfection in a deeply moving and spiritually uplifting way. For every mature and open-minded adult who has already experienced the pleasures, pains and power to fall in love and live life to the fullest. A revolutionary production; A must see!
