Do exactly what you expect, and then some. The first film was a step ahead of the TV show with sicker cascades airing without censorship and a rude factor that had risen. Surprisingly, Jackass Number Two is even more twisted. <br /> <br /> The waterfalls have become more dangerous and spectacular, with some breath-taking puffs sprinkled with good fun sketches to turn this smile into a loop of disgust. Knoxville, as always, dominates the process, but this time, he is right to put himself in the center of the stage as he volunteers for the most dangerous and stupid of all the stunts, Bam Magera being as crazy than ever, although his image was toned down in "Viva La Bam". Surprisingly, the infamous Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to participate in less skits, even though they were at the center of previous outings. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez, then you will not miss this movie and laugh at your guts for 100 minutes of its duration. If you consider it childish, disgusting or a sad snapshot of today's youth culture, you will find it as offensive as ever. So f ** k off.
