Worth the admission price for the Rock-off alone !! All D fans will like this movie (though it's quite short) and the John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (almost recognizable) cameos prove that the D is pretty hard for anyone. Same Dio ... The sasquatch / mushroom scene will become an instant classic (I do not want to say more and be accused of putting spoilers here). Fans of the original HBO series will see some early signs of the first appearance on the D screen in characters such as Lee and the open mic host. I only wish they played some of the songs from the first album and the omission of "The government is completely nil" from the POD album is also a shame. Other than this film rocking. Obey D!
