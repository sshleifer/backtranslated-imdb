Why did Ramón (Carlos Fuentes) bring his five schoolmates to an abandoned and sinister school building that once served the children of wealth, black sheep? This answer may well be in a diary in his possession that was written by his dying father. What puts them in contact is actually a resuscitated episode involving another group of six people. Five of them have probably had a tragic fate in the hands of a sadistic security officer (Paul Naschy) 20 years ago. But as they search for a way out of this place, terror awaits them as this horrible group recurs as the group runs away, often in panicky states, while the murderer begins to freak out. to hunt and destroy them in various ways. Will Ramón and his friends survive this night of horror or will they become ghosts who will repeat the same night forever as their predecessors? <br /> <br /> The elegant Spanish slasher has this professional chandelier and this shocking and powerful violence. Some spiritual exchanges between characters ... mixed in their dialogue are references of pop culture to American horror movies that could disturb some viewers. A demented Naschy is really fierce with children, because he attacks them cheerfully ... a bloodthirsty maniac who performs his violent acts with taste. I found the musical cues a little awkward and the filmmakers often use backtracks of previous events in the film as reminders to the audience. I do not think these tips are necessarily necessary, but I thought the director wanted to communicate deeply with the viewer, hence the use of signals and backtracking. A minor deviation for the plot of this film continues to advance and the camera follows the rhythm of the characters and their reaction to the chaotic situation presented to them. Your enjoyment of this film may ultimately result from your acceptance of the supernatural paranormal aspects of the plot. Moments in time revive and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave. The twist seems a little shocking and abrupt, but it could (or may not be) work because of the way the story is played out about why Ramon's father is represented among those ghosts who reconstruct these frightful events two decades ago. I would say that this film probably would not hold if we scrutinized it in detail, but as a slasher movie, it's a breath of fresh air.
