I found this movie on one of my old videos, after "Godzilla against the sea monster" (which should immediately give you an idea of ​​his tone) and I had not seen it for a long time, so I decided to watch it. I did not remember much about Rainbow Brite, except that I loved the cartoon and that it was cute. Most people feel this for her. You probably do it. <br /> <br /> When the film started, I wondered if it was the right one! It did not fit Rainbow Brite's mold, as I remembered her. But it turns out that it hits the buttocks! This must be the strangest animated movie ever! I can not believe that these characters were so popular (the show is not very different) when they were so weird. As soon as I watched this movie, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I really do not want to say too much. Just know that if you see the movie in the video store, rent it and watch it. No questions asked. You will have a kick. Especially the scandalous princess character. And the robotic horse. And hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you can not know it, it's a cartoon from the 80s that is really a movie "to the head" undiscovered and disguised! Enjoy!
