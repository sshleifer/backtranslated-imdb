In the middle of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues to realize it, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is a captivating drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of the word, where a sympathetic but unconscious narrator unintentionally privileges the public. The story thus has a double weave, the history of the documentary and the history of the documentary director. <br /> <br /> We admire the filmmaker, and not only for having pursued his story stubbornly, even if it puts him at risk. the relationship of his parents, but also to never give in to sensationalism or melodrama. Although the details of Hollywood are in the details, Doug Block treats the story in the same way as his daily life. For those of us who have always speculated about their parents' lives before we arrived (or after we arrived, but although we were too engrossed in ourselves to notice that they had a life independent of ourselves) 51 Birch Street warns us: There are wonderful things in the homeland, but beware if you choose to enter. <br /> <br /> But this caution is the caution of the public to walk slowly in the details of his parents' past. This is not a warning for those who are offered a glimpse of the life of Block's parents. The film is a marvel of making the mother alive as a vibrant, passionate yet introspective person who makes her own conscious decisions in the 1950s. The success of the filmmaker is to ensure that viewers actually see the young woman behind the parent and the elderly grandparent. We all know that our parents were once young and vigorous, but at 51 Birch Street the mother is. The father, who was away while the filmmaker and his sister grew up, remained distant in the film, but this is due more to its elusive nature than to its portrait. This biography became autobiography is dramatic, intense and unforgettable. Spectators will rush to take a closer look at their own family albums, but will be more reluctant to look at the back of these photographs.
