This British film version of the play I AM A CAMERA is based on Christopher Isherwood's "Berlin Stories". It is the source material of the famous musical CABARET. <br /> <br /> Julie Harris, a major actress of her time, returns to her role as Sally Bowles, winner of a Tony Award in 1951. She is far from the character of Liza Minnelli, but the base "Sally" is there despite the different movie codes that would have prevented the filming of this story in Hollywood. Harris may be a trainee, but she is also very good as mad and exasperating Sally. Her singing number is obviously nicknamed (by Marlene Dietrich not less) although Harris is apparently singing for herself at other times. <br /> <br /> Laurence Harvey (with very ugly hair) plays Isherwood with zero charm and can not even make the character interesting. Shelley Winters does little with the role of Natalia (Marian Winters won Tony's support for the play) and Anton Diffring is OK as Fritz. Ron Randell plays the Clive caddy but seems a bit strong. Lee Seidl is funny as an owner. <br /> <br /> However, despite its unpromising nature and its economic aspect, Harris is at the center of the stage and is incredible. This film was released the same year as EAST OF EDEN in which Harris gives a commendable performance like Abra. The comparison of the two performances gives a good overview of Miss Harris's talent. These two characters could not be more different. Sally, Harris, swallows and walks around and utters a very lascivious laugh. She also plays circles around the boring Harvey. <br /> <br /> Without the music and a familiar scenario, many viewers may find little value here to recommend this film, but it's a great opportunity to see the great Julie Harris was probably a very important role. shocking in 1951.
