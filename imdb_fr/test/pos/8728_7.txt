Anyone who has ever doubted Ingrid Bergman's ability to play comedy can only watch "The Bells of St. Mary". OK, so it's a nun with TB who is probably in love with p. O'Malley, (think what Luis Bunuel could have done with this), but she also showed a sense of extremely sneaky fun that made you want the directors to have thrown it more often into comedies. In "Cactus Flower", she is a dentist dentist (Walter Matthau is the dentist), in love with her boss, but keeping it well closed. When she is forced to act as her "wife" to deceive her mistress, (does not ask for it), she goes wild and the buttons appear. And she is a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a more robust translation than the usual on-screen Broadway hit (you can see it's three acts). It's a French farce (it was originally, it is extracted from the play Fleur de Cactas by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Gredy) and it hits all the spots. Matthau uses wonderfully his formidable expression mouth. A blonde newcomer, as she was then called Goldie Hawn, almost steals the film like a dazed mistress who decides to give up her meal ticket because she feels sorry for "the woman". even if 'the woman' has a balloon. Hawn made such an impression in the role she stole was the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
