And what is his gender? Behind the scenes tell the story; what does the theatrical life behind these Broadway curtains (and others) really look like? There is certainly a lot of competition: Sing in the rain, both I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers of (You call the year.); Ladies of 1934; Noises Off (1992) on the farce side and Une étoile is born I and II from the 1930s and 1950s on the tragic side: not to mention Summer Stock from 1950: the list continues to roll. So, what makes this film so special? And why are there so few comments on this incredibly good movie? So few people have actually seen it? How wonderful to see a young Frank Langella pre-Dracula and pre-Frost-Nixon 30 years old! How wonderful to see the talented Tom Hulce if pre-Amadeus! And yet another superb Stiller! What a wonderful group of talented people at their best from so long ago! And such a script! Who was this David Shaber? So full of disillusionment and realistic pathos compared to the usual sentimentalism and comedy of well-being! As the Star-Is-Born episode, where the heroine travels to Broadway, is a striking example, while the character of Langella has to settle for another provincial tour. <br /> <br /> Langella's next hysterical and sadistic explosion against the star - The Latin teacher struck and his granddaughter in which he expresses his fury and frustration are just one of many fantastic moments and psychologically real film. (The Latin teacher and his love affair behind the scenes certainly echo Marlene Dietrich and his teacher seduced into The Blue Angel of 1929.) Another of the series of mercenary agents and cold-hearted like Kevin McCarthy, preceded by Burt Lancaster in The Sweet Smell of Success (1957) and succeeded by Alan Alda in Clubland (2001) in the history of the film. The sexual liberation of Hulce's character recalls similar incidents in Ah's great comedy Oh, Wilderness. <br /> <br /> And what a tribute to the operettas that disappeared a long time ago: Victor Herbert's Moulin Rouge; Rose Marie and the vagabond king of Rudolf Friml; The song of the desert of Sigmund Romberg, etc. What satirical insertions of great pieces plays like Romeo and Juliet. Tributes to the theater itself, as described by star Langella. The richness and depth of this film are simply endless. And be harassed by such a title! Who could have a little idea of ​​what this movie is about a title so ridiculous and so insidious? But on the other hand, what title could have been attributed to such a magnificent drama that could have lived up to its emotional and emotional content? <br /> <br /> PS: I just saw (2009) Frank Langella in his last acting dramatically: like Richard Nixon in Frost-Nixon. How does this great actor after 30 years go from triumph to triumph!
