Perhaps one of the best movies ever made. The friendship between Orry and Goerge is deep and the war puts a strain on their strong friendship. As a Southerner, I can honestly say that this epic is as accurate as possible. Brothers fighting brothers. Can you imagine what life had to live at that time? The best part of the film, for me, was when the South surrendered; General Grant urges President Lincoln to stick to the South. He said, "Mr. President, a lot of people want the south to bleed for what they did ..." A very tired voice said, "The South blew enough ... and so do we ..." I burst into tears and took a deep breath. Which president! It's like a father who says his son has been punished enough and, despite his anger, he realizes that his point has been explained. This war was a very dark time for our young country and we had to lead it. President Lincoln knew it. I urge anyone reading this to watch this movie and add it to your DVD collection. Then, thank God, our country has been preserved. As Jesus said, "a house divided against itself can not stand."
