I'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of Mr. Ozon. So far, I have only seen four films and, with the last of the series, it seemed to me that they all focused on single women and their actions. Not one lonely female character out of 12, and all have a significant impact on the environment. <br /> <br /> This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is sustainable. The gay theme is an almost standard part of the background of Ozon movies, so it does not capture the accent (although the appearance of the characters can be). Watch for feelings, not for their objects. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant and fleeting, really like a summer romance, and while being a rest for thought and spirit, it gives food for the soul.
