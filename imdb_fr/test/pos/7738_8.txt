I love this film despite the fact that it just misses being awesome. It's an adult entertainment, full of problems that an adult person can relate to. The acting is superb. It's fun to watch John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands as a middle-aged quarrelsome couple. Who knows how much that comes from their own marriage? Susan Sarandon has never been as sexy or as attractive as her free-wheeling character, Aretha. Raul Julia is funny as a vigorous kid. The landscape in Greece is spectacular. New York's settings are hurting me because of the many pictures from the World Trade Center. Fantastic score of Stomu Yamashta. With so much to do, why is not it a good movie? It is a little disconnected and too long, vague and unbalanced uncomfortably between humor and drama. It's still engaging, entertaining and deeply thoughtful.
