I watched this film in a Singapore theater yesterday (February 4, 2006) and left with a better understanding of the situation of patients with schizophrenia and their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Ms. Aparna Sen is to be commended for not only addressing a difficult subject, but also for treating people with mental health issues with a deep understanding of their situation, which is necessary to help them cope. to the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and turmoil in their minds. <br /> <br /> We had Hollywood movies on this subject, such as "We flew over the cuckoo's nest" where Jack Nicholson took the honors. Since then, research has helped to better understand the problem and dispel some misconceptions about treatment. In "... cuckoo's nest", for example, shock therapy was portrayed as barbaric, but in "15 ...", it was pointed out that it was not as bad as what was said . <BR /> <br /> The other misconception is that abuse during childhood is a cause of schizophrenia. But researchers such as Dr. E. Fuller Torrey have pointed out that studies have shown that childhood schizophrenia is a disease of the brain and that it has genetic roots. <br /> <br /> It is now established that schizophrenia can be treated as any clinical illness and its advancement can be checked if detected early. Even at a fairly advanced stage, medications and regular counseling can be effective. <br /> <br /> Ms. Sen's same understanding is evident in the way actors play their roles. In keeping with the gravity of the theme, the acting is controlled by Mrs. Konkana Sen-Sharma's suggestive silences and her eyes reflect the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind speaking louder than some of the speeches we are used to making. in most movies included characters with a mental challenge. <br /> <br /> Like me, most theatergoers seemed confused at the abrupt end. There are still a lot of questions in terms of intrigue. <br /> <br /> Is Meethi's search complete? Why is it not found in # 15? Did the children really play when Meethi walked through the doors with her shining eyes of gratitude? Can anyone solve this puzzle?
