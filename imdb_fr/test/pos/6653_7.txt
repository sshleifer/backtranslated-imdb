Watching "Cold Mountain" gave me the impression that his director, Anthony Minghella, was deliberately trying to outdo himself and that his own movie "he was trying to beat" was practically flawless "The English Patient" of 1996. Comparison of two films, the premise is quite similar. We have a fascinating love story between two people who are going through a period of turbulent warfare and end up treating the war more or less like a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves in the arms of one of the other. The main difference between the plot is that the character of Nicole Kidman is not married, that of Jude Law is a deserter and that the conflict is that of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> Cold Mountain is, so to speak, more diluted and darker. softer than saying "The English Patient" and it's more for people who want a simple love affair with a kind of outside turbulence that is a problem. It's a shorter film, which is an advantage for the less courageous. However, it's not as spectacular, original, or truly captivating as The English Patient. My * only * big rebuke I would do about "Cold Mountain" is, surprisingly, the love affair between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Surprisingly, their love was the least interesting thing about the photo. They have no real relationship; we do not feel any real passion for them and the passion we see is more physical than emotional. I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellwegger, an Oscar winner, and by Jude Law's travels across the country, avoiding militias and enemy soldiers. If Minghella had reinforced the importance of the love story, he would have had, I think, a better image. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is entertaining, even if the love story is uninteresting. The sequences of the Civil War are absolutely fantastic; they belong to the modern tradition which shows that the war is horrible and dehumanizing. The reconstruction of the Petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives exploded in the basement, followed by a hand-to-hand battle is horrible. Minghella does not hesitate to show blood and blood artistically and sensibly, and he is not afraid to show victims of innocence and life in these scenes. There are times when women and men are killed, often by crossfire. And there is more than that. The sound design of the film generates a tension. There is a scene where Inman and another deserter prepare a meal by sawing the head of a dead cow. We do not see the cutting, but the sound effects of the blade crossing the bone are disgusting. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to congratulate the cast for the performances. Jude Law was great in the film and deserved the Academy Award nomination he received. I think Nicole Kidman also deserved one, even if her character was a bit superficial. Renee Zellwegger had the most personality and a flying atmosphere to the screens. And then, there are just a few elements that really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in the American past. <br /> <br /> Maybe "Cold Mountain" would have been better as a picture of war, but certainly It would have been spectacular like "The English Patient" if his love story had been turned on and made more passionate about screenwriters and director Anthony Minghella. In the current state of things, it is a photo of the most pleasant; she did not bother me and I recommend it. I just said that her love story - even if it was a central part of the plot - is a little softer than she needs to be and that all that surround is what really worked.
