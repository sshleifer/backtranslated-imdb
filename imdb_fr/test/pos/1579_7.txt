GUTS OF A BEAUTY is a bit better than its predecessor GUTS OF A VIRGIN. Although this movie is not really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment, I found BEAUTY a little stronger and better assembled all around than VIRGIN ... but then again, it does not say much. <br /> <br /> BEAUTY begins as a rather crude and straight-faced exploit film. A couple of cats Yakuza holds a young woman prisoner and begins to brutally rape her in a group. While this malice continues, the manager tells the girl that she did the same with her sister and sold her as a slave in Africa, and that they will do the same to her. They then shoot her with drugs and beat her again. She gets away and finds herself in a clinic where the nurse listens to her stories of sobs. The rape ends up panicking under the stress of her past experience and commits suicide. The clinic worker, moved by the story of the young woman, decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the subordinate types and trying to hypnotize him to kill the Yakuza leaders. All this plan turns against her, so now, Ms. Vigilante-Clinic-Worker is exposed to about the same treatment as our original rape - much worse (a nice brutal rape occurs alongside the gang rape required ...) . She too is drugged, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly unhappy victim ----- she turns it into a raging Hermaphrodite BLACK DEMON !!! (That's what's really happening, it's true!) Then BEAUTY takes off with pretty scenes of senseless killings, including a very chic chest rap that looks like a cross between ALIEN and a bad porn, and my favorite - a swallowed head-by-demon-vagina (complete with vagina-slime demon ...) that must be seen to be believed ... <br /> <br /> Certainly some promising This happens in the Guets of a BEAUTY, but the feeling is still very disjointed. BEAUTY almost feels compelled to coerce two different films. I still have to give credit to the film: the scenes of rape are very rough and misogynous, and scenes of killing are simply out of the ordinary. A solid 7/10 for another "classic" crazy J-horror.
