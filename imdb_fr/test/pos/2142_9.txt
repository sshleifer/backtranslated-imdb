I was expecting this movie to be a stink but I wanted to see for myself, but I was surprised at how good this movie was. I know that long films often do not do well at the box office, but I do not understand why it was shot and not watched by the public. This has kept my interest alive and the landscape and photography are breathtaking at times. The plot was good and the game of morality was good. I liked the realism that went in the direction of "Unforgiven". I had to rent this movie to see it but it was well worth it.
