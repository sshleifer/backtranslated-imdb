Batman Returns is a very dark movie that shows the Caped Crusader fighting against the Penguin and the sexy Catwoman (I'll discuss them later). Michael Keaton plays the role of Bruce Wayne, showing that he is a good actor. Tim BUrton directs this picture well and the locations of the film are impressive. The bad guys: Danny deVito is threatening like the penguin. A cruel but disturbed man, who had a very hard childhood. But Michelle Pfeiffer steals the photo. She is the best Catwoman ever! She is menacing and extremely sexy. There is a scene where she kisses Batman like a cat that warms up the movie. The action scenes are good too, and the ending is dramatic and tragic, probably the best end of a Batman movie. Tim Burton shows that he can very well handle a Batman movie (he has already demonstrated it with the first Batman) and also gives him a darker nature. So much like him.
