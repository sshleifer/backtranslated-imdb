With its new version by ADV Films, I had the opportunity to watch "The Giant Majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and cruel words of a late-night Horror Chiller Theaters. Guess what? It's a damn good movie! <br /> <br /> The sets are authentic, the acting is discrete and credible, and Majin the giant is majestic, powerful and unstoppable. I loved the subtle fantastic touches (the enchanted wood, the lucky charm, etc.) and the god's potrayal a little less than "good". <br /> <br /> This film calls for a remake in the new century!
