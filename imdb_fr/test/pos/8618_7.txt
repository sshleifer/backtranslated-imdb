Catherine Brreillat is a French director who likes to provoke her audience. She takes us to see how a film is made on the spot. The film in production seems to be based on itself, since the person at the center of the story is Jeanne, a director, in the manner of Mrs. Breillat. Jeanne acts as an alter ego of the real director. <br /> <br /> Jeanne ends in a dead end at the beginning of the shoot. Not only did she choose the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold snap, as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with the two main actors, especially with the main male role who has trouble accepting the way the director decided to show it in the film; the main actress is not an angel either. <br /> <br /> The making of a film, Mrs. Breillat tells us, is a unique process in a creative work of art. There is first the writing period during which Jeanne, in this case, wrote a play, in which, during the production, reveals problems that the author / director has not thought. There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a scene of love in which the young woman of the story has her first sexual contact. What seemed smart in the written page does not necessarily translate into easy time in front of the camera. The actor is forced to wear a fake penis and has great difficulty in accepting the fact that a make-up must touch him in such a way that he never thought he would one day be touched by another man. <br /> <br /> The light Anne Parillaud is wonderful as director, Jeanne. She comments on the production, the actors and the team that fit well into the story told. Gr√©goire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the main actors, with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a film set. Jeanne has to massage their ego to get what she wants in the end. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. <br /> <br /> "Sex Is Comedy" allows Mrs. Breillet to give us her own vision of films in general. Here is an overview of how the films are made in a typical Breillat style.
