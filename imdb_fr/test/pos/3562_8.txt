This pleasant Euro-Western begins with a scene prior to a similar scene in which Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for "Once upon a time in the West", but failed to persuade Clint Eastwood to appear. Three hard-faced shooters go to a city. We are dressed like an unnamed man in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer of "For A Few Dollars More" and the third is dressed like Django, except that he rides a horse instead of pulling a coffin behind him with a machine gun. Our hero meets them in the main street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins. "Any Gun Can Play" is a spaghetti western with a joke about spaghetti westerns since the hero here annihilates the three killers. Aside from a little too much comedy, especially in acrobatic fight sequences, this is an avatar above average. <br /> <br /> The famous Mexican outlaw Montero (Gilbert Roland of "Barbarosa") and his band of triggers - happy pistoleros rob an army train carrying 300 000 dollars in gold coins across the border. Director Enzo G. Castellari of "Inglorious Bastards" stages the report from various camera angles that propels you to the forefront of the action. The bandits seize the locomotive with the coach carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the American cavalry. While Montero and his armed men keep the cavalry on the ground, Pajondo (Pedro Sanchez of "Sabata") takes the locomotive, kills the engineer and his crew and drags him, leaving the other pistoleros behind them to defend themselves. Essentially, Pajondo doubles Montero and steals gold for himself. Later, Montero catches Pajondo at the Rio Grande. Before the villain could reveal where the booty was in Montero, a cavalry sergeant killed Pajondo. Before dying, Pajondo informs Montero of a medallion that allows him to know where he has hidden the treasure. The angry cavalry captain (Ivano Staccioli of "Commandos") imprisons Montero, but he can not loosen the bandit's tongue even after using his whip on him. Furious at Montero's reluctance, the captain threatens Mexico if he does not speak. Meanwhile, the jailers let a priest speak in Montero, but he's really not a priest. Stranger (George Hilton of "The Ruthless Four"), six guns, pretends to be a man in disguise and rescues Montero from a firing squad. Unfortunately, before Montero's rescue, Clayton (Edd Byrnes of "77 Sunset Strip" on TV) takes him the medallion and keeps him for him. Clayton is the representative of the bank that was sent to save the gold. He is horrified that the captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's career at the bank depends on his ability to recover gold. The stranger lights a fire at the fort to distract the firing squad and Montero takes the captain hostage and tries to escape, but the stranger pulls him off the horse. Before the authorities can verify that Montero is dead, the stranger claims the body of the fine reward he will receive and he leaves with the graceful thanks of the captain. No sooner have they left the fort than the men of Montero present themselves to save him from abroad. From that moment, Stranger, Montero and Clayton make ephemeral alliances in their quest for gold. Castellari and screenwriter Tito Carpi, who has written a number of spaghetti westerns such as "A few dollars for Django" and another Castellari after "Seven Winchesters for a Massacre", rely on intelligent humor and surprise twists to keep fresh and fast action. rhythm. In a cool scene, Clayton is sitting at a table about to eat his meal when he hears suspicious noises behind him. Clayton pours his glass on the table and sees the armed men behind him with six sealed guns. <br /> <br /> "Any Gun Can Play" lives up to its title. In fact, many firearms play, and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before fading. This western is not so much a parody, it's a replica of "The good, the bad and the ugly" Sergio Leone. Mind you, villains and good guys fall as often as ten pins into a bowling alley, but their death is not described in the brutal manner of a Leone western. "Any Gun Can Play" does not take itself as seriously as the aforementioned Leone masterpiece. The three leaders are fighting for supremacy. Everyone has a piece of the puzzle that will take them to the treasure, but they refuse to share their information until the final shoot'em up. The colorful large-screen photography of Lenser Giovanni Bergamini is spectacular, especially the foregrounds of the train lying along the railroad tracks with the distant mountain peaks rising dramatically in the background. Another good move comes when Montero tests the unflappable calm of Stranger. This scene occurs once the stranger has saved Montero and the Mexican henchmen arrive to save the lard from their leader. Confiscating the six weapons of the unknown, Montero targets the tough guy and dumps the revolver, placing his well-focused bullets safely in and around the ruthless bandit. Bergamini, who photographed Castellari's "Inglorious Bastards" thriller during the Second World War, frames the scene with the stranger in the background and his gun in Montero's hand in the foreground for a superb shot in the background. three dimensions. Meanwhile, Francesco De Masi's animated orchestral soundtrack is as memorable for his own idiosyncratic melodies as Ennio Morricone's for the Leone westerns. The opening song recalls 1950s Hollywood westerns with catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. Although not a major spaghetti western, "Any Gun Can Play" is always an entertaining nonsense with interesting twists and good performances, especially the tireless Gilbert Roland who was 62 years old at the time!
