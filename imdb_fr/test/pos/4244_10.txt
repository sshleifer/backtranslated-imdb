"Bride of Chucky" is one of the best horror movies of the last ten years and could be one of the best horror movies of the 90s. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** < Chucky's girlfriend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) manages to find his remains after being sucked by the fan at the end of Part 3 and gives life in his trailer park. Her neighbor, Jessie (Nick Stabile) and girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are tormented by her uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany upsets Chucky when he refuses to marry her, so she buys him a doll. Chucky kills Tiffany, then transfers her soul to the doll she got. To be placed in human bodies, they must travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet. Jessie sees an opportunity to escape from Ritter and they embark on the journey, but not until Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany. Along the way, several strange incidents forced them to stop in a bed and breakfast. When several other people are killed, they call their best friend (Gordon Woolvett) to redress the situation. They convince him that neither of them are the killers, because the police have started to solve the crimes. He finds Ritter's body in a trunk at the back of the van. Thinking he was set up, he confronts them about it. Chucky and Tiffany then become real to prove that they did it, which makes Woolvett kill. The group steals a camper and arrives at the cemetery. Jessie and Jade force Chucky and Tiffany to hurt each other, giving them enough to escape. Chucky takes Jade back and forces her to get her amulet. Chucky and Tiffany resume their enmity, leaving Jessie and Jade time to kill them both when the police arrive and eliminate them from crime. <br /> <br /> The good news: I have to give the most accessories to the FX department, such as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls, seem quite convincing. The scenes that accompany them are the highlights of the film, including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany advises Chucky about how serial killers work in the '90s. That being said, the amount of unique characters in this movie that are actually fun is incredible. Chucky makes the most of it, but Tiffany discovers some gems. It's actually funnier than what Hollywood calls comedies nowadays. The gore is abundant and shocking of realism. Many deaths in this film are really original and creative. Transforming Ritter into a new Pinhead shape was a totally brilliant scene. The honeymoon couple was also a beautiful death scene. For the sake of teenage girls, the Stabile and Heigl association works very well. They have excellent chemistry together and really behave like a normal couple. I must also admit that the first time I saw this film, I jumped in some scenes and it shows how much the director Yu did an incredible job. He has apparently learned enough to do the same thing with "Freddy vs. Jason". He knows how to set up mounts and fallout, and here he shows great skills that have a Hong Kong-influenced look and feel. He could be the next big horror director if he continues to fill his CV with films like these. Nice soundtrack too, like "Freddy vs Jason". <br /> <br /> The bad news: for fans of cheese films, it will be a great find. However, this movie has a high cheese factor that can prevent serious horror movie fans from having fun while enjoying this movie. The movie knows it's a nerdy movie and goes into it, making a real fan inactive because of things like one-liners. It's not as bad as a movie, but you have to keep in mind that this is a lame movie, and that the staging of certain scenes adds to the movie, do not remove it. Remove yourself from this state of mind and take the opportunity to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: fans of cheese films and other "Child's Play" movies will find their happiness in this film. Take a look at those who love horror, but be aware that this is not a serious movie, that cheese is supposed to be present and that you could enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic violence, graphic language, brief nudity on a doll, spooky sex scene, drug use and numerous references to drugs.
