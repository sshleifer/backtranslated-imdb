I am slightly biased because I appear in this film, but I liked it and I'm only in seven minutes scattered and I'm not the most interesting part. The film is an honest and intriguing tale of a group of independent and noble filmmakers who are trying to make an adorable film. It is also a record of excessive expectations and fallen heroes. The interviews are well connected in the edition. The different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of a person. In addition, the interviews are shot in a rather interesting way, which makes the film visually satisfying. Certainly an interesting movie. I hope it circulates.
