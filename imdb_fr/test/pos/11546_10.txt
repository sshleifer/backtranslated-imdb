When I watched this movie for the first time, I thought it was a very strange movie. But I know that the director almost always has a goal when he makes a movie. So I decided to watch it again. The second time I watched it, I realized that Albert Puyn was a very talented and very original filmmaker. At first, the viewer had learned that the film had taken place a decade after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But they had clothes and cars with a typical 1950s design. They had plutonium, which I think is a symbol of futuristic trade. I think that means that the actual movie time is not specified. The music of the film creates a long video clip that tells some parts of the story contained in the lyrics, especially for the intro and the end. <br /> <br /> Albert Puyn uses a red and blue background color when he shows the symbols of communism (red) and capitalism and the western world (blue). We can notice that Ice-T is called Mao (communism) and that, when it is clean, the background color is red. The American cop, with Burt Reynolds, is still filmed in blue. The club where Mao and his gang hang out is also with the red background color. Crazy six is ​​between red and blue. <br /> <br /> The little white dog that Mao had at the beginning symbolizes, I think, the force that controls him. Mao had the dog at first but the cop took it in the end. This symbolizes, I suppose, the fall of communism and the replacement of the capitalist thought of the Western world in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think Crazy Six is ​​a very well done movie. Albert Puyn creates a sci-fi / action movie of political depth. It's a different but very special film about the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see another spectacular film by Albert Puyn.
