I went to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York and I really loved the movie !!! I'm the biggest fan of Diane and of course, as always, she gave a magnificent performance !! I have seen each of his films and I must say that this is one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and moving and took my breath away. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly funny but also serious. Anton Yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and gave an incredible performance. Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who can enjoy a great movie. 10 bravo !!! I would definitely go see him again and again and again. It's the best movie of the year so far !!!
