That's what porn was, it's a real classic. I mean, it's a x-rated musical based on a real book! There is a real plot and how many x-rated movies can boast these days? This is part of an exclusive restricted list of true pornographic film classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with "pornographic movies" nowadays is that it's "pornographic" and not "movie". Alice in Wonderland has graphic depictions of sex, of course, but tells a story at the same time. Not one of the typical intrigues "Oh, sir, do not write me a ticket", it goes even further and makes it a musical! Fabulous! If you want to see an example of "good" porn, it's one of the best.
