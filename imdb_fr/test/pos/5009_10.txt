I say, remember where and when you saw this show because I believe that if Fox gives a chance to Talk Show, Spike will be with him with Conan in a few years because, like him, he is incredibly funny and seems to be very grateful to have his own show. which adds to the humor. <br /> <br /> The funniest things Spike has had so far are The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners, and if you're not very high and CFS tells you what it says about you. <br /> <br /> In short, this show is funnier in 25 minutes than SNL in one hour. Let's hope the Talk Show gets the attention it deserves, like an extra half hour, more money and a group.
