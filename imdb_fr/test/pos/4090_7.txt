I saw the movie Lost Horizons of 1973 and read many reviews of this movie. I recognize that the movement offered many opportunities for improvement, but unlike anyone looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a little different and this film tells me has offered. I watched this film not as a critic, but as a person looking for some hope, a little encouragement, a bit of hindsight in my daily life, and I had. You can criticize singing and dialogue, but that's not what I'm looking for when I go to the movies. I'm looking for a little relaxation in my daily life, a little time where I can sit and imagine a better life, where people love others and help others. It's too bad that we can not appreciate a movie for what it tells us and stop choosing it as an English teacher reading a fifth-grade dissertation. It may sound very simplistic, but really, would not it be nice?
