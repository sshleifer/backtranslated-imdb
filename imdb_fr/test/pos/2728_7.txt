As everyone knows now, 15 Park Avenue is the story of a schizophrenic girl and her half-sister. <br /> <br /> The manifestation of schizophrenia is still perceived as a disease that we say is often at risk of disappearing if ignored. There are also those who, as furious as it may seem when shown in the film, think that the illness manifests itself as a result of some kind of supernatural influence. I think Ms. Sen deserves a lot of praise for "15 Park Avenue". She has played well, not only with the general public, but also with people with schizophrenics: parents, social workers, psychoanalysts. The film actually helps dispel many myths and misconceptions about the exact nature of this psychological disorder. I am told that the film is largely based on his personal experiences with a person very close to her, who is suffering from this mental affliction. In this sense, I am sure that none of the achievements presented is excessive ... on the contrary, it is a faithful representation of the facts. <br /> <br /> The performances are good, the all, as one would expect. Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi and of course Rahul Bose are really very good. They appear as very "real" characters ... sufficiently credible to be able to identify with them at times. People can think me terribly queer, but I think there are times when we can identify with Meethi too! I guess we all have a trail of "craziness" in us ... maybe some more than others. These are the people who are distinguished. After all, do not we all have our fantasies and our secret dreams? Impossible, sometimes? Would we be called "off-foot" if people could get a glimpse of these points of our mind? Could a person with low self-esteem be considered schizophrenic because he or she avoids the business ... preferring instead to live in his or her own world because it is the only space with a sense of security ? <Br /> <br /> Konkona, like Meethi, is remarkable !! Her performance is so easy ... she lives her share. She has demonstrated her ability to lull the audience to sleep, forgetting the gulf that separates reality from acting! A typical example is the part where she is afflicted during the arrest of Saddam Hussein on the scene of the television. Her reaction seems so uninhibited and intense ... as if she was really heartbroken by this tragedy! His Indian English brand is also spontaneous and natural. <br /> <br /> However, we can not say the same for at least some other actors. Kanwaljeet and Waheeda Rehman, two remarkable actors, seem uncomfortable when presenting their dialogue in English. Their diction is less than perfect ... sterile and affected, the fact that they make a supreme effort, becomes more than apparent. Their dialogue is discordant and tends to break the fluid flow of the story. <br /> <br /> The brutal rape of Meethi (Konkona) seems somewhat useless. I think any other incident would have been enough as well. The point here is that something triggers the extreme manifestation of the disease. As the psychiatrist explains, it can not be said, with a minimum of conviction or certainty, that the rape incident was instrumental in highlighting the hitherto latent propensity to schizophrenia. So why are we subject to the scene where Meethi lies bleeding and unconscious. Did Sen try to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country, where the voice of the masses is silenced by a handful of people who use violence to stay in power? If this is the case, the rape scene is justified, but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film. <br /> <br /> The end seems a bit steep. Is the public supposed to find a solution? Where does Meethi go? Does Mrs. Sen want us to feel that what the psychiatrist says about the most real and therefore most credible reality is true? In other words, is she trying to say that we are not biased in judging who is on this side of the dividing line between mental health and madness? I am not very sure. <br /> <br /> A film that makes you think and deserves to be watched. However, IF you're the type of person who likes things tidy ... everything is cut into pieces, with a waterproof solution to every problem coming ... this movie is clearly not for you!
