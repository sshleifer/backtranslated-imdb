Although Cover Girl's plot is very fragile and tired, she serves as an anchor for Kern and Gershwin's musical numbers. After his role in Gilda, Hayworth chose to play in this musical that seems to him tailor-made. In addition to being as beautiful as ever, she also impresses with her dance. Gene Kelly, who was loaned to Columbia by MGM, compared it to the dance and the sequence in which he plays with his own shadow is well done. The secondary characters have also been interpreted competently. Personally, I did not like Cover Girl as much as the musicals that Hayworth did with Fred Astaire. However, Cover Girl remains very entertaining and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.
