This second feature, Lone Ranger, is not up to the 1956 classic but is a thin film with enough rough action and tumble and moving to perfection. The Ranger is studying a series of mysterious murders that have a sinister motive, with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more and more murders and violence generally associated with the adventures of Lone Ranger and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, whose comments are peppered in the script. The Ranger uses disguises as he can only gather clues, expose the group of outlaws and bring them to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels play the lead role in a colorful presentation showcasing the desert country and cactus of old Tucson. The score is good, but the familiar theme of William Tell Overture is set aside by interesting voices that lack the richness and beauty of the traditional Ranger theme.
