I watched this film at a special preview in Reading, Berkshire. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Michael and Rory, make friends when Rory is introduced to the retirement home where Michael already resides. Michael is stunned to find someone who can finally understand him, because until now, his brain drain made people believe that he could not communicate. <br /> <br /> Rory presents Michael with the life he misses. Rory is a courageous character who does not let his illness (muscular dystrophy) reach him. <br /> <br /> They bond and apply for an independent life, and find a beautiful apartment and an assistant and have fun they could never dream. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this movie if you are looking for "entertainment". Go see this movie if you want to see something different. <br /> <br /> The story is strong, the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that accompanies the film, the atmosphere is exhilarating. <Br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. Although if you're like me and you tend to cry, take some tissue paper because you'll need it!
