I love this movie, one of my favorites of all time. Ann Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is sweet and without problems. She thinks that praying to Saint Anne will solve all her problems with her friends. The naughty villain's subplot to get his father's property is funny and smart. His brothers are the kind of brothers a girl would like to have. Also look for "Aunt Bee" in the role of her mother, a strong Irishwoman who will not leave the house in which she raised her family. They do not do it anymore, that's for sure.
