"Thursday" is a good movie, but we recognize too much in the genre and it lacks originality. If you've seen 'Goodfellas', 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and many other movies inspired by this latest movie, you've seen almost everything since Thursday. There is a torture scene that even has the same dialogue as in Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs". <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie. Because not all parts are from the same movie, the whole thing has new ideas and pretty touches. The opening sequence to start is quite impressive. We meet Nick (Aaron Eckhart), Dallas (Paulina Porizkova) and Billy Hill (James The Fat). They argue for a coffee at a gas station with a gas station employee. It ends with the death of this employee and the arrival of a cop. We have already seen a suitcase containing a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Casey (Thomas Jane) in Houston. He is married to Christine (Paula Marshall) but previously worked with Nick. She does not know anything. Then Nick calls him and tells him he's coming. We learn that he has screwed up his friends and that the problems are about to start. <br /> <br /> What happens is not mine, but we meet other characters, all interested in the money or drugs Nick also had with him. Casey threw them into the water. <br /> <br /> Very funny moments, lots of blood, a very amusing secondary plot featuring actor Michael Jeter and some surprises (although if you really think about it, you'll see them coming) it's a good movie with great performances, beautifully directed by Skip Woods.
