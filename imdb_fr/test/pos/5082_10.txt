Rendition presents a topical subject in the form of a very tense thriller. It's a captivating film, not a preaching. To see him in an Arab country with a mix of Arab and European audiences gave him an extra atmosphere. The film was gripping by the audience and was applauded afterwards. The story of an Egyptian married to an American suspected of links with terrorist organizations and sent to a friendly Arab country (with the United States) for "thorough interrogation" (as Meryl Streep's film: torture in the United States ") seems to be on the news of the day.There is a very clear link between the different characters that appear in the film and the rhythm of the film never drops.The message of the film seems to be Jake Gyllenhal's character in the film said that by kidnapping and torturing suspects, you create many more terrorists.The acting is always excellent, with Streep and Reese Witherspoon among the protagonists .Not to be missed.
