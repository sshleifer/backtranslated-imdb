I have seen this film twice and its theme is invigorating. I have been in the computer for many years and this film inspired me from a technological point of view, just like a new love that fueled the fire of my poetic passion in the fire of envy. A very original idea, a great seduction in the way she holds you because she tells her story to spirits who need to be liberated from the daily realities of this life.
