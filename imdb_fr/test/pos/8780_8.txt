There are many familiar elements of Hitchcock (previous and next movies) and this time, they mingle with fun entertainment, but barely suspensive. You can say that Dorothy Parker had a hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of the hero Cummings with the blind man and his meeting with a rather strange group of circus people. The famous climax on the Statue of Liberty seems a bit heavy - judging by current standards, but also by the other finals of the Hitch monument (eg, Chantage, North by Northwest).
