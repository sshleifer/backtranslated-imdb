stars: Danny Devito, Billy Crystal, Anne Ramsey, Kim Griest, Kate Mulgrew, Oprah Winfrey and Rob Reiner. <br /> <br /> After class, teacher Larry (Crystal) wants the death of his ex-wife and Owen (Devito) wants his mom (Ramsey) dead. When Larry says he wants his wife, Owen knows what he has to do for him, in order to get a favor in return, so that Larry kills his mother. Devito is absolutely hilarious in this as a wannabe writer with a dead brain dreaming of poisoning his mother and sticking scissors in her head. He has a childish role that makes him look more confused than a killer. Ramesy was actually nominated for an Academy Award because of her magnificent performance as a mean-spirited Mrs. Lift. In addition to comedy, the film also has heart. A scene between Devito and Crystal apparently begins as a joke, but goes further, making me slightly sad. Danny Devito directed the film and did a good job putting the dark tone in his direction. I recommend it to all comedy fans. <br /> <br /> My note: B plus. 84 minutes PG-13 for Language, Sexuality and Violence.
