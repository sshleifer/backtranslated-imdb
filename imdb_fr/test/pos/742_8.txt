I'm not sure what intrigues me in this movie then. It's gritty, poorly written, bleached, often ridiculous and confusing in many ways (the person I was watching with fell asleep twice.) Still, there's something about this film that fascinates me, even though I do not I'm not sure what; perhaps the character of Sam, a huge former patient who was lobotimized by the former chief doctor and who perpetually sucks an ice cream), or the head doctor marvelously played (I forget his name). <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, look at it and form your own opinion; it's one of the greatest purposes I've seen in a movie.
