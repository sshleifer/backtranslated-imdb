I have to tell you that I'm a Star Trek TNG fan since I was a child. <br /> <br /> Well, I recently gave a friend episodes of DS9 and I asked him <br /> <br /> "Hey man, what are you looking at these? time because I finished watching all episodes of TNG "he says. "Well, I have these episodes of Farscape". I said, "Ok, let me try it" I was pretty sure I would not like it because I had just seen TNG and thought it was great. "<br /> <br /> I had 3 episodes viewed These, but the series did not impress me much, I found it infantile at first and I thought it was just a other TV show, pleasant but regular adventures.The actors did not completely penetrate the skin of the characters. <br /> <br /> I watched three other episodes thinking that the 3 eps were not enough to to decide whether I liked or not since, good understanding of the action and wanted to see what was happening next to poor Crichton ... the rest belongs to the story. <br /> <br /> I think that I especially like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action unlike Star Trek where everyone slept when we were supposed to do it and where there was too much bullshit in the field of high technology. br /> <br /> The series got better with every episode tory line ..... what can i say, this movie is c as poetry. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it !!!
