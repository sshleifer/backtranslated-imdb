I only saw this film once, many years ago. But I remember having loved him a lot. <br /> <br /> ** Upcoming Spoilers ** A famous old opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats. His butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so that he can have the fortune. He puts KO drops in their milk. When they wake up, they find themselves miles away. They have to go home before it's too late. With the help of an independent tomcat and other complicit animals, avoiding the butler and thwarting his plan. <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but it could have been a lot worse. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10.
