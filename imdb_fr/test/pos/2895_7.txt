The Rush-in-Rio DVD is a disc that is both convincing and disappointing. This set of two smooth discs shows Rush at their best. After 30 years of refining its unique sound, it's great to have this album from one of the most talented rock bands of all time. <br /> <br /> The concert contains more than two dozen songs, a documentary and three songs-viewing angle. Packed in a holder with a pocket and a small insert, its price is excellent for the amount of material it contains. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Rush, from the late seventies to the early eighties, and this DVD comes to the fore, half of the series featuring songs from that time. I will not list the songs, in case you want to be surprised. If you've been to the Vapor Trails tour, then you'll know what they're going to play. <br /> <br /> Playing in Rio in front of their biggest audience, Rush is a real treat for the spectators. In fact, this is one of the first things I noticed in this show. For most of this two-hour concert, you hear and see the crowd, actively singing and dancing wildly to the sound of the music. At first, it's encouraging to see fans give Rush a well-deserved answer. But after several songs, I was ready to hear and see more band and less crowd. This is by no means a slam of the Rio crowd. More power for them! This is a review of the final edition of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my second and main reason "I hate it". The video editing is terrible in my opinion. Except for the multi-angle bonus cuts, the whole show is a frenzy of visual chaos. It's as if the director wanted to see how he could succeed. I count camera angle changes, on average, every four seconds, consistently! After about three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. Which is a shame, because I would have liked to attend the whole show, as I was able to do during the concert last year. This quick edit is perhaps the latest craze for DVDs in concert, but I really think it's a hindrance and a loss of meaning for the overall experience. As mentioned before, it would not bother me for a song or two, but all the visual aspect of this disc is rushed, or RUSHed. It's really ironic, because all of Rush's previous concert clips, mostly from Moving Pictures, that I saw are strictly filmed, with few alternate passages. It's almost boring, visually. This DVD has taken to the extreme extreme. I know that many Rush fans tinted in wool will violently disagree with my statements, but that's just my impression. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: If you are a fan of Rush, you will buy this DVD regardless of my comment or any other. I would have bought anyway after reading my opinion. Do not expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the things mentioned above might not bother you.
