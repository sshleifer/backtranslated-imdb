The film begins in a club of stifling British men, full of leather men and smoking cigars. It's the world of Denistoun. A messenger delivers him a small box that he opens to find a pair of gold earrings. The site of the earrings is reminiscent of time spent in the company of gypsies. The rest of the movie is a flashback. <br /> <br /> Golden Earrings is one of my favorite since a long time and is probably the most romantic film I know. Dietrich plays against his usual type. Here, her hair is black, earthy and not at all mysterious. Instead of a femme fatale, she is a tour de force and works energetically to use all her resources to help Denistoun survive and achieve his goal. To make sure he's really a convincing gypsy, she pierces his ears and asks him to wear the golden earrings of his dead lover. With her clothes and a little fat, she turns him from a British gentleman into a wild and sexy man. <br /> <br /> When I was young, I heard the song "Golden Earrings" that is sung in the movie. I think the melody is a little hummed by Dietrich. / There is a story that gypsies know is true / That when your love wears gold earrings / It belongs to you.
