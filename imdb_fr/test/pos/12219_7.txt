What can I say? I got up this morning to turn on sci-fi and watch half of the first season and I understood everything. Strange, unusual and brilliant. It gives all its potential, and first, I said it was stupid. This must be the next best thing since X-Files, but as always, nothing will ever reduce this show in my opinion. I tell you, it's scary, then suspensive, then softened. Towards the end, you have Miles as a puppy of love with a strange animal that is a new species. You have two people fleeing from the authorities. And a deadly tsunami about to hit! Wow! And did I mention that the pet Miles is a potential killer (the rest of his species is). Surface is a brilliant show with tricks and twists that offers everything.
