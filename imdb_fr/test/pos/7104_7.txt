The "House of Dracula" really has nothing new to offer in terms of thrills, thrills or new twists on an already tired story. This film was made as a hasty sequel to the relatively better "House of Frankenstein" from the previous year. In "House of Dracula", you can see the factory, like the 1945 production values, influence a potentially scary film. Archive footage from the previous films in the series, and the end of "Ghost of Frankenstein", used here as an end, are just examples of the film "el cheepo". This is the shame of the studio and the producer, believing that they had exceptional talent and that they simply lost everyone's time and effort to a quick money return program. But this seems to have been the trend throughout Hollywood at the end of World War II. That's what brought some of these stupid SciFi images from the 50s, with all their big shots of harmless lizards, to make them look like dinosaurs. The times of James Whale and Val Lewton, to name but two, were as far as creating a real atmosphere and atmosphere in this genre. And do not forget that makeup genius Jack Pierce, who actually did medical research to create all of our favorites, was fired immediately after the release of this film. Bud Westmore, a less competent makeup artist, was then hired as head of this department at Universal, which will soon be Universal-International. Do not belittle Mr. Westmore's ability, but horror movies just were not his forte. OK, watch or not watch. Watch this film, but only in the chronological order of the Frankenstein series and you will see how it all turned into a comic film for Abbott & Costello.
