<----- Little spoilers! -----> <br /> <br /> A woman gets pregnant but not by her husband. She develops "something" in her, or at least that's what her husband thinks. They are going through a lot of difficult times as she is on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The husband contacts a UFO teacher, and with his help, they try to find out what's wrong with her. <br /> <br /> <----- Minor spoilers! ----> <br /> <br /> The story could have been a little better, or at least made less predictable, but the movie is catchy and it allowed me and my sister to be hooked through all the film without problem. The acting is very good and the shooting is much better than normal, if you compare it to your normal b-alien movie. The effects are good and something happens every second of the movie. The characters are really nice and, apart from a stupid nurse in a scene, they are all very convincing in their roles. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie and I can recommend it if you like Alien. / Movies about kidnapping monsters! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - The story could have been a little less predictable.
