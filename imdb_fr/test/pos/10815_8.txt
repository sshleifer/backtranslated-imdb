A comic book, a dramatic comedy or a frantic and fast joke, which looks like a ball-over against the implosion of France in 1939. Played with a right intensity in wide-eyed eyes, by a talented cast and an amalgam scenes of action, satire, social commentary and authentic period details, brilliant and shiny hairstyles with marked hairstyles and a fleet of Citroen "Tractions" credible imitations of Charles de Gaulle and Marshal PÃ©tain. <br /> <br /> This is simply the best entertainment recently presented on screen, without presumption and "message". If the movies were trains (and there is a creative recreation of a trip in a steam train that works well that there is no steam locomotive - an expensive accessory, no doubt), it would be a TGV.
