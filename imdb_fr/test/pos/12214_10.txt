I do not believe that sixty percent of voters voted for this show saying: 10 now, how on earth is it the five point score out of eight? in any case the show is great the story is great and the characters are interesting, certainly a ten out of ten of me I think the creatures are cool they look great and I would like to have a great show nimrod a great show awesome cgi hope there is a second series as The first season, many questions remained unanswered. When Nimrod is going to grow while the rest of the creatures is huge, why is the note still so low when the votes were so high? <br /> <br /> 10/10
