Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Almost laugh: the Monkees reduce their career to a one-minute television ad on dandruff! See: The 50-foot Victor Mature is trying to figure out what he's doing in this movie! Listen: Frank Zappa (with his cow on a leash) tells Davey Jones "Your music is terribly white"! Experience: The only live performance of the Monkees as a true rock band is the very first honest song of all time, punk-rock (Circle Sky)! Listen: Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father! Be confused: be very confused, as confused as Terri Garr when Mickey Dolenz makes sexual innuendo about her in her movie debut! Witness: the vain demonstrations against the Vietnam War jump from nowhere and disappear just as quickly! Watch: Mike Nesmith spits at Christmas while wearing a velvet victorian tuxedo jacket in a cobwebbed gothic horror movie soundtrack! Let yourself drift: in karmic happiness inspired by a comic version of Indian mysticism, delivered by a white-faced, white-faced actor, while Peter Tork claims to be playing the guitar! Discover: Academy Award-winning director Bob Rafelson's first feature film, Oscar winner Jack Nicholson! Imagine that does not happen: when the Monkees commit suicide by jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge! Take drugs - take a lot of drugs: take as many drugs as the team and the team did by making this movie! <br /> <br /> With Head, the Monkees have turned out to be the most upbeat and snobbiest artists in Hollywood history, without exception. It is disconcerting to discover that they blamed the failure of this film for bad promotion. Admittedly, the promotion was practically non-existent; but have not they recognized how angry, depressing, self-destructive? I mean, this movie is a trip - on the wrong acid - in the suicide room of a psychiatric hospital. The only film I know to be so depressing is Terry Gilliam's Brazil; and like Brazil, this film reveals why life at the end of the 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. It was not simply that Western culture suffered from a serious information overload, but the information itself was simply bad, worse, darker, and darker. In fact, it was the overload effect itself that allowed people to continue, because it allowed people to continue to distract themselves from one crisis to another - if the news from Vietnam became too difficult to bear, they could turn the chain and watch a documentary on rising unemployment rate. <br /> <br /> The "positive" answer to the reality revealed in Head is Woodstock - three days of peace and love, nudity, mud and insects, bad food and messy drink, poop, pee and bad acid and Peter Townsend almost killed Abbie Hoffman. All unfolding behind a steel fence, under the watchful eye of a real army of New York State soldiers, which means that the "freedom" of the Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song John Sebastion thought to sing while he was as tense as he could barely speak. "500,000 bastards are too stupid to get in the rain," said one of Woodstock's critics (I think it was Andy Warhol). <br /> <br /> The only good thing that happened here is Jimi Hendrix's star-spangled banner. Two years ago, the Jimi Hendrix Experience had begun its first national tour in America, as the first warm-up group for the Monkees. <br /> <br /> You see, everything is connected in one way or another. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself, you also owe it to your unborn children, to see the real 1960s, only to be found on film in this weird, miraculous and absolutely absurd tribute to the 'one of the most interesting capitalist scams of the late 20th century.
