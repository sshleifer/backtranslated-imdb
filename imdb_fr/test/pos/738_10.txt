In the 1970s, a small Texan director named S.F. Brownrigg made a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget intriguing horror movies that seem to have developed a little cult over the years. Before watching her first movie, Do not Look In The Basement, I did not know what to expect, but I really did not expect it to be the only Texas horror I thought better than the chainsaw Massacre. I do not know, it could actually be my favorite horror movie of all time. <br /> <br /> We start in an insane and isolated asylum. At first, it seems like a rather casual place to regain good mental health, since all patients are allowed to move freely, etc., as if it was their home (I guess it is) . none of them seems so dangerous, only delusional. Residents include a lover, a 700-year-old woman, a man-child, a spaz, a guy who thinks he's at war, a woman who thinks he has a baby, and a man who thinks he's a judge. One day, coming out of nowhere, the judge kills the doctor with an ax, soon after, the mother wanting to be-baby kills the nurse. Ten minutes after the beginning of the movie, and things look really ugly. Maybe the new nurse will know what to do, but maybe not. To give more would do more harm than good. It is best to dive your head first into it, knowing as little as possible. If you can appreciate honest honors towards God, without any horror, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you liked Scream, if you liked Wrong Turn, if you opt for this non-original, overproduced and overrated digital Hollywood junk, chances are you will not see the beauty of it. . Do not look in the basement, a first attempt makes the quality even more shocking. The atmosphere and the grain fit perfectly in the location and the score. Unfortunately, good old SF has used most of his good ideas on his first film, though, the next entry into his quadrilogy in Texas is a bit of a masterpiece, that is, if you like extra shabby and petty, hixploitation as someone i know. If you like Brownrigg's first two movies and you absolutely have to discover what he has to offer, check out Do not Open The Door and The House Where Hell Freel Over. Do not Look in The Basement has all that the horror needs: no stars, no budget, no digital effects, but an original story animated in an insane asylum, with a dozen of members of the cast, and a dark and subtle score, and of course, the twist. It's a real horror for the real horror fan. 10/10
