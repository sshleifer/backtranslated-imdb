Corniness Warning. As many other IMDb users already know, I'm not a nerdy, nerdy person. If you do not want to read this kind of criticism, then leave. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, you heard that from a man who laughed at the Titanic and almost broke his parents' tape in continuous rewinding of the propeller scene. <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br /> <br /> One day, I went to the movies with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star, last year in August. The boring caravans rolled until one of them left so calmly. It was for the radio. By the time I saw the trailer, it was enough for me to see this movie on the opening weekend. When this weekend arrived, Scary Movie 3 was out, too many teenagers were waiting in line this Friday night. It turns out that the movie is out of print and that these teens were so desperate to see a movie that they also went to sell Good Boy and Radio. I could not get a ticket and in the following weeks I was busy doing more important things. About 5 months later, my friend rented a radio. He let me borrow it and I looked at it in my room. I'll tell you this now, it's the ONLY film I've ever seen that made me cry EVER. When Radio's mother died, everything came out automatically. The next day, I went to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> Enough about my stupid personal story, let me tell you the movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man nicknamed Radio. Ed Harris co-stars and this film is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on a true story, Radio is a teenager who spends his life spending most of his day. He walks around with a cart to pick up everything he can and always carries a radio. He has his own collection. At the end of each day, he goes back to his mother's house. He never went to school until later in the movie. One day, the radio passes in front of the local high school while the football team is training. A football flies over the barrier and the radio picks it up and continues. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, the football coach. They meet and that's the life of the radio. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Radio and Coach Jones spend quality time together, teaching each other things. It's nice to see how the film goes to the highest joys, the lowest and to see the radio live his life. You will laugh, cry and live Radio's life with him. This film occupies a special place in my heart with Toy Story and others. It's a must for the whole family, whether by yourself or if you're just someone who wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. The radio will never be forgotten by me. Never. <br /> <br /> As the character of Ed Harris said at the end of the film: <br /> <br /> "We do not teach radio, radio teaches us." <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
