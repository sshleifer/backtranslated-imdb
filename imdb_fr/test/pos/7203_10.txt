I loved this movie, the audience I was part of loved it and the 7 year old girl who was with me loved it. We all laughed at the word games, the visual humor and the good feeling with which you left the cinema at the end. I could easily understand why this success had been so important at the box office in France. I plan to buy the DVD so I can see it again and laugh at all the fragments I missed, while I laughed so hard the first time.
