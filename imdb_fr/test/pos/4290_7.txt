Separate lies have changed my life. In fact, the questions and answers were taken into account. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS BELOW. Play only if you watch trailers or if you've seen it before: <br /> <br /> Emily Watson's character deceives Tom Wilkonson's character. My first reaction to Emily, the puppy-eyed dog, was, "It's all over, let it go, bad riddance." For some reason, he stayed around. Not pathetically. He has just listened. And tried to accept his needs. Sometimes he needed to leave. But he stayed by her side and let her live her life. But I still wanted to see it <br /> <br /> Then Julian, the screenwriter and director, talked about the movie. I'm glad he did it, because frankly I'm too much of you and I was too immature to understand the point before he broke it down for me. <br /> <br /> Tom's character liked him, and no matter how much his quest for his needs could be at odds with what he wanted, he would still love it. The relationship and the love they shared was not a lie, all of a sudden, just because she wanted to be with someone else. The fact that she wants to be with someone else did not return her as she was. When you are over fifty, there is a good chance that your love of life will never come back. So you can not be as dismissive as when you were younger. You have to try to make things work, because the alternative can be much worse. <br /> <br /> She needed what she needed, and she could not help it. He had to learn to let go if he wanted to be the man he could be. He helped her pursue her lover, even when it hurt. <br /> <br /> Something else: Julian said that the most powerful tool of a controller is guilt. <br /> <br /> Again: The most powerful instrument of a controller is guilt. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Tom released her from her burden. He felt the need to let him know that he loved her, but not to get her back. he wanted to let her know that she did not need to feel guilty or think about the relationship, just because she ended so badly. <br /> <br /> This is not my way of making a movie based on the message, rather than the performance, especially when I understand it best when it is explained by the director, but I make an exception here because I feel more mature than I would get to see the movie. > <br /> The film's performance was a beautiful British look. Rupert was slimy and revolting. Tom and Emily were their real characters, usually solid.
