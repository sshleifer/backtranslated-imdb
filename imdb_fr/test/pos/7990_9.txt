As a child, I grew up with the 60's chintzy television series (and no, I'm not that old, prisoner of war!). However, when director Tim Burton presented his original vision on the big screen, I simply gave him an immediate sparkle and I never hesitated to focus his episodes on the latest high-profile additions ("Batman Begins" and " The Dark Knight "), which I do not really like. Even if they opt for a much more serious approach and wish to further explore the psyche of Bruce Wayne / Batman ?? but in all honesty, I do not think there is so much to exploit. I wanted a crazy fun with a dark band and in the eyes, that's what Burton brought, and that's why I can watch them again and again. <br /> <br /> After seducing the audience with the "Batman" of 1989, thank you to the Gothic Artistic Direction and Jack Nicholson not to make prisoners of the Joker camped but psychotic. Burton would come back 3 years later for follow up and my favorite batman movies so far; "Batman is coming back." Camp, but well done. In what way would it be even larger, stronger, more dull and nihilistic and that would have two naughty adversaries for the price of one. Enter the grotesque penguin (with Danny DeVito standing up beautifully) and the lovely Catwoman (a Michelle Pfeiffer who fills the suit nicely) that spoils the party Gotham. Again Batman (a good looking Michael Keaton is just as laudable and looks rather awesome in this bat costume - look at the eyes) is the second violin of the bad guys, but I've always preferred this sober interpretation of Batman who gave him a sinister and dark mystique. but also a psychological complexity of wear that has never felt the need to force-feed. And Bruce Wayne's turn was also well served. The direction of Burton's illustrative atmosphere begins with its elegant Gothic style carving a universe of filtered carnival comics with a splendid range of characters and lively costumes. The moody narrative (in what is probably a little too long) is more symbolic in its progression, showing rather its stopped and extravagant scenes and its artistic direction strongly etched and covered with shades and shades. gray / blue neon lighting from a winter backdrop. The camera work, beautifully fluid, takes off and Danny Elfman's spacious and imposing score balances the balance between the game and dark touches with a very hypnotic pull. The rest of the performance may be overshadowed, but Christopher Walken is laughing at the glassy role of a double-sided businessman, Max Shreck. Pat Hingle is back, but gets very little as commissioner James Gordon and Michael Gough is charming as Alfred. Michael Murphy, Andrew Bryniarski, Vincent Schiavelli, Doug Jones and Peter Rubens also make an appearance.
