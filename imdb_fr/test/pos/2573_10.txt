This if the first film I gave 10 years. If there ever was a film that needed word of mouth to promote it, that's it. A $ 4 million box is a shame. People do not know what it is. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, this is the only reason to go see it. How many people knew that Jackson could sing, and damn well too. You hear books and movies that taunt that they are talking about salvation. After seeing this, you will never be able to forgive such a trivial use of the word. Yes, it's crisp, sexy, real at home, weird and real. Is not that the best reason to see a movie? Those who understand what I mean will not stay away from seeing this another week.
