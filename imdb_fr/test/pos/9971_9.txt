I just saw that at the Toronto International Film Festival in the beautiful Elgin Theater. I was blown away by the beautiful cinematography, the brilliant adaptation of a very delicate piece and finally, the brave performance of Al Pacino, born to play this role, perfectly balanced by such a strong performance of Jeremy Irons. . <br /> <br /> The film skilfully explores the themes of love versus loyalty, right against justice and passion against reason. Some might argue that the content is intrinsically anti-Semitic, but they should take into account the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced manner in which it is told in this adaptation.
