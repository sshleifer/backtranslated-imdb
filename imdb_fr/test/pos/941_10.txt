A fantastic movie featuring great Australian talent. Director Mark Lamprell tackled the potentially bloody topic in a humorous and refreshing way. Definitely the highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival. Sam Neill, veteran of the Australian film, was, as always, fabulous in the role of Frank's university professor and the new talent Matt Newton gave a performance that will make people say: "You know, Bert Newton, the father Matt! " Go out and see this movie !!!
