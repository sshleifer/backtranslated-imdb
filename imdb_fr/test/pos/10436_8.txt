I saw this film for the first time when I was about 12 years old. It's been one of my favorites since ... It's so perfect in all its glory, with a great soundtrack, a cheesy dialogue, and it was both hilarious and terribly sad. The first movie I really messed up in the end ... I will not spoil it for you, but it's a jerker of tears ... I just remember feeling so sad for Gary! What a band of cool characters in this movie, it's great !!! They're all so great that even the old girl that Gary does not like ... (she had a pretty little body, though). I can not believe that all the girls are going to look for Rick, he is so thrilled with his handkerchief tied around his neck !!! ha ha ha ... When you watch this movie, get ready for many sex jokes and sexually transmitted diseases (or almost). But a love story in the heart of real problems, ranging from insecurity to life-changing decisions, which makes you think and feel real sorrow for the actors. I love that movie !!! If you love Valley Girl another classic of all time, you too!
