Large companies c. Conscientious Do the right ones. We seem to attend events (both real and real) of this kind all the time and greed prevails most of the time using all the necessary (dirty) means and the truth is suppressed. At least in this film, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) understood and paid dearly. We have seen several other films of this type shot in recent years, the most memorable being "The Insider", in which Russell Crowe played the role of a tobacco industry scientist who was trying to denounce by stating that the industry added more nicotine in cigarettes make smokers dependent. There was also this journalist-protagonist angle where the journalist looks for the scoop of his dreams and the protagonist is confronted with this moral dilemma in which he must choose between justice and his livelihood and sometimes his life. Jane Fonda played reporter Kimberly Wells to perfection. She embodies a journalist who wants to search for serious information while her bosses appreciate it more as a "candid". She and her crew (the cameraman played by post-comic Michael Douglas, who is also the producer of the film) witness an accident at a nuclear power station during their visit. The cameraman Michael Douglas sneaks illegally / illegally images of this event, while it is a prohibited area to photography, and fate secretly from the station. The plant refuses to broadcast it and informs the company that owns the nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Chief Engineer Jack Godell is launching his own investigation and discovering numerous irregularities in the equipment used for the reactor. It starts all dirty politics of corruption and greed. <br /> <br /> This is a good thriller that managed to create a lot of tension in the audience until the end and the funny thing is that there was no bottom partition suggesting all scary moments. Now it's awesome and unusual in movies. The performances were all good and I like Jack Lemmon. We know him primarily for his comedic roles, but he's just as good in dramatic roles. I give this film an 8/10.
