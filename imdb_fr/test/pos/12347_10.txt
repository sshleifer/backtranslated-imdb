Meg Tilly, a well-groomed and well-educated teenager, has to spend the night in a scary mausoleum to be initiated into a high school club. The problem is a powerful medium named Raymar was buried that day, but he is not quite dead and he needs the life force of humans for his powers. <br /> <br /> An obscure horror movie offers a lot of thrills, an appealing and appealing cast and superior special effects. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> One Dark Night is rated R for violence and adult-only themes.
