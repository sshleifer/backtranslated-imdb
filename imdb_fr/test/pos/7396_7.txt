* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I do not care what we say, this movie is completely hilarious. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. The snowman is created when a condemned serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck hangs with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that allow Human DNA to bind to the earth or, in this case, to the snow. The first film was just boring, and finally the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze. <br /> <br /> Or, they thought. <br /> <br /> This film takes place about a year after the second one. Some scientists resuscitate Jack Frost by mixing antifreeze with chemicals. No explanation is ever given for why they do this, they simply do it. Meanwhile, the sheriff who arrested Frost in the first went to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman accompanies him. <br /> <br /> This film has it all. It contains talking carrots that can stand, ice cubes that explode when you put them in your mouth, and deadly snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say "Dada!" like babies. I will have to give the creators of this credit. Snowballs are some of the cutest things ever imagined. I wish I could get one as a pet. The freezing finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman had the ability to influence the big weather phenomena. <br /> <br /> Then there are the actors. There is Manners, the FBI agent for the first film, except that here he wears a cache for the eyes. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I AM AN AGENT OF THE FBI! Yarrr! And then there is the British stereotypical adventurer and the black Jamaican stereotype with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fun. The most successful man on the planet, without exception. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, but is hilarious. I made fun of myself throughout the game and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
