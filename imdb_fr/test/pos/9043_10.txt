An unjustly neglected classic, "Intruder in the Dust" is one of the great films of the 1940s that sadly sank into obscurity. Based on a story by William Faulker and filmed in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, "Intruder" tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hernandez), a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a white man and a white boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.) who takes advantage of this situation to pay a debt prior to Beauchamp. Terrible acting, especially by two great actors, Porter Hall (as father of the deceased) and Elizabeth Patterson (better known as Mrs. Trumbull in "I Love Lucy") as an old woman willing to s to oppose city dwellers to assert this right is done. This frank, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves more attention.
