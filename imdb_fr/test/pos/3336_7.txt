This is a better than average entry in the Saint series. It holds your interest and, as the mysteries should, lets you guess to the end and lets you choose between several suspects. <br /> <br /> Many films from The Golden Age do not suit all tastes, especially the youngest ones. They come together with clothes, cars, sets, and so on. Who is asking for a highball today? Or wear a suit and tie anywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler: at the time, there had to be a shortage of lawyers. Frankly, it's not very good at that time. <br /> <br /> In any case, go ahead and enjoy. It's good - in an obsolete sense.
