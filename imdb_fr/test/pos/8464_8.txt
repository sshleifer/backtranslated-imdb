I went to see this film out of curiosity and to settle a dispute. The film is now more known from the music suite that Sergei Prokofiev extracted from his incidental music of the film, the troika movement even appearing in pop arrangements. The general outline of the plot is well known thanks to the notes on the cover of various recordings. An employee accidentally generates a non-existent Kizhe lieutenant in a list to present to the Tsar. The Tsar is interested in this person and rather than telling him that he does not exist, the courtiers and the officers maintain the pretext that he is real. Kizhe is exiled to Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, promoted again, dies, receives a state funeral, revealed as a money-grabber and posthumously demoted to the ranks. <br /> <br /> The clerk invented Kizhe, involving ink stains and sneezing, but I had heard that the film was lost. So there was no way of knowing what was going on. The film was then shown at the London Barbican as part of the Prokofiev festival. For the record, it turned out that all that happens is that the clerk confuses two words when he writes an order and turns Kuzhe into Kizhe. As the Tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there is no time to correct the mistake. <br /> <br /> After waiting for a historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is very funny and the audience, including myself, laughed constantly. Although most of them are filmed directly, mainly in the palace, there are some "tricks" where several images appear on the screen. For example, the Tsar's army is represented by a small group, repeated across the screen. Four identical guards perform a perfect drill in perfect unison. Two identical servants rub the floor. <br /> <br /> A slight disadvantage was that it was very difficult to determine who everyone was. There were two women who could be the Tsar's daughters, or a girl and a servant or something else. And very few people have been named. But overall, it's a nice movie and I'm surprised it's not seen more often.
