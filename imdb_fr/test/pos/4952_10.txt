Lou Gossett, Jr. is awesome as "Chappy Sinclair", a US Air Force super pilot who comes to the rescue of a friendly but undisciplined "Doug Masters" (Jason Gedrick), the son of a captured pilot A couple of F-16 fighters to use to try to save his father from a dictator (David Suchet) from an enemy overseas country. <br /> <br /> Better than "Top Gun", this Air Force aviation film has excitement and a lot of explosions - you know, everything you want from an adventure movie contemporary military. <br /> <br /> Great music, including Twisted Sister's Dee Snider, shouting "We're not going to take it" and King Cobra's "Never Say Die". <br /> <br /> Aim high! Aviation!
