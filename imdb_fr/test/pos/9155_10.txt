I loved this series but I do not remember ever loving anything he did, starting with "Americanization of Emily". A sheriff in the city who keeps trying to steal the city blindly and leave for Mexico must love it. Like all he does, he has a taste of language that qualifies him as a Garner product. James plays the same character in many of his series and films, but he never became obsolete. <br /> <br /> PS re: Killing the main character <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, the "good" brother was killed and replaced by the "evil" twin in order to increase the odds, ie; do more like any other Western TV on the time. I think this show was way ahead of its time and I still miss it. The television without emission of Jimmy G misses something.
