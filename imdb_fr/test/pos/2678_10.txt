Wow, this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends. If you've had a shitty day, sit down with a beer (if you're old enough to do that, if no root should do that.) And watch a few episodes, it's the perfect recipe for happiness. <BR /> <br /> What I like most is that everyone in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic timing for comedy. After a while, you become attached to the characters and you really care about them. I think the secret of the success of the shows is that they have an enviable life. Doug is fat but still happy, he loves his wife, his job and his friends. The father-in-law is the fly in the ointment, but good nothing perfect.
