Gary Cooper is a cool guy. Always loved his characters easy to live. As some have said, there are some oddities in the scenario, such as an American Marshall who has had his job and can not even hit a barn with a gun. A farmer with thirty hands but does not seem to be able to stop his livestock from flowing. <br /> <br /> But there are a lot of quick thinking, free shots from Cooper to keep you entertained. <br /> <This film was shot in 1950. People in their twenties and thirties find it difficult to understand that these films were made for entertainment and not for the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Waiting for the film Oscar makes this film an injustice. These are the good ones who find the way to gather the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Rent, borrow or buy this movie, pop the corn and enjoy the co-op once again.
