"Christmas In Connecticut" is a jewel of a classic Christmas movie. Although less well known than others, it's still a delicious way to spend an evening in the holidays. I look at her every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is a perfect interpreter for Elizabeth Lane, the career single. Long before it was popular, Stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise. His apartment in New York and his friendly restaurateur "his uncle" at the corner of the street embody the unmarried girl of the city. She does not know how to cook yet, she writes a household column in a magazine! <br /> <br /> Dennis Morgan also perfectly plays the role of our war hero, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After getting lost at sea, all he wants is to spend Christmas in a "real" house. Which sets up the delicious, senseless story that is evolving. It's fun from start to finish. We should all have an Uncle Felix too!
