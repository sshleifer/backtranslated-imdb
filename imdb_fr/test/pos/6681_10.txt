If you enjoyed the butterfly effect, Donnie Darko or The Machinist, you will also appreciate K-Pax. <br /> <br /> For me, this film was really uplifting and depressing in the end. Spacey offers excellent performance as Prot. In addition, let's not forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the film, which I am a big fan. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I recommended the film to a lot of my friends and everyone was upset. <br /> <br /> But this is still very underestimated, perhaps because of lack of action and explosions. I'm sorry, this is not a film about the explosion, but about the behavior of humans and the lives of people in non-existent worlds. <br /> <br /> Continue and enjoy.
