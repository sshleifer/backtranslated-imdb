Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectic of life. In the late nineteenth century, in a remote Japanese village, a young man and a married woman, older than him, fall in love with each other and decide to kill her husband to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy this freedom because Remorse begins to haunt them, as usual at the time by the weaker member of the couple, the woman of course. From now on, in an atmosphere where dreams (nightmares) merge with reality, the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman but also to the man. It also haunts the dreams of other villagers, creating a climate of suspicion and rumors about the couple, compounded by the arrival of a police officer to investigate the disappearance of the murdered husband. But what makes this film more interesting, besides this almost common story of adultery, is the evolution of the couple's feelings into a deep Shakespearean psychological and dramatic development of remorse, anguish and fear that turns their romantic relationship into a nightmare. until their ultimate misfortune. Expressionism so dear to Japanese theater or cinema is also present in the performances of the players but not in an exaggerated form. Only to the extent necessary to show more effectively the deepest feelings of the characters represented. It's really a good movie.
