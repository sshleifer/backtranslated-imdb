You can find here an anti-war statement without looking too hard; this layer is worn. Or you can find a neutral commentary on the madness of war (devoid of "judgment"); this layer is totally uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Or you can look at that for the damn good entertainment value of Duvall Liners, but it's only a coating for commercial chewing. <br /> <br /> You can try to see this as a "realistic" film about the war with Vietnam, but ask any veteran and he'll crush that idea - most vets will say it stinks . <br /> <br /> Or consider it a "will" or will it not want to play morality - nothing rich there either. <br /> <br /> Where I found that value lay in the superb reference to oneself. Coppola needed a large enough container (war) to fit the size of the talented multidimensional actor playing "a great man". <br /> <br /> Brando, the man, was as much a maverick as the character Kurtz. The studios were uncomfortable with his "acting" method, yet he always excelled and won praise; the "generals" are not comfortable with Kurtz's "dubious methods", despite his strategic genius. <br /> <br /> Coppola is making a film about Brando's greatness. To pound the point, he places himself in the film (as Hopper, a maniacal photojournalist loaded with several cameras) to launch his praises. Brando himself is only visible in half-light and silhouettes - a brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the power of the actor. And he comes out like a sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: "the horror ..." <br /> <br /> Other topics of interest: the great use of camera perspectives to the point of view, including "being in the fire" well before the "Private Ryan"; the innovative use of sound, including threatening scans and the sonic representation of an acid trip. <br /> <br /> Do not stay caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should remove is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.
