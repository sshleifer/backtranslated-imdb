A year ago I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on TV and was pleasantly surprised by the results. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker would have revitalized the horror with Hellraiser, but it's a film that has effectively blocked his film career. somewhat. What a pity, because, like the inhabitants of Midian, this film seems to be misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Barker has created a motley mix of genre staples in this story - it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fable about man's inhumanity to man. Avoiding sympathy for the devil is difficult in the best case, but when the characters are as visually demonic as in the movie, it becomes almost impossible (cue the child!). The human insurrection virtually similar to the Klan (pitchforks and holy anger!) At the conclusion of the film becomes even more overwhelming compared to what happened before. As a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy, this film can be quite evocative. <br /> <br /> I pity those who will not see the film from this angle and consider it a phantasmic indulgence going too far. We have here a real forgotten gem and the sooner the studio and Mr. Barker will be nice and will spend time there, the better.
