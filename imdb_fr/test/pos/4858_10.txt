The essential message - which Miller would certainly have liked to have after seeing the Vichy war crimes trials - is that the hatred of someone without a rational foundation is a loss of life. The character of Meat Loaf, Fred, has known Lawrence for many years and yet, when the time comes, at the request of his fanatical followers, he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their "target" group. For me, this is the crucial message - no matter what Lawrence and his wife do from now on - they are branded and have the opportunity to save themselves by using reason. Animal aggression and anger have blinded the thugs of Fred's Union to reality. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine suggested I see "The Wave" to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them account. I once had a role-playing experience and was shocked to see how normal and ponderous people enjoyed the creation of an oppressive police state - one that would threaten them all - because he slipped in stages. <BR /> <br /> Fred is the beginning, his Los Angeles friends and preacher idol are the catalyst that pushes his neighbors over the brink of violence and keeps thinking that what they are doing is wrong . <br /> <br /> The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein, the Jewish trader is fascinating, because Lawrence misses the goal almost to the end: if the bigots force Finkelstein out, where should he go? If his family fled the Nazis, what an irony to be tormented in the country of "freedom". <br /> <br /> This big poster (a fairly famous propaganda article) about American families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail. When you see this movie, watch the subway graffiti and all the little posters. The message is hiding there too. <br /> <br /> This film should be on the agenda of all schools, especially in our time when baseless hatred is so largely embodied by "reasonable" who are only extremists in a thin disguise.
