A teenager gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by an ex-jockey to participate in the Grand National Steeplechase of London. A beautiful adaptation of the classic children's book, with Taylor's excellent early performance as an energetic but polite youngster. Rooney is OK as his coach, although he has melodramatic moments too. Crisp and Revere are very good as Taylor's loving parents. Filmed in Technicolor, it is beautiful. The problem is that there are deceptive elements, that there is nothing interesting and that it drags on a bit. The race is exciting but could have been a lot more.
