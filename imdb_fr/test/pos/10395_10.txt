I was stunned by this movie. Subsequently, I did not even want to see movies for a long time. All the other films would be as unsatisfactory in comparison. <br /> <br /> For many, it may be Antonion's worst-an engaging conventional scenario, microscopic examinations of human emotions and their interactions-and Wenders' worst-a confused and confusing transcendentalism. It is composed of short, distinct episodes bound by the stream of consciousness typical of Wenders' sinuous hero, so that it does not produce the temporary oblivion of escape cinema. But for the fans, the worst is the best The ripping scenario draws a single poetic image that extends over the film. Wenders and Antonioni create between their segments a discourse that seeks the heart of things. <br /> <br />
