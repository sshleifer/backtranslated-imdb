I do not really know what it's about Dirty Dancing ... there's some kind of absolute magic in this movie ... I can not tell hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times that I've watched it, from the beginning at the end ... But every time I come on TV, I am fascinated and mystified, I sit and I stay two hours to love the film as if I was watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray have absolutely detested each other during the filming of this film, they have great chemistry on the set. The viewer benefits even more to appreciate this passion and commitment. help me rip a little in the end, when Patrick approaches the Houseman family and says to his father: "Nobody puts baby in a corner". (classic moment) For all those who believe that this movie is nerdy and dark, maybe somehow, but it was the penis of 80s movies, and placed Patrick Swayze on the map; his performance was immaculate. <br /> <br /> Three cheers for Dirty Dancing !! <br /> <br /> Ps- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece
