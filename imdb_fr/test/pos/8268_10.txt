Knowing and loving this book since I was eleven, I was terrified to see it become a movie - and if they had made a mess of it? In case I did not need to worry at all. Everyone was very well chosen and the acting is great, he followed the story very well except for the strange addition of the prison scene which, for me, adds nothing at all. . However, it's really the most beautiful love story and I'm so happy to have filmed it so I can watch it again and again. My only complaint is: why did not they give Kester a green vest "who made him such a remarkable man"? Something so simple, when they went to so much trouble for everything else. If you have the opportunity, see it, it's excellent.
