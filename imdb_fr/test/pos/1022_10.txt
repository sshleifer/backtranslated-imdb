I was in school in the late sixties and early seventies and this film is very much like my school. The school play where the main actors kiss each other is what happened in my school. A bunch of crazy guys, my school again only when we went on a long distance run of the country we were going to smoke a cigarette! "I got it," someone in my school pierced the light from the sky and broke the canes! after that they were kept in a safe !!! And as for some nocturnal activities! What can I say ... The film was released in 1982, I remember what it was when I bought my house and the film was being broadcast at the same time. If you like British movies and movies about school, youth and vintage pieces, this is for you. "SWALK", another very popular film, came out a few years ago and I would like to see it again, as well as "Kes". Highly recommended. (But believe me, it was in 1982 that he came out)
