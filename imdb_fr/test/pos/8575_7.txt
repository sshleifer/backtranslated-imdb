I wanted to love this movie. Everything seemed in place for a nice, if not revolutionary film. It was held in the south of France, under the direction of beautiful recognizable actors, and I really admired the vibrant African costumes, proverbs and music. Still, I did not like that. The films are supposed to convey their meaning during the first viewing, but "Secret Laughter" does not do it. Nimi and Matthew, as played by Long and Firth (who both played romantic roles before and should have known better), emit as much warmth and passion as dried fish. I deliberately used the 'dried fish' because it was one of the few - too few - strong traits and highlights scattered throughout the film. Another winner is when Nimi surprises Matthew poking around his apartment. He finds one of his books with his name written on it and says, "Your name is Nimi, I never knew." Then he insists that she call him by his first name. I watched this scene carefully as Matthew asked Nimi to repeat "his name," realizing that until then, they were still calling each other by their last name. I thought it was a turning point for the film and I was expecting it to improve. It does not have. Why do Nimi and Matthew always seem to be standing ten paces away, even in this scene "tell my name"? What does Matthew like about Nimi, apart from his obvious beauty? And why would a sensible woman like Nimi fall for a comic writer who sees her marriage as something that can be put on hold when a beautiful exotic "adventure" comes along? And I would like to add that it was a bit difficult for me to find myself behind a love story about adultery. Yes, Jenny is a vicious harpy, but if I were in her place, I would probably match her Cruella tactics to keep my husband from getting lost. Believe it. The story alludes to Nimi's painful past, but never explores it completely. Some critics say that Firth seemed a bit awkward here, and I agree. For God's sake, the actor summoned a desire and passion more palpable than this snob of the early nineteenth century, Mr. Darcy (and while wearing these hideous pants)! As for Long, who shone in "Love Jones," she sometimes seemed to focus more on her accent than on her character. Still, there were many moments ?? the scene 'tell my name' among them ?? when she was in total control and she did very well. Yet, "Secret Laughter" is not devoid of its redemptive qualities, and I found that he grew up with more viewing. Nene has been well-presented as being supportive and well-intentioned, although she does not fully understand the appeal of Nimi for Matthew. I really loved it when Nene faced Mama Fola in these dueling proverb scenes. My husband liked that, and he's usually the first to sigh and insult the screen if he does not like what's going on. He even laughed jokingly when Sammy asked Matthew some very candid questions about sex. So there you have it. "Secret Laughter" was good enough to entertain a recognized curmudgeon like my husband, but a passionate film buff like me will need more than one viewing to appreciate what the director and the writer wanted to convey.
