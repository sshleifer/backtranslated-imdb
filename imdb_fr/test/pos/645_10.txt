I felt that this film had a lot of heart and had to be a work of love for Eleanor Bergstein. The main actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well selected and played their roles with excellence. It was a very edifying film that I would like to see available on tape or on DVD. A rare jewel.
