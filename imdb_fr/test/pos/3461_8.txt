I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie that moved me very strangely. I was confused, sad and happy at the same time. I guess too many people will pay attention to this film. But I hope at least some will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their physical disabilities, who (as a team) beat the health system and fought for their rights. This film shows a side that some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotionally presented. Hopefully this film will help us better understand some of their desires and become aware of the importance of having a friend in the world, especially when you can hardly express that fact.
