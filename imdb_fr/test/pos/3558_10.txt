Based to some extent on the authors, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, his own experiences as animators at Butlins Holiday Camp in the UK during the same period, the program follows, "Hi-De-Hi!" The slapstick, postcard humor of post-war Britain. Based in the fictional seaside town of Crimpton-on-Sea, "Hi-De-Hi" tells the comical events at the Maplins Holiday Camp, one of the many British-owned, mega-rich but never seen (on screen) Joe Maplin. <br /> <br /> Although the show began in 1980 with the pilot episode, it lasted until 1988, when the BBC deemed it too docile. for its state-of-the-art comedy department, seasons 1 to 5 were centered on 1959, while seasons 6 to 9 were centered on 1960, when the British British Holiday Camp began to deteriorate. During the first five seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (brilliantly played by Simon Cadell), the camp's animation director, was a well-meaning but thoughtful former university professor who freed himself from his higher-class background. and ventured into the "real" world to lead his animation team that stood out for his own laid-back personality. More than six years later, Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin when Cadell quit the show at the height of his popularity), a former RAF war hero who, in many ways, looked a lot like the character Cadell a rascal than a gentleman. <br /> <br /> However, the true stars of "Hi-De-Hi" throughout the nine seasons were Ted Bovis (played superbly by Paul Shane), a stereotypical working class, who drank beer, band cartoon bawdy - someone who could never resist an opportunity to fiddle with the campers; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc who is currently making a career comeback with appearances in the hit BBC Comedy, "Little Britain"), the Yellowcoat leader (whom the animation team was called because of her jackets bright yellow) and sports organizer - but more importantly, the person who saved the embarrassment of Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster by concealing their inexperience in running a holiday camp; Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard), the modest and yet adorable maid with an ardent ambition to become Yellowcoat, and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), the innocent protégé of Ted, learn more about the "show business" he did not hope. <br /> <br /> As usual with a production of Croft & Perry, the characters gathered were a group of misfits played superbly by the actors involved. Mr. Partridge (played by the late Leslie Dwyer, 70 years old when he left the series), the alcoholic artist who hates children; Fred Quilly (Felix Bowness), former jockey champion with a dubious past; Yvonne and Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Dianne Holland and Barry Howard), former champions of posh ballroom dancing who were at the twilight of their careers; and Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard), the two main Yellowcoats girls, who were always looking for the kind of fun that Joe Maplin would never allow in one of his camps. <br /> <br /> "Hi-De-Hi" characterizes the slapstick era of the late '50s with its saucy humor and, to some extent, vulgar "idiotic" jokes about people sitting in toilets and anecdotes about "women with big shots" are on the agenda day). But despite his "Carry On" smell, he was always so innocent and became something family-friendly in the '80s. Of course, critics of the show pointed out that the show had has been well received for at least two years, but I do not agree. While the first seasons were mostly focused on leanness and blinding humor, the latest series of "Hi-De-Hi" saw more room in the scripts and the main characters (including Spike Dixon and Gladys Pugh) were able to grow up with a more sensitive story. lines. That said, there have been some critics of the series. Clive Dempster was not Jeffrey Fairbrother, and the first did not quite have chemistry on screen with Gladys as Jeffrey (I personally think it would have been more believable if Gladys had married Jeff); five seasons devoted to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than a few errors of continuity (the disappearance of old faces and the introduction of new characters were not explained correctly, especially with the Yellowcoats who came and went with a lot of regularity, and the character of Gladys Pugh, who, in the pilot episode, was an eater of men in love with free love who was suddenly transformed into a naive virgin as a character! Not to forget to mention with much of pedantry, most of the 1959 holiday season was covered by the first season, so it was amazing to spend five more series in the rest of the year, but the show was not meant to be meticulously watched and the comedy was more than offset by its flaws. <br /> <br /> All In all, "Hi-De-Hi" was probably one of the last comedies of the golden period of the BBC, and even though she has never managed to compete with pillars of British comedy such as "Only Fools & Horses", "Porridge" or even "Last Summer Wine", "Hi Hi" will be Remember like a comedy that the whole family could enjoy. If you have not already checked by yourself, I beg you.
