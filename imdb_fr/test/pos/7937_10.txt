There is a version of "Nevsky" which is shown with a symphony orchestra, a choir, a soloist and the film. If this happens NEVER in the day after your trip, see "Nevsky" as well. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic did it with the OKC Canterbury choir (one of the best in the world) a few years ago. I think I cried through all this, it was one of the most powerful cinematic experiences of my life. I listen to "Nevsky" on the radio right now and it always tears me. I love movies and classical music, but I do not think there is a combination that looks like the impact of "Nevsky" played in real time.
