"Caribe" is not a masterpiece in its narrative aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is articulated around two narrative axes, one inserting the other, each with elements that bind and coexist in perfect harmony. The story never loses the right rhythm and shows a very good mix of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great and we must thank him to the new director, Esteban Ram√≠rez. In addition, the characters are very well written and complex. then, once you become familiar with them, you can perceive their feelings without them saying anything. I can not say that I liked this photo because of all the hype that it generated (in Costa Rica), but rather because of the way it really manages to show an interesting portrait of what is happening. happens when you interfere with the balance of people's lives. Let's hope that Caribe will set a benchmark for future projects in Costa Rica, as this is a very good example of a nice movie.
