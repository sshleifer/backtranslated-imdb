The third part of Miike's Dead or Alive trilogy is more or less related to the first two parts. Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are back for the lead roles, but this time, the film takes us 300 years into the future ... after the apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Riki plays a hard cop, a force agent for the city's corrupt police policies, and Show plays a tramp who clings to a group of oppressed rebels in the city. The film must have been shot in Hong Kong, most of the other actors being Cantonese speakers, Terence Yin and Josie Ho being the most recognizable faces. There is also a team of HK stuntmen for the action sequences of the movies, which are very cool in a HK-via-Miike style. <br /> <br /> This could fuel a terrible B movie on a budget, but Miike's hands of course become something more interesting. It's a slow, thoughtful movie that winds and does not try to force anything into the spectator's throat. The characters are rounded and interesting and the plot is an interesting but fuzzy frame for the hanging of the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, a rather modest effort up to the action scenes, which shows Miike's growing ability to direct and choreograph a very beautiful action. Watching the filming of Show & Riki on cable montages is really fun - you can tell they were having a good time <br /> <br /> The finale of the movie tries to link the 3 films Dead Or Alive, which is completely useless because everyone is truly autonomous. Miike's explanation about the connection is, however, very entertaining and pretty much sums up the series. <br /> <br /> Not as deep or as developed as DOA2, not as scandalous and intense as DOA1 ... Still a good Miike movie though.
