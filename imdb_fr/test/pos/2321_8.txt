Down Periscope is not a "big film". But again, very few movies are. So, if you're looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom, it's a "big movie" without the capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence can spoil this light comedy on a group of marginalized assigned to an ancient submarine. They are ready to fail so that a general can get his extra star. They must confront the entire US Navy with its nuclear submarines. But they are outsiders and it's a comedy, so you can guess the result. But you are looking for outsiders, which makes it a very entertaining movie. Watch and enjoy ******** (eight stars)
