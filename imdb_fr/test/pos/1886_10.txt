It's very funny (well, except when Bruce is in the hospital scene, which is a bit sad). Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are both excellent and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not a big blockbuster controlled by a low-budget combination, but that's all it promises and besides, women are wonderful in their roles, Although I do not know them in other films, I'd love to see them again. <br /> <br /> The Brainstorming Scene is Inspired and Definitely a Showcase For Bruce's exceptional physical comedy, he is a delightful guy! <br /> <br /> Thank you Bruce, for your brain, it's your baby!
