I can understand how Barney can be annoying for some, but the hatred he provokes is very ridiculous. Barney was created simply from the beginning and simplicity is not bad, especially for the youngest. Personally, I find that this show is a very underrated period. Barney & Friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut (and almost 21 years after its debut in the music video), it proves time and time again that it still seduces young children. Maybe less than in the early 90s, where Barney was Hannah Montana at the time, but it remains a classic. As a fan of Barney myself, I feel that I should defend him in a way that does not look like spam. The way purple teaches things can be very simplistic and unrealistic, but would you prefer them to hear about the war? Be thankful that someone (a costumed dinosaur, but still) is there to comfort the children and let them be just kids. Nowadays, I think we urge our kids to grow up and Barney is here to say that you can always be a child of heart. In addition, many of Barney's lessons from current episodes of plagiarism, being honest and, yes, even death, could be of interest to everyone, not just his target audience. In addition, our children must learn to be kind and respect others, and help them to do so. In short, Barney can be annoying for some people and I totally understand why, but I leave him a little limp. All that he and his friends (with HIT Entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is to help the children not only to acquire the necessary skills, but also to have fun and examine the aspects positive of life. If more people listened to the favorite character of their children and saw it through their eyes, we might not be so negative about him and maybe even life itself.
