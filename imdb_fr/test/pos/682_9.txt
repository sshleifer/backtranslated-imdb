Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio movie of the early fifties directed by a man, Harry Horner, best known for his sets. Robert Ryan plays a handyman hired by Ida Lupino to clean up his place. The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and he does not know it. Miss Lupino is an empathic soul and tries to convince Ryan, without much success. He is not the kind of man that compassion could help or heal. So we have an interesting situation where two people have a good intention, but one of them can not succeed because he has something wrong. He experiences periodic power cuts during which he commits acts of violence that he forgets later. <br /> <br /> Essentially, Ryan's effect on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense, a sadist. The public soon discovers that Ryan is a crazy killer, but it takes a lot longer in Lupino. We must therefore live with this knowledge and watch poor Miss Lupino make every effort to "win" Ryan so that all goes well, the work is done and life goes on. However, Ryan does not get along well, because he is only capable of the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening, his paranoia asserts itself. <br /> <br /> As a study on mental illness, the film is not too impressive. What is superlative is to show the effect of a major mental illness, with a dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. In this respect, the film is realistic and compassionate, although relentlessly logical in the sense that we know that Lupino can not "fix" Ryan, but we wish it. The result is that, if you wish, you can be very emotionally involved in this film if you can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. <br /> <br /> Horner shows us, gradually, the Lupino house layout, a discouraging Gothic monstrosity that never looks like a house. We are familiar with the stairs, the kitchen and the pantry; and we come to know the windows that Miss Lupino can use to escape and those she can not use.
