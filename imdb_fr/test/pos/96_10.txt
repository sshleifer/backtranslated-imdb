Having been raised in Canada, I have seen this very often, especially at the CBC. I have seen it many times, at many ages of my life, and each time, the reactions are the same. It's a bitter-sweet and beautifully animated merry film that pulls your heart. I'm sure I have it on a VHS tape somewhere searching. <br /> <br /> Every growing child can understand the situation and want to integrate with his favorite idols. The scene and the look of children when his mother fills the Eatons catalog and her jumps in the room are invaluable. I have never seen someone capture the carefree atmosphere of youth in movies and this short film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm a Montreal habs fan and that makes my appreciation even more special. But in the end, it's the nostalgic aspect of pond hockey and your family's memories that tells you that you should be grateful for what you get, even if it's not exactly what you want. And oh yes, the animation is beautiful too;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10
