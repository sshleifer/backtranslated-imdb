Normally I hate vintage movies. Living in England is a nightmare at the moment if you are allergic to vintage dramas - which I do. However this one is the best. This is not taken seriously and Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are doing well together. Liv Tyler is good too, although his English accent is fishy. <br /> <br /> The film has it all for someone who just wants to leave. the cinema to have fun. There is action, adventure, drama and comedy. I do not know if the jokes will translate on the other side of the ocean, but I hope they will. It would be a shame if the American public misses this film. This shows that English filmmakers can produce something that does not require constant swearing and sex. Both are present in this format, but in a balanced format. The portrait of Iain Robertson in the camp of the strong man to do is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class are hilarious! say .... "If you see another movie" ... this spring, make Plunkett and Macleane. It's fun, there's action and of course, Jonny Lee Miller with an English accent to change!
