I love Tom Hanks and he is one of the few actors to attract me to the theater, no matter how worried I may be about the film. I was worried that Mr. Hanks would return to "light comedy" because it was the arena where he made the transition from television to film. Do you remember "Big"? Well, "Charlie Wilson's War" is not a light comedy. It's a political satire, and a very well written political satire about it. The script is the star of this movie and Aaron Sorkin's blacksmith is among the best of this year. <br /> <br /> Mike Nicols organizes the entire getaway and delivers a film that stands out very fast 90 minutes (the timing is all in comedy, and nothing is ever funny if it drags). Nicols' choice of scenery and lighting is also reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s television, deliberately used to root the play back then. <br /> <br /> The return to use of model work and stock photography on Digital special effects also enhance the retro look and credibility. Note to production designers in your choice of footage footage: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG, as well as a bell and a Hind. But that was perhaps also part of the joke. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the audience, but NOT the historical references to his own story. The story tends to repeat itself because repeat offenders have forgotten what happened the first time. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mr. Hanks and this chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. Sorkin's script is showcased by these actors and the entire production team is at the top of its game. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
