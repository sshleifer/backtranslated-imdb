Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL of the day. She is one of Danny McGuire's club dancers, the most special by Danny (Gene Kelly) and almost everyone who meets her. Take, for example, John Coudair (Otto Kruger), a magnate from Vanity magazine: delighted by Rusty's resemblance to his grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks), whom he loved very much when he fell in love with she was trying to revive her youth to repair what he thinks had gone wrong between him and Maribelle. He does not believe that Danny can give Rusty happiness, or whatever else he should be entitled to - he even makes Danny believe. When Rusty becomes known as Vanity's "Cover Girl", Danny drives her into the arms ready to wait for Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman). So what happens when Danny returns to town with his sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers), only to find out that Rusty marries Wheaton? <br /> <br /> As a musical, COVER GIRL enjoys the beautiful score and songs written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including "Long Ago and Far Away" (probably one of the most beautiful ballads ever written and beautifully sung in duo by Hayworth and Kelly), nominated for the Oscars, and entitled "Sure Thing" by Maribelle (the dullest "Poor John" is not a collaboration Kern / Gershwin) and "Put me in the test". The dance, of course, is first rate, since Gene Kelly had more than a hand in the choreography. This is seen in the simplest of dances, such as his dance with Hayworth for "Put me to the test", or the joyfully exuberant number of "Make Way for Tomorrow" (performed by the trio of Danny, Rusty and Genius ) ... which foreshadows the reaction of Gene's character to the police officer in the title issue in SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN. Kelly particularly marked a technical and artistic blow with the dance 'Alter-Ego'. Like his successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and UN AMERICAN IN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity Kelly has brought to the modern musical: wanting to use the film medium Current dances that could not be performed on a stage, and years before CGI, Kelly insisted on dancing with the only person who could match him with talent and style - himself. The number is barely five minutes, but he (and Kelly's genius) remains breathtaking, even sixty years down the line. That's why I watched COVER GIRL, and if nothing else, this dance is well worth it. <br /> <br /> You will find that a lot of money has been spent on COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth - but not so much. she does not deserve it. Witness the scene when Rusty arrives on Broadway - the big screen featuring all the different women on the cover makes way for a surprisingly large stage set up for Rusty's entrance. Hayworth is indeed one of the most beautiful girls in the movie, without effort, and she dances with a style and grace almost worthy of Kelly. (Very few of Kelly's co-stars have that honor.) She's hilarious in some scenes, like her drunk scene when John and Wheaton pick her up to Joe. <br /> <br /> For some reason, however, his performance still lacks the spark that would allow COVER GIRL to overcome his general curse of mediocrity. This curse is lifted only when Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or not), or when Eve Arden, John's secretary, "Stonewall", defeats at length with another sharp comment or intelligent observation. Since the movie ultimately belongs to Hayworth, neither Kelly nor Arden can save it as a whole. That does not mean that the film is bad - it is not. It's nice, with beautiful songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to watch. But it's just not a classic. The dance is classic, so watch COVER GIRL for that, and you will not regret it.
