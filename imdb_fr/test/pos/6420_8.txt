In a strange experiment, an astronaut is abandoned on the moon while Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a troubled translator living in Italy, comes out of a nightmare about a lunar mission mixed with an old film that frightened her in her childhood. She does not remember the last three days either, except for a torn picture of the Garma Hotel she found in her apartment. Licensed for her work, Alice goes to this island resort to try to solve the mystery ... <br /> <br /> Often presented as a giallo because of its director (Luigi Bazzoni of THE FIFTH CORD) and the presence of Evelyn Stewart, Nicoletta Elmi and Klaus Kinski, FOOTPRINTS is actually a psychological thriller deliberately punctuated with sci-fi accents. Blurring the distinction between dream, reality, memory and cinema, the troubling story is magnificently photographed by Vittorio Storaro, an Oscar winner, with a thoughtful score by Nicola Piovani. He also combines elements of films as diverse as MACCHE SOLARI by Armando Crispino and DEATH IN VENICE by Lucino Visconti in his depiction of alienation, isolation, hallucination and perhaps madness. Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan, on screen all the time, makes a replica of her Carol Hammond in Lucio Fulci in Lucio Fulci's film Lizard in the role of Alice, a young woman immersed in a mystery that casts her in doubt of his mental health. The locations reflect Alice's unstable state of mind. The island of Garma, out of season, of Arab influence and ancient ruins, is a lonely, almost mystical place, unwilling to give up its secrets. Evelyn Stewart started out at first as a worried friend, Nicoletta Elmi and Lila Kedrova, an Oscar winner, are guests of the hotel, Peter McEnery plays a beautiful biologist trying to help Bolkan and Klaus Kinski, still intense, is "Blackmann" in the movie-in-a-movie, "Footprints on the Moon". <br /> <br /> FOOTPRINTS is an elegant case of "100% Euro-Weird Guarantee" but not for everyone. There is only one murder towards the end, but you will not see it coming because the film begins to gather.
