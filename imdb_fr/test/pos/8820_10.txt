Michael Sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant portrait of a comic genius. If you're familiar with Kenneth Williams's mannerisms and diaries, this drama captures the essence of it perfectly. When I read that Kenneth was in his bathing trunks, I laughed, then the screen was animated, but this time I did not laugh because it was put into perspective as a acts of a repressed and tortured man. It must have been such a lonely existence in Kenneth's skin, seeking attention but fleeing it when it mattered REALLY! The last 20 minutes are heartbreaking and you see Kenneth gradually sink into the depths of despair and see suicide as the only solution. I've seen him a dozen times and still cries uncontrollably to the point where he wishes good evening to LOUIE. I can not recommend this drama enough. Sexually explicit, but it clearly shows that Kenneth could not let anyone invade his world and this is where the sadness of this man lies. For a genius who has made so many happy, it is so unfortunate that his private life is filled with despair and sadness. Pauly.
