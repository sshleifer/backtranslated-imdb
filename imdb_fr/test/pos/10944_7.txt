Well, do not expect something deep and meaningful. Most combat scenes are pretty decent. The two leading women are quite endearing, but their lack of background action in Hong Kong sometimes shows it. The end may be missing something but I still appreciated it. The cheesy humor will probably not appeal to those who have not watched a lot of Hong Kong movies, but if you have that kind of thing and you have a few hours to fill with something that does not make sense, you could do a lot worse. . (OK, so you can do better, but .......) <br /> <br /> Certainly, tied with most Hollywood blockbusters. <br /> <br /> 7/10
