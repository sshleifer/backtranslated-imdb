I came out of "Dark Blue World" (sigh) "so sad", but it was really a movie to do and it's really well done in the Czech Republic. It's fun despite the "sad" principle. He is full of feelings, connection and true undeniable friendship between the two main characters - a mature lieutenant-driver (Ondrej Vetchý as Franta) and the young budding pilot (Krystof Hádek as Karel), the inevitable love triangle , and reminders from time to time of the painful situation of prisons in Czechoslovakia in the fifties. Everything is gathered in a film, directed by the screenwriter father and the director son, Zdenek and Jan Sverák (the previous realization being the kind "Kolya"). <br /> <br /> This is not as long as "East-West" ("East-West" French) 1999, a heartbreaking and heartbreaking story that tells the story of a Russian doctor back and the fate of the French wife after the Second World War in Russia. The plot of "Tmavomodrý svet" (title in Czech) is quite simple and has a hint of light humor. The music, the songs of World War II, England sung in Czech, the modest special effects of pilots and airplanes in the sky - not as elaborate as Hollywood - there is no need to be bing , bang, boom all the time to show aerial battle scenes. The sadness has been explained from the beginning (two paragraphs in English) and ends with follow-up paragraphs. The film is not completely subtitled, only when translating Czech conversations - the others are in English, very British or Czech. (This is therefore an English-language foreign film and includes British actors.) <br /> <br /> The three main performances, in particular those of the two Czech pilots, have been wonderfully performed. There are nuances between the two, even if it is the constant maturity of the greedy youth. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: yes, there is "Brassed Off" in 1996 alongside Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite; remembers her as "Hear My Song" (1991), alongside Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; In front of Hugh Grant in "Sirens" 1994 and "The Englishman who climbed a hill and descended a mountain" in 1995, besides his appearances in the mini-series PBS Masterpiece Theater. <br /> <br /> "So sad" - the fact that the heroes who defend their country can be treated so fatefully and so long (40 years). Thank God for interesting memories and imprints of an unforgettable friendship. Where does the break for a ray of sunshine through a stained glass window (ironic or fortuitous whether it is a church where hard work has taken place) - symbol of hope, never give up ?? <br /> <br /> Other recent films that tell stories must be told: "Kandahar" (Nelofer Pazira as Nafas, Afghanistan's Canadian traveling to Kandahar with a personal "mission" to spirit) far exceeds the expectations of the eye behind a burqa by Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. "Everything Put Together" (with Radha Mitchell as a new mother to SID - Sudden Infant Death), insightful film by Swiss director Marc Forster, and his controversial film about the controversial movie "Monster's Ball" (which I do not have still included) with Halle Berry's Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. See movies without prior expectations or comparisons with previous films. Just see him.
