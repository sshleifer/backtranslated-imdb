I just saw this program on Channel 4. After reading some of the previous comments, I would like to say first of all that I am not in favor of the death penalty. Other than that, I was expecting a lot of things from this movie, but the result was not very satisfying. Dead Man Walking is very well done, with good performances and a good scenario. In fact, it is difficult to make an artistic mistake. However, I felt that even though she was trying to cope with the problems of the death penalty, she seemed to be distracted by her religious / moral attitude (which was hardly surprising since the main character was a nun). Although I'm not heartless, I did not really sympathize with any of the characters in the story. If you do not take religion seriously, you probably will not see much in this movie. I think Let me have it, by Peter Medak, was a much more powerful and moving film, and I would strongly recommend to anyone considering watching it to go see him.
