For all who liked the series, this movie will be watching. However, it also leaves you wanting more. I loved how each character (detective) made his appearance. The least with the end of who is the fourth president as they leave a reason for another movie. My hypothesis is Bayless of course. It looked like a series of very well prepared scenes. This is a series that I would have liked to live. Thanks to the casting for a wonderful television.
