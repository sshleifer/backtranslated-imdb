Christopher Nolan's goal was to continue in a very narrow direction and in that sense, he realized something that reminded me of the kind of super little movies of "poverty" that Ullmer had made in the '40s. Only this time, he is able to implement tribute keys, such as black-and-white photography (because of the budget of the shoe, but also essential for the dark crevices that these characters inhabit) and the cast of the actors (the main role of John Doe , his glamorous male counterpart, and his femme femme fatale) - while keeping him in the underground realm of the '90s where, for many thousands of dollars and specific choices about places and music, anything could be possible. This, and also in the mood of the film noir, Nolan is also putting together a sneaky intrigue, perhaps even more than Memento. Where the latter was a work of psychology taking place in the form of a plot enriched by a careful examination of the past, the non-linear structure serves here to show how much someone like Bill can follow a path as dark as Cobb . Cobb is obviously the responsibility of Cobb. <br /> <br /> Of course, simply following a person becomes the main goal of Cobb. I did not even know where it would lead, if it could be a sort of flow of consciousness at the Slacker where Nolan would lead his character from one British man to another. But the bond between Bill and Cobb is fast and excellent, as we see when Cobb approaches Bill at the caf√© to ask what he's doing next, says almost everything we need to know on both, namely, and the first flight he brings with him. What seems to be a good score on the horizon is really a big montage organized by Cobb and his lady (who just called "The Blonde", perhaps a tribute too obvious to the black, but why the carp). But this is revealed in a way that really led me to guess, because the manipulation of the story has all the more contributed to raise questions, not so much of why, but of how. The density is all the greater as the actors understand their essential points as characters. Alex Haw is brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely conceal his "deep" ideas about what it's like to actually enjoy a burglary, and Theobald with this behavior of someone who can never be so smart what it really does, but who is smarter in this naive way that has no chance in an environment as humid as this one; Russell almost makes the task too easy, even with a face that would make Ana Savage shake her head. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Nolan also plays in the ball with his cameraman style, keeping nothing of the kind Add to the atmosphere and suspense, with the fades that are not too fast to let a lasting impression, but sufficient to add to the logic of the scenario "it could go everywhere". He follows it by hand, as if he knows where his limits lie, while keeping the essentials: keep the basics up close when needed (the one I liked is Russell's face in a small mirror ), and a fairly simple techno. track that never hurts. Sometimes, as mentioned, the distinction between seeing something of the "present" and seeing something as eternal as a solid story of low-level criminals with games of mind and moral ambiguity is still never clear, which for me is almost irresistible in its dark way. In simple terms, this is one of the most remarkable business cards I have seen in recent years and which should, hopefully, be something that future fans of the other work of Nolan will be able to hope to discover. Or even those who think that black has gone to mainstream movie dogs (even in independent movies) who shoot fast and hard, that's 71 minutes.
