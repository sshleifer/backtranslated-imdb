Patty Chayevsky was years ahead of most of the most accomplished scenario writers and dramatists in solving thorny problems. In this 1971 film, he followed Sinclair Lewis and AJ Cronin (respectively in ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL) by casting a critical eye on the world of medicine, although his focus is on a particular scene: a modern hospital in Manhattan . Chayevsky's point of view is pretty straightforward: are hospitals places to go for treatment, or are they lucrative organizations where people often die as a result of incompetence? <br /> <br /> As someone recently visited too often in a hospital (and will have to return soon), I find THE HOSPITAL as a very timely and rewarding satire. George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the leaders of the Manhattan Surgery Center, a large university hospital. He has just started his day when it is said that one of the second-year residents died during the night in apparent confusion. It seems that he was sedated and drugged while sleeping on a bed (he had had a date with a nurse) and that someone had tampered with an iv that should have contained water containing glucose (later, he had an intravenous insulin overdose). Soon, Scott discovers that every time he turns around, another staff member dies as a result of a heart attack or botched operation. The key to all this seems to be a patient who had arrived at the hospital ten days earlier for a regular checkup. Since then, he has lost a kidney, almost lost his other kidney and is now in a comatose state (Barnard Hughes). <br /> <br /> Hughes' daughter (Diana Rigg) wants to bring the comatose dad to his home on an Apache Indian reservation in Mexico. Scott is not totally opposed to the idea. After all, hospital errors almost killed Hughes. In addition, Scott suffers from a mid-life crisis due to the collapse of his marriage and family, and growing doubts about the achievements of his profession. It's not just a case like Hughes. The hospital is in a state of constant chaos where regular staff (Scott, Stephen Elliott, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) is overworked and overworked, and is at war with business staff (characterized by Frances Steenhagen in a really chilly performance). The local community is hostile because of plans to expand the hospital - but when they meet to "discuss" issues with Elliot, they also prove to be a source of contention (Black Panther activists versus local clergy versus women wanting to take birth control and a pro-abortion clinic the types). Rigg (who falls in love with Scott during the movie) becomes increasingly certain that leaving the madness of the city makes sense, and Scott is also playing with this idea. <br /> <br /> Scott was in his place. interim height in this film, with ANATOMY OF A MURDER, THE HUSTLER, DR. STRANGELOVE and PATTON to his credit before the creation of L'HÃ”PITAL. His anguish was registered when Rigg and he got to know each other (it prevented him from committing suicide because of his despair). He does not know if anything accomplished at the hospital is worth it, and shouts out the window of the words from the "summary line". Although he relaxes a little later on the quality of his teaching with doctors who study with him, Scott is never really sure of everything. However, he fully accepts his own sense of responsibility that others only empty. Rigg too was at the peak of her international fame (if not her acting skills) - her stint as Mrs. Peel on THE AVENGERS was a few years old, but she was also recognized as a great stage talent in Britain at that time. as one of the sexiest artists of this period. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors are good too. In addition to Steenhagen (who requires Medicare / Medicaid information / insurance from comatose patients in the Czech Republic), there is Hughes as a religious maniac who wins and Elliot as the head of the hospital who is fed up . There is also my favorite caricature: Richard Dysart as Dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who really settled at the big picture of the stock market, after having formed to benefit from tax incentives. Anyone remembers his performances as ethical types, such as the head of the LALAW law firm or Melvin Douglas's friend and doctor in BEING HERE, after seeing his greedy Dr. Elwell see another facet to the talents of this underrated actor.
