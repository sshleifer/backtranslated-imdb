This film is probably the best of Hal Hartley. The subject, of an unusual originality, is treated (it's usual with Hal Hartley) with a lot of humor. This particularity is not the only quality of this film: the composition of the complex frame (everything is parallel, down to the smallest detail), the angles of view, the lighting, giving a more supernatural dimension to these blurred images (The descent of Jesus could not not be filmed in a conventional way), the false actor "setter" are qualities that make essential the re-reading of the Bible, realized in the form of an apocalyptic delirium.
