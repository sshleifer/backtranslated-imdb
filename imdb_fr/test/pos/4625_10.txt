I had the pleasure of attending this brilliant film during a screening in Sydney. Although it was a pleasure to see him. Pleasure is not the emotion that remains to you at the end of the credits. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a film that addresses not only the stigma felt by young people, but by all. Chief of whom is isolation. It's not just about placing the final galvanizing scene of the films on a pedestal above the other films, but it's rather important to consider it as the highlight. And from there, it's important to understand what it means for you as a spectator and for people directly affected by it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is not a blurry image, but the way Thalluri treats his subject with deep dignity and is no exception to the rule is a message that does honor to his message. <br /> <br /> I do not think movies like 2:37 should be converted to favor. It should rather be recommended to those who are looking for a specific purpose in their viewing. <br /> <br /> A brilliant portrait of lost innocence. And a master stroke for a talent still unexploited. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it.
