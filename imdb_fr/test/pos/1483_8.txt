There was one day a member of my family (who does not say who it is for personal reasons) who thinks that Mr. Bean is still stupid in everything he does in the comedy series. Imagine how I felt at that moment. Shocked instantly. <br /> <br /> There is more than one reason why I love to watch Mr. Bean. Being one of the first local television shows here in my country, where I grew up for the first time, is one of those things that came to my mind. There was even one time my friends and I had talked about some of the selected episodes and we had just laughed together. <br /> <br /> It's always silly, funny and hilarious, no matter what Rowan Atkinson behaves like Mr. Bean does at each episode. Although, sometimes, he can sometimes show some of the rehearsals here, he has never failed to bring back my childhood memories. In fact, I can dare to say that this is the very first show that shows me the kind of shows that come out of the UK as I grew up. <br /> <br /> Humorous series ... really really mean, like what the British can say.
