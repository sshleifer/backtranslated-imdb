This film is a mystery. It's not scary, it's scary. You will probably jump at certain points and for some of them, you will scratch your head to understand it. He reveals his mystery through the main character Eve and his psychotic college project in an insane asylum, Don. He needs her to look for clues to murder her mother, and once Eve agrees to help her, she opens Pandora's box completely and releases some very strange items, including Malachi. I will not go into Malachie, but I thought the way to play was a complete genius. I know that movie buffs will not consider this film as prestigious as the other classics because it contains no celebrities (Angelina Jolie's brother was excellent, but perhaps he should have asked his sister to be a film might get some recognition) but I think the way Malachi's end works is something to talk about. I recommended it to my friends, this is definitely worth the purchase price or the rental price.
