Of course, very experienced critics who like things like Star Wars and professional shit will definitely slide this movie and make some very bad comments. But really, it's a fun comedy for teens with an awesome story and a good acting. <br /> <br /> Josie Gellar (well played by Drew Barrymore) is part of a reporting team and she was given a "real" job - she needs to go back to school and find out what the teens these days, well, everything is fine until Josie remembers her awful high school and panic, but she's never been hip, never cool, has never been popular until present! <br /> <br /> Sit back, relax and enjoy with Never Been Kissed! <br /> <br />
