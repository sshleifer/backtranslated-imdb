This movie is great. Best game I have ever seen in my life. Ingvar E Sigurðsson is the best Icelandic actor and, of course, Hilmir Snær and Bjorn jörundur. Great music and sound. A harsh cold reality about a struggle of a man who has a lot of problems and people in his life. Black humor mixed with great actors and this style of European art films, it works, it meets in the best Icelandic film ever made. I say to you: "Look at this movie, you will not regret it". I gave it 9 stars. If you see an Icelandic movie in your life ... See this one
