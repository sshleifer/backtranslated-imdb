Harrowing series about life in Oz - an experimental prison where they try to rehabilitate the prisoners. There is gay sex, rape, torture, mutilation, murder, humiliation, tons of male nudity ... all in your face and in full force. <br /> <br /> It's also one of the best drama writings ever put on television and almost every actor is just great. As it was on the cable, there was no restriction on what they could say or show. There are many racist comments circulating here, but it's for all races. In fact, the white characters stand out badly (especially the Aryans) and the black characters, better and better (peace-loving Muslims). Hispanics do not have an important role to play and there is NO Asian prisoner. All the prisoners seem to be the daggers and ready to kill anyone at any time - but you still find yourself sympathetic to some of them. Even guards, counselors and prison doctors have serious problems. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it, but rent it - do not buy it. I have the whole collection and, to be perfectly honest, I do not think I want to see her again. It's an amazing tv but so dark, dark and depressing. I guess I have to sell everything online. <br /> <br /> I give him a 10.
