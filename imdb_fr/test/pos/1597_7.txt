A film to divide its viewers. Only critics evoke his funeral rhythm, instant zooms and persistent, persistent looks between the protagonists. The defenders underline the powerful performance of Dirk Bogarde and the reference photography of Venice by Pasqualino De Santis. <br /> <br /> Taken as a whole, this might suggest an indulgent and romantic elegy for the nobility of homosexual love (at the time, in 1971). it became consensually legal). In fact, Visconti has managed to create a film richer and more complex than such a vehicle. He put together his ideas - weaknesses and others - in a meticulously punctuated arc. <br /> <br /> Inside this one is indeed the central performance of Aschenbach Bogarde. Rather than a simper, Johnny, who became a gay recently, he manages to give a pathetic composer struck by a tragedy and a misunderstood integrity that sees the salvation of Tadzio. His hypnotized, staggering around an increasingly infernal Venice after the boy, is a simple metaphor of the artist's tenacity as to the truth compared to the dilettante crowd (and it is explicitly cut with such a back-and-forth ). <br /> <br /> Mahler's music may be a little overused, although it's appropriate. The Italian overdub is a weary anachronism, but fortunately, the acting does not suffer too much. 7/10
