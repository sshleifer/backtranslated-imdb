I can not surpass the quality of the score, the book and the performances. This is Sweeney Todd's first production I've ever seen so I do not have anyone else to compare it with. But the impact is so strong that I simply can not imagine better. <br /> <br /> First, there is music - take "Johanna" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing a vocal line mix incorporating the melodies of three songs. It's like a Bach chorale in this sense - just a composition masterpiece. And the structure of the underlying chords and chords are so perfect - a little melancholy, a little contentment, a little desire, all expressing the point of view of these three singers. <br /> <br /> Then - - the lyrics. Rhymes are so smart. Rhyming patterns sometimes seem random but they always add up at the end. (The DVD I watched contains subtitles, essential for appreciating dialogue and lyrics.) Sondheim deserves a literary award for his only poetry. <br /> <br /> Finally, the performances. I can not imagine anyone better than George Hearn. Why did not I hear about him before? His singing alone is masterful, but the reach of his playing is simply incredible. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song about "you and me at the seaside" - who could do it better? His timing is impeccable, the pitch is perfect, every beat of the score is counted; and his musical achievement is covered with a delightful comedy performance. <br /> <br /> It's a dark tale, but I found it was sometimes sweet; and the melody of "Johanna" continues to play in my head.
