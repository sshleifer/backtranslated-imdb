I thought I had witnessed all the wrinkles that the crime / gangster film had to offer, but the combination Garrett-Marcin-Hammett brings real thrills and surprises here, thanks to the inventive and energetic direction of Mamoulian, Lee's atmospheric photograph. Garmes, plus a remarkably clean movie montage and flawless special effects. The brilliant game helps too. Coop gives one of his most convincing performances as a reluctant bootlegger to the intrepid hay (kind of character progression he had to repeat in other roles such as Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (center photo) in her first major role is also a revelation. The directors receive great support from Paul Lukas, Wynne Gibson and Stanley Fields, as well as Robert Homans' detective. The film was obviously made with a considerable budget, which is brilliantly deployed in realistic and crowded settings.
