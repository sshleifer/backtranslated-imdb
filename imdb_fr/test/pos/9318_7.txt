Nothing better than an Android with the technology of the 80s and a nascent plot to pull your thoughts from the depths of your mind and get them trapped in a beautifully beautiful cast. Growing up in the 80s gave me the invaluable opportunity to see covers of "not quite human" on many special occasions. Given that my parents were never present during the screenings, I guess I probably would not like it as much as I did when I was a child. So maybe it's a movie out of your VHS collection and give to your kids, we can find it on the same tape as "The Apple Dumpling Trang" and an episode of "Tour of Duty", it's ie if you recorded LP Mode of course.
