It was easily one of the most bizarre of Ernest's films, especially with regard to the design of the production. What was happening with the uniforms of the pink guards? Unfortunately, this film probably destroyed the Ernest series, turning the series into a series directly in video format. However, Jim Varney gave one of his best performances by playing Nash, his criminal alter ego. A faux pas in the series, but it was not so serious in many ways (the electro man's routine was classic)
