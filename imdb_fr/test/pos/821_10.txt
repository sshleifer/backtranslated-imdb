Van Damme has made very good films over the years and this one already has ten. From Mexican decor to five-star fight scenes, this movie was incredible. The film only talks about patrollers protecting their territory, the Mexican border. The former seals of the navy smuggle drugs from Mexico to the United States of America, Van Damme and Scott Atkins offer amazing performances as cop and villain. Although this film was not as good as until the death, it still gave the action, the game and the film a five-star appearance. I always look forward to seeing these category b action movies and they are constantly improving. keep them coming van damme. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you liked movies like - Until Death, The Hard Body and the Second Commander.
