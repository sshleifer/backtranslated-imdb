An interesting complement to the real documentaries of John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, it does not deal with what ultimately killed Holmes, and he certainly could have benefited from it. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg had the most praise on this subject, but I had the impression that the real stars were Julianne Moore in the role of the mother who sniffs cocaine, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with a pornstar / stereophonist identity in wild parties and William H. Macy, whose wife is the ultimate bitch. Not to mention an Alfred Molina almost unrecognizable. Macy's New Year's Eve party and Cheadle's chances of finding a better life after robbing a bankrupt donut store are probably the two best scenes of the movie, or at least the two best shots. What this film does best is show how power can easily be corrupted in its different forms. However, none of the characters have apparently learned anything from their dark spiral as they bounce back and return to a normal life.
