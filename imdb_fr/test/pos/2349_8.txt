Naruto, the television series Anime, has produced 2 feature films and a third comes this summer. <br /> <br /> The first, released in the summer of 2004, was a fun adventure. featuring the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, one must be a blind chicken, deaf and a leg to deny the flaws of this film. While the first was very nice, there was a lot to improve. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all these aspects and excels. <br /> <br /> The action was incredibly cinematic. The lighting, decor and style were three times more effective than in the first film. In the first film, we had a basic action, a well animated and choreographed animation, but nothing is obvious, but the cinematography of this film was exceptional, the use of shadows and light combined to make the action more intense was very effective and added to the strength of the fighting. <br /> <br /> The animation was very good. It rivaled Disney, but since it's a movie about TV characters, the design and details of the characters are not unusual. However, the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they even used twice as many bells a second because there was absolutely nothing nervous about the animation, it was incredibly fluid. <br /> <br /> The music ... I think that's where the movie fails. The original composer / chef of the TV show was used for the film and I do not really think he did such a good job. The music reminded me a lot of songs used in old SNES games. The composer is very good, but the synthesizers used for the film could not convey the melody very well. However, they did not fail at all, adding a good accompaniment to the action. But with the exception of a few violin / string pieces in the end and some choral works, the music has not gone beyond the limits or done anything special. <br /> <br /> The story was fun. It was a typical scenario for Naruto that looked a lot like the first movies, except that, again, all that was wrong with the story of the first movie was improved. The characters were much more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the movie. It made you think that the movie would end from one second to the next, but then it would move, but instead of feeling trailed, the action and characters made it seem like everything was fresh and exciting. <br /> <br /> All in all, This movie is a good thing, but as good as it is, it definitely goes for the fans. I enjoyed the movie, but it's because ... I'm a fan! But I can see that, just like with Advent Children's Final Fantasy, the movie is not great, it just serves as a fantastic support service for a good hour and a half. Although I think this film is a good introduction to the series for current non-watchers, it will not give a complete effect to anyone other than those stuck to Naruto screens. However, despite everything, it was a fun movie to watch during this depressing period of upsetting fillers.
