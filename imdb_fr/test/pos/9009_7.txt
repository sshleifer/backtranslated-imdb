Spin-offs, for those who do not know it, are generally not successful because most of the original characters are absent. <br /> <br /> Here they are. You can not ask for a better set in the essentials. a silly little drawing, wanting nothing to amuse. <br /> <br /> JP Manoux, replacing David Spade, admirably retains Kuzco's ego but does not seem as boring as the character of Spade (a character Spade has created for decades and annoys after a time). He has a softer voice but it fits a little. <br /> <br /> Eartha Kitt, resuming her role as Yzma, is brilliant. He has not been given much praise since Batwoman centuries ago, except perhaps for his vile role in the Boomerang. It's funny to see how much the character looks like him. <br /> <br /> And Patrick Warburton. There's no way he's not funny, except when he's been completely lost in Men in Black 2. I'm one of his fans since Seinfeld, but unlike that character, he's playing a real nice guy that's trapped. So beautiful things. <br /> <br /> The animation is really beautiful as usually all Disney, but sometimes the design of the characters is a little too sweet. Never mind. Two out of three is not bad.
