Probably the best comedy for a long time. lets you laugh all the time! the acting is good and there are a lot of hilarious cameos like Ben stiller as a guy from the guitar store. The plot was not as good as I had hoped, but the comedy offsets that. I can only hope for a sequel, because it seems to me that they can still do a lot more. Even if it was 1 hour and 40 minutes, I wanted more at the end :) There is also a scene after the credits that is actually one of my favorite parts of the film! I suggest it to anyone who likes good comedy and certainly suggests it to fans of The D or Jack Black. You should also buy the album, the songs are so catchy and hilarious, the music is also top quality.
