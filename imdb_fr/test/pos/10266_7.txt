I had a good time watching Femina Ridens a few mornings back, a bit of a hangover. For most of the film, it's a two-handed movie, showing the games and the strange relationship of crazy doctor Philipe Leroy and the amazing Dagmar Lassander. I had already seen her in two Fulci films dying of a horrible death, but here she is beautiful and young hip. The film is quite predictable and certainly moderate from the point of view of exploitation, but entertaining because of its wonderful colorful kitsch feel. Scenography, music, lighting and cinematography are all Italian classics of the late 60's, a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and even if the thread of the plot is not too difficult To predict, there are enough unusual events and remarkably strange sites and seems to keep things interesting throughout. Both tracks are pretty good and it's worth repeating that Dagmar Lassander is doing really well. The music of Stelvo Cipriani is great too, perfectly adapted to the images. Director Pierro Schivazappa has developed a cracker here, but it's not perfect. Although very seductive, there is little substance here and the elements of exploitation are as sweet as possible. I guess it gives it a kind of charm and innocence, but I can not help but think that the subject could have been treated with more rumors, more threats, that sort of thing, all the more it's pretty simple to predict what's going to happen. I think this is a bit useless for the stronger exploitation fans and certainly not for those who want sex or nudity. It's more a matter of light and fun pop art, adorable but insignificant, like a bubble bath. Recommended primarily for those who love the 60s, Dagmar Lassander or decorations gently.
