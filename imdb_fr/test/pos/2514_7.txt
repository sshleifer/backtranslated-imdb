A bland title disguises this well-entrenched example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, proving that it's a thorny mix of successes, composed of several disparate elements: a period play, a romantic drama, a detective film, and a movie. political thriller. Interestingly, although manufactured by Fox, its protagonists ?? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck ?? were both usually associated with other studios; their composition on the screen is palpable and finally resulted in marriage in a few years. A little too young, Taylor is a dashing hero (Marine personally appointed by President McKinley to discover the guilty of cleaning up many banks); Unsurprisingly, he has barely recovered his identity (under the leadership of Brian Donlevy and Victor McLaglen) that he falls in love with a singer (naturally, Stanwyck) who has set his sights on the gang ?? Although, to tell the truth, singing is far from being the strong point of the actress! Likewise, in addition to having to prove his worth to join him, he must compete with McLaglen for Stanwyck's attentions; By the way, the practical joker character of the first one reminded me a lot of Charley Chase in SONS OF THE DESERT (1933), which, incidentally, was also directed by William A. Seiter. Later, Taylor hesitates to involve Stanwyck in the imminent lure and tries to resign from the president while he gets off with the girl ?? but the jealous rival disrupts his plans. The flight went wrong, we find Donlevy dead and the two others in prison; Taylor's hopes for McKinley's intervention ?? have meanwhile learned the identity of the "inner man" elusive and obviously important ?? are apparently annihilated when the president is murdered (which is a big plot, although the suspense resulting from the eleventh hour seems artificial)! To return to the clutter of styles of the film, even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows down the pace and it comes close to the thriller aspect, it shows a good production ?? with the actors already mentioned, supported by artists such as John Carradine (who disappears inexplicably after a single scene!), Douglas Fowley, Sig Rumann and, as two American presidents, Sidney Blackmer (the fizzy Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley)
