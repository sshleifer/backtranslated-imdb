Although it is generally recognized that one of the first martial arts movies to be played here in the West, its real impact is retrospective. Lo Lieh is VERY discreet since the beginning and many fight scenes, although hailed as innovative (as they were at the time of the release of the film), are a bit tame compared to what happened by the following the standard by which all others will be judged forever). This is not to say that FIVE NEEDS OF DEATH / KING BOXER is anything but a classic in itself, because it is. Like many of the main characters in many martial arts films, the character played by Lieh remains low for most of the film for a reason - but when it breaks loose, it effectively cleans the house. You can not ask for more than that.
