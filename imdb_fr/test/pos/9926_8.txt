One of his less known films, many horror fans have not yet understood this offer of Dario Argento, which is unfortunate. It is underestimated mainly because of the fact that very few people have seen it. The film boasts Argento gore, level A, with his usual shots on wild rock scores. While it is true that this script is not very complex, it is not as serious as the other entries of its kind, or his personal CV for that matter. <br /> <br /> This film symbolizes more "terror". that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission. Worth a visit any night.
