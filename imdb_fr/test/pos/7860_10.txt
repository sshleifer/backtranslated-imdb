Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this movie. It's a crisp, graphic picture, without visual graphics, well interpreted by all concerned and addresses some of the most taboo issues of the day, in an almost normal sitting state that has never been seen in no other film by this chronicler. I did not know what to expect to watch this: a movie about the civil war or some kind of camaraderie of the 70s with Eastwood coming down to a girls' school in the South. But in reality it is neither of these things, but rather an examination, an exploration and a descent into the souls of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the heart of the civilized. as one reviewer previously noted, none, none, the characters are sympathetic to the end of the film, but each of them is interesting, complex and enigmatic. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by the young Pamelyn Ferdin (you'll recognize this voice as soon as you hear it), a girl in a school of manners presided over by Geraldine Page amidst the chaos of the American Civil War, especially in the south. Soon, Page, Professor Elizabeth Hartman, charming young seductress Carol and even Ferdin (Amy) have emotional / sexual ties with Eastwood, each with their own unique needs, secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a nice man. he plays the girls on top of each other, always trying to get the sexual advantage. In the process, we discover real interesting things from latent lesbianism to incest. The Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that has far exceeded my expectations on all creative levels. This could be (except for Invasion of the Body Snatchers) the best Siegel movie. It's certainly one of Eastwood's best REAL performances. The page is still good and Hartman, Fe5rdin and other excellent. the gothic manse established for the school is actually claustrophobic. Some scenes with disturbing sexual connotations. And what is happening in Eastwood is a boost on much of the competition for the scary, strange, insane film.
