One of my favorite movies. Retail, led by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious dramatic situations with brilliant comic punches. An exact mix of character and history. Real people with real problems and everyone has a different relationship with each member of the family. Pass gently from sad to hilarious-funny. Read the quotes. It's the best adaptation of Neil Simon's play. <br /> <br /> If you want to know more about Eugene check, Biloxi Blues (starring Matthew Broderick who played in both versions of the scene) is OK, a little darker. Stay away from Broadway Bound, a channel made for television.
