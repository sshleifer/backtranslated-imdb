I saw "Sweeney Todd" on Broadway in 1980. He starred George Hearn and featured most of the casting directors who participated in the production of the national touring company, recorded on tape for television in Los Angeles. Angeles in 1982. Last night, I watched the new DVD release of Los Angeles production, although I own the videotape for many years. The production and performance could hardly have been better, but the age of the soundtrack has been demonstrated, as the audio and video quality is below modern standards, even on a freshly squeezed DVD. Nevertheless, I still give him 10 out of 10 because of the great work and amazing performances of George Hearns and Angella Lansbury. Even today, my most memorable memory of a live musical theater performance should be Hearn's rendition of "These are My Friends". "You will lose rubies", brrr.
