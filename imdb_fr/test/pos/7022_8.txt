Good music, good dancing, a sexy star (Swayze) and the current sexual desire shown by a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters who are mainly motivated by lust and that's a nice change. I also think that the film shows very well what it is like to be a teenager who is dealing with class problems and that his ideals suddenly come up against reality. Of course, there are difficult moments - it's, after all, a movie musical - but overall it's a real pleasure - a fun and politically informed romance. This film also has one of my favorite movie lines of all time: "I wore the watermelon."
