"Dope Sick Love" is a truly remarkable documentary made for HBO about two couples of lovers addicted to the heroine wandering the streets of New York. I managed to catch him one night by accident and I found him absolutely hypnotic. There is no narration and we never see interviews with the subjects, the camera follows them, like a third eye, completely detached. Followers do not even seem to be aware of being filmed! (or at least, they do not seem to care). The film is incredibly straightforward. Some of the most candid I have ever seen. This is as real as possible. The details of what it's like to be on the street and addicted to heroin. We watch them ass fuck, shoot, make up, tinker and even mimic cops to steal people, and about a million other little details that less attentive documentary filmmakers leave out. <br /> <br /> is really horrible. It's like looking at a guy who was desperately looking for a fix he had lost. I found myself praying for him to find him, just so that his misery stopped temporarily. And when he finds it, the guy literally dances in the street. <br /> <br /> The cyclical nature of addiction becomes very apparent when you look at it. Everything is about to get the next score to these people, but the next score seems to be worth the huge difficulties they are going through. <br /> <br /> I would like a copy of this document if anyone knows where it is available. Highly recommended, if you can catch it on HBO.
