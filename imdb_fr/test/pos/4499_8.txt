Based on Khaled Hosseini's bestselling novel, The Kite Runner is a story of friendship, betrayal and the struggle for redemption. Taking place in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the Taliban era, all elements are present in a dramatic drama, but under the direction of Marc Forster (Finding Neverland), the film lacks the genre of burning emotional impact. this makes it a memorable, though entertaining, well-played and sometimes moving experience. <br /> <br /> Taking place in 1978 in Kabul, but filmed in Kashgar, China, because of the dangers in Afghanistan, the friendship that opens The film between two young boys is real, even if they are far apart from each other in social and economic conditions. Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi), 12, lives in a posh environment with her rich and educated father Baba, portrayed by the great Homayoun Ershadi, although his fortune seems a bit incongruous in one of the poorest countries in the world. Although Baba is a loving father, he confesses to Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), his friend and business associate, that Amir is too soft and that there is "something missing with this boy". The family has a servant, Ali (Nabi Tanha), who loves everything he needs and whose son, Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmoodzada), is Amir's best friend. <br /> <br /> Both are separated not only by class, but also by ethnicity. Amir, a burgeoning writer, is a member of the Pashtun majority while Hassan is a Hazara, a minority sect (10% of the population). Although we know little about their traditions or their social situation, they are united by their kite love, a popular sport in Kabul, and by Amir's reading of Afghan folk tales to Hassan, an illiterate. The annual kite competition for boys is an important event in their lives and the effects of CGI are breathtaking. The kite ropes are covered with glass particles and the winner is the one whose rope can cut other kites into the sky. Hassan is the kite runner who has a strange ability to locate fallen kites and bring them to Amir as a trophy. However, after Amir wins the important competition, there is a sad event that will mark the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> Bullies, led by the eldest, Assef (Elham Ehsas), who will later appear as a ruthless Taliban leader, attack Hassan because he is a Hazara and rape him brutally (off camera) while Amir is too scared to try to stop him. Unable to cope with his lack of courage (although one wonders what he could have done to help Hassan), guilt becomes the driving force of his relationship with Hassan and their friendship is tense. In one incident, Amir throws grenades at Hassan as if to beg him to defend himself and punish him for his passivity, but Hassan does not bite the hook and remains faithful despite the cowardice of his friend. When Amir urges his father to dismiss the servants and accuses Hassan of stealing his watch, Hassan admits the theft even if he is innocent. Eventually, circumstances force Ali and Hassan out of shame. When the Russians invade Afghanistan, Baba and Amir also leave, taking refuge in Pakistan, then in Fremont, California, where the story begins years later. <br /> <br /> Baba is forced to work at a gas station and sell trinkets at an open-air market while Amir (Abdul Salam Yusoufzai), apparently living as a human being, studies to become a writer at the local community college. After falling in love and marrying Soraya (Atossa Leoni), daughter of a general in Kabul, Amir finally publishes his first novel, A Season of Ashes. Everything seems very positive. When Amir receives a call from Rahim Khan asking him to visit Pakistan, telling him "there is a way to become good again", the specter of guilt that has haunted him from the beginning makes Amir go home. He returns to Pakistan and, with great risk, returns to an Afghanistan now controlled by the Taliban to confront the demons of his past and discover a surprising secret in the process. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner is a sensitive film that deals with the inner pain of knowing that you are not faithful to your best instinct and that you can go beyond shame to a new level. of responsibility. This does not hide the pain caused in Afghanistan by the wars and the revolution, pain that is perhaps represented by the suffering of Hassan. Unfortunately, it reduces the complexities of the good and the bad and distorts what really happened, exonerating the United States, which engaged in secret anti-government operations in the country, from any responsibility in the disastrous war that has claimed more than a million lives and lives. millions of people with disabilities. Although we are inspired by great children and driven by the kite's freedom, The Kite Runner gives up his power when he tries to substitute melodrama for the story.
