Why take a perfectly good original drama, based on a perfectly good novel, and redo it in quasi-musical? And throw it with actors lacking exclusively talent in singing or dancing? Much like "Showgirls" or the last two "Star Wars" movies, "Lost Horizon" is full of unintentional laughter. Who can forget Sir John Gielgud smiling in his Dali Lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretative dance for the Republican Party ("Family")? <br /> <br /> Or Sally Kellerman lurking with love to George Kennedy, doing her best Best impression as she jumps from one rock to another ("Every Little Thing You Do")? And my favorite, Bobby Van, embodying the strength of the American education system ("Question Me An Answer")? I'm looking forward to releasing the DVD, because I hope it will contain the comments of Liv Ullmann, who will finally explain what she thought when she agreed to do this movie!
