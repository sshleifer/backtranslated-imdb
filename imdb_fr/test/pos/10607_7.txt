If you've ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know it's longer than most movies because of the routines of songs and dances (each takes more than five minutes). Fortunately, this one has less routines of songs and dances and integrates in the duration "standard" of the film. Do not get me wrong, I love Bollywood movies, but I tend to go fast in song and dance. I bought this DVD because I am a fan of Ian Bohen. Although his role was not as important as I had hoped, he still had plenty of time on the screen. And his character was very different from his other roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good movie. Like most Bollywood films, there is at least one element of controversy / conflict in traditional Indian culture. But true love triumphs over adversity and a happy ending is won by all.
