What a tribute to his father! He set out to find out more about a man he knew little, and at the end of the trip, I think Nathaniel Kahn is happy with what he has learned and felt personally. The film has 5 years of filming and a quarter of a century after his death, the total commitment of Louis I. Kahn in his work is a constant desire to build buildings significant for humanity and timeless for the whole world, with a Overview of his life is proudly described by his son Nathaniel in the documentary "My Architect: The Journey of a Son". <br /> <br /> The film is by no means an anthology of Louis' work. There are many books and archival documents containing archives of Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. This documentary works wonderfully, screenwriter-director and co-producer Nathaniel Kahn was looking for the man he briefly described as a father. <br /> <br /> The film is in chapters. In "Heading West", we are at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. It's a show that deserves to be seen - Kahn's whole concept of building and environment, optimizing lighting for scientists at work, is incredible. From a former colleague who worked with "Lou" 35 years ago, we heard about his meticulous attention to detail, as well as his "agility" - he certainly did not mince words in his critics. A memorable scene occurs when the camera goes back and we see Nathaniel skating on the Salk Institute plaza - a tiny figure resembling a child playing happily in the hands of his father. <br /> <br /> The segment "Immigrants" made us meet Anne Tyng, the architect who collaborated with 'Lou' and gave him a daughter, Alex. At age 80, Tyng's return with Nathaniel's film crew to the Bath House project in Trenton, NJ, was nostalgic. In "Go to Sea" we see the barge of the American Wind Symphony Orchestra, entirely made of steel, and meet Robert Boudreau, surprised by Nathaniel when he finally announced that he was the son of "Lou". Boudreau was touched, he said he saw Nathaniel at the age of six with his mother (Harriet Pattison) and that he should not tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was an emotional "stifling" reunion. <br /> <br /> Like his father "The Nomad", Nathaniel went to Jerusalem and learned the synagogue project initiated by his father but not realized. He visited the Wailing Wall and saw that his yarmulke was still falling / being "refreshed", his head made me understand that he did not have to be "totally" Jewish to be the son of his father. We continue to sit with his two half-sisters in the Family Affairs segment. We also hear him talking to his mother in Maine, and after talking to former employees in his father's office, we come to understand how his father worked hard and practically lived there, sleeping on a rug in the offices, weekends and others. <br /> <br /> "The end of the journey" took us to Ahmedabad, India, in the building of the Indian Institute of Management. Talking with architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. In the end, Nathaniel found Louis Kahn, his father, very much alive - his spirit lives in him. This documentary is for me a puzzle. I had tears in my eyes most of the time - it was very touching and I am impressed by the man, the architect and his son, and by the women of his life, besides his works and famous buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to the "whole world", juggling between work and three families (we could say that he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration). As Shamsul Wares, the architect of the Bangladesh Capital Complex (completed 9 years after the death of 'Lou'), said so poignantly: Louis Kahn has given much to the people of Bangladesh, spending time in Bangladesh , including the culture of the place and the people. - in addition to giving them democracy through what he did, and for such a devoted man, his family often missed him. It seems that the price to pay to be good comes with unavoidable personal sacrifices. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of King Vidor's 1949 "The Fountainhead" (a good black-and-white drama on Max Steiner's music), based on Ayn Rand's novel, with Gary Cooper as uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals and by Patricia Neal as a parallel woman in his life. <br /> <br />
