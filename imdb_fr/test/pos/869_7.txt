A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel "Waltz into Darkness" by the writer Cornell Woolrich. It's a drama rather than a film noir, which tries to send a message that love changes your life, that is to say, your love for a person and the love you have received from him . A rich man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally realized that he was the only one to love him. Belmondo played well as usual, while Michel Bouquet, a little young, played his eternal role of detective or police officer. Frankly, Bouquet was not as impressive in this film, but Catherine Deneuve's performance was less good. She was not so convincing in her role as prostitute then wife / wife of Louis Mah√© (Belmondo). For those who like to visit the world, the film offers the opportunity to see part of the Ascension Island and the city of Lyon in France.
