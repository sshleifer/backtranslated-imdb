Nikki Finn is the kind of girl I would like to marry. Never boring, always thinking positively, good with animals As a reviewer wrote, a little too much peroxide, lipstick and eyebrows (only Madonna could get away with that). But that's why I love Nikki Finn, she's not your ordinary girl. She makes things happen, always exciting and always honest. Of course, she steals, but she does not steal and kill (unless you want to fuck her). She knows what rules can be broken and which ones should be respected. She knows what to take and what can not be stolen. If you need a favor from her, she is 100%. Bottom line: She knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always loving (which is why she has a passion for wild animals) and is totally dedicated to those she loves and loves. <br /> <br /> Who is this girl? She is the girl for me.
