After watching Desperate Living, I became addicted to John Waters' films. I heard about Pink Flamingos and I had to watch it and, boy, it was worth it! Believe what you hear is rubbish! It is packed with all that is dirty which is actually the main plot of this movie. It contains the following: Incest, cannibalism, rape, chicken shagging, nudity (as you've never seen before - beware of baby birthday party animators), poo, arson, trash trailer , perversion, transsexuality, egg fetishism, disguise ... ... you get the picture. Above all, it's a must! Just be wary of the birthday party leader and the Divine who walks in the park!
