When I watch a short film like Boy-Next-Door, I feel like a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I am happy. I'm looking at something that has been well thought out, executed seamlessly and just bold enough to be interesting. On the other hand, I complain about the level of comedy generally produced. Television and movies are so often wrapped up in easy and condescending shit that we find ourselves judging excellence on a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who without the "benefit" of studio notes or a substantial budget; can create a really cool comic gem. Producers and network managers should contact Travis Davis for equipment and stop contracting with people just because their resume or agent may request it. I hope Boy-Next-Door caught the attention of the right people to make Davis's job easier. It's really fun and very well done!
