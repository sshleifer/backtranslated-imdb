I totally disagree with the person who first commented on this film. For me, this story tells the story of a man suffering from a hormonal growth disorder who seeks his best to seek the love for which he aspires. He tried to do his best to integrate into society and did not seem to accept it. <br /> <br /> He then met someone who treated him with the love of the best friend and showed him the way to receive the love he had always wanted to receive. to have. the man who created all this happiness has received something important from the giant, namely the love of the family and the wife. <br /> <br /> and comedy, this is simply to make the audience feel laughter in some places shows. <br /> <br /> and I must admit that it made me tear a little.
