Bridget Fonda has disappointed me many times over the years, but she had my full attention in BREAK UP. It is true that the story lacks critical details in many places, but I continued to scrutinize Fonda for clues as to what was significant in the story and she did not let me down. The look in her eyes in the last scene, as she gives herself courage to literally put one foot in front of the other in front of her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of acts facial. I believed it completely, perhaps because I had known and admired several "tough guys" who had survived similar abuse situations. And they did it without becoming enemies, but it's my own optimistic projection of the character from Fonda to BREAK UP.
