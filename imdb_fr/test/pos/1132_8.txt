I'm not a big fan of television ... but when I saw the first episode of Greek, I could not wait until next week! I do not miss the show for NOTHING! <br /> <br /> THANK YOU GOD for the DVR! LOL I'm in love with Cappie ... he's acting like a bad boy, but he's so nice ... Everyone has his own character so we have pretty much all types of people. You could always bring in a Hispanic and a chubby. <br /> <br /> I did not go to school in the United States, so I never liked the idea of ​​fraternity houses. told me about the show I did not pay attention to, until he asked me to watch it and I did not do better, I accepted. The first night, I laughed so much that I had to keep watching. <br /> <br /> So ... I'm with the other people who voted for this show to continue! I hope a second, a third and who knows how many more episodes! It's a very good show, very entertaining and entertaining!
