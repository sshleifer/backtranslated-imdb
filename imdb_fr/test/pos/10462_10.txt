it's one of the best films I've ever seen .... the unprepared landscape ... the isolation ... the ignorant bigots hidden behind their religion ... a backdrop for a bit of sophistication and vocabulary ... the acting is quite natural ... but for me as a "gourmet", the best is the choice and the preparation of the party .. I spent time in Paris and I know the kitchen well ... whether English coffee really exists or not I do not know, but I know similar establishments. The menu of Babette and the choice of wines are authentic ... and of course, the end where, in spite of themselves, the perfect meal brings them back to the friendship, it is the only possible denouement. 10 out of 10 movies and should be seen by anyone with enough brains and taste to understand it
