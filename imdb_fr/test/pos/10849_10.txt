When I rented this film, I almost expected it to be a low-budget movie, minus an Indy movie, but I decided to try it. I started watching the first part and I could not get away until 3 hours later. It was by far one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. From writing to staging to performances, I laughed, cried and sang throughout Nan Astley's rite of passage, from innocence to adulthood. Rachael Stirling is phenomenal in this movie. I had never heard of her before, but I will always remember the vulnerability and strength I felt in her performance. She, Keeley Hawes, and Jodhi May are amazing insofar as they guide you through the emotional turmoil most people feel about another form of sexuality. The fact that the film takes place in the 1890s not only raises public awareness of homosexuality at this time, but also makes a statement about our society. You must see this movie and, probably like me, you will make a trip to the store to add it to your collection.
