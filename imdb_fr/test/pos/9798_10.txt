The young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are remarkable in this excellent film about two boys who promised to "take care of their mother" and how they manage when their new father-in-law starts hitting the youngest. The distribution of support around the boys is also excellent. The script really enters the mind and heart of an imaginative child. It's hard to believe that Wood could look like Tom Hanks, but it's not new to Hollywood. Honestly, this is my only criticism of the film.
