This solid burlesque comedy in black and white with a dark plot (but desperately artificial) is a real pleasure for the crowd that will make you scream with laughter (as well as rolling your eyes in disbelief). <br /> <br /> This is the old psychopath in a train story but it does not matter, because the thriller part of the film seems almost to be a simple counterweight to the antics of the great actor Robert Gustafsson . His unhappy, almost incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a way that almost rivals Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> What attracted me the most in the film is the one who is stuck between the improbable and the hilarious are the daily joys and annoyances of the train. They add a very appreciated sense of realism and recognition. <br /> <br /> This comedy-thriller has certainly borrowed most of its "suspense" from Hitchcock and should, in my opinion, be monitored only for its comic value (which is indeed high). In addition to Gustafsson, Lars Amble's strong performance as a deliciously cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend it.
