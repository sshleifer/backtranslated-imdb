I was fortunate recently to see Ingrid Bergman's name associated with a movie I had never seen (or even heard) about AMC. What a stroke of luck. <br /> <br /> Marveling at his flawless, homogeneous performance is not the only reason to stay awake and watch this movie late. The writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent. <br /> <br /> Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was almost perfect and Goldie Hawn (surprisingly) was fabulous. Tender at the same time, demanding, then simply clumsy. It happens that, even in the film, the most hardened spectator finds himself caught in the story and forgets that it is a film. <br /> <br /> That Bergman could steal a dance scene from a crowd of 20 - olds was amazing to watch. She is effortless in her return to the screen (at age 54?). The support cast was excellent and the lines ... the lines are exquisite. <br /> <br /> A romantic comedy of the 5 best of all time.
