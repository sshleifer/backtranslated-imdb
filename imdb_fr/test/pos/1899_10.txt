Has anyone been interested in what cinema filming in the 1970s looked like to watch this movie? Some dialogues in this movie are so funny that the summary of my submission. Also make sure that the microphone boom appears in some of the scenes as well as among the best karate actions of all time. Do not take this film seriously or you will be disappointed, go ahead with an open mind and enter the world of one of the world's most wicked mutha, Dolemite !!! The editing is sensible, as if it had been cut with a razor, but again, this movie is so much more than what you see in the movie, it has influenced the black community in a way that you can not understand !!!
