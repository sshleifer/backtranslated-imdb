THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> The cell, like Antz, must be viewed twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was mediocre, but the movie impressed me so much after watching that I decided to rent it again. I did it and I found the film a lot nicer. The cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams of images and ideas on the ground that could not be matched. The film's script can sometimes be clumsy, as well as the acting, but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life. Oscar-nominated makeup is also bold and cautious, while beautiful costumes and bright decorations have gone unnoticed. Tarsem Singh, who also directed video clips, becomes completely crazy with his staging and the result is good. He has a lot of talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give him the chance. Overall, The Cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoids being too tacky, making it a great and fun watch.
