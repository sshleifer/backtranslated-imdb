The film is rather a fake documentary about corruption throughout the American system. The correlations of those who vote who do not count are thus proven in machines that end up voting a comedian at the Oval Office. Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to portray ourselves as we have been laughing at us for years around the world. Bushism has become a way of life for Americans and will be the only thing that will remain after his resignation from his post. Oddly, the only honest person is someone who has not even been elected to the position and who is telling the truth in the end. The story is very subtle and if you go there to laugh, it will not happen. Leave a lot to think. Overall, I appreciated.
