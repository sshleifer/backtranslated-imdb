After reading some of these reviews, it's obvious that some people have misunderstood. What's great in this film (here's the point), which is amazing in this film, what is amazing in this film is that there is no proselytism. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece that allows an audience to think for themselves. They are just kids doing what kids do - without awareness. We all went to school with kids like that. We are numb by reality / invention based on fiction, cinema, television, news. <br /> <br /> Feck's girlfriend (Dennis Hopper the great) is on her own and her relationship is worth the movie. <br /> <br /> Few films were made before or since, at the height of the intelligence of this film. AMEN. <br /> <br />
