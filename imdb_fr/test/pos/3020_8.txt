The cell is weak on the plot, filled with holes and has pretty ugly acting too. but none of this matters, because director Tarsem Singh has given us one of the most breathtaking movies of all time. the whole plot is just an excuse to let tarsem have fun and plunge you into the mind of a serial killer, bringing to the audience shocking, enjoyable, breathtaking, breathtaking images . <br /> <br /> the images of this beautiful film will stay with you for a long time. This film is a perfect case for the theory of "suspension of disbelief". Forget the stupid plot, just let your senses be overwhelmed by the images. and J.Lo is beautiful enough to be added to the rest of tarsem work. cinematography is heartbreaking, music haunts and costumes just stunning. <br /> <br /> the film is less a film than a work of art. it's just that the medium is no longer a canvas, it's the big screen and the celluloid. one of the most refreshing films of this decade. The cell is a must. A new bold step in the making of a film. <br /> <br /> an exciting 8 !!
