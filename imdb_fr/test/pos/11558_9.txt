When Melville's "Stone or Ambiguities" appeared in bookstores in 1852, his first publication since "Moby Dick" a year earlier, public reaction was similar to that found in BDIM's "POLA X" journals. The newspapers have even published titles such as: "Melville Insane!" which, of course, he was not. But when we compare the writing styles found in "Moby Dick" and "Pierre", we find in the second a break with the simple and often declamatory style of the first. He obviously imitated the overflowing style of Victorian novels, now forgotten, which easily sold better than his immortal "Moby Dick". However, he did not just create the type of product his publishers wanted, and that would surely have sold. His version of a Victorian novel was twisted, perhaps cynical, but brilliant in its synthesis. The alternative title: "Ambiguities" is entirely appropriate. As Peter seeks and thinks to find the truth, we do not know who to believe or who to believe. In search of happiness, he becomes more and more unhappy. <br /> <br /> "POLA X" is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, located in modern or almost modern France. Although, in some ways, it leaves little to the imagination and shows us graphically the incestuous relationships that Melville could only guess at, the ambiguities that make the novel and its message so appealing are perfectly intact. The questions he raises are questions that few films have thought of asking, but the answers are left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I recommend a reading of the novel, which is much shorter than "Moby Dick", before seeing this movie. I hope more people will discover this tempting film.
