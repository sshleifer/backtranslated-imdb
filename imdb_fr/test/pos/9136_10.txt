I decided to write a comment on this amazing movie, because here on IMDb, it is mentioned that John Woo, a mediocre director who made decent films in his pre-America years, but completely ruined his reputation by his latest American film, plans to redo it. Well, here are two reasons why this is one of the most stupid ideas for a remake: The plot of the movie is simple and even clich√©d by the current standards, but what makes this movie a chef-de Work is his unique action direction of Mellville, cinematography, music and his style. Today, no director can make such a film, it is impossible to create such an atmosphere in a film in the film sector targeted the current box office. <br /> <br /> John Woo made a more or less decent film borrowed from The Samurai - The Killer of Melville, but remember, it was realized when the director was not spoiled by large budgets and expensive (in wages) but not expensive (in the merits) actors. So, what I'm saying is that this is one of the greatest movies ever made, with another film from Melville - The Samurai. Look at this. And even if the remake will be done, try to avoid it before seeing the big original first.
