The representation of the Marines in this film is perfect. Action scenes are among the best ever produced in terms of accuracy of content. The uniforms and weapons of the American and German troops were perfect. The costumes and weapons of the Berbers were also perfectly accurate. This film could easily be used to teach the militaria of this period and was used for this purpose by the USMC Academy. The scenes of Roosevelt's shooting and the rifles he was using were magnificent. Getting so many period weapons in such good condition is a testament to the attention to detail and presentation of this film. Millius is a genius.
