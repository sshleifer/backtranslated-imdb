A very insightful psychological thriller! Footprints is a stylish example of the mighty Italian cinema of the '70s. And Luigi Bazzoni, an underrated director and a visually stunning' author '. The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere and never disappoints, especially in its sad and dramatic finale! Florinda Bolkan delivers an excellent performance, rich in nuances and touching sensitivity, being able to represent a black lady who is not only fascinating, but also painfully real and tragically lonely. But distribution is a treat, too! Lila Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (the mysterious girl near the beach), Italian screen legend Caterina Boratto and the magnificent Queen of the movie B Evelyn Stewart in the short but bewitching role of the protagonist's friend! And Klaus Kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo! It's odd to see how films like Footprints were incredibly well done! The creepy and scary cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, the stylized sets and decorations, Nicola Piovani's spellbinding score and above all the story, so intense and disturbing, so intelligently superimposed and structured! A thriller with fantastic elements, but above all with a soul and a personal vision. I wish that movies like Footprints are not forgotten! I wish the films were more insightful and personal today as they were back in the 60s and 70s! And yes ... I hope someone will soon realize a widescreen DVD remastered numerically from this little masterpiece!
