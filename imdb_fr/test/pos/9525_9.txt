The Railway Children, at least this 1970 film version written and directed by this long-time British actor, Lionel Jeffries, is a flawless classic. It tells a story of childhood with a lot of simplicity and charm; sentimentality is muted; the evocation of childhood adventures implies; and Jeffries brings intelligence and style to his production. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family leads an idyllic life in Edwardian London. The father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are well behaved and affectionate, their home is warm and comfortable. Then, one night, during the Christmas holidays, two men appear on the doorstep, speak gently to the father, then take him away. In an instant, the lives of Mrs Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and young Peter (Gary Warren) have been changed. Only their courage and good humor will bring them to a successful conclusion. Now that poverty is rife in poverty, Mrs. Waterbury takes her children to live in an old moldy brick house in the countryside, near a railroad, not far from a small village with a train station. The children discover the rail and sit regularly on a small hill to signal to the passengers that the train passes. One day, an old man, going to his business in the city, looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving his hand. He will soon play an important role in history. <br /> <br /> As time goes on, Mrs. Waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to her children. She starts writing stories to make money. She teaches them their lessons and provides them with a source of warmth and security. The story, however, concerns these three children, especially Bobbie. At 14, she is old enough to share her mother's concerns, but young enough to live the adventures she has with her sister and brother. They find a poor man at the station who does not speak English. They discover that he is a Russian refugee who does not know where his wife and child are. They insist that he come with them home and their mother takes him. Shortly after, the children wrote a big sign to the old gentlemen on the train to ask him for help. They help a young man participating in a steeple who breaks a leg in a rail tunnel. Soon, he is at home in convalescence. They decide to organize a birthday party for the station chief, a man with few friends and several children who undermines his dignity. It will not be long before children help him understand the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, the three children face all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and manage to make sure that all the problems end successfully. <br /> <br /> But what about their own problems? Bobbie finally learns from his mother that his father was taken away because he was accused of treason, of revealing state secrets to the Russians. Will Bobbie be able to find a way to help? Will the old man be anything more than just an old man in a passing train? Will their father's case be reopened? Will there be a happy ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny Agutter was almost 18 when she filmed her role; She plays Bobbie, 14, with a lot of naturalness and charm. As important as other actors, including Dinah Sheridan as a mother, Agutter is at the heart of the story. For me, it is the talent of Jenny Agutter, the style and restraint of Lionel Jeffries that make this film so memorable. The problems of history are undoubtedly serious but they will be solved. And Jeffries does not just give us a perfectly adapted and realized film, he adds touches that are barely noticed but that charm us. This could include a split second of a freeze frame when two people are speaking; or a slow close-up of a small yellow wildflower in the grass outside Bobbie's house, then a slow retreat of a yellow oil lamp inside; or the realization that a pretty interior shot, a view of the green countryside or a look at the station from a hill ... suddenly recall these charming Edwardian hand-tinted drawings of a perfect past. <br /> <br /> Maybe this sweet story can not compete with the time kids need to hone their Nintendo monster skills. I'm pretty sure this would never get the attention of most of their parents, especially those weaned on Batman and Leone. Still, it is a film perfectly set up and should not be forgotten. By the way, 19 years later, the story was taken up as a television show. This time, Jenny Agutter played the mother.
