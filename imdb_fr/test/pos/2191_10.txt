I saw this version about ten years ago and I have been looking for it ever since. I recently found an original version of VHS and bought it for $ 125.00. It sounds crazy, but if you consider it one of the best shows that the Broadway music scene has ever produced, you would not even think twice. a Broadway ticket today. I really hope they will reissue it soon as a DVD. It's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by everyone!
