It can be difficult to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. Perhaps, because I never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry. True poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is incredible and useless to say that Venice is used as a perfect landscape: dark, dark and sad, like the soul of Bogard. And classical music is more than just a basic accompaniment to human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of European cinema.
