This harmonious and silent little film becomes a masterpiece of human dignity. It is intelligently structured, filled with small significant details and important secondary intrigues. It tells the story of a man of great humanity without positioning himself politically, but to make life a precious right (not an obligation) and emphasize the right of everyone to choose. It benefits from the richness of different landscapes (mental and physical) and languages ​​(important detail). Excellent actor from each of the actors, especially the incredible Javier Bardem. Its presence on the screen is so strong that you forget it is a fiction. The film has a wonderful rhythm, it is beautifully shot and remarkably realized. Making a film on such a difficult subject with understanding, humor and heart requires real talent. Six out of five stars.
