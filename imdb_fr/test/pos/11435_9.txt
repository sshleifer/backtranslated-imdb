When I went to the movies, I was not expecting much. I did not know anything about this movie but it was the only movie I could see because I was in a small town at the time. So I saw this movie and I was fascinated! "The stelle che n'c'Ã¨" is a journey through the new industrial China and it shows itself honestly! You see most of the ugly places in China and see what is really happening with this new industrialization. The main characters are sad but I hope people. It's the naive Italian guy who can not believe what he sees. She is a Chinese translator missing from her son. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but poetic every time! A wonderful movie with wonderful actors! There is only one star missing!
