I have watched this movie many times over the years and I still find it an entertaining experience. As a retired airline pilot, I am interested in most aviation films and this is one of the best. I know that Lindbergh was only 25 years old during his historic solo flight to Paris and that James Stewart was almost 50 years old when making this film, but I can forget that Stewart was always one of my actors preferred. makes one of his usual outstanding performances as a "solitary eagle". <br /> <br /> There is a good mix of comedy and drama throughout the movie and a good use of flashbacks. It is also useful for James Stewart to be a real-life pilot, both military and civilian.
