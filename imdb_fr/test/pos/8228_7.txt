Make a title search on Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is the only missing movie in the list. One of the four films Scott made at the RKO during its heyday (1947), the others are still easy to obtain. Liberal, Kansas is just southwest of Dodge City and is a powder keg on the verge of exploding between bikers driving longhorns in Trail Street, the city's main street, and those who feed our belly. It will take a strong man like Bat Masterson to switch from one to the other and put the city back on the order. Plus I will not say except that Scott movies usually have only one pretty girl and this one has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT has always played against men who could be admired for their sense of honor, their courage, their coolness and their willingness to do things right. Fifty years ago, parents could send their children to see a Scott movie with confidence and learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN co-starred in this movie, playing a good guy to change. In real life, RYAN was one of the many WWII heroes who played in American movies. How sad we are these days. George Clooney teaches our young people that we must sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in Munich and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 draws its moral compass from too much cocaine and attachment to the far-fetched left. I wonder how all this is happening in the Liberal, Kansas. After all, the Liberals were not a big word 150 years ago when the city was named.
