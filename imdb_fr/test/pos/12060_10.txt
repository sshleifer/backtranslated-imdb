I realized that a lot of people commented on the racist and homophobic nature of this show, but I do not think that's the purpose of this show. <br /> <br /> The show talks about parents who are not ready for kids and are not ready for teens. This show contributes to bringing humor to a very difficult subject that is sometimes too neglected: parenting. <br /> <br /> Yes, we all had programs that included the family, for example: Family Matters, Step by Step, Family Ties, Full House .... but it would still have the same old recipe for his episodes. "Steph" cuts school and gets caught by his father. They have a heart to heart conversation and the music is played. It's over with two weeks of writing that, after a "aww, dad ...", gets a smile and the show is over. Where is the comedy in such a situation? Where is realism? With The War at Home, you get real situations from a real father-like figure. Most parents watching this show hear some of the lines that parents have written and they either laugh (because they know they said it!), Either they nod their head (because they know that they thought about it and they never had the courage to say it!) The War at Home has situations that bring out a beautiful comedy as a father who thinks his son is gay. It does not seem funny, most think it makes the father homophobic, but the comedy tells the story of a gruff father who tries to talk to his son to open. Which parent knows what to say, especially in a situation like this? I highly recommend this show to anyone who, to my knowledge, has a sense of humor, especially to those who are young parents or who were young when they had children. You are referring to a show like this when you are.
