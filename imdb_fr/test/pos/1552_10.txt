This film brings the psychological thriller to new depths. Well written by Shane Black, the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of director Jack Swanstrom. Obviously, Swanstrom is an administrator we should be wary of in the future. His strength lies in adapting personal experiences both on screen and in class. <br /> <br /> This thought-provoking film is a must for anyone who can appreciate action, drama, suspense and mystery. As with all good movies, the viewer embarks on his own journey to find his individual interpretation of the film. The mystic aspect of the film intrigues and adds to the suspense. You find yourself looking for answers with Marquette. The audience loved the film on the festival circuit - with many awards received, they must have accepted that A.W.O.L. (2006) is worth watching. <br /> <br /> I would like to own a copy. How can I get one?
