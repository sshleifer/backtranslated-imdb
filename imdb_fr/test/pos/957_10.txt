I must admit, I absolutely loved this movie. Of course, knowing that you know that Frankie Muniz, star of "Malcolm's in the Middle", and Amanda Bynes, still so sweet, "The Amanda Show", have starred in this children's comedy as two friends that I'm sure we can all -late to. The film is about a young boy, Jason Shepard (Frankie) and his friend Kaylee (Amanda), embarking on an adventure in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> AHEAD SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As it begins, Jason is typical A 14 year old boy who lies to get around the problems of everyday life. One day, Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf (the big bad director). Jason's English newspaper is stolen by Wolf and begins the adventure with kaylee to regain his father's trust. They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to recover. Frankie and Amanda do all kinds of crazy stunts to recover Wolf. It's enough for him to call Jason's father and tell him he stole his idea. But the end is not really a surprise, to be the good proveles and the winner. <br /> <br /> The story is cute and has a fifth grade humor, but you expect it to be PG rated. I really believe it's one of this year's best family comedies. Not only do kids play well, an outstanding cast, is it well written, but it's a good clean and fun game. It made me laugh and fall in love with this innocent message. I highly recommend it and would like to disagree with the one who gave it a zero out of ten. The unemployed critic is not unemployed for nothing. I give him (well I voted a ten on ten) a perfect.
