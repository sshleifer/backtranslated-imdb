This film has been roasted by the boys of MST3K, but it is actually a neat and nasty piece of low budget black film. The plot is tight, the characters are credible (like the good boy who becomes obsessed with the bad girl), the pace is solid, the climax is well managed and the cast is reinforced by several actors of refined character. . Granted, most of the time, you want to hit the protagonist with a brick, but it's actually pretty scary when he plays the brain. The scenes between him and his father are quite powerful, in a minimalist way. Of course it's depressing, but that's the goal. Good movie.
