This criticism is long overdue, because I consider Tale of Two Sisters as the greatest film ever made. I will contrast this jewel with any film in terms of screenplay, cinematography, theater, post-production, editing, directing or any other aspect of making a film. It's practically perfect in all of them? a true masterpiece in a sea of ​​fake "masterpieces". <br /> <br /> The structure of this film is easily the tightest in the history of cinema. I can not think of any other movie where something extremely important happens every two minutes. In the literal sense of the term, Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a film that virtually induces the viewer to dissect it at the most detailed level. A seemingly insignificant object can be shown ?? a rack of dresses, two diaries, a drop of blood emanating from a crack on the floor, a bottle of pills, etc. ?? but on meticulous inspection turns out to be a lot more ?? A clue that helps make sense of this particular scene (or perhaps the film as a whole), which almost always contributes to a moving reflection on the psychological concepts lurking in the background until the spectator's intelligence makes them come to the fore. Such an event can happen many times during any other film, but in A Tale of Two Sisters, such events occur so quickly and relentlessly that the viewer must watch the film in a state of perpetual vigilance, not to miss something important. In other words, the content of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. How can a sensible person ask for something else from a movie? It's simply the highest and most sublime form of cinema imaginable. <br /> <br /> The most quoted criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is well summed up by Zaphod B Goode, who falsely claims that the story is incoherent, unresolved mess that uses confusion to instil a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing issues. He postulates that Ji-woon Kim has launched a dozen possible explanations and left him there. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. A Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of unprecedented objective facts that help the viewer identify the EXACT occurrences of each scene in the film. If our good friend Zaphod had been attentive, would he have noticed? for example ?? the series of obvious flashbacks that provide enough factual information to make sense of the movie. These flashbacks contradict convincingly the affirmation of the total subjectivity of Zaphod. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone who wants to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only cast doubt on the patience of a spectator who, apparently, does not want to make the slightest effort, in any way. to see them. Can we really blame Ji-woon Kim for the impatience of the spectators who do not want to understand his film? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod who can not "understand" the story of two sisters, because she has nothing to do with a lack of as much as a lack of persistence. The film spells out so effectively that the only possible explanation for the confusion is the lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this movie requires a fairly large amount of puzzle solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture. You only have to put them together. Remember, the scenario was written by someone who already had in mind the picture ?? he simply separated the pieces and skillfully placed them in order to provide a magnificent brain exercise that ?? when finished ?? confers an ultimate form of satisfaction and astonishment. <br /> <br /> Do not understand me. Some movies seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create an insoluble puzzle by nature. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples. A tale of two sisters is not. It is ironic that Zaphod claims that Darko is more masterfully built than A Tale of Two Sisters, especially since Darko does not provide almost no objective facts, but also a finishing touch which is the cliché par excellence deus ex machina which could be abandoned at the end of the year. all movies ever made to provide the ultimate in false intelligence. I am ashamed to mention both films in the same sentence, but the contrast is important. Although it puzzles me that Zaphod cites a film that collapses when exposed to the slightest intellectual effort to criticize a film that becomes noticeable only through a significant application of intellectual effort. He apparently likes his "intelligent" films in the most superficial form possible. This is evident when he poses 17 consecutive questions in his criticism to which the film itself responds very convincingly. Just read Opiemar's discussions in the IMDb discussion forum A tale of two sisters. Anyone who carefully reads these discussions and always asserts the lack of an objective solution to this film may just as well stop watching smart movies, because the answers are so cursed. <br /> <br /> I would like to say more, but I have reached my limit of 1,000 words. Everything that was said here had to be said. So be it said now!
