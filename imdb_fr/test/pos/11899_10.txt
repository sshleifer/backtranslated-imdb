I finally see the movie El Padrino. From what I can see, it's an incredible movie and a lot of action. Damian Chapa is a good director. But I must admit that I love her role better. I saw behind the scenes of the film, they were mounted by a lady named Kinga. She needs to go back to school to learn how to ride. However, the film El Padrino is a pure epic of 10 actions. Why can not most filmmakers make films that make you wonder what the plot is? I am so happy to see someone that I know to be a great actor and also become a great director. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those who like to see artists do it. <br /> <br /> BS
