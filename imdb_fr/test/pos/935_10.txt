See three colors: blue and three colors: white. These are two wonderful films that will give an extra dimension to the Three Colors finale: Red. Red is a fantastic movie. It can be enjoyed in one viewing, and the highlight of the film is very powerful during this first viewing. But, look again. Once you understand the use of character symbols and parallels in this movie, you'll see new things every time you watch. From the first viewing, you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind. With each additional viewing, you discover that it is actually a work of genius. Red is supposed to symbolize fraternity in the French flag. The story revolves around the theme of fraternity to be considered from angles that one would never suspect. The facets of fraternity shared by the different characters are as deep as you want. If you're used to the blatant "symbolism" in most mass-produced movies, you might find that Red is a bit slow. You may end up watching a screen filled with intensity you can not imagine ... and gaping, ask yourself what all the excitement is. It is not an unconscious experience, by proxy. Everything is not explained to you. You must think while you watch. You must see ... not just watch. A wonderful movie ... intended to be enjoyed by a wonderful viewer.
