I thought the movie was good, but I like to read the true story behind the "true story" movies. Does anyone know the names and locations of the real characters on which the movie is based? I have done a complete Internet search and I can not find any information on this case. All I get is the information on the film and the fact that it is based on a "true story". I find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence immediately in the courtroom, even after such a sincere speech by the brother (the magnificent John Corbett), but overall the story was very captivating. Anyway, if anyone knows the real "real story", I would appreciate you sharing it!
