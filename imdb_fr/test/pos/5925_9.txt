Each year, we must not miss the long-awaited title of the big budget with the right combination of star, director and subject that fails miserably at the box office. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982, it was Blade Runner. In 1957, it was The Spirit of St Louis by Billy Wilder, a film that had everything - the best director, a big star, the true story and the best-selling American hero - with the exception of sufficient audience to cover its costs. Perhaps the public still remembered Lucky Lindy's anti-Semitism and his great admiration for Nazi Germany's achievements before the war (nor was it covered by the movie that ends with his arrival in Paris before the legend not too tarnished). Maybe because they thought they knew the story or it would just be a guy stuck in a cockpit for two hours. Wilder and his co-author, Wendell Mayes, are certainly aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindbergh's relatively uneventful flight, alternating a well-remembered structure from the key points of his life and the construction of the flight itself. Once the film is in the air, it is both surprising and suspenseful. He finds a real drama in his attempts to stay awake and navigate without proper instruments. <br /> <br /> It also creates a rather remarkable sense of terror, unique in its kind. in Wilder's filmography, allied to a true sense of the epic: clich√©s like threatening thunderstorms above the hangar at dusk before the flight bring a thrill of apprehension. Even the typically muted and problematic WarnerColor adds to the movie rather than night. In addition to the superb use of CinemaScope, Franz Waxman presents a remarkable score: majestic, planing but filled with a discrete threat, and intelligently used in the film rather than a simple musical accompaniment. The film loses points for hinting, even though it was never frankly said, that it was a race to be the first to fly over the Atlantic. flying eight years earlier - but it's still an extremely tense and captivating adventure story that deserves the success it has never encountered.
