Like many, I first saw the water babies as a child / young teenager in the late seventies and early eighties. He has stayed with me ever since with his catchy tunes, his memorable performances, his less than successful animation and a story full of heart, coldness and finally overcoming evil. Recently, I sat down and saw him again after at least two decades, and I noticed THIS TIME around his striking similarities with The Wizard of Oz. No, they are not obvious similarities, but listen to me. In this one, we have a boy and his dog who have personal problems at the "house", fleeing something and in the scene right after their flight, changing the substance of their appearance. In this one, the boy and the dog come alive. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and Toto are in color. In this one, the boy and the dog are informed that they have to find the babies from the water to get answers, then finally the Kracken for advice and that he has the ability to let Tom go home. he shows that he has courage, etc. Oz, Dorothy must also find an authoritative person who tests her before allowing her to go home. In the Water Babies, Tom meets three characters who will help him on his journey to the Water Babies - Dorothy also has three assistants. When every help is met, we have fun with a rendering of "Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi, HI Cockallorum ... We are on our way." In the wizard, it's "We'll see the wizard". Dorothy has a good witch who takes care of her. Tom has a woman with several roles (Billie Whitelaw) doing the same thing. If you look closely at both, there are many other similarities. That being said, water babies is by no means an imitation, I just comment on the strange tastes in between. This film presents solid performances by villains Bernard Cribbins and the ever-fascinating James Mason. The kids playing Tom and Ella are good. The actors of Joan Greenwood (I love her voice!), David Tomlinson, as well as the vocal talents of John Pertwee and Lance Percival add a lot to the mix. I must admit that the animation is less than sterling, even for its time, but is enough for the challenge. The three animated characters that help Tom get home are all nice. I still have trouble choosing my favorite between the French swordfish and the John Inman / Mr. Humphries as a hippocampus. The scene where we hear this manic and guttural laughter of a ship wrecked allowed us to see that a seahorse with a huge bow tie with polka dots, makes me roll! Water babies is very fun. Of course, it's more of a children's film, but it has always been a special place in my heart. Most of the credit for the film's success must go to director Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a wonderful comic actor and his sense of humor is clearly evident through.
