Bonny Hunt scores a hit with her first film. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have this indescribable element called chemistry. Of course, the plot is unlikely, but that does not prevent anyone from enjoying this movie. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other big players play his card mates. Jim Belushi is hilarious as a down-to-earth husband of Megan, who is part of the extended family. <br /> <br /> Faith, family and marriage are respected. Some sexual references and salty words are used, but in context and with a sweet humor. <br /> <br /> And in the background, that wonderful Dean Martin look - "Come back to me." <br /> <br /> Recommended.
