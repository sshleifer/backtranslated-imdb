We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film and Video Festival and loved it. <br /> <br /> This film has plunged into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and, more importantly, fear of our own inadequacies. <br /> <br /> The three main actors, Barbora Bobulova for Valeria, Brigitte Catillon for Flavia, Andrea Renzi for Massimo are excellent. It was a pleasure to see the dynamic that existed between them three. <br /> <br /> I think Barbora Bobulova is remarkable. I hope we will see it much more in the years to come. <br /> <br /> This film is not an easy way. Congratulations to the Italian team that made this film. Highly recommended.
