I am a Christian and I found this film rather good! :) Although the acting is not of Oscar caliber, I thought it was good, considering that the cast had limited experience at the time this film was shot. Jesus Christ was explained wonderfully. The message that the director was trying to convey (which is THE important thing, not the way the characters dressed!) Was definitely passed on. The theme of involving the main characters in illegal drag racing was also a good idea (cool cars, by the way). I think this film will certainly reach a lot of young people. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it without hesitation, it is a great tool of testimony! :)
