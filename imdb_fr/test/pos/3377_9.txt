I wanted to watch this, have a glimpse of the show. He told more about Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, I thought it was great. We have to see, Robin is always on, no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was impressive. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the main actors seems so real to me. Roebuck like Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming about it, which helped me get through all of Williams' energy. The small pieces behind the scenes of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley) have been rewarding. I also thought that Harvey of Richmond-Peck was also a pretty rock in the pond. (This is a good thing). <br /> <br /> This film tells the centuries-old history of Hollywood residents, reviewing the highs and lows of fame. It kept me from sticking to my TV and I learned to love Robin, well, almost everyone seems to be the great character I sometimes think of Hollywood. Go understand. <br /> <br /> I sometimes wonder why people in the network are still considered idiots. We have never seen ABC's head. I just heard it, like Charlie from Charlie Angels (I wonder if this was planned?). It seems so sad that a show at number 1 can be destroyed by its own network. <br /> <br /> I think this story could be told about the life of anyone as he climbs the ladder of his work. Movie and TV stars are always loved or hated by so many people with whom you grew up, you just want to go back in time, remember your own past. I remember watching the show and wondering what was going on in their personal lives. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy will always be part of me and I have seen some of them. This may not be quite the truth, nor is it a lie, but in the end it told me a wonderful sad and happy story.
