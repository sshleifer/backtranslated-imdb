This is a perfectly successful example of a 1950s biopic. He has the young and powerful hero - well, he is no longer so young on screen; superb, so improbable, direction of Billy Wilder; a lively musical score, entirely orchestrated, composed of edifying scales and, if necessary, of divine strings of Franz Waxman; strong support players; a captivating story; superb photographs of Robert Burks, favorite of Hitchcock; and a narration about a singular historical event. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Jimmy Stewart, Charles Lindbergh trying to sleep in a Long Island hotel before his solo epic flight across the Atlantic, between New York and Paris. . And he can not sleep. <br /> <br /> The flight itself is filled with memories of Lindbergh's personal story and the purchase and construction of his unique high-wing monoplane aircraft, The Spirit of St. Louis. St. Louis, Missouri is home to the partnership that sponsored the flight. (Even in 1927, the money was talking.) Anyway, the movie had to include several flashbacks and Stewart's storytelling. What is the alternative? Observe the units? Thirty-three hours watching Jimmy Stewart sitting silently at the controls of his noisy plane as days and nights come and go? I found the scenario and direction awesome for their time. Unpleasant things are of course omitted, so as not to introduce more ambiguity than the contemporary public could do. <br /> <br /> My bet is that the screaming crowd surrounding Lindbergh at Le Bourget tore the plane into pieces for souvenirs. And of course, nothing about the pilot's rescue tube, although that would have added more opportunities for humor. Some of today's viewers will find some unhealthy incidents if they think too much. Aloft, Stewart chats with a friendly hitchhiker who, in his own way, cares gently and wakes him up by landing on the cheek at a critical moment. Later, the St. Christopher's Medal Father Hussman gave him gently pats against the glass crystal of one of the instruments, just as Stewart desperately tries to land. Atheist Stewart is saved twice - once by a fly and once by God. <br /> <br /> But too bad. It's an awesome movie. This landing at Le Bourget, with an exhausted Stewart behind the joystick, troubled by the spotlight, sweating with fear and collapsing with fatigue, is really convincing. "I'm going to rip this plane," he told himself, and we can believe it. <br /> <br /> Driving a light aircraft is not like driving a car at all. There is no highway that runs smoothly to tell you where to go, no way to guide you. You are busy every second. You must monitor the instruments, check each wing tip to see if they touch the horizon, as well as the nose of the aircraft, and constantly monitor the traffic up, down and side, although this is not the case. has not been a big problem for Lindbergh. He was alone over the ocean. <br /> <br /> Why? In one of the film's most filmed moments, two 1920s Gypsy goldsmiths, Stewart and Murray Hamilton, lounging near their aircraft in a Midwestern field. "What is it, what makes us so fond of flying?" Asks Hamilton. (No answer.) Later, his backers try to dissuade him from leaving the plane. Five other airmen are already dead while trying. "But you do not understand, it's a must," says a passionate Stewart. <br /> <br /> Well, that's not really an answer either. Why must it be done now and why by Lindbergh? Why NOT wait ten years and stop ruining lives in the meantime? The answer, dear Socrates, lies partly in our glands. Pilots are a placid and confident lot, given the occasional gags of excitement. Their main problem may be an addiction to an internal rush of adrenaline. I laugh. Some of my best friends are pilots. Still, Lindbergh had to be quite a guy. He deserved to be treated like a hero. Not only because of the theft itself, but because of his later behavior - calm, modest, family man. We can easily forget his admiration for Hitler, who largely compensated by testing Corsair fighters in the Pacific and advising the Navy on how to refine aircraft and get the best performance possible. <br /> <br /> See if you're lucky. If nothing else, it's a story lesson told with visual splendor.
