The fabulous cinematography of Sergei Urusevsky helps to make this work a magnificent work. The opening scenes are like flipping through a master photographer's album and, as the story unfolds, we are overwhelmed by both the events represented and the beauty of his eyes. Everything is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. Difficult to describe without "spoiling", but suffice it to say that one of the scenes is very intense during an air raid and that the lady left on the spot and the brother of her lover disagree when the sirens moan and that the windows break. Another superimposes a swirling staircase and a crest of rotating tree tops and even develops into a fantastic sequence. Soviet cinema is of the highest quality.
