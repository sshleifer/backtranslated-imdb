The most remarkable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogues and their dances. This typical rising musical has an overflowing intrigue, even for 1944, but because of the actors, it's always fun to watch. Hayworth is not even a dancer, but she has a lot of "inexperienced" charm that suits her character. Kelly plays his usual authoritarian role while Silvers provides a lot of self-deprecation and laughter. The film can also be very serious sometimes. This is not a must, but recommended if you like actors.
