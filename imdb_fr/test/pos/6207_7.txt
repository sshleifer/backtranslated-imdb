Despite later claims, this melodrama of the first conversation has very little in common with "Citizen Kane": it is the biopic of a ruthless but fictitious plutocrat, recounted in flashback but jumping back in time. The screenwriter, Preston Sturges, does not show any of his subsequent gifts for a sparkling dialogue, and none of the innumerable film innovations of "Kane" is evident. It's still very observable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-fashioned makeup makes him look like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore - a little beyond its climax, and not physically matched well - playing a multifaceted woman behind the man. Helen Vinson is one of the most treacherous femme fatale in film history, sending the last third in ecstatic reverberation. The surviving copy is nervous and lacks audio snippets. There are still a few holes in the plot (how could she know who the son is if she sleeps with them two?) And the music is terribly hokey. Nevertheless, I was quite fascinated.
