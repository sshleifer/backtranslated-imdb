All right, I love this movie. I like everything about it. He has an excellent soundtrack, he has many recognizable faces and it's funny like hell. There are so many topics in this film and each one of them is funny, one way or another. <br /> <br /> Where Spicolli illuminated the screen two years ago, Drake is almost as memorable as a character. All he wants is to have fun. He leaves home without the consent of his parents, he jumps out of work when he feels like it, he is obsessed with sex, he likes drugs and alcohol and he tries to be a good friend. It's his nonchalant attitude that makes him such a pleasure to watch. And he goes out with some outlines. And there are so many small observations that you do not see coming, but they make you laugh at speed when it hits you. A special moment is when Tommy and Bill are talking about Bill's ex-girlfriend with someone else now. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his huge bottle of beer and simply throws it over his shoulder. He said goodnight then and the scene ends. It's a perfect scene. Tommy's world is his. He really lives to party and have fun. When the conversation is over, his time is up and he does not care who he is offending in the process. He has an innocence about him. "It's casual" is his favorite saying. <br /> <br /> Reggie hands Reggie a donut. He tells her something that my friends and I will never forget, because we rewinded the film ten times and looked at it again and again, and we laughed. It must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Wildlife is a throwback to the days when teen comedies were funny, scorching, had good ears, entertained us and just wanted to get lost in their world. 90 minutes. Wild life does all these things perfectly. If it's a movie you have not seen, give it a chance. It's a classic. <br /> <br /> Also check out the army storekeeper who has problems with Jim. He is a very familiar face now and it is his first role on the big screen.
