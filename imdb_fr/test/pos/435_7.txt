It was a nice musical on the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, it reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the '40s and' 50s, as many clich√©s lead to the inevitable conclusion ("will the show continue?"). Of course, none of this is new, it was nice and well done. The music numbers at the end are frantic and beautiful to watch. In many ways, it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was cleaned up in the American movie. But in FRENCH CANCAN, the characters have fully functional libido - but nothing is really shown, so the movie is good for kids. <br /> <br /> Nothing new but well done anyway.
