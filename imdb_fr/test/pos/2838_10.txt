After a summer of retreading and disappointment, nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is unlike any other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he knows how to make more disturbing images of men and women and their approach to sex (his two previous films were brilliant In the Company of Men and almost brilliant Your friends and neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnesses the brutal death of her husband, the asshole (the pillar of LaBute Aaron Eckhart), gets lost in a fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the killers who killed her husband and are currently on trial. The thing about the movie is that Freeman and Zellweger are really parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and polished Dr. Dave Ravell on a soap opera, Freeman idealizes Betty. Nurse Betty is a brilliant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My rating: 10/10.
