After watching the show for about four weeks, which is enough to get an idea of ​​the show, I think it shows potential. Although many things are borrowed from other shows (which science fiction does not do nowadays) and the characters are stereotyped, I like what they do with the stories. There is some continuity between the development of the parcel and the interaction / development of the relationships between the characters, despite the essentially modular nature of each episode. Some topics related to science have been explored, as well as revelations about the secrets and weaknesses of the characters. These have also added a comedy to the series, which I would gladly see more in "serious" science fiction. Overall, this is a good balance, which may appeal to larger groups of people, unlike the Star Trek vs Babylon 5 debates that I attended and attended many times. The visual aspects of the show are more than sufficient and well budgeted for a first season. The acting is acceptable, and I am curious to see how well the actors manage to get their characters out of their scripted stereotypes. I see enough positives and potential to stay interested in seeing where the show wants to go ...
