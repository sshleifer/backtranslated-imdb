I saw it at the BendFilm festival on Friday, in the middle of a moving crowd, not helped by a bad decision of the event organizers, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the film. And the audience was really disappointed when Modern Love appeared after a whimsical short (forgotten name). <br /> <br /> People !!! It was really silly to mix this short film with Modern Love - which is a serious drama. A movie film. <br /> <br /> The public receives the teaser which is a comedy and then ... Modern Love. Hmmmm. Modern Love, despite my reservations (strange end, a bit too tangential), needed a short film at the height of its strange strangeness. I therefore advise programmers for next year to take more precautions when planning the show. <br /> <People who watched Modern Love really did not know what had hit them. They were led and it's not their fault. <br /> <br /> Modern Love has great performances that play well against the tangential meanderings of the film - a film that its director seems to have "questioned aloud" rather than executed in the usual way. A film is scripted and shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad the public was misinformed. Poor session placement, bad short film, bad approach of well-meaning programmers, who, despite good efforts, need to see a lot more movies and travel to other festivals.
