I saw Ray when he came out. Why? Partly because of the hype, secondly because I just loved the music of Ray Charles. But not being there when his greatest things in music and his life happened, I wanted to know more about the life of man. And in this movie, I did it. I did not know he was addicted and the movie lets us know. <br /> <br /> But now, while it was a decent autobiographical film ... I can not say it was a "big" movie. I saw "Malcolm X" and I was blown away. Same with "What love has to do with this" and "Bird". The performances of each of these films were exceptional. I'm not only attracted by the main characters of these films - who have done incredible work - but also by those around them. It helps to make an image. <br /> <br /> I felt that parts of this film were superficial and heavy to attract emotions. And yes, I'll admit that I almost fell asleep at certain parts of the film. And the movie was too long. And the film omitted several "other" important details of Ray Charles's life that would have made the film more fluid. The film has been "agitated" for me in some parts. And the movie seemed to end with a moan, not a bang - some parts, including the end played as a cable movie "Lifetime" stuck on me. I'm expecting more cinema outdoors. <br /> <br /> So where does my ambivalence come from? With the performances of Jamie Foxx. Overall, he did it - okay. Denzel Washington's Malcolm X and Angela Bassett's Tina Turner are not spectacular, but ... okay. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but for me, there were several moments in the film where I saw Ray Charles's performance by Jamie Foxx, and in others, thanks to camera angles and with magnificent lighting, he "resembled" Ray Charles. But I was careful to play it. An actor must make you believe that he is the character he plays. Do not make a caricature of the character. Did I believe that Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes - sometimes no <br /> <br /> Did Jamie Foxx deserve a Golden Globe? You betcha. Does he deserve an Oscar ...? It depends on who he is against. There are some major competitors and he might well dismiss them. But again ... maybe not. If Jamie Foxx does not win, I will not get up to say "he was stolen". I will not particularly feel that he was. <br /> <br /> It was a decent film with decent performances and a decent story. A "big" autobiographical film by the late Ray Charles? No. Somewhere over there, I think there's a great movie about Ray Charles just waiting to be filmed, and an actor that will take your breath away by doing it.
