I spent a lot of my childhood in front of the wireless network listening to Round the Horne or half an hour from Hancock or watching movies from Carry On. Probably the most famous line of comedy "Infamy! Infamy! They all infamy!" makes me laugh again. <br /> <br /> This is a rare glimpse of the man behind the comic figure and all the production is a brilliant mix of tragedy and comedy until the last quote from the coroner's court, read in four different voices of Michael Sheen. He was brilliant in the role. Most of the other members of the Carry On team were mediocre and their Kenneth Horne was very good, but Michael Sheen did the show and he should receive a price somehow for him. <br /> <br /> It let me feel "wow". To quote Kenneth Williams, the cynic who said, "Life is a joke," the only answer can be, "Yes, well, let's make it a good one."
