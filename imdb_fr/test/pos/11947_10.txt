"One Crazy Summer" is the funniest and craziest movie (not necessarily the best) I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> At the very moment that a crazy scene is made, another one emerges. He never lets you rest. Just one thing after another. The soundtrack is great. The songs are good for the scenes. <br /> <br /> It's also a clean film. There are very few dirty things in there. <br /> <br /> Of course, he has the story of guys you would not trust with your pocket money, which is a challenge and seduces people with more resources. Who would want to see if they failed? There is a serious side to the fact that parents and children do not live up to everyone's dreams. Always have an open mind and weigh all the options. This applies to both parents and children. In "One Crazy Summer", parents are wrong. It's not always the case.
