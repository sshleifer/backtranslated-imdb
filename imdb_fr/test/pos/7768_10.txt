Late movie critic Gene Siskel said the film shows how easy it is to make a movie. He gave her a compliment even though now it could have been taken as an insult these days. Although I have not always agreed with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. Love Jones is an eloquent example of what a love story should be: realistic, with real characters in real life situations. <br /> <br /> The story tells the ups and downs of the relationship between Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than just a beautiful couple on screen. These two actually have chemistry together. You can feel the vibration between these two when they are on the screen and it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Bill Bellamy is pretty funny like Wood and Lisa Nicole Carson is great as Nina's friend, Simone. Isaiah Washington is just as great as Savon, Darius's close friend, and I sigh every time I see him in a movie. The guy is a great actor whose career is ruined by the industry's lowlifes and the childish games they play. You may think he called the little weasel on Gray's Anatomy, but anyone who knows how Follywood works knows better than to believe any "official story" of the place of fake make. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a wonderful love story full of interesting and friendly characters who are in realistic situations that any lover can tell. You like these people because they are credible and are not described as gangsters and vagrants. Not an obscene stereotype can be found here. Compare that with the romantic toad movies. Exactly. In closing, if you like Black Cinema, you'd better have a copy of this movie.
