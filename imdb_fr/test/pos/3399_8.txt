Dramatic drama with great sets, costumes and performances ?? although some people channel Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite family ties and location. Beautiful villains ?? you will want them all to finish very badly. Many strong female characters in this one ?? both good and bad. Secondary scenarios are also well developed. Several cameos of major stars from past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Relax on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and have a drink with your choice. A carpet and a cat would be optional.
