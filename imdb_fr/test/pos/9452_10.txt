I just rented this movie at the video store last night. Since it was new and was not published a long time ago, the rent was only overnight. Me, my little sister and my big brother who hates watching these movies, we sat down and watched. Once the film started and after watching it for a moment, we all laughed historically. Even my brother. This film is hilarious, I laughed. Even if some movies are funny, even if I find it funny, I sometimes can not laugh. But this movie ... I laughed. My brother ended up thinking it was the best "this type of movie" he saw. I ended up watching the movie about 2 or 3 hours later.
