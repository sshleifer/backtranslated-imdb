It is almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious critique of THREE COLORS: RED without leaving some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries of this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them, and I imagine myself in their world, the more I have the theme: that we are more connected to each other than we would like to think ourselves and that we a bit of fate to put certain events in motion. In BLUE, Juliette Binoche played the role of a widow in mourning whose project of living her life without links to the past made her meet an unexpected person. In WHITE, an act of cruelty creates an improbable friendship between two men who will conspire against all odds to bring the perpetrator to justice in a complete circle. And now, in RED, all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply to the meeting of a young Geneva model and a retired judge who is used to meddling in the lives of others. <br /> <br /> This girl has the appropriate name of Valentine (a luminous Irene Jacob), who has this radiance in her and smiles even while working on the podium. Not that she is without luggage: she has a boyfriend, invisible, who also wants to know what she does all the time, she has a brother who troubles her, and she rejects the advances of a photographer who works at his image for a huge billboard. She strikes a dog while driving and heals her again, but when she takes him to the owner, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he does not want her. "I do not want anything," he said coldly, and BLUE elements suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and apparent freedom and floating freely, watches over unsuspecting people. This masculine version of Juliette Binoche's character shocks Valentine first - she declares that she can only feel pity for him as she goes away with horror, but a fortuitous event takes her home, and she It's here that he begins to reveal who he is. and his great loss. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Kieszlowski tells a parallel story: that of a young man, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), about to become a judge and who lives on the other side of the street. Valentine - but they continue to miss each other. Chance is the word. Like Valentine who wins the jackpot at the grocery store that she visits, elements of chance animate her life and that of Auguste. He has a girlfriend who also provides people with phone reports about the weather. One of them happens to be the former judge. He knows more about her than Auguste and he has never met her. Like God or Prospero, he slowly creates a storm that will break the walls of the current state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the phrase "We'll meet again". It is this parallelism between the old and the young judge that makes RED so beautiful and so transcendent, because time is actually much more fluid than we would like. There are people we meet in life who, if only we were born in the same time, so many things would be different. <br /> <br /> This is the case of Valentine and the old judge. I believe that there is indeed a strong brotherhood of souls that unites them closely: it is this woman that he did not meet - by chance or not - and who, whether he knows it or not, try to be forgiven That's why he runs the risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the pariah of society. But it does not stop there. One of the many links between the three films is the character of an old woman walking in a big garbage bin. Where Julie did not see her (and would not have helped her anyway), and Karol, all fresh from her public humiliation, made fun of her, saying, "Someone is worse than me," is Valentine who helps him. Fragility in need can occur anywhere, and Kieszlowski applies it even here in a minor character. <br /> <br /> Now, RED is more than just a story. Valentine, the old judge, Auguste, even Rita the dog: they are not characters confined by tales. An American version would ruin the idea, commercialize fortuitous encounters and even end in a stupid end. RED is so devoid of a linear and definite plot that anything that could happen to one of these people could well happen, and the possibilities that this story might have deviated in many directions if a crucial element had not occurred at the exact time and place. <Br/> <br /> The theme of sexual betrayal is added to the concept of characters that are reflected. It is also an important and determining element in the three films: in BLUE, Julie's husband had a mistress and she also betrayed Olivier when it became clear that she had died emotionally. In WHITE, Dominique asks Karol to listen to her moaning on the phone (which becomes an important tool in RED) while she sleeps with a man under Brigite Bardot's CONTEMPT billboard. In RED, the story of love and treason of the old judge is reproduced. And all this time, the image of Valentine watches them as an omen of what must happen at the same time that Rita, the car of Valentine, carries seven puppies, life renewed for the six major actors of this complex trilogy filmed obviously with care and love. Why do I say six? You will have to watch the movie and marvel.
