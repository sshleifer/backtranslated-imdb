It's a decent effort for a B-Movie Martial Arts actor. Ian Jacklin, a former North American Kickboxing Champion, is the leader and performs well on stage. Matthias Hues, muscular, has the chance to add more to his martial arts villain character in this film than in many others and if you're a fan of The Teutonic Titan, rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> Renee Griffin is also notable for the romantic interest in this film. She starts with a positive attitude, but she quickly learns and creates "The two-backed beast" with great style. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are good in the American tradition (NO Hong Kong acrobatics here!) with the added realism of seeing Benny "The Jet" Urquidez play himself the trainer role of John Larson ( Jacklin). <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie seems to have more subplots than most of its kind. Get more than one story.
