Hello to all fans of Dirty Dancing !!!! I came across this bulletin board when I was bored one day and I think it's cool. I love DD! I saw it for the first time at my friends when I was 13 (now I'm 17) and I became addicted !! I saw it at least 10 times and soon after, I bought the DVD for myself. At this point, I have memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever someone asks me. '' I wore a watermelon ?! '' It got so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded the song of Micky and Sylvia, and now it's ringing on my phone !! Most of my friends think it's a crappy movie, but I do not care what they think about it, I know it's great! I read the comments a little earlier and have a few questions for you: 1. Why do you ask trivial questions such as Lisa's age and baby? I do not think that matters a lot. They are teenagers in the 60s, is not that enough? 2. Where did you get this special edition that you all talk about? That sounds very interesting ... Please answer that. I would like to see the opinions of other fans ... Cheers! charliesangel415 xxx
