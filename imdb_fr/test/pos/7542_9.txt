A really fun British comedy from the mid 50's on a school for girls. The girls are all involved in mischief and chaos, making bath gin, smoking and playing. Alastair Sim plays the director Millicent in a glorious role, as well as the brother of Millicent. A policeman goes to the school to find out what's going on. This movie is funny, with great gags in sight and Alastair Sim is awesome. Just a classic British comedy, fun and not too crusty. Joan Sims and Sid James, stars of many of Carry On's films, play small roles, but this film is about girls. It spawned 3 suites and a recent remake. Watch and appreciate where everything started.
