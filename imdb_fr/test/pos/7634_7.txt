Italian exorcist clone X sweet. <br /> <br /> Woman buy the statue of the crucified thief. This thief comes alive and turns out to be the devil with his fantasies of rape. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rassimov plays the devil brilliantly. Mainly because of his gift of evil looks. And because he was never above nakedness. Of course him. <br /> <br /> The leading actress did a decent job. Her wide-eyed innocence and the fact that she looked tall and naked helped him. <br /> <br /> This one has an element of conspiracy similar to that of most Italian horror movies. The girl's parents are very rich and depraved. Look at him for details. <br /> <br /> Gabriel Tinti, Laura Gems' husband, also appears as a random stallion. His role is basically phoned, but as a cheap beer he did the job. <br /> <br /> Let's scoff the director for his failings. It could have been a horror / sex classic.
