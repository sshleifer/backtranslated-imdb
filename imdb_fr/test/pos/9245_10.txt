Beautiful doco Stuie! <br /> <br /> Even if it did not work out the way you wanted with the original movie, your work is fantastic and your viewing exceptional. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that you put a lot in it. <br /> <br /> This goes for everyone too. It's great to see the warts and the entire story of the process without being "too nice". <br /> <br /> I loved it! It's really worth the detour. <br /> <br /> That Pena, the writer of the film "original" can not appreciate what you have accomplished. <br /> <br /> Adore this attitude too. Excellent piece. Looking forward to seeing the next job. <br /> <br /> Keep it up! paully
