Oh my God!!! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid childhood memories of the 70s. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, Carole and Paula were swinging on swings, telling jokes they had picked up on the square of chuckles, getting dressed up with costumes they had found in a giant chest called The Storybox and were arguing with a pink squirrel named Sherlock who lived in one of their trees. They could also scratch a medium acoustic guitar and sing a pretty melody. It was a great childhood show. Very feeling. But that's the problem: they do not do shows like that anymore. Unfortunate that. You could say that these two girls really had a heart of gold and loved children, they were really adorable. MAGIC GARDEN is one of those shows that, if they came out with a box, people would buy it, because it's such a sweet walk in Memory Lane.
