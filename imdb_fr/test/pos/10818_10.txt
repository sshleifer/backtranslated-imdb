I saw Bon voyage 2 days ago and I found the production excellent. The movie is supposed to entertain, and it is! It mimics the style of the American Screwball comedies of the 1930s, but Von Voyage is more refined. Adjani and Depardieu are simply excellent in their roles. The plot is simple. The film begins with people involved in many situations that apparently should not have anything to do with each other. It's very funny to see how these situations are related during the movie. It's good to see a French film with that kind of humor. I find it mainly in a film whose love is the main theme. Peter Coyote as a German spy in France shows once again being an excellent actor.
