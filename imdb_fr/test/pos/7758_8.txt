At first glance, this is another high school anime with lots of excuses for "fanservice", but there is still a lot to be done. The "fan service" is part of the plot, the main character is a tired cynic (unusual) and, more importantly, there is a clever plot that connects all the episodes between them, which poses interesting questions. The episodes are deliberately non-chronological, and it is certainly worth watching the series again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching the series closely, because there are many casual remarks that prefigure and explain things, plus lots of jokes about other series, anime and others.
