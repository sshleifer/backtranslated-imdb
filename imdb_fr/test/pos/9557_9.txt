"Best in Show" is certainly Christopher Guest's funniest and deepest film. The characters are excellently portrayed and the pet's connection to the owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie. I'm a fan of Guest since Spinal Tap, but in this movie, he really realized what he set himself the goal of doing in the "simulacrum", a genre he invented and perfected.
