What can I say? The curse of Monkey Island is fantastic. The story is good and solid, but properly silly, the jokes are complicated, the puzzles are enigmatic ... you could not ask for more in an adventure game. The bit "You do not need to see my ID" is in itself very interesting to buy the game, not to mention Murray, which has become the hot topic of many of my friends (only a few have played the game ). You will like this game. And if you do not do it, too bad!
