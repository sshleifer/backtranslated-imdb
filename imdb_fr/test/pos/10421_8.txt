I agree with the comments of the Australian for the most part. However, there seems to be a pretty decent plot even though it is not original. Christina (Kelli McCarty) inherits a rural property in which she plans to open a mountain lodge. She meets Chip (Bobby Johnston) whom she knew when she was growing up there. The plot gets complicated when James (Paul Logan) arrives with his new stripper friend, Shene (Devinn Lane), because Christina was James stripper's friend in the past, and the implication is that James had done something wrong. To add interest to the film Sophia Linn (Monique Parent), a novelist is invited to the lodge, as Eric (SÃ©bastien Guy) and Linda (Flower), two lawyers of the city. James calls the local inspector of Christina's business building codes one of her dirty tricks to shut her up. So the question is: "How far will James go to sabotage the lodge and succeed?" <br /> <br /> Watch Devinn Lane here and in "Beauty Betrayed". She seems to be moving from the hard core to the world of "R". Samantha McConnell also plays the role of "Bait", the name of the most outrageous character in the movies!
