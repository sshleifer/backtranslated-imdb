<br /> <br /> Crackerjack with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy - both members of the cast of Saturday night comedy show "The Late Show", Bill Hunter, an icon of the Australian film, and John Clarke, who remains to see us regularly on Australian television alongside Brian Dawe. <br /> <br /> Crackerjack, Losely tells the story of a young man in his thirties (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy) who pays his annual brief at the local bowling club in order to get some parking spaces for which he uses himself and rents to others as cheap parking in the city center. <br /> <br /> The club is going through a difficult time and brings together all the resources and all the members it can, Jack receives a call asking him to present himself at next Saturday's petanque game or to lose his subscription ( and therefore its parking space) <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the rest, but the movie is funny, light and contains everything a good Australian movie should do. <br /> <br /> If you are not Australian, then some of the jokes and humor will probably leave you speechless. We are an Aussie - enjoy yourself and sit down at Crackerjack .. It is now available on DVD, I already have my copy! <br /> <br /> 10/10 .. Awesome movie! <br />
