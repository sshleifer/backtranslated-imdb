hi i'm john and i would like to tell you that my dog ​​was in this movie on the screen setting up it was the pit like this one, that was going to bite the chained man. My dog ​​name was Colin and he stayed filming for a week for this movie. He was also in other areas, such as Crime Watch UK and some other small plays. he won a few dog shows but he died now i miss him he was a big faithful and faithful dog and we had good times together but he had cancer that could not be treated so i had to put him down worse day of my life, I hope this will give you something to look for in the movie if you see it again. <br /> <br /> thank you all
