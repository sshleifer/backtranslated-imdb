Unfortunately, I can understand this movie, since I'm 17 and have not been kissed yet, I feel really good for Josie. I have not seen this movie for a long time, but to write it, I watched it again and remembered everything I liked about it. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is a great actress and this role suited her very well. at the time. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good and Michael Vartan was an excellent actor in this field. <br /> <br /> I also liked the story - as I said up there, I could tell, and you rarely find a movie you can completely understand. <br /> <br /> Everywhere - I loved it. 7/10
