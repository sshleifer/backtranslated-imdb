While Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is about to take a break from his professional life, his frustrated wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) finally had the courage to leave him, leaving Ted to take care of their five-year-old son ( Justin Henry). Being a single parent turns out to be a chore for Ted. He suffers professionally but also learns that there is much more to life than a career while continuing to bond with and truly know his own son. But then, Joanna returns and intends to recover her son, which leads to a cruel trial in detention. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs. Kramer is a beautifully written and beautifully played human drama that will leave only the coldest heart an intact spectator. The growing relationship between Hoffman and his son is so well described and the film is never easy. It always looks very real and thanks to the discrete approach of the film, the impact is even greater and it is easy to work with several views. The dramatic impact of the film does not diminish. <br /> <br /> Easily recommended; 10 of 10.
