I watched it last night and again this morning - that's what I liked. There is something in this film ... When the film was almost finished, I was about to cry. I highly recommend to my friends "Latter Days" - worth the trip! I agree with those who say that some parts of the film do not seem very realistic. For example, the two main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical shape (though, round is also a type of form :)). I rarely meet people like that in single and I've never met a couple. Other parts of the film, including all these "coincidences", do not seem very realistic as well. BUT, after all, it's a movie, not a life story.
