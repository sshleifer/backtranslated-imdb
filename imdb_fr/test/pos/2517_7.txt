Another decent offering of Vince Gilligan's feather. <br /> <br /> Bryan Cranston, a "malcolm in the middle", plays Patrick Crump, a deranged guy who ends up diverting Mulder with a gun and driving him westward at high speed. It has something to do with the severe whistling of his head (and a possible deadly burn - his wife has just experienced it), and the pressure seems to be relieved only by heading to the left side. Only Mulder could understand the fate of this guy and make connections with his captor before the end of the night walk. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Scully seems to have solved the case with a possible cure for Mr. Crump and will meet them at sea. Check it to see if our Dynamic Duo can set foot in the Pacific and sort of solve Mr. Crump's big problem.
