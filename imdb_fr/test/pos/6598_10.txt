I must say that this must be the best documentary I have ever seen in my life. I first told the film at my friends' house and I could not finish watching it. From there, I spent my free time trying to find the movie. I never found it, but on my birthday, my friend who knew I had the hardest time finding the film, gave it to me as a gift. Sean Penn does an excellent job of narrating the documentary. I loved how it told the story of each of the Z-Boys and the story of Dogtown. I often went to Venice and the surrounding area and I never knew what had happened before watching the documentary. I did not have the chance to see the film itself and I heard that the documentary was far from it. I do not know if I really want to see the movie, but who knows.
