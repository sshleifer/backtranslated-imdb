This is one of those movies you do not want to finish. The characters are rich as a well woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters draw you in and tell a story of people who have lived in a boarding house over the decades around the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is cared for by a dynamic woman with a big heart who runs the house. These are stories based on his experiences. <br /> <br /> I could not believe it was a movie made for television. It was so well executed. S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as a nanny and she gives a lot of life to this role. You want to be in the middle of his boarders. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie so much that I bought the DVD.
