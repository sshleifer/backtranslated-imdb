I crossed the tops. I crossed the bottom ... I cried, I laughed, I vomited my guts always affectionate. But through all that, I was healed. I became a better person to have experienced this self-imposed degradation experience. It is not everyday that we can say that we have experienced the worst and are coming out on the other side with something that closely resembles our entire mental health intact. Friends ... neighbors-unite and be like one now. Go out and find this film and languish in its extravagances. Place it high on the coat and kiss its polystyrene box. Take him to bed. Take it with you when you go shopping or go blind with strange people. They will appreciate you all the better for your sublime and schizophrenic point of view on the cinema. And then they'll throw you their drink of choice (but you'll have the last word). I ran for Governor with this little beauty to my credit (and you too!). It is a treat that is worth having again and again.
