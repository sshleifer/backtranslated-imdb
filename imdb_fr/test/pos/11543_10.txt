A genius. My genius I remember the exact second in 1994. I was sitting in a pub in Shropshire, England. I remember the exact seat. "Bill Hicks dies of cancer," headlined the NME. I felt like someone had hit me in the stomach. Buy this DVD. If you do not find something in one way or another, I'll be amazed. <br /> <br /> RIP Bill, I wish you were always here.
