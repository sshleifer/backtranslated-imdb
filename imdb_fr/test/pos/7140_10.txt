it's more than a special Saturday afternoon. Very well written so very discreet, there are many here if you seek it. Catch the companion / scout cat, for example. It could not only have been a comic but a comic. The comic book industry (as well as the film publicists) has missed the mark on this. One of the least really know great movies. A good script by John Sayles is a strong point, but the acting is good too. Probably the best "superhero" movie I have ever seen. Short of special effects, but long on credibility. This one is a guardian. I have never seen a DVD of this movie, but I had a VHS version. Good hunt
