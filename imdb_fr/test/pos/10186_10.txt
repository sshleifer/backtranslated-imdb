It's the best 3D experience Disney has at its theme parks. It's certainly better than their original movie "Acid Trip" of the 1960s that was in its place, better than the movie "Honey I Shrunk The Public" can even beat the original EO captain "Movie Experience" in 3 dimensions . This film brings back some of the greatest musical hits of Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and other Disney works, and made me smile throughout the show. It is also a film totally adapted to children, unlike "Honey ..." and which has more effects than the spectacular "MuppetVision"
