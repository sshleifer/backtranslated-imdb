Dracula (John Carradine) visits Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), convinced that everything can be cured by science. He wants Edelamn to heal his vampirism - Edelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) comes in search of a cure to turn him into a werewolf. The monster Thr Frankenstein is also discovered but does nothing. <br /> <br /> Very ambitious plot for a 1940s universal horror movie. Trying to heal monsters by science is actually an interesting idea. This film also has beautiful scenery (LOVE the castle where the doctor lives), a pleasant atmosphere, is very well done (great use of shadows) and has very good special effects. <br /> <br /> The acting game is all good except Carradine - he tries but I could never accept him as Dracula. In addition, Lionel Atwill plays (as always) the chief of police. It's pretty much forgotten and ridiculed as a stupid movie but I think it's very good. This is also the last time the Universal monsters were made seriously - the next film was in 1948 in "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". It's a good movie, but the focus is more on comedy. <br /> <br /> The only real flaw is that there is a LOT of intrigue for 67 minutes and a few holes in logic: why is Dracula trying to bite the beautiful Miliza (Martha O ' Driscoll) when he will be healed? And why (and how) does the doctor bring Frankenstin into his castle? Still, they are small complaints. Recommended.
