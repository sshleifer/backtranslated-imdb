Now the game is smashed, right? <br /> <br /> The jokes are over. Everything is finished. The creative genius that drove this game for the first two games was gone, after all. <br /> <br /> False. <br /> <br /> The game is still intact, the jokes are there, guys. Of course, they are all used to it, but it was the same for Monkey Island 2. And 1, by the way. <br /> <br /> The difficulty is well placed, somewhere between the slightly easy 1 and the 2 ridiculously difficult. Fighting the subgame is inappropriate, in the subset tradition. And this game has the best joke of the whole series. When asked for your membership card for an exclusive beach, always select "You do not need to see my identity." Its worth the price of the game by itself.
