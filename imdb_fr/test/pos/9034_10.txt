Hello; I would just like to say how much I appreciated your review and your comments on this excellent movie "intrus in the dust". I think the remarks you made were insightful, intelligent and totally valid. it's also a shame that this movie is almost no longer on TV these days and it's not available on DVD Region 2 - I live in England. Once again, thank you very much for your opinion. the actor juano hernandez was in another brilliant film, "young man with a horn", who also played kirk douglas and lauren bacall. it was a very evocative and elegant film with superb music. I would like someone of influence to be able to release all the movie catalogs such as "johnny belinda", "I remember mom" and "the yearling" on DVD region 2, we love these movies in Britain. I'm not in retirement age, I'm still young enough and my family and I love classic movies !! Films like these have been beautifully made and remind us of wonderful memories. anyway...! Thank you very much for your comments!
