A fine performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful by Jean-Hugues Anglade adorn this strange story of lust, desire and alienation in France. The work of the two main performers is striking - subtle, intense and passionate. Alas, the scenario is deliberately turgid and sordid, and the overall effect leaves a depressed spirit. Nevertheless, those who can appreciate a quality game quality will be able to savor the courageous work of the main actors in this often difficult film journey of life in Gallic low.
