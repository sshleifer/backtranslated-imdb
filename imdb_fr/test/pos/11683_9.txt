If I suppose you know what this movie is about, I'm also forced to assume that you came to this criticism knowing that you will probably see it no matter what I say. If all this sounds right - keep reading - you will probably find some harmony with at least part of this article. If you're undecided or not sure what happened in the late 70's and early 80's in the musical culture of young people in cities and suburbs, you should probably read one of the critics who claims to be objective instead. <br /> <br /> Although I did not grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene in which I really lived. At the height of hardcore, I was immersed in the years 1979-1981, everyone had a group and the only common denominator between the groups and, in fact, members of their audiences were: <br /> <br /> * rejection of conformity <br /> <br /> tolerance and pleasure of difference <br /> <br /> * desire to have fun - hard and fast <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, aversion to authority figures and violent dances from slam dancing were not part of what I had experienced, although some clans or factions tended to be intolerant of those who do not dress, do not speak or do not behave enough "punk". And there was often some undeserved credit from some of those cliques to those who were really trying to live up to the fascist paradigm of young anarchic, self-mutilated, and angry hateful plagues. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews with the public punks in the excellent documentary Cal-Punk by Penelope Spheeris "The decline of Western civilization" present a very narrow vision of the subculture that some of among us have appreciated, interviews with groups, club owners, promoters and even security guards are much more representative of at least my own perspective and my memories of "the scene". Nevertheless, it is possible for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is to experience this film without their preconceived ideas being questioned. Unfortunately, it is only the responsibility of those who promote, believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes - not filmmakers. Do not blame the messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here will not be for everyone - or even most. This is not the coarsest material, but it is strong, hateful, fast and less concerned with technique than with raw energy. <br /> <br /> For me, seeing Black Flag in the beginning with Ron Reyes singing, X, Fear and Circle Jerks was worth more than the cost of this hard-to-get movie. As much as I like The Germs, see Darby Crash for the mess - and the nice boy - that left me a little cold. Nevertheless, the scenes of Darby playing with his tarantula while "Shut Down" buzzed in the background were precious. X's interview is also excellent. <br /> <br /> The simple documentary style of Spheeris is complemented by wild panoramas and zooms over the musical segments. During interviews, framing is very well used to provide context for everything that is said. Given his experience and the budget allocated, Spheeris did what everyone could do with this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended to those who appreciate the content of this film and to those who have forgotten these few years of pleasure Honest Rebellion without direction before the American punk is co-opted into another current within the musical current and that stereotypes have become more important than the basic philosophy.
