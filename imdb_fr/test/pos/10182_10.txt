I was trained in this series as surely as the sea would take me away. Although it started slowly, I found that the realism of the ship's representation, the variety of characters and the lively dialogue keep me from watching. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, grown up and changed during this trip and I wanted to be there for that. I was not deceived. The series has taken you from humor to tragedy and everything in between, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was a wealth of emotional layering, interaction and expression - ruthless and compelling to watch. The ship's movement added an almost whimsical element to the many scenes, making the characters sick for a moment and adding humor to the next. <br /> <br /> Edmund Talbot is a complex character to see often. We may know where the captain or Mr. Prettiman is, but these are older men, who are well versed in their habits. Talbot was young and arrogant, continuing to learn, test himself and be tested. He had trouble getting along with others and making mistakes as a real person would, but he had a heart that could be touched, that grew with every hard experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; it's too rare in the cinema and on television.
