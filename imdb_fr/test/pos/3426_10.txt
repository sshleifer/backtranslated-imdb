The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experience. This film does an excellent job in revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I think everyone should see this film because I think that few people outside South Africa understand its past and what we are trying to do in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has a part of its history that remains a source of persistent hatred and bitterness. We must all understand the ways of dealing with the past. What is happening in South Africa should guide us all. I found it credible, moving and sometimes overwhelming. There were no outstanding acting performances, but it added strength to the narrative. Once again, the BBC has been instrumental in supporting a complex subject and producing a high-quality film.
