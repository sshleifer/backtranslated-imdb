Why would not the end of the film be that of Sean Connery's men fighting the French instead of the Germans? Since the French occupied Algeria in 1830, Moroccan and Algerian tribes raid French military and civilian colonies. This film could have been a continuation of this historical aspect where the French had seized the Rasuadli so that his followers did not burst into Algeria, then his followers would have attacked the French to free him. <br /> <br /> The film is still stereotyped shootings between Germans and Americans. When Americans fire on Germans, their weapons (even guns) make noise, generate large gunshot wounds, and their enemies scream after being hit. When the Germans fire on the Americans, their weapons do not emit serious sounds, do not cause bloody wounds and their enemies emit little or no noise after being shot. <br /> <br /> In real life, the American rifle Krag It was the worst rifle that America has ever made until the arrival of the first version of the M-16. The Krag was hard to maintain, not reliable and the rifle lock was still blocking. The German Mauser was one of the best guns in the world. We were so impressed during the Spanish-American War that we made a copy of it and we call it the Springfield rifle. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Moroccan people must know how to speak of artillery, because the French used it. them in their raids against Morocco. I did not like that when they made the Rasuldai feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the Moorican vocabulary. Instead, the Rasuadli said the Europeans had rifles on wheels that were shaking the ground.
