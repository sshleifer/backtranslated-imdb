Arthur Miller certainly knows. His stories give a clearer picture of what it means to live in the United States in the twentieth century, more than any other writer I can think of. <br /> <br /> Focus, based on one of his novels, is no exception. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Laura Dern give fantastic performances here. Injury emotional but ultimately rewarding, this film is excellent.
