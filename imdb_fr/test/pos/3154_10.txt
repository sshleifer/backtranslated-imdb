In 1858, Tolstoy wrote in his diary: "Politics is not compatible with the artistic, because the first, to prove, must be one-sided". This thought of a great spirit applies to USA The Movie. The film could be read by those who have a narrow vision as a 90-minute slam of Bush, Cheney and. Al. As well as a tear of America as an uncontrollable imperialist force that will eventually be destroyed by its own madness and thirst for power. The most open-minded viewers will take note of the recurring images and themes that make this DVD a testament to postmodern thought, as the main character breaks into pieces surrounded by recurring visuals of the natural world contrasting with artificial constructions; tours, roads, video monitors, radio, vehicles. Especially the worrying threat of wars that have been and are to come bustling all the way through. War and war rumors are what is created, destroyed and recreated on the screen, in our conscious world and in our unconscious mind.
