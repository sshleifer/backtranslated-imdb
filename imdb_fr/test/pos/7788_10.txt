This is the best movie released in Bollywood so far. The best comedy, the best acting and the best direction so far! The writings and direction of Rajkumar Santoshi prove that he is one of the best directors in the sector. Aamir Khan was absolutely amazing, Salman Khan looked good in his way of acting. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep acted as usual! This comedy is still copied by people and no other screenwriter and director has ever been able to do that! Even Rajkumar Santoshi has not yet managed to make this cult classic! This film was a flop when it was released, but it has been a cult classic since its release and has been loved by all kinds of people. <br /> <br /> STAR. <br /> <br /> ACTING 10/10. <br /> DIALOGUES 10/10. <br /> <br /> SCENARIST 10/10. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION 10/10. <br /> <br /> MUSIC 9/10. <br /> <br /> WORDS 9/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is highly recommended. If you had not watched it until now, you missed something big! It's a laugh and the best comedy I've seen so far! Classic films like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not even as funny as that. <br /> <br /> GREAT FILM, HAT OFF !!!!
