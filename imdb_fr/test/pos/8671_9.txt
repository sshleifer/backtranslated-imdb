Andreas arrives in a strange and inhuman place, where everything seems perfect. He did a good job, everyone is nice to him and everyone, and he really does not have much trouble even to find a beautiful girlfriend. But in this nameless city, Andreas quickly discovers that a perfect business-like world is really not a paradise. Really one of the best movies I've seen this year.

Simply beautiful the incredible scene in the underground subway.
