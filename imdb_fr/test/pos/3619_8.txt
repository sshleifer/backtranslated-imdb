As is often the case when you try to take a book of more than 400 pages and stuff it into a two-hour movie, a lot of things are lost. Here, director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) is taking an extremely ambitious project and is nearing completion. What we get is a charming and emotionally captivating film that seems to be somewhat incomplete. <br /> <br /> There are many wonderful and fantastic things in this movie. The cinematography of John Toll (director of photography for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is splendid. By working with Madden, the choices of places on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the images that come from the photography of these majestic places in varied light conditions are lush and beautiful. Madden also uses many Greek actors as city dwellers, which gives the city an authentic atmosphere. The soundtrack is also fantastic and the mandolin passages and voices of the Italian soldiers are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Madden does a great job bringing us Italian occupation and romance, which occupy much of the film. . There are many sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. However, by the time the drama of the serious battle is ready to unfold, there is not much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and shortened. Although the battle scenes are well prepared, it is obvious that more and more compromises are being made to prevent the film from going on too long. By the time we reach the post-war scenes, the treatment is simply skeletal. Another disadvantage is that the DVD is particularly thin on feature films. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is charming in romantic head as a sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. When he has to fight, Cage shifts into a fierce, resolute and resolute man who remains credible in both characters. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz, whom the camera adores, gives an uninspired performance as a Pelagia. This is partly because Cage so dominates the screen, but Cruz seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. It allows the character to be objectified as Corelli's love interest rather than claiming to be a powerful character in his own right. <br /> <br /> John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as an old wise doctor, who knows as much about the man. nature as a medicine. However, Christian Bale seems a little overworked and stiff as a fianc√© of Pelagia. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie as an 8/10. Despite some disadvantages, this is a touching film that is worth seeing. The photography alone is worth the price of entry.
