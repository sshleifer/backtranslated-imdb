One day, a cat from the red alleys gets fed up with kicks from people. He is attacked by dogs and thinks that life would be better if he was a skunk. He then paints himself in black with a white stripe on his back and adds some Limburger cheese to make him stinky. At first, life could not be better for him, the dog ran away and the butcher left his shop, leaving the cat to go with a pile of meat. Just when he thinks everything is perfect, he is noticed by a real skunk, not just any, but by Pepé Le Pew, a man very in love. Pepe takes the poor cat for a skunk and pursues him thinking that his protests are only shyness. Our poor cat thinks he has escaped by throwing a skunk skin in a high-rise building so that Pepe thinks he is dead. At first, it seems to work, but by sneaking, he immediately forgets the dead skunk. In the end, the cat realizes that it is better to be kicked and attacked than to be coveted by an excited skunk ... there is a beautiful ending for skunk also when his wife discovers what he did. <br /> <br /> It was a pretty funny introduction to Pepé The Pew who at the time was too much in love, but now looks like a harassing sexual stalker, although he was punished for his behavior at the end .
