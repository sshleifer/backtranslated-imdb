For all American fans of Deneuve, this little gem is a little hard to find. Fortunately, I found myself so engrossed in the short clips that I previewed on youtube.com that I was ready to go anywhere. I found it on ebay.com, ordered it directly from France and changed my laptop so that it could play region 2 DVDs. Let me tell you it was worth it . Be warned - there are NO subtitles (unfortunately, Pathe should not have posted this on DVD, Koch Lorber should have done so - they are good with subtitles). I do not speak a word of French. I can pronounce a syllable here and there, order a drink and all the rest. That said, this movie was a treat anyway. I could not fully appreciate the supposed humor "debauched" or the spiritual dialogue. Watching Deneuve and his cohorts was enough for me. I understood what was happening without needing dialogue. It really says something of a movie when those who can not speak the language appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is beautiful. London is adorable like his son-in-law. I loved the lesbian mom. And of course, what can I say about our dear Miss Deneuve? She is one of a kind. Those eyes, that smile. I could watch his movies all day long. She really goes beyond beauty. People always say that she is beautiful. Well yes. But she is also very talented. I believed it every second of the way. His conversation about chocolate and vanilla with London is too sweet. His character is even arrested for smoking drugs with a 15-year-old girl on the street. DO NOT MISS! Fly to France and buy this if you have to Great. ten
