*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Do you believe there is a part of yourself In your mind, with things you do not want other people to see ... During a session, when I'm inside, I can see these things. "<br /> <br /> - Catherine Deane <br /> And us too. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "The Cell" is a film of love / hate - whether you love it or hate it. I can understand why some people do not like this production. With a story that combines annoying serial killers with mind polls, "The Cell" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think it's one of the most captivating movies of the year. <br /> <br /> Making his debut as a feature film writer, Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world rich in colorful images and provocative characters. Filmmakers take advantage of every shot. Protosevich devised ideas for "The Cell" in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his main interests, psychological questioning and serial killers. He was influenced by filmmakers like Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such an imagination. <br /> <br /> The film combines two major narratives, one on the scientific exploration of the human spirit and the other on a psychopath who murders young women for their own sexual pleasure. Child therapist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is participating in a neurological study at the Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of his empathic personality, scientists chose Deane to immerse themselves in the mind of a catatonic teenager in the hope of reviving his brain upon waking. <br /> <br /> A sick, demented serial killer roams the streets. In an abandoned rural farm, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) traps innocent victims in a large glass cell where he drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI each time they approach, until now. A violent crisis makes him comatose. The FBI captures his body forever unconscious. Unfortunately, he has already prepared the cell with his latest victim. In forty hours, the cell will fill with water and Stargher is the only man to know the place of detention of his victim. <br /> <br /> The FBI takes this situation to Campbell Center, where Catherine enters Stargher's mind. in the hope of discovering the location of his last victim before the cell fills with water, sending it into a liquid grave. <br /> <br /> Parts of the history of science fiction were based on both real science and theoretical fiction. neurological mapping and synaptic transfer system. The premise takes a long time to develop, but it is worth it. It's exaggerated, but it does not matter. The film makes us believe. Even if you do not suspend disbelief, the visual appeal offers an attractive setting to enjoy. <br /> <br /> According to the production notes of the film, Mark Protosevich was delighted to collaborate with the director, named Tarsem, because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his sense of detail, his stunning art direction and his great ability to tell a story. "When I wrote 'The Cell', says Protosevich, I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of paintings or photographs of painters while I was working, so I think visually, and Tarsem is a highly visual director. Tarsem has a similar frame of visual references that allowed for a very fluid collaboration. "<br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a spine, and no actor could have accomplished his character better. It delivers a mysterious performance, disturbing and engaging. "I think that my character is, in a way, trapped by himself," thinks D'Onofrio. He also studied the psychology of serial killers to help him sneak to the surface of the character. His deep preparation for performance is perfect. <br /> <br /> While the actors, the writer and the director do wonders with their material, the real honor goes to the film's talent behind the scenes. Director of photography Paul Laufer, set designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney and visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They give life to the world of "The Cell". It is an extraordinary world worthy of several views. Some movies you watch, others you meet. "The cell" belongs to the last category. <br /> <br />
