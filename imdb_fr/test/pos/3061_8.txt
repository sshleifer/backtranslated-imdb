This film must be released on DVD because it is the only way to buy it. I thought it was so funny because there was no real plot. It was not supposed to be an Oscar winning film. I appreciate these movies. Cary Elwes was a very cute Robin Hood. I can not even think about my favorite part of the movie because they are all very good. In any case, peace outside. !!!!
