Starewicz is always inventive and his techniques still surprise animation fans 70 years later. We may have computer-generated techniques now, but all he had in 1934 was an imagination that would not take "no" as an answer. Everything he wanted to see on the screen, he created. <br /> <br /> And he wanted to see something really weird - every piece of junk imaginable is called to the service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats ... seems like if nothing was forbidden. <br /> <br /> A really disturbing, even disturbing film, which should be seen by all those who have a passing interest in animation. This film must be seen to be believed!
