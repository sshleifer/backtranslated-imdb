Ok, here is the deal. There is this American pilot flying, taking care of his own business, when he is suddenly overwhelmed by diabolical and cowardly non-American warplanes (they are Middle Eastern guys, but suffice it to say that they do not like apple pie or Elvis Presley), who slaughter it. Now, this American pilot did nothing wrong, but these evil non-Americans did not care and even before you know it, he was busted in a foreign prison and sentenced to death! <br /> <br /> Now, what would normally happen here is that the US military was bombing several nearby cities until the pilot was released, but not this time. These perverse types of peace have probably been involved and have managed to stop any type of reprisal killings. As you can imagine, this does not please the pilot's family and the devilish foreign dictator has this look sufficient and satisfied. He will charge these Americans, oh yes indeed! <br /> <br /> But he did not rely on Doug Masters, the 16-year-old son of the captured pilots. You see, Doug was able to fly a plane longer than he could drive a car (which can not be so long) and decided to fly to this foreign and evil country to get his father back. So, with the help of his friends, Doug and his retired pilot winger - Chappy 'Sinclair, Doug launches a two-man air raid on foreigners. <br /> <br /> You would think now that this plan would fail, but you would be wrong. Of course, these guys from the Middle East can all be veteran pilots, but Doug has an ace in his sleeve, he listens to rock music when he's flying! After shooting down a dozen enemy aircraft and detonating an oil refinery, Doug landed at an airport and took his father, now injured, aboard the plane. Naturally, the evil dictator, who no longer looks so satisfied, gets angry with these antics and flies away himself to try to shoot down Doug. But the boy listens a little more rock music and blows the bad guy out of the sky. HURRAY! <br /> <br /> After Doug and Chappy have shot down 90% of their air force, the aliens are sending their last planes in a rather mediocre attempt to kill him, but soon after, steal the US F16s and scare them away . <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. It was the very first videocassette film I brought, and until I was twenty, I hoped my father would be shot for a foreign country so he could save him. But he does not like flying, so it did not happen.
