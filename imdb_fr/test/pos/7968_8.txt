Once you've sat down to watch this movie "A Cannon for Cordoba", you feel like it's going to be great. The reason? The film begins with a catchy score by the famous composer Elmer Bernstein, who offered memorable themes such as "The Great Escape and the Seven Wonders". Indeed, when you read the opening credits that is the star, the cast is none other than George Peppard, as captain Rod Douglas, you know there will be a lot of action. Moreover, when you see the actor John Russel in the role of General John J. Pershing, you know that you are going to have a heroic saga. The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican Revolution and involves the United States in a dispute between a border town and the Mexican bandits who crossed the Rio Grande in the early 1900s. General Cordova (Raf Vallone) is one of the most the bravest leaders of the rebels. With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacks Pershing, kills his men and steals valuable pieces of artillery. Since the US military can not legally enter Mexico, Captain Douglas is sent to what is planned for a suicide mission, with no order or assistance from Pershing. His mission is to recover the cannons, destroy a rebel fortress and bring Cordoba back to life. Selecting the toughest, hardest, most experienced and certainly the most insolent men available, Douglas enters Mexico and attacks the almost impregnable fortress. A dramatic action ensues, as well as a lot of explosive excitement. If we ask for criticism, I would say the choice of heavy. Vallone and John Larch are not very threatening. This is not the case for the men who are siding with Peppard. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (Which is superb.) Nevertheless, this film is recommended because it is well seen. ****
