A small town child who works in a big city becomes a huge star and becomes uncontrollable. He shows you the rise to glory and then fall from glory and return to a small rise. Excellent cast of actors and excellent director = a very good movie called Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> P.T Anderson. An incredible director who made Boogie Nights incredible. From the beginning to the end of the film, you can feel how beautiful this movie is. Some scenes are breathtaking, literally. A beautiful story, a good movie. Mark Whalberg was fantastic, Philip Seymour Hoffman was wonderful because he is in everything. Thomas Jane was also beautiful and although he played only a small role, he played it to perfection. There is a scene from this film that I can not live without, "The Drug Deal Gone Bad Scene" was amazing, the game of music and cinematography combining to make it incredible. I had not seen Boogie Nights and, thank goodness, it's so complete and I'm now a huge fan of PTA (Paul Thomas Anderson). <br /> <br /> Do whatever you have to do and watch this movie.
