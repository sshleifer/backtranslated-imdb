Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu is nice to watch. Fun animation, good character design and a playful story make Suzumiya Haruhi enjoyable. After my first viewing, I thought this anime was pretty good for a second monitoring. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the procedure is messy and once you look at it in the right order, you will notice connections that you had not seen before. (OR you may see a second meaning to some events you did not notice before). You may want to read Tanigawa Nagaru's original novels (not mangas) before / after seeing this. The anime is very good for viewing all the details of the stories it shows. <br /> <br /> However, there are some news from the book that are not animated, but are referenced. (Bamboo w / attached greetings shown in episode 14) All in all, this anime is actually very good once after a brief analysis of the plot (reading the book also improves it). It's a nice break from the shounen-jump anime that seems to take over.
