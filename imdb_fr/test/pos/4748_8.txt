I recently had the video THE SEVEN-UPS and I must say it was a very nice movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are excellent as cop and crook respectively and a young Richard Lynch is excellent as a psychopath Moon. The late Bill Hickman is very good as his partner Bo and sets up a brilliant car chase that will take you to the edge of your seats. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are rather bland, but that's to be expected. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that many people on this site have supported this film. I think it should be a movie that should be released on DVD and not just forgotten. I certainly enjoyed every minute. The final scene between the two main actors is excellent because the villain must face the consequences of his actions. THE SEVEN-UPS does not disappoint.
