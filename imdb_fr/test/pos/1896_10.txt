This film is fun for more than one reason. There is action. He has a sense of humour. He has the attitude. This is the army of Dolemite kung fu girls! And that's exactly what the film offers as a film. It is also badly acted by some, the microphone makes more than one appearance, and some "punches" miss feet. But when you make such a cool film, who has time to pay attention to these "details"? This movie is great. Rent it tonight, if you can find it ... I had to buy it to see it, but I do not regret it!
