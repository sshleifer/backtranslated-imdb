I watched this movie the other night and I must admit it was probably the best movie of this generation. It turns out I was not born until 1988, but I can understand this film as Cary Grant may have an STD, or Burt Reynolds being a burnout. Marky Mark has not lost his climax after his brief stint in New Kids on the Block, which I will now call "the best band in the world (aka BBW) .It's totally a morality tale about fargin trannies love all and continue to support Marky Msrk because he has more than ever need us because he is the only boy to have survived De-sharted.
