This is an example of what film school speakers would call a good first film. He follows all the rules. Short, relevant, inexpensive scenes to shoot, guerrilla movies, no decor (just decommissioned buildings) and perhaps an empty hospital wing. In addition, even the stock of black and white film was a stroke of genius, probably chosen more for its low cost than for its film effect, but it worked. <br /> <br /> Reno was amazing as a Brute. Everyone was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and there were no more soft pieces to distract you. A tight budget film, well designed and profitable. <br /> <br /> Released in 1983, this film was created just before the art of big-budget action movies was refined by the Hollywood filmmaking engine. The production of films was more exclusive and therefore more difficult and needed better people in the right places than today, thanks to the Internet, Luc Besson should therefore have negotiated and keep his promises. achieve this result, which makes the final product all the more remarkable. <br /> <br /> But, once again, French cinema has always maintained an excellent reputation (yes, I know that Luc Besson is Belgian, but the film is a French production) and has been the source of many remakes Hollywood. <br /> <br /> If I have a criticism to make, it is that the cover photo of the DVD (and maybe even the original poster) does not resemble the film whatsoever and seems to be a rather weird image rather than representative of any of the movi The themes of e - at first glance, it seems to be a man in post-apocalyptic armor on a swing, but at the second inspection, a man in armor carrying a spear on an office chair, legs resting on a desk confident posture. This never happens once in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a stock of black and white film, zero dialogue, physical play, tight scenes and brilliant actors make this movie one of the most interesting to add to your private movie collection. A superb movie.
