Idiocracy is as good as Microsoft Office Space, but with a broader scope. To criticize this film as being too childish because of its potty humor is to miss the point, I think. There are wax jokes, etc., but they are not really meant to be fun for the audience. They exist to define the state of "culture" in the world of the year 2500 AD visited by Joe, as a backdrop to the bizarre state of affairs in which he wakes up. The true humor of the film lies in the many gags and attitudes present in this future society, which are only the shadow of what we encounter in our daily lives and which should serve as a warning. My favorite is the Fox News description. The subtlety of the film lies in the fact that it is also interested in the "intelligent", and the average Joes as protagonists. Note the moments in the film where Joe and Rita almost unconsciously conform to the idiots around them and you realize that idiocracy is not created to attack a particular group of people, but to the culture of the idiocy in general. I do not know what to say about Fox's "made for conspiracy theory" behavior at the release of this movie, but if it's not in your local theater, ask for it.
