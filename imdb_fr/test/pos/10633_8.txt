This beautiful actress makes one of her best appearances on the screen, guided by the sure hand of Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Ms. Huppert's works demonstrate economic gestures, yet she projects so much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika. <br /> <br /> The support cast does wonders under the direction of the director. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect as mother of Erika. She seems to be the key to everything that's wrong with her daughter.

The beautiful music heard in the film comes mainly from Schubert and Schumann, two composers preferred by Erika. The film is enormously helped by the cinematography of Christian Berger.
