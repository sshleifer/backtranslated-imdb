*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, since I'm a big fan of H: LOTS, I may have liked the movie more than normal people. However, this film is still excellent. There were tons of surprises and it closed the show again. Although I was sad that Bayliss turned into a murderer, the general feeling I felt was satisfied.
