Most of Brigitte Bardot's films I have seen have not been able to take full advantage of her captivating presence on the screen. Unfortunately, he was given some very good roles in films of undeniable quality, which was a real oversight. She deserved them and was able to demonstrate all her cinematic power when they came to meet her. As a Genevieve in "Love on a Pillow", we had a clear exception to the trend of light and fluffy vehicles, as it was an interesting and reasonable piece of artistic film featuring a BB of 28 years. the most seductive. "A Parisienne" is another, featuring a captivating Brigitte in an interesting and well-designed comedy that shows how an ambitious man can be convinced to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife. There are several good performances here. Her husband, Michel, is one of them, "the prince", played by Charles Boyer, is another, to the entertaining efforts of a good cast. As for Brigitte Bardot, her appearance in this film is the one I remember when she was a child in the fifties. She was 23 years old in 1957 and was ahead of her time, more beautiful than any other actress of that period, including Marilyn Monroe. His flirtatious and coquettish sexuality, widely staged in several tight dresses, jumps to the chest, just jumps from the screen. She was more trendy and cute than women in America today, nearly fifty years later. Obsessed with their careers and still clinging to feminist politics, they stand out like a bunch of helpless lesbians. In contrast, the sexual pussy was sexually liberated, intelligent and clearly independent long before it was fashionable, while fully understanding the power of her exceptional femininity, she used it for a purpose higher than the simple self-interest - she believed in love. A picture just could not do it justice. He had to look at his slim but voluptuous shape (with his size of 20 inches) to cross a room slightly. You had to see that wild blond mane, look in her big brown eyes and seduce and listen to her sulky mouth speak French. In a close-up at the end of this film, she winks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful glittering orbs. What baby! For fans of Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" is not to be missed.
