It finally struck me to watch my Christmas VHS in Connecticut, which another movie reminded me of. If it was not the fact that the other had been made 20 years later, I would say it's a remake. <br /> <br /> Just as Rock Hudson was a phony fishing expert for Abercrombie & Fitch who had to get some fish While training at a fishing tournament, Barbara Stanwyck plays Martha Stewart in her quarantine version. <br /> <br /> A culinary columnist who built the image of life on a small farm in Connecticut with her husband and baby cooking these wonderful delights. The problem is that she is single, childless, writes her column from her apartment in New York and can not boil water. But his writing is a hit with the public. <br /> <br /> Boredom comes when it's diverted to prepare a Christmas dinner at home for a war hero sailor portrayed by Dennis Morgan, who also sings some songs. Keep the image at all costs. And his publisher, Sidney Greenstreet, is so fond of the idea that he invites himself to dinner. <br /> <br /> It is with the farm borrowed, the baby and Reginald Gardiner, who would like it to be real with Stanwyck, that she tries to brave. through. <br /> <br /> Christmas in Connecticut is now a Christmas classic and rightly so. The tracks are warm and human and have the support of assembled players. S.Z. Sakall as owner of Stanwyck's Hungarian restaurant / girlfriend from whom she gets her cooking information and Una O'Connor as a housekeeper has a nice chemistry between them. Reginald Gardiner and Stanwyck have no chemistry, which is obvious to Reggie and he's funny in the way of his stuffed shirt. <br /> <br /> Most people remember this film as one of Sidney Greenstreet's rare comedy adventures. If he is not a villain, a cynical observer of life or a tyrannical tycoon, Greenstreet has few other things on the screen. Christmas in Connecticut gave him the rare opportunity to play burlesque with his own image and he took advantage of it. <br /> <br /> In a biography of Barbara Stanwyck, she mentions that she had the pleasure of experiencing Christmas in Connecticut as a welcome change from nasty parties like Double Indemnity she had done recently. What made the film so enjoyable was that, between two shots, director Peter Godfrey and Greenstreet organized impromptu animations with English Music Hall numbers. Designed for a relaxed and warm decor, the cast reacted accordingly. <br /> <br /> Now, if only someone is filming these numbers.
