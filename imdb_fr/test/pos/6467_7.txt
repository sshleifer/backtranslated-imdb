"Edge of the City" is another film that owes a lot to "On the Waterfront". From his home in New York, to the conviction that, no matter what problems you encounter, you can repair your wrongs. <br /> <br /> "Edge" also deals with ideas such as loyalty and racism. In my opinion, this is where the film does not succeed as "Waterfront". After 85 minutes, the film begins to build relationships and binds everyone so quickly that much of it seems forced and incredible. <br /> <br /> Possible Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. I do not think that these two characters, coming from two very different places, would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /> <br /> I think that all the under-plot of love with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so clumsy with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason it's in the movie is so that it can motivate him to do the right thing in the end. They could have shown that in different ways. I would have liked to see scenes of Axel in the military to illustrate why he is as he is. <br /> <br /> The acting game is excellent. Poitier is great in a well-written role. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957) a confident, respected and intelligent man. The cassavettes, like Axel North, although very good, do not seem quite up to it. Warden is great as a boss who knows the secret of Axel (although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is horribly staged - too many storage boxes). I thought Ruby Dee played the role of Poitier's wife wonderfully well. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Edge of the City" is a smart movie with a very good cast that is too much about being an interesting black style. image, without taking the time to let the drama build. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
