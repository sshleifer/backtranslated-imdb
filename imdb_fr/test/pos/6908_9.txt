I went to see Glenn McQuaid's "I Sell The Dead" during his North American premiere at Toronto's After Dark Film Festival. As it is the second time in the world, I did not know what to expect from this movie, especially since I did not see the short film that inspired this adaptation on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I will begin with a more elaborate synopsis of the plot, without giving up the revelations. <br /> <br /> This film talks about Arthur Blake, his transformation into grave robbers and interesting and supernatural discoveries discovered by him and his mentor. <br /> <br /> The costumes and scenography of this film were excellent. I was amazed to learn that the entire film was shot in New York and surrounding areas. The costumes were very specific at the time, really bringing you as a spectator in the spirit of the moment. This film works as well as a period piece as a horror comedy. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the two main characters has been very fluid. They played each other with ease. The dialogue between the two was very well written. Glenn has added his comic touch, even in tension situations. <br /> <br /> The story is very encompassing and the ball rolls from the beginning. I would compare it to a visual page editor, always wondering what will happen next. The characters themselves are all very lively and unique, adding different layers of emotion to the film itself. <br /> <br /> In total, I recommend this film to anyone who is looking for black humor and a bit of mixed horror in. <br /> <br /> 9/10
