Hooray for Korean cinema! Last year, I saw "Chungyang" and "Nowhere to hide", now I'm catching the directorial debut of Hur Jin-ho, "Christmas in August". The variety of themes and level of achievement speak volumes about national cinema, conducive to discovery. The main themes of this film are death and love. The graceful and thoughtful way that Jung Won (Han Suk-Kyu) faces his impending death and the sublimation of his desires for Darim (Shim Eun-Ha) out of love for her. I was deeply moved by his careful management of behavior and emotions, protecting Darim from unnecessary pain without rejecting it. <br /> <br /> The success of this type of film is based on the skill of the actors. Han and Shim excellent, both very expressive and naturalistic. A number of secondary characters, relatives, friends and customers of Jung Won, are quickly delineated to enrich the story without detracting from its main purpose. To live is to love, but everything must pass. The pain decreases. Life goes on.
