A movie that I have seen and enjoyed perhaps more than any other movie. I first saw it when I was a child and I loved the drama and the big decisive battle. As I got older, I enjoyed it as much or more than before, but now, thanks to all the components that work together to make it a true classic. The acting is awesome (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), the spectacular cinematography, the scenario is filled with jewels and the staging succeeds wonderfully well. It is vaguely based on a real event, and it shows the rush to Europe and an emerging America to split the "old sick" (the Ottoman Empire) as it collapses in a way that does not resemble to no other "historical" film I've seen. Humor, drama, action, love ... everything is together and deserves much more praise (a bit like 'The Great Waldo Pepper').
