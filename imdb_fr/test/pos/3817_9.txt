The Outer Limits is a brilliant show that leaves me for the most part with very strong emotions. There are definitely some bad episodes, but it's basically an old comic-pulp turned into a TV show, so we can expect it. Most of the time, it is excellently directed, well produced and directed, and often features big-name names that seem to like working in a solid, short fiction fiction translation in one-hour television format. <br /> <br /> The Outer Limits tends to focus on rather broad ethical / philosophical / moral issues and rarely ends without voice-overs, provoking serious thought. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the themes are a little too hammered for all except the most thorny viewers. In addition, while a certain level of mistrust of the government is likely to foster effective democracy, you may unfortunately witness several consecutive episodes of this absurd contradiction in terms of mistrust of the government. Army / CIA, etc. that any important group with power (the Roman Catholic Church, the Evangelicals, the People's Republic of China, etc.) is poorly enlightened in frequency, one to several times. <br /> <br /> While the show can beat a dead horse if it is watched enough, the overall quality is incredible, and I am grateful to Sci-Fi for having decided to continue broadcasting it until they produce a DVD game season by season (and I can afford it.
