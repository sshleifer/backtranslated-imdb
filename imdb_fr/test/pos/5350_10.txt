In 1989, Aardman Animations introduced the two heroes in The Grand Day Out. In 1993, they fought an evil penguin in The Wrong Trousers. And in 1995, they had to save sheep from an evil robot dog in A Close Shave. In 2005, they are back and they will fight against something that was cute and cuddly in The Curse of the Were Rabbit. In this feature film, Wallace and Gromit work in Anit-Pesto, a pest control company. There will be a giant vegetable contest, but rabbits continue to eat neighbors' vegetables. Wallace and Gromit are dealing with this problem. But Wallace had an idea. He will wash the rabbits' brains with his machine. After doing this, something suddenly eats all the vegies of the neighborhood and it's big. It's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the situation. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. He kept what the previous 3 chapters had and instead added a lot of Hollywood actors for the voiceovers, they put an unnamed cast for work and boy, they did a fantastic job. Wallace and Gromit have not changed. Wallace is still the cheese maniac, as he has always been, and Gromit is the silent newspaper dog. In addition, the scenario was not too shabby, unlike other family films. There is a twist of who is really the rabbit-hare. The management of Nick Park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a very good job with the script. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula, it was simply inspired by the style of previous chapters to add a touch of dark fantasy. Well done, Nick. Rabbits are also funny and adorable, but the funniest rabbit in the movie is the one with Wallace's mix in him. The characters were not bad and they were not boring, but they will never go beyond Wallace and Gromit. The animation is really fantastic and beautiful. I've never seen an animated movie about clay so amazing since Chicken Run. All in all, fans of both mind blows (including teenagers) will love this fantastic movie. It's a well done film that should receive an Oscar next year. Hooray, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10
