I just have the opportunity to find old movies from Austen and I understood because Persuasion is, has always been, my favorite work of Jane Austen and Anne Elliot, my favorite Austen heroine. It is therefore with great anticipation that I inserted the disc in my reader. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed either. I knew there were inevitably some drawbacks, so I'm going to spell them out and try not to be too upset. Anne Elliot is the most introverted character of Austen; she is the least talkative and the least spiritual. Anne does not say anything in the book, but only her feelings are described. It works very well on paper, but how to transfer that successfully to the big screen? Unless you make thoughtful voice-overs (which would become tedious after four hours), you have a long succession of clich√©s where the heroine says little or nothing, and has to communicate with her facial expression. This may give the impression that the film is slow and lacks purpose. If you need a more open style of Austen, then this movie is not for you; but if your style is moderate, and you tend to pick up unspoken "waves", it will meet all expectations. <br /> <br /> Anne Firbank (as Anne Elliot), is, fortunately, an actress whose face can transmit a lot. It looked like I had always imagined Anne Elliot would look: not a coup de grace - Anne was not supposed to be the elegant of the family - nor in her early youth - which is also emphasized from time to time. time by light and makeup. What you see is a person who looks a lot like Austen's character: someone whose appearance you might have once; but hear her speak and look closer, and she becomes more attractive as you know her. It's Anne Elliot, as animated by Anne Firbank. <br /> <br /> Captain Wentworth's portrait is cleverly managed by Bryan Marshall. Bitterness is never apparent in appearance (except on the concert stage); and, yes, I had a hard time believing that he hurt Louisa Musgrove and that she was interesting. But that's another point in Austen's book: he did not find it interesting, he tried to find it interesting and finally failed (sigh of relief). This also corresponds to the original story of Austen. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the representation of Lady Russell, which, in my opinion, was not really described in the book; this also appears in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> This is a film that has followed the book closely; I could write a lot more about fidelity to reproduce everything, but I did not have enough room here. Charles Musgrove remained one of the most dynamic characters (good humor), Mary the most annoying (I was dying to shut her up - but I had that feeling when I read the book too), captains and admiral that I found charming. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, I thought a little stiff. There was little or no fade from one screen to another - maybe it's because it's a TV movie. A scene - CHOP! - the next scene, the actors enter on the right, continue on the left, and - CHOP! - another scene, where the same thing happens. It was the only part of the movie that I felt I was cheating a bit. A small budget must be somewhere, I suppose. <br /> <br /> And, as I said earlier, if you prefer to go ahead with Jane Austen, do not bother with this one, find it too slow. I enjoyed it immensely because it brought a wealth of detail (the sets were elegantly elegant!) For an excellent adaptation of my favorite novel, Austen. I highly recommend it!
