when I was a kid it was the movie I watched. I think it's a good movie to watch for kids and parents do not have to worry about violence or obscene images. Rainbow Brite is a playful girl trying to make winter go away. she finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it for themselves. I love this movie and I think even adults can enjoy it.
