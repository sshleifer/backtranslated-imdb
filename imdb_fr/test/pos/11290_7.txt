Although it does not really matter to the movie, it's a myth of creation. God (a convulsive figure bleeding on a chair) cuts his organs with a razor and dies in his own filth. The nourishing earth rises from her corpse and impregnates herself with her seed to give birth to man. It is very unlikely, however, that you realize anything without first reading a synopsis, and that's not particularly important for the film, because it's more of a surrealistic thing about art house images, while ink, treated in black and white. Dark photography and minimal sounds (mostly drops of water, moans, scratches, etc.) create a dreary, dark atmosphere, but each scene lasts a little too long, as does the film as a whole. It could have been great as a short film, and the scene killing itself as a god was excellent and extremely scary, especially if you see the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when it lasts that long. what you see most of the time. <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie for style, images, atmosphere and original content.
