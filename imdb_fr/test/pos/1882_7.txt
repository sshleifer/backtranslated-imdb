I have not seen so many people in front of a theater since episode III of Star Wars. Both shows were sold, and for good reason. The man with the screaming brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm a dork too.) <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell was there and gathered the crowd! The movie was corny in the best way possible. It may be the funniest movie Bruce has done. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip-itude and his wacky facial expressions, he's crazy about laughing! Who knew that Ted could rap? <br /> <br /> I changed my mind, the person who stole the show was actually a robot. There is nothing more funny than a robot ... doing the robot. <br /> <br /> Regarding Bruce's performance: "I'm taking the 5th." Thank you Bruce. Thank you for being cool, thank you for taking the time, thank you for all the pleasure.
