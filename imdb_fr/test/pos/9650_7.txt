See Les Amants Reguliers immediately calls for a comparison with Bertolucci's film "Les rÃªveuses", which is in my opinion the best film made about the student revolt in Paris in 1968. In reality, the director Philippe Garrel does not seem to avoid compare with his much more famous colleague, sharing the same actor and even including a direct replica of one eye in the look of an old Bertolucci film. And yet, LAR is a different and interesting film. <br /> <br /> The story also seems familiar. The film begins with long scenes of the "riots" of 1968, perhaps among the best performed so far. The film is made in black and white, and the perspective of the static camera on either side of the barricade recalls Eisenstein. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action takes place in the Paris apartment where the heroes of the vanquished revolt make art, smoke drugs, dream and fall for each other. There is no direct social comment, no real explanation of the background of the revolt. The film focuses on the psychology of the characters and the love story between the main characters. It's like a premonition of the 1968 transition process to the establishment. It's just that not all participants can adapt or survive. <br /> <br /> The film speaks more about the characters than their characters. The events. And it's just for the style that will be remembered. Black and white cinema is memorable not only in the scenes of revolution, but also watching the evolution of the characters. Many sequences are enriched by a technique derived from films of silent films, with long shots accompanied by a melody off piano. The effect is exquisite. However, the length of the film is barely justified, it lasts more than three hours and I doubt that cutting it at only two hours would have been a failure - in fact, I am convinced that it is quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> Without The depth and subtlety of Bertolucci's film, LAR, is another perspective from one of the most important years in the history of France and the world in the 20th century.
