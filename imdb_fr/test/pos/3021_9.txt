A gorgeous and loud thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), who is urged by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use his therapy on Carl Stargher (Vincent D 'Ofornio). ), a serial killer who (uses a strange and horrible torture tactic) is found in a coma by the federal government. What Novak wants from Deane is to know where Stargher's latest victim is and if she is alive. Once Deane enters the Stargher spirit, which looks and feels like a colorful combination of David Lynch's "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" of Wes Craven, the adventure begins. Deane sees a variety of strange people, ranging from Carl in his youth (an adorable Jake Thomas) to a man looking like Freddy Krueger minus the claws of the razor. I do not want to give the ending, but the film is great in addition to the dynamite performances, Howard Shore's scary musical score and the staging (of Tarsem, which shows here that he can lead).
