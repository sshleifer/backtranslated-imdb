Do not let the film's very diverse reviews discourage you. You will love it or hate it according to your tastes. However, if for no other reason, see "Greystoke" to feel the excitement of a great actor who grabs your heart as he breathes life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor, he knew perfectly well how to handle Shakespeare. we must rather remember him for his sensitive treatment of each character he has described. He has never been indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the role of the sixth Lord of Greystoke, his last performance, must be cherished by all who love the theater.
