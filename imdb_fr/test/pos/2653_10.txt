There is really no way to compare this film to another movie because no one has ever done something like that and nobody will ever do it. And it really has to be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least, it deserves to be seen with great sound. <br /> <br /> I saw this film the day it opened in 1968, my last year in high school. I went there because I like science fiction and I wanted to see a "spatial" film. Remember that this film was made before the first landing on the moon. <br /> <br /> We sat, waiting for the movie to start. But SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no attractions to come. For some reason, the theater owner at the Cooper Theater chose to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the lights still on. So we all stood up. We never did it in a movie before or since, and then we sat down at the end. Then the theater became completely dark and the strange opening began with the barely visible blank screen. <br /> <br /> The opening ended and my seat began to vibrate when the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, with the first bass notes, then my senses were submerged, hearing " Also Sprach Zarathustra "for the first time in my life. The journey had just begun. <br /> <br /> (I strongly recommend you watch this opening, this movie, in a dark room with your subwoofer turned as high as possible to get the effect I felt in this theater.) Of course it took a while to get to outer space and the film that followed was anything but a sci-fi movie. The INTERMISSION arrived (a good thing, very underestimated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other, amazed, caught our breath, then the ride resumed, wilder than before. <br /> <br /> I've seen 7 more times in the next year, always in a true full size theater, like all the theaters before the multiplexes. I might have been "high" once, but I did not go to see him again and again because I was "stumbling". I went there because I knew I was seeing a work of art. IT WAS SO DAMN BEAU; the sound you could feel in your bones followed by a terrifying silence; unimaginable and unimaginable views; the affection for HAL turn into terror. And of course, was WTF Kubrick really trying to make me understand? Years and years and many other visits later, I understand it too, I think, as I will always do. Read someone else's comments. If you are looking for someone to explain it to you or to search the web, you will find "explanations". It is not my intention to write these comments. <br /> <br /> What I hope What you have to do is encourage yourself to look at it patiently, to appreciate its beauty as to watch a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know (for example, Gayne Ballet Suite or Blue Danube); enjoy it as a good meal, sip it like a good wine; look and listen to the clues and hidden symbols that are there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTS to share with you some things that he has found beautiful and that he wants you to think about where you are. a human, from where you go. <br /> <br /> If it's too much work for your brain and you can not see, hear and meditate on the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then, excuse me for being outspoken, but your life is about as significant as that of a tapir or pre-monolith monkey. If you want to escape without thinking, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries and sensuality and you can have an open mind, this film will add something to your life .
