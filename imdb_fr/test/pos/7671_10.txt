I found this film one of the best for this time and that time. The cast was very exceptional and very entertaining for all who saw it. I wish my younger generation had seen this film, but I had not yet found or seen the film. The first viewing was back Since the early sixties, I've been looking for all this since. The film showed me how good we could be in a job where we could only have meaningless roles to play the role of buffoons and servants. <br /> <br /> Porky and Bess portrayed a part of my neighborhood's urban life as I saw it when I needed good solid male models. The song and the game made me jump several days, playing the role of different characters in this excellent film.
