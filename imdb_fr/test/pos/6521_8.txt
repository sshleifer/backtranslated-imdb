In a sport that showcases his originality and treasures, one of the greatest of them in the 1930s was the pitcher Dizzy Dean. He was so colorful that he was probably elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame for exceptional reasons, contrary to his statistics. After all in Dean's story, it's the early end of his career. <br /> <br /> In the pride of St. Louis, Dan Dailey successfully captures the character of Dizzy Dean, at least the dean I remember. I'm not old enough to remember his throw, but I remember him for broadcasting the baseball game of the week in the 1960s. That's also part of Dean's story: to be a pioneering broadcaster in radio and later on television. Now that advertisers are in the Hall of Fame, there is no question that Dizzy is one of them. <br /> <br /> Jerome Herman Dean was part of a tribe of children of sharecroppers with little education, but an incredible talent for throwing a baseball. at a blinding speed. In fact, he had a younger brother, Paul Dean, who was himself a very good pitcher. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna plays Paul in this movie and it's one of his first roles. In real life, Paul Dean was a quiet retired guy whose career had also been interrupted by injuries. Because of this, Crenna does not have much to work on. At the time of Dean's heyday, sports writers tried to give Paul the nickname of Daffy, but that never took. <br /> <br /> Joanne Dru, taking a break from playing, Western girls in gingham check dresses and corsets is first rate as a wise, patient and understanding Patricia Nash who met and married Dizzy while he was playing for Houston at Texas League. <br /> <br /> In the 1937 All-Star Game, Dizzy started for the National League. Facing Earl Averill of Cleveland, Dean was hit by a line shot. Refusing to listen to a doctor's advice, Dean came back too early to talk. He had broken a big toe and put too much pressure on his arm. He has never been the same thrower and his refusal to accept that is part of the story. <br /> <br /> If he had had a career of 10 to 15 years, who knows what launch statistics he could have had. Dean was the penultimate pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after Denny McLain (who was himself a character) did it in 1968, it had not been done since. <br /> <br /> Dean went on to broadcast and although he was not the first former player to enter the broadcast booth, his descriptions of colorful games immediately appealed to him. He started broadcasting for the other team in St. Louis, the Browns, and the Browns were a rather miserable team that did not have to be happy. Dean has become a star attraction. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of Dean's story is the trouble he faced because of his lack of education and his colorful way of speaking on the radio. This is a part of the story I will not go into, but in the film it is treated with tact and humility and your eyes may become wet if you are more sentimental. <br /> <br /> A good baseball movie, a real tribute. to an American success story.
