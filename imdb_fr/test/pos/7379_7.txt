It was an interesting study of societal sexuality, as well as the "dark interests" of man. <br /> <br /> I can not say that the woman was a strong character - she was the wrong choice for the role in my opinion, it was a rich kid looking to escape his life of drooling. In fact, she was a rebel and had never matured for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman). It is obvious that he married her for his money and to cover his sexual desires, which is taboo. Rickman played his role in the t-shirt, his flirts with the young man and his very subtle hints of cheerfulness. The young man was gay up to the hilt! When he imitated Marilyn, it should have told the woman everything. It was also perfectly chosen. He wrote on Hustler. <br /> <br /> I was not crazy end, I knew what was coming. All in all though, Rickman's role was excellent, Reedus was good, Walker was not a problem, but I had doubts. For a gay themed movie, it was average, but not glaring at least. It's worth watching if you do not have "Really Madly Deeply" to try.
