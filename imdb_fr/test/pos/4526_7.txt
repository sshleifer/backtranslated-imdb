"Murder Over New York" is a fun entry into the Charlie Chan movie series, but if you pay attention, many intrigues are revealed to the viewer. On the way to New York for an annual police convention, Chan (Sidney Toler) meets Scotland Yard's former investigator, Hugh Drake (Frederick Worlock), on the same flight. Now employed by military intelligence, Drake sued Paul Narvo and his Hindu servant, suspected of sabotage around the world. Drake thinks that by contacting the elusive wife of Narvo, he will be able to locate the criminal master. <br /> <br /> When Drake will end up dead in the library of George Kirby, president of the Metropolitan Aircraft Corporation Charlie assumes he was killed by a newly discovered toxic gas called "tetrogen", administered via a glass pellet releases the poison when broken. Inviting Kirby to meet all his guests, Mr. Chan and Police Inspector Vance (Donald MacBride) question the attendees, one of them being the murderer. Among them are Herbert Fenton (Melville Cooper), another student of Drake in Oxford, actress June Preston (Joan Valerie), unknown to Drake but invited by him, Ralph Percy (Kane Richmond), chief designer of the company Kirby aircraft, and Keith Jeffrey (John Sutton), Kirby stockbroker. Butler Kirby Boggs (Leyland Hodgson) is also suspect, especially after his son, Jimmy (Victor Sen Yung), at number 2, opens it by steam opening a telegram whose content concerns Boggs himself . <br /> <br /> There are other characters skillfully planted in the procedure as well. Narvo introduces herself as Patricia West (Marjorie Weaver) and, contrary to Drake's suspicions of wanting to take him to Narvo, is on the run to flee her former husband and her disastrous marriage. She is involved with David Elliott (Robert Lowery), director of a research company in chemistry, and therefore suspect in the tetrogenic angle. <br /> <br /> As in many of Chan's films, racial remarks must follow the course of the proceedings. . This one offers two crying. When Kirby's black servant is summoned for interrogation, he declares that he knows nothing about Drake's murder, that he is completely "in the dark". Chan's answer: "The situation seems contagious". <br /> <br /> Jimmy Chan comments later, following Inspector Vance's order to gather all the Hindus in New York, me. "In fact, the scene provides one of the elements of comic relief of the film, since Shemp Howard embodies the Hindu mystic "The Great Rashid", but is actually discovered by the police as a crook, Shorty McCoy. <br /> <br /> Before the end of the film, two more victims fell on the clever Narvo - his confederate Ramullah and the tycoon of the plane Kirby himself.To discover the murderer, Chan, together with Elliott, is organizing a test flight aboard a bomber TR4 recently developed after discovering a poisoned capsule planted by mechanics on the plane the day before, before it can release its deadly poison, Brit Fenton catches the capsule that falls in midair, revealing that he was aware for the plant Arrested and summoned for interrogation, Chan says that Fenton is not Narvo The real Narvo is revealed when he offers a cup of poisoned water to nervous Fenton, anxious to preserve the secret of Narvo. But Chan was clever enough to be wary of such an attempt and reveals the real murderer - Narvo now under the guise of stockbroker Jeffrey, after undergoing a reconstruction operation after a car accident. <br /> <br /> holes. In the first investigation into the murder of Hugh Drake, the police claimed that the fingerprints found in the library did not match those of the guests. However Jeffrey / Narvo was present at dinner. It had already been established that Drake had an uninvited visitor to the library, the chemist Elliott. If fingerprints did not really belong to Narvo, it would be useless to treat them. <br /> <br /> Similarly, at the end of the film, when Narvo offers poison water to Fenton, how did he think he would get along with everyone there as a witness? But even better, how would a global saboteur like Narvo have the time and the means to establish itself as a stockbroker in New York, that makes no sense. <br /> <br /> For trivia fans, a few extra points are worth mentioning. In the movie, son # 2, Jimmy, studies chemistry while he comes to the rescue of "Pop" to solve the case. In the previous film - "Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum" - Jimmy was a law student. <br /> <br /> The formula of toxic gases would be reworked in a later film of Chan, this time from Monogram with Roland Winters in the role of Chan in "Docks of New Orleans". In this story, the toxic gas is emitted in the same way by broken radio tubes to make victims.
