If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles. His gentle intensity to right a wrong is what made his career. "Blayde Hollister" comes to Dallas to take revenge on Will and Brian Malowe, who burned his farm in Georgia and killed his family. Inept Marshall gets in the way of Hollister's way, trying to stop him after a shooting in the street between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. Hollister stages the shooting and takes the Marshall "from the back-east" under his wing to keep him alive in Texas as he changes his identity. <br /> <br /> It was a good start and the photo holds up. The action may be a bit "slow" by today's standards, but it's one of my top 10 favorite movies.
