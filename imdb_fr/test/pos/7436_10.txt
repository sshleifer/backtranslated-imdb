It's really not hard to understand this movie! I watched it without expectations and without knowledge of the history of games. I was completely blown away! <br /> <br /> Initially, I wondered how most characters had some kind of super-power, but it's called "Final FANTASY ...". I was also wondering about Cloud's past, but it was pretty easy to watch. In any case, these questions did not spoil the pleasure of the film. All the opposite that shows that I thought about the story long after seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most beautiful films my eyes have ever seen. The music completely supports the film. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
