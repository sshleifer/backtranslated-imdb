I was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable film that caught my attention. I am a horror fan and I see almost everything in this genre, but Dead Line has managed to make me panic. The pace is very well regulated and Andr√©s Bagg achieves a good performance as a desperate man. What is under the main plot? A trip to madness. How can you finish like this? Martin Sanders asks himself the question when he sees a homeless person talking to him alone in the street. Towards the end of the film, Aaron Mandel's character asks the same question as he sees another SDF doing the same thing; not knowing yet that this SDF is Martin Sanders, answering the question of the beginning of the film. Glasses broken in two are a clear symbol of the breakup and division ... of the personality. The end is the jaw is falling and you just know that a sequel should be done.
