It was a very strong look at prejudices and group mentality. The cast is composed of superb actors doing a remarkable job. The decorations are beautiful and just a little stylized. The art direction is first rate with excellent cinematography. The story is tense and shows how prejudices and bigotry can flourish easily. It is disturbing for its realistic violence and its representation of a fairly typical community. I was very impressed.
