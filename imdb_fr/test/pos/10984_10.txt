I did not know much about this movie that went in my roommate had trained me there. I was so pleasantly surprised! The plot really caught my eye and held it, and the characters are well drawn and realistic. The scenario is very intelligent and fun, and the casting is doing great things with. And the best part is that he managed to be entertaining without sex or explicit violence! If this movie happens somewhere in your area, you should really go see it. Get up for this little movie, it's worth it!
