I only saw three episodes of Hack, starring David Morse, and it looks like I missed 37 episodes! well if ITV 3 shows them in chronological order. I just watched "Misty Blue" (episode 38). I really enjoyed the 3 episodes, but then I'm a fan of David Morse (especially at St. Elsewhere). For all who read this, Hack is excellent. Too bad it was broadcast on ITV 3. The cast is strong, although I can not get used to the idea that David is playing a curved cop, but we all know that it's the good guy who is accused to wrong. I see that Gary Cole was invited, what happened with 'Midnight Caller'? Ask yourself if Hack is available on DVD (for now). I just love it. Cheers.
