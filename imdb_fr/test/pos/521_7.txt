Sorcery, or witchcraft as it is commonly said in Europe, with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) waking up from a nightmare involving a witch. Jane's mother and father Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old abandoned hotel on an island about 80 km from Boston, to renovate and reopen it. Together with Jane and their youngest son, Tommy (Michael Manchester), Rose and Freddie plan to visit the island with architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to check the volume of work to be done. They also meet the domain. Agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) & hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island. Once there, they enter the hotel and begin to inspect the property as they get back on the boat. Sam is killed and the boat is let go to sail away. They discover two unexpected guests: a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) and his virgin fiancé Leslie (Leslie Cumming), who is looking for a book about the abominable legends and superstitions that surround this infamous island and hotel. As night falls on a violent storm, isolates them from the continent and a mysterious "lady in black" (Hildegard Knef) continues to emerge while the old evil that inhabits the hotel seeks new victims for demonic possession, human sacrifice and satanic rites ... <br /> <br /> The director of this film co-produced by Italian-Americans is a little mysterious since the IMDb names Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin, but according to some rumors, Joe D'Amato would have done the honors. to be honest despite his bad reputation, I found Witchery quite entertaining in such a bad way, it's really good. Harry Spalding & Daniele Stroppa's credited screenplay on IMDb is again confusing, as the real merit of the film itself is Daniel Davis. Anyway, whoever wrote this thing did a decent job, please, stop laughing. At heart, it's a horror of the haunted house, but it adds a few bloody deaths and a surreal feeling to everything. The different sets of characters have reasonable motives and did not annoy me as much as I thought, it's not very well drawn, it does not make much sense and the dialogue is not exactly objects of high-end drawer, but overall, Witchery entertained me for 95 minutes, sober and simple. It's pretty well paced, maybe a bit slow, but there are a lot of surreal, weird and horrible deaths to maintain. A part of Witchery that destroys some of its credibility is this so-called storm, there is no storm in sight and the sea is probably calm enough to swim, Witchery's so-called end of "twist" did not really work for me either. Check out the stupid expression on Cummings' face during the last freeze frame. The hotel offers a good secluded location and adds a certain atmosphere to the film, which gives off an indefinable sense of horror, a cheap horror. Technically, Witchery is not so bad at all, it was obviously shot on the spot, so it looks good and it's not the pinnacle of the finesse of the shoot, but the production values ​​are slightly better than planned. Violence and violence are typical of the euro, a woman stitched her lips is suspended in a fireplace, she can not shout while others illuminate, a person is crucified and burned alive, impaled on a swordfish, the veins of someone stretch & pop & a woman is raped by a man without lips. Witchery was shot in English, so there is no dubbing. David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair in the same film as in the role, what can I say more ?! Yes, ladies, Hasselhoff takes off his shirt and for the boys, Cummings takes off his shirt. Hasselhoff and Blair are very excited to watch, but the little boy is very annoying and can not really act at all. I'm sure most of the filmmakers will disagree with my opinions, but I still maintain the fact that I liked it and would look at it with pleasure, Witchery is quite fun and really worth the detour if you like them. bad movies or your horror fan in general.
