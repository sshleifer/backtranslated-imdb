Yes, I know that my title is zero. I could not think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant first season episode. Very interesting idea and good game too. Everything that looked like a worm was really terrifying in my opinion. I have never been a fan of insects, so all episodes of insects scare me. x] In any case, let's move on to the good and bad points of this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: The parasite. Awesome! <br /> <br /> Scully is finally trusting Mulder. Awww ... <33 </ p> <br /> It was a good idea to put another pest in the ear. However, if someone told me to put that thing in my ear ... I think the whole cabin would be dead. <br /> <br /> The bad: how did the dog stay alive for so long? > <br /> How did Huffman not have these black spots? Or maybe she did it, but nobody saw it ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: very good episode, especially for season 1. 8/10
