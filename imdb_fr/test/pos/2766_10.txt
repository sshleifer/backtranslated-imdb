Susie Q is an excellent romantic ball movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that the Disney company will one day be able to put this movie on DVD. I think it's pretty cool and a little hilarious. It's a little sad when Susie Q dies in a car accident at first, it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle, when no one suspects Susie Q, it becomes funny and surprising. There is a bit of mystery in this film but not much. But I would still recommend this movie to the whole family if they like movies like comedy, mystery or romance. It's good! I think Amy Jo Johnson like Susie Q is cute.
