This film presents two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other good films on the death penalty and executions. These also focus on the drama experienced by the victims' parents - without concealing the hatred and the desire for revenge they feel or mitigate the horror of execution - and the Christian vision of all the questions involved. We must also emphasize that in this film, the convict is not the kind innocent we see in other films about executions, which does not prompt us to abandon the idea that a criminal execution is anyway a murder committed legally. Finally, it is worth mentioning the extraordinary emotional weight of the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis illustrated by the last words of the convict and the detail with which the act of execution itself is presented in parallel with images of the scenes of murder in the forest to emphasize that we are facing another murder as ruthless as the last, but executed in a cold way and supposedly "legal".
