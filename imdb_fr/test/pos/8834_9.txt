Obviously, the answers here have been written many years after the release of the film and therefore can not be considered in their context. In 1980, after work in England, this movie was very funny. Rising Damp, with his friendly mockery of a complete social stratum, was one of the best British sitcoms of his time, if ever. It struck a chord with almost everyone and, in the British way, we made fun of Rigsby. America had nothing to do with this kind of humor because self-deprecation did not please our cousins ​​abroad. Leonard Rossiter was one of the best English actors, on stage, on television and in cinema. His commitment and professionalism were incomparable. Although young, Richard Beckinsale was a perfect comedy film for Rossiter and should, of all rights, be considered a great one. If he had not been taken so young, I'm sure he would now be ranked among the biggest actors in British comedy. Frances De La Tour found her best televised moment in Rising Damp and, for me, she never quantified her indisputable abilities with other roles. If you have not seen the movie at the time of its release, you are not qualified to comment, simply because you can not understand why it was funny, the humor of the moment.
