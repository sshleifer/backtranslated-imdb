Darr (1993) was an incredible movie. In my opinion, this is one of the best in Bollywood. The film itself triggers feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness and sadness. Shahrukh's role was incredible, he actually gave a new face to the obsession. The innocent and feminine character of Juhi Chawla contrasted greatly with the fiery and passionate character of Shahrukh. The role of Sunny Deol has made the role of the "good guy" look like that of the "bad guy". The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny, has captivated the public's attention proves that everyone has this inner helplessness to pursue something that is not really in their hands. Although the film is several years old, it surpasses all recent films. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality perfectly matches the role. He should seriously consider returning to a similar movie.
