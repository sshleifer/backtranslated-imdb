It's one of my favorite movies of all time, it's great to watch bands, I think. It's also great for all Alan Rickman fans, it does a great job. It's captivating, entertaining, very surprising ... you have to watch it twice. I did not look at it with people who did not like it or at least found it worthwhile.
