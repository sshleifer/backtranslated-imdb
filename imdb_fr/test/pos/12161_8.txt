Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but by that time almost all of Europe had fallen under the Nazi war machine. By entering the war, Great Britain was virtually nothing, with scarce supplies and an air force overwhelmed by Germany. But the will of the British was firm, emboldened by their new Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who said: "We will never go under." <br /> <br /> August 8, 1940, the battle for Britain was engaged. However, for the first time since Hitler's declared position to conquer the world, he came up against a wall. Although much larger, the British Royal Air Force went on the offensive and in the space of twenty-eight days in September and October 1940, the number of victims of the German Luftwaffe passed to two thousand three hundred and seventy-five aircraft and lost crews. Hitler's rage was boiling, but he had to ask for a momentary stop. Responding later in the year, Hitler launched a huge bomb attack on London on Christmas Day 1940. When I say that there has never been a disaster film that can rival London's actual images in flames during this assault would be a euphemism. The most surrealistic effect of this chapter of the "Why We Fight" series would be to see British citizens come out of their underground shelters after the bombing raids to take back what was left of their lives above the earth. Even as you look, there is no way to understand the vivid horror that these people have had to live because the city of London has been virtually ruined. <br /> <br /> However, the Nazis were also stunned and blocked. All that Hitler wanted to believe about freedom and democracy had now returned to his head. Instead of showing willingness and complacency like the French, the British would not give up without fighting. And they fought, taking the air battle in Germany and reacting in the same way with attacks on the German homeland. It was a turning point, forcing Hitler to rethink his strategy.
