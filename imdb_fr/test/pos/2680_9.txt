"THE KING OF THE QUEEN", in my opinion, is a pure success of CBS! Despite the fact that I have never seen each episode, I still enjoy it. For this reason, it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite. Still, I have to say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before closing, I would like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, that the scenery is spectacular, that the costumes are well designed and that the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, if this issue survives in the subscription after its release from CBS, I strongly recommend you watch it in case it disappears permanently.
