Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, fits perfectly with Melville's detective film (especially Bob the Flameur and the Red Circle) that he is totally focused on the story and the character and ensures that no words to be said without necessity, and was ahead of his time. Ionically, there is always a kind of professionalism among his characters, a kind of respect (if not for themselves than for others, a kind of duty) that resonates well in post-war France. His actors wear faces for those characters who say, "We know what they are," and from there, the story takes off. Maybe that's maybe because I have a weakness for flight images, especially when we only see the cogs (uh, physical side) of how a flight is done. <br /> <br /> One of the problems The film is filmed in today's movies is that it is very fast (Snatch) or in a way that we have seen too often before . Dassin, like Melville a few years later, decided to virtually create a silent film of heist, sound effects included. The tension that rises in this scene may not surpass that of Melville in "Red," but at its own level, it reaches its own magnitude and momentum, as well as a crucial originality compared to what has been done before. For example, during the cracking of the safe, some close-ups are among the best I've seen from France at that time. An additional benefit to the film, aside from the new wave touch at the larval stage, which ultimately makes it a bit more modern, is that the story works so well and differently. It becomes completely question of character at points, then keeps the chills. The last ten to fifteen minutes are miraculous; as with another burglary classic, Asphalt Jungle, it's not even the last stop that counts, but all the time we pass the call of duty, putting humanism before greed. <br /> <br /> all the excitement of the camera flying at high speed near the trees with the car that he could do well. Dassin offers here a very entertaining and intuitive film, with a very nice little musical number.
