I saw this beautiful movie leaving the college soon. As I sat happily watching Alice go from being a pent-up virgin to a sexual adventuress, I wondered why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Play! One of the lectures was on the psycho-sexual stages of development, essentially the change over time in which part of the body and the stimulations that flow from it, and the focus on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is bathing, focusing on the genitals and the bottom. His next meeting is oral with the mad Hatter's dingaling. I forget the rest of the conference and Alice's order of meetings, but I remember their correspondence. It's interesting to see a skin movie with some brains behind, rather than the clich√© "I'm here to deliver your pizza. <br /> <br /> I do not see how Kristin DeBell's career could be destroyed by this film because it was his first film. And Reagan's boring hypocrisies had not yet invaded this country at the time of publication, but in a way, he and his stooge Meese actually affected Ms. DeBell. When Meese set up her anti-pornography commission (to distract people from her own criminal activities), Meese hired an anti-porn activist named Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with the images she saw as child pornography. She saw the "Alice" blanket that Ms. DeBell made for Playboy and quickly announced that she had scientifically proven that Ms. DeBell was actually a collage of pictures of pieces of several adult women and the face of a girl of ten years. Yes indeed....
