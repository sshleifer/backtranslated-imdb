Oh so beautiful, oh so tearful and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Makes the impression that everything is so superficial, so pale, so insignificant in comparison. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen is not a true saint. <br /> <br /> He's a real human being - imperfect, raw and blunt, but passionate and with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> What I found most interesting is that this handful of miserable, miserable people have found meaning and laughter. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most is how the documentary describes the polarity of human nature.
