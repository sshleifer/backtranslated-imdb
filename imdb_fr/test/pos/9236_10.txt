After watching "A tale of treason in Texas," you feel a renewed disgust for the nature of the Hollywood beast. The interviews and conversations of everyone involved in the project reveal a common sense of camaraderie and rebellion that extends to origins, social classifications and even geography. This can be attributed to hard work on the flawless commitment of production in the project, to the love of the story of the original film and the complete creation of Vacuum who is the creator. The scale of the people involved in "The Hawaiian Vacation of Waldo" was incredible for me, with no budget or glorious production. There were no caravans or craft services, no amenities at all, yet all the people involved were stuck there. If nothing happens in this project, Antstuie Productions has laid the foundation for its serious and honest business status that will never do it and will sell it or sell it to make a movie just for its money. I would like to see any director of L.A. follow the guerrilla process to try his luck. More realistic than ever, cinema currently lacks CG and green screens. The masses can enjoy their entertainment spoon served to them in quiet censored pieces, but a lot of people here in the world share the opinions and ideas of filmmakers who still make films for the love of the material or love the narration, no DVD sales or ticket office. I loved this documentary and I hope that the IFC will have the booklet to take it and broadcast it, so maybe someone else decides to take a camera and film a real life so that the viewer can even understand temporary that everyone is the same and that everyone can be a true storyteller.
