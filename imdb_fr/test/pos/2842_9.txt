A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: who are the crazy? <br /> <br /> The answer becomes less clear as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger loses the message her voice and, even though her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as a shocked Betty. In fact, she's so efficient that I almost wanted her to be a little bit crazier because her created reality was so credible. <br /> <br /> This is the first time Ms. Zellweger has been called on to make a film and she is more than equal to the task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock ?? though as dirty as usual ?? is pretty submissive like Wesley. He is able to sublimate his manic energy and it only appears occasionally and always when needed. <br /> <br /> There are interesting hints: the first time you see Betty, she is dressed almost in the same way as Dorothy Gale. the Wizard of Oz" ?? and later in the film she is compared to Dorothy when she says she has never left Kansas before. At one point, the song for which Doris Day was the best known, "Que Sera Sera" is on the soundtrack, and later, Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes her as having "everything happening at Doris Day" . <br /> <br /> This is an extremely original film with good performances from everyone, including the cast. <br /> <br /> It has a surprising end which, on the contrary, seems rather predictable. <br /> <br /> If for no other reason than this movie has just listened to the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.
