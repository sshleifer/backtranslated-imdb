This film is a perfect example of a great escape! I loved this movie and I was sucked from the beginning. Of course, it's just an action movie, but do not you have fun watching movies? <br /> <br /> The actors in this film are very strong with nice characters. The friendship between the boys is so realistic and so appealing, it's comforting and hilarious to see a group of teenagers interact, especially this group of boys !! Sean Astin is a great rebel, successfully avoiding being an early teenager. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun, watch this movie! I really liked it even if I watched it on a very dirty and old VHS, very bad quality (Go DVD!)
