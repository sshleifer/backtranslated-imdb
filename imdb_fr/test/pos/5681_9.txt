I put this film on not expecting much, other than a festival B gore gore. Fortunately, I was presented with a very well done film, which built the suspense and managed to maintain it throughout its execution. It was an impressive feat. The acting was solid, creating characters that were important to you and that concerned you; and although some may find the film slow, it forced you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. In addition to that, there was a good work of camera and the directors have all concocted beautifully. An excellent effort therefore, it is well worth your time if you prefer the development and suspense to the gore.
