After reiterating how many Columbo episodes are brilliant, it's time to honor an episode with a maximum of points. "Study In Black" is not 100% perfect, but it's certainly more than 90% ... maybe 96 or 97! <br /> <br /> Last week, I reviewed "Just Married" and compared it unfavorably to "Meet The Parents". Well, here's one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much older role as the wife of the famous conductor Alex Benedict, played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex had an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl from the orchestra (this is not her first case, we suspect her). She makes Alex sing for him to leave his wife, but since his wife's mother holds the purse for the orchestra, Alex does not think it would be such a wise decision to destroy his career and his wedding overnight. Instead, he draws up a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a show and murder his young lover by making him believe in a suicide. <br /> <br /> Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realize that homicide is more likely than suicide. Columbo quickly connects Alex with the victim, and he soon follows him wherever he goes. Even though Columbo is certain Alex is his man, it takes a while and some false leads (none of which Columbo actually swallows) before he has the vital proof. <br /> <br /> There are some great characters, from Jennifer Wells' young, early neighbor to the English mechanic who sounds like he's more comfortable in Coronation Street, going through the brass. to the chagrined air that is almost prepared for the murder. (He had also seen Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). And there's even a brief glimpse of Commander Lassard's films from the Police Academy. As with Leslie Nielsen in "Lady In Waiting", it's impossible to take it seriously (I bet you're thinking of the speech he made at the podium, is not it ?!) <br /> <br But Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk are stealing the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine like Mrs. Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialing Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by the exact nature of their relationship. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite his intuition that something is really wrong. Columbo does not help things by interrupting his tennis game to ask impassive questions about Alex's relationship with members of his band. <br /> <br /> As for John Cassavetes, well it's a pity he did not repeat appearances as Columbo's villains, as he could have been there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as the one of the biggest in the series. But this performance is superb! This is another man who falls into the category "very irritated", losing patience with Columbo rather than befriend him. Despite this, when the game is finally over, he reluctantly recognizes the genius of Columbo. <br /> <br /> Well, it's a really, really fantastic show. He loses a few small points because of his rather underhanded view of classical music, as many posters here emphasize, but none of these affect the logic of history or characterizations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting! <br /> <br /> Finally, if you have not found it yet, there's an absolutely incredible clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70's. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything in the clip looks like Me know, I know you, from the brilliant introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra plays circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara laugh and ridicule the host. <br /> <br /> This might not be strictly relevant for this article, but the Cavett clip show provides insight into the deep friendship and professional relationships between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It is clear that the quality of "Study In Black" shows how well the pair worked together!
