All I can say is that every time I see CONRACK, dir. Martin Ritt, DP. John Alonzo, I feel a sense of inspiration and maximum enlightenment in that the power of cinema is possible in such a simple film. <br /> <br /> The film Conrack is shot in 1969. It is based on a true story. . It's the story of a white man (Jon Voight) who teaches a group of young black kids how amazing the world is outside their small island in South Carolina. <br /> <br /> History places the work of a noble teacher because of changing the lives of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
