"In the Line of Fire" is one of the best thrillers I've seen, building and building to a great climax. This movie really draws you into your beating heart and you're out of breath from the action. The cast is in strong performances, especially Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film was made by the master of suspense Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers do not get much better, do not miss that.
