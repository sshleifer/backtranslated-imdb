Abe Zwick has perfected the unique game, beautifully. He has never shot another film, but has created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hatred in this film that is both caustic and touching. He controls the screen by presenting the debris of a man who collapses under the weight of a life of less and less significant. <br /> <br /> Paul (Zwick) is an elderly queen who has somehow convinced Stanley (Wayne Crawford), a perverted idiot who has no idea of ​​the future, to follow his star. It's a little thief whose boiling hatred has intensified recently. He was forced to leave the city and settle in a suburb of Miami. As a disguise, he dresses like an old dry blue stocking with as much sexual torment as the Lady Church. He tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "Aunt Martha". Paul himself has no friends, spends much too much time alone at home and has to deal with Stanley's dissolute lifestyle. It would be enough to cross the border to a man to make a mania transgender homicide. <br /> <br /> Again, Zwick describes Paul as a tragic figure who has completely lost the understanding of how to build relationships with other people. Nevertheless, there is a certain poetry in his anguish, which burns slowly over the film. He is tragic, but also elegant. It's finally a very sad movie. There are certainly many hilarious moments, but despair and despair are so profound that the humor is bittersweet. This film is worth watching for Abe Zwick's performance. He could have really built his career on Martha. She is a good gas, once you know her. Just make sure to cut your hair and stop walking around. She really hates that!
