After the death of all senior officers, Commander Craig-Scott, from the laundry and morale corps, was promoted to command an intergalactic spacecraft belonging to Starcups Corporation. Its main mission is to search for habitable planets and, of course, long-lasting coffee markets. <br /> <br /> Craig-Scott and his second in command, Chief Blather, find themselves unprepared for command, except as they are perfectly capable of keeping the crew's underclothes clean - which does not diminish the importance of clean underwear, especially when incompetent commanders make these same underwear stained regularly. <br /> <br /> The episodes are presented in the form of a series of brief reports of 2 to 3 minutes written by the commander on Earth. Humor is a mixture of scandalous and impertinent physical comedy. Think Yes, the minister meets the red dwarf, but on a tight budget. All the usual intrigues of science fiction are present - extraterrestrials, nuclear weapons, computer malfunctions - but each is enhanced by the lemony scent of a high-quality laundry detergent. <br /> <br /> Commander's diary is definitely small budget, but the slightly tacky effects and props correspond to the absurd premise of the series. Do you remember those hilarious hockey helmets worn by old Battlestar Galactica? With the brand "Jofa" still visible? Okay, there's a lot of that in the captain's diary, but it's cute. <br /> <br /> The commander's journal is not great art, but it's not what he's trying to be. It's just a little fun off the wall. It's a good job to be that.
