I saw this on Horror Zone and I expected it to be shit like most movies they play, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck that pursues them (I know it sounds bad but it's actually pretty good), the film is terrifying when it intends to be and laughs funny in places (and not unintentionally either, it is well paced and very fun while being very gore, there is also a very funny black humor added.) This is not the film the more original, but it's the same, is not it, if your after a movie fun then it should go
