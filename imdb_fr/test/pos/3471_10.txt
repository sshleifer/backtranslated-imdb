I think the lady of the shop where I rented it recommended me this movie! For once, she was hooked! What a superb movie! First of all, I was convinced that James McAvoy and Romola Garai were so convincing Irishmen that their accents; and half way through the movie, I was totally convinced that Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and James McAvoy was too! When I watched the special reports on the DVD and saw the two actors in their "normal" appearance, saying that I was blown away would be a euphemism !!! I remember all the success that Dustin Hoffmann had in the 80's for his portrayal of autism in the movie 'Rain Man' - quite frankly (in my opinion of course), Steven Robertson's performance / interpretation hurts Dustin Hoffmann straight out of the water - and he deserves to be recognized as such !! All in all, this is one of the greatest representations of friendship / love / human relations of all time - and it was done in Britain / Ireland with local actors - stick it in your pipe and smoke it in Hollywood!
