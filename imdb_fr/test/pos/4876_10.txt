I also attended the International RI Horror Film Festival and can easily understand why this film won the Best Show Award. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST is a wild spectacle of horror, comedy and beautiful scenery. A story to go back in the past of strange events. An increasingly widespread disease with an extremely irritating side effect of the exploding head, brings an apprentice to a young teacher; Stefan, to investigate. During his travels, he decides to make a short detour and asks once again the hand of his long-time love in marriage, to be sent again to pack his bags by his extremely stubborn father ?? On the way out of the city, he meets a sick girl on the road and delivers it to Dr. Maitland (brilliantly interpreted by the imminent actor Vincent Price as the actor: Edward X Young.) Who explains to Stefan the foot pain. Only the doctor is insulted to have called the teacher and to have only received a boy in formation. Nevertheless, Stefan turns out to be much more than just a passerby. Horror icon; Tom Savini depicts the ultimate tormentor of religious torment; John Prester. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance like Anna. Many talented and talented support players have seamlessly fused history and contributed to its optimal advancement. <br /> <br /> Dark Religion and above, but fun and sometimes very original, bloody scenes play an important role in this film. Hammer tribute movie. This elegant film is the shuttle between flashbacks, surreal worlds, dreams and reality of the character. <br /> <br /> Horror and Gore apart; It's also a very funny movie! The humor of slapstick, tongue and cheek and black comedy looks up in the dark history. As others have said; it's really like three big movies in one. Very funny and original.
