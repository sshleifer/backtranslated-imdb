It's a cult classic for sure! <br /> <br /> It's hard to follow from time to time, but it's still a movie like Jacobs Ladder or even Fight Club. If you want a standard fare, then I think I'm going to rent the Care Bears movie or maybe an old Disney classic. But if you want to "see the world differently," I'd say you need to open up to Enigma and a movie that defies what we see and think. <br /> <br /> For me, the key is that the film was original and asked me questions all along. So, even though I've seen complaints, I would say that the film is what it is and I like it.
