I was fortunate to be invited to see this movie in New York. It's a fascinating story of how a group of extremely close friends managed the tragedy of 9/11. This film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit, through love and friendship, can endure and create wonderful things in one of today's darkest days. Filmmakers have truly captured the emotions of the individuals involved. It was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people. I left the theater that day with the desire to call all my friends to say hello. I would recommend everyone to see this documentary. I would qualify this movie with an A +++++++++++. See if you have a chance.
