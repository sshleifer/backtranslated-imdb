I did not know what to expect from this Swedish team of comedies and satires extremely popular (and hilarious) at the time of the release of their first feature film. A wider satire? Well, we have four exceptionally memorable contemporary accounts of family suffering, intergenerational gaps, and paternity in particular. But it is dramatic, fortunately, and what a drama! Epic in its scope, each episode comes from areas of Sweden carefully selected and geographically different. But each story could seriously wear an entire movie, if it were enlarged separately. <br /> <br /> It's dark, twisted, heartbreaking, yet extremely entertaining and breathtakingly executed. The scenario, the actors' game and the cinematography are absolute world class, three hours seeming to pass very quickly! It's four shades of mastery, and easily one of the best movies in the history of cinema of nations. This is Sweden's answer to "Shortcuts" or "Magnolia", if you prefer, and on par with them! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
