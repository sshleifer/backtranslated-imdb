Cool action - yes, the principle was done - but not that way - that's the thing. Hi people - SHOCK - it's an X file. <br /> <br /> For me, it's cool that Scully / Mulder has almost no scene together - they have to adapt, rely on the intrinsic meaning of what is really happening on - and the coping skills of each. They read each other's movements and do the work ... (in a way). <br /> <br /> Oh yes - really good acting - are these people paid to do that? Or a slow day when the convenience store does not call them to work. (hey - Duchovny - where are the donuts of a day? Malcolm - go to school ...)
