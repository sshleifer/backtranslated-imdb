In my research on Susan Harrison (The Ballerina) in reference to an episode of Bonanza, I remembered this gem. <br /> <br /> This episode is the inspiration of Dylan's "All Along the Watch Tower" (Hendrix's cover is probably well known and is one of his best) which is one of the best. <br /> <br /> This episode is therefore responsible for several "best" - not bad for about 22 minutes of television. <br /> <br /> But it's "The Twilight Zone". There is no need to comment further on the series. <br /> <br /> "5 characters" is typical of Serling. Intense, dramatic, it tends to an end as inevitable after the fact that it's surprising the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> This episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for anyone not seen. <br /> <br /> But you will feel ambushed. And you'll never listen to Hendrix again with the same ears.
