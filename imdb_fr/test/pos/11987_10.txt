I liked this film. <br /> <br /> No one I know likes him, but me too. <br /> <br /> I did not like it as much as the first, but it was still good. The plot and plot may not have changed at all, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not like Caddyshack 2 is .. . <br /> <br /> NO RODNEY DANGERFIELD! <br /> <br /> I think the film would be better if Rodney Dangerfield had Jackie Mason's share. Although I liked Jackie Mason in the movie, it would be far better to keep Rodney Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> Another flaw in the film, which I did not hate so much, was Dan Akroyd. The film was made 8 years after the first. Bill Murray, "Carl", could have left his job as a Green Guardian Assistant and joined the army, you know? If Warner Bros. had thought of that, the film could have been improved as well. <br /> <br /> That was my comment for Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> I gave him a rating of 8.2. 10 <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but still good. <br /> <br /> If you have seen Caddyshack 1 and are wondering whether or not to see Caddyshack 2, please give it a try.
