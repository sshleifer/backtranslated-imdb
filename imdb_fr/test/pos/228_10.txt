To say that it's a good show does not mean anything at all. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Avion and other hilarious and brilliant films. The writing is superb. Even if the show is built on a single line, they do not become invasive or boring. Leslie Nielsen flexes the muscle of the comedy as if she were saying: You have not seen anything yet. The format has been definitely refined to introduce Naked Gun. When watching these movies, note the number of schticks taken on the TV show. The bright part is that they should not be changed too much. The show was really a testing ground for bigger and better versions coming later.
