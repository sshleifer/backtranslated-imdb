The plot of "In the Mood for Love" is quite simple: a married man and a married woman (but not one to the other) slowly develop a romantic attachment to each other. The rhythm of the film is very slow and precious, there is not much going on between the two. Yet the backdrop of Hong Kong in the early 1960s and the keen sense of director Wong Kar-Wai to capture the beauty of the scenery and the main characters make this movie a pleasure to watch. Actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are both excellent and Wong Kar-Wai did an amazing job capturing the feeling and nostalgia of the past (something that so many films and filmmakers are trying to do but generally fail miserably). There are so many little details that add charm to the film (a brand of the director) and the colors and cinematography are what makes this story, otherwise simple, is considered a wonderful cinematographic achievement. 9/10.
