One Life Stand is an accomplished movie that has not received the credit it deserves. Her score of 1.7 from the BDIM does not do her justice and may be due to the few projections she had rather than the quality of the film itself. Shot in digital in black and white, the film is well made with production values ​​that contradict its limited budget. The performances are excellent, especially that of Gary Lewis, who improves with all the roles. My only criticisms are that it's a bit long and that we could have done more with a little humor to compensate for the darkest moments. But overall, it's a great job.
