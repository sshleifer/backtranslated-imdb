It is the story of three brothers who come together in the midst of hardships and losses and learn that the really important things in life are family, love, trust and forgiveness. The whole cast managed to get a powerful performance despite some meager linings. An excellent movie for fans of real problems of credible families. Fans of Dermot Mulroney or Sean Astin are also worth a visit. They both do amazing work and often make you cry. Believe me and praise it today!
