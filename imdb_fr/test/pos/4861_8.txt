They first came for the communists, and I did not say anything because I was not a communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not say anything because I was not Jewish. Then they came for the Catholics and I did not speak because I was a Protestant. Then they came to pick me up and at that moment there was no one left to speak for me. <br /> <br /> Attributed to Reverend Martin Niemoller, 1945 <br /> <br /> Faced with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - talk and you risk becoming an object of contempt. But when does it get too much? Global anti-Semitic sentiments allowed Hitler's genocidal policies to flourish, and equal doses of fear and ignorance allowed McCarthyism's anti-Communist purges to destroy thousands of lives. Inaction makes no less guilty. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman is a man's chameleon: calm and indefinable, he blends perfectly into his environment. Lawrence does not like being involved - when he attends an attack on a young woman, he does not tell anyone and go about his business. His world turns to chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and is confused with one of them. Lawrence's worldview and his vision of him are altered forever. <br /> <br /> The subject of this film is not new, but its presentation is quite unique. It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudices when placed in a certain context - Lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is Jewish than with the views of his attackers. He thinks that if he corrects this "forgetfulness", everything will go well, without realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. <br /> <br /> Whether playing an intruder (the only thing I liked in "Fargo") or a nice sheriff, the roles of William H. Macy are linked by a common thread : their characters share a subtle, deliberate physiognomy that gives them substance. Macy nails Lawrence down to the smallest detail and says more of a stealthy or quivering look in his voice than a page of dialogue. By showing, rather than saying, Lawrence is able to share his fear and dismay with the viewer. The support troop brings the story together. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern is convincing in the role of Gerty, Lawrence's wife-bomb with a past. Trailer park rough, but also mundane, she also felt the anger of prejudices as a result of a "mistake" and unintentionally exacerbates Lawrence's situation. Michael Lee Aday (aka "Meatloaf") is scary as Fred, the prototypical redneck next door, equals ignorance and venom, rallies neighbors to his virulent cause. Finklestein (David Paymer), the center of aggression and the voice of reason that raises important questions, is at the heart of chaos. Paymer's portrayal of himself prevents Finklestein from becoming a stereotype or a person whose sole purpose is to arouse sympathy, making it one of the film's strongest performances. <br /> <br /> Tight editing and close-up cinematography make it a sharp image with few distractions and blend an air of claustrophobia with the feeling of small towns in the United States - it is both comforting and disturbing. The deliberate use of two-tone hard lighting to accentuate the malicious aspects of the room and the carefully marked soundtrack are powerful without being overwhelming. Finally, sets and costumes recreate the atmosphere of the time, essential element of the message of the film. <br /> <br /> The unconventional "Focus" approach to dealing with prejudices is reason enough to recommend this film. Just think of the excellent story, the solid acting and the look of the film.
