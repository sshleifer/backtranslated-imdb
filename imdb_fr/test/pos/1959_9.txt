I remember a university professor who commented on how disturbing this film was and reflected teenagers' apathy (it was before the "X" generation). <br /> <br /> In a way, most of us are products of the same kind. culture of consumption; these high school students spend their time drinking, getting rough and wondering what to do with the body left on a bank. <br /> <br /> What would they do today? Would things be different? Some very important questions. There are excellent scenes with Keanu Reeves and the dysfunctional family he lives with; his 11-year-old brother coming out to get lost; the mother has no idea what to do - she spends her time drinking with her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This film was a little before its time in that it addresses the problems of American society of the lower classes; these children had no outlet; what is available to them in this saltwater city? . In total, some interesting social comments are presented and there are no solutions. 9/10.
