I am a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I do not count the bug budget or the Batman plot) <br /> <br /> Two of my favorites are The Phantom and a low budget movie called The Demolitionist. Black Scorpion can be added to this collection. <br /> <br /> If you saw the demolisher, get this movie. It's basically a copy of this heroine. <br /> <br /> If you have not already done so, let me explain ... the father of a policeman is murdered and she seeks revenge. She's wearing the black outfit (a sexy, sexy outfit that looks awesome for Joan Severance) and comes out to kick. <br /> <br /> It's a fun and action-packed movie, but you may not want the kids to see it ... without looking at it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene that Severance has in it. Which, in my opinion, was a bonus (okay, give him an extra star <smile>)
