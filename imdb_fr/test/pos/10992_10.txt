`Manna From Heaven 'is a deliciously captivating film. <br /> <br /> In the changing paradox of middle class Americans 40 years ago, the plot is changing the concerns and hopes of an interesting range. characters from "Damon Runyonesque". <br /> <br /> Their struggles against moral dilemmas, related to "what could have been", still hope to achieve youthful dreams, romantic aspirations and the most entertaining film. Rather than relying on sexual expression "in front of you," the emerging relationship between Inez and Mac / Bake is classic, but clear. His denouement of the knot of his lace at the Art Gallery and its warmth in their poker game are exceptional. <br /> <br /> The script's clean script is skillfully interpreted by a star and an exceptional cast. "Manna From Heaven", one of the few films I've ever seen twice in the first part, certainly deserves national distribution. <br /> <br /> Conrad F. Toepfer
