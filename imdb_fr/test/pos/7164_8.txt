Initially, I saw this movie as a rental VHS Blockbuster. It was some time ago, but I still remembered it. Blockbuster does not have it anymore. Netflix did not have it and there were not many copies on the Web - only a few expensive copies in VHS. Recently, we finally found it available as a DVD on eBay at a reasonable price (in PAL format, but our DVD player reads PAL discs on our NTSC TV). <br /> <br /> We enjoyed it, both. The style of the film is a little strong, and many if not most of the roles are quite strongly played as if amateurs realized (especially children), but it is not embarrassing. The contrasts of societies are accentuated in excessive gambling. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of political preaching that young people in Russia should not try to escape their not so great life, but should at least try to improve things first. But it's not dominant. It's pretty humorous most of the time. <br /> <br /> Some criticisms of the West commented by others are not at all those of the IMO, I consider this as a commentary on the expectations of Russian characters. At least when taken from my western point of view. It may be a minimization of the west from the Russian point of view (which is literally said by the characters who say it). <br /> <br /> I can not say how much the English subtitles are faithful to the film, but I can say that the subtitles were very well done, full of English idioms, as if they were made by an anglophone - with a "colorful" language.
