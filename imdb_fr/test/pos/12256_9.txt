... there was "Broadcast News" and what a good thing it was. He simply gets up and his barbaric yawp sound resonates twenty years later. <br /> <br /> There are times - especially with regard to the cutesy score - when this movie becomes a bit too 80's, or a bit too "Sleepless in Seattle." Fortunately, they are rare. <br /> <br /> A third of the social satire, a third of the romantic comedy, a third of the drama, with three imperfect but endearing people at the base, it's smart and moving and almost incredibly funny. Holly Hunter, in particular, may never have been so amusing to watch in a comic role. (And yes, I include "Raising Arizona", his other star turning away from this time, in this evaluation.) <br /> <br /> A legitimate classic.
