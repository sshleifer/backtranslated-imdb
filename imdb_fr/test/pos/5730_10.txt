Many of us who attended high school probably did well on a physics course - I know I did not do it. But after watching this show, I would surely want to have it. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a guide to the "Holy Grail of Physics" - the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into a "master equation". who escaped Einstein in the last years of his life. Brian Green, a professor at Columbia University, presents this breathtaking theory in a wonderfully simple way and gives us a greater appreciation of the universe in which we live. <br /> <br /> We start with the enticing possibility of a "master equation" that could unite and explain everything ... * everything! * in this universe, including the four fundamental forces we know that exist: electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force and gravity. Green shows us how our understanding of the universe appeared in the works of Newton, then Einstein, and later, the quantum-level physics revolution. <br /> <br /> It is at this stage that we encounter a problem that has been of concern to physicists for years and that no one has yet been able to solve. How can we unify all these forces that we know together? As Green constantly points out throughout the problem, we find that the answer to this puzzling problem might be string theory. However, if we describe the universe in terms of string theory, the price to be paid will be very high. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the insensitive mathematical equations of string theory a consequence, we find that we could live in a filled universe, not only of 3 dimensions that you and I see every day plus 1 ( for the time), but rather that we can actually live in a universe of * 11 * dimensions. But the calculation that follows from this theory does not stop there - it is possible that there are indeed parallel universes; some of them right next to you and me! Could we possibly take seriously such a theory that entails such consequences? As Green points out; We do not know it yet, but we know that the calculations from these equations already show us that the universe still has a lot to show us. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are concerned that you will not understand the concepts of this program - do not be afraid. Professor Green does an excellent job of eliminating the maths and harsher concepts of physics and focuses more on the * concept * - which, when you remove all the math, turns a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and, like Green constantly underlines it, the concept "elegant". Viewers of this program do not need prior scientific knowledge; the concepts are so simple that even a child can understand them. <br /> <br /> When you finish this program, you will come to understand what a wonderful and mysterious world we live in.
