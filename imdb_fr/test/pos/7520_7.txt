I had never paid much attention to this film before learning that Paddy Chayefsky - the author of the brilliant "Network" - was the scriptwriter. His work there had taught me his genius, so when "Hospital" appeared on TMC, I was eager to see him. I was not deceived. Looking at both this film and "Network", it seems that its main theme is the absurdity, the inanity and sheer brutality of the big human companies (hospitals, networks, for example) against the sacredness of the experience individual and human spirit. he delivered with a keen sense of humor totally black. "Hospital" is as black of a comedy as "Network", and the excellent cast, led by the incomparable Scott, makes his work fully justice. This is a guardian; certainly not to miss.
