Dekalog Five was an interesting viewing experience for me, because of the question that Kieslowski seems to be posing subtly to the audience. This chapter is devoted to three men and Kieslowski presents the two people involved in a murder with traits both good and bad (in one case, almost terribly bad). With such vile characters, I was almost happy to receive some sort of punishment. However, when the time comes for the murder (And that has consequences for the murderer), Kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my point of view: "Are not you as guilty that man? " This sort of indirect audience address makes Dekalog Five's final all the deeper as Kieslowski (as usual) does not stay within the literal limits of his theme. Just like the other parts of Dekalog do not take the theme of their command in the literal sense, Dekalog Five either. He asks us what is murder, who is the most guilty of murder and what should be the appropriate penalty, if any? It's a fantastic film and, typical of Kieslowski, absolutely beautiful.
