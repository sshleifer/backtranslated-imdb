"Ideas are dangerous." Comment of a person questioned. <br /> <br /> Evaluation of the DVD: B + / 4 out of 5/8 out of 10 / Worth the time. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story for adults or teenagers not for kids. None of these stupid violent crimes, so often confused by Hollywood today, is "quality work". And, it can be used as a coaching film on what to do to prepare for boating, or not, before "sailing the seven seas". The film begins a little slowly to develop the story as most documentaries do, but as it drives the viewer into the saga, emotions begin to seep into his head! Emotions include anger, sadness and disbelief. The time: the late 1960s. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising to sail solo around the world. What's amazing are all the twists and turns that viewers do not expect. This is not your average group of guys in a sailing race! Each boat was different as allowed by the race rules. Each solo sailor had different ability levels, as allowed by the race rules. There were among them known sailors and some less known. One of them was considered a mysterious, no one seeming to have any idea of ​​his abilities. Each boat was allowed to leave as long as everyone was en route on a given date. And it was, of course, before modern electronics that allowed boaters to communicate with the shore about violent storms, etc. <br /> <br /> Video and audio recordings are interspersed with interviews with family members and others involved. The atmosphere of the interviewees is always gloomy, despite the years gone by. <br /> <br /> The main character, Don, is at the center of all the attention and the way his journey relates to those he wanted not only to conquer, but also because of circumstances of his own creation , had to beat. He had to win. The story focused on the consequences of this situation for his life when he crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest over the years. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the section "Particularities" of the site. DVD once the movie is finished. The whole saga is not fully understood without viewing the "bonus" content. <br /> <br /> In the end, once you have watched everything on the DVD, you will probably have to shake your head and exclaim. 'sensational.' That's why history has stayed alive for the past 40 years. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: Be sure to watch the "Specials" section of the DVD once the movie is finished. A sailor who had returned to England after traveling around the world decided on the fly that no, he was trying another round and the film recorded the views of his wife on this decision. The opposite story unfolds as another runner wants the race to allow two to board so he can take his wife with him and their photos show a very warm union between them. The interview with a former paratrooper who had actually picked up a boat on the other side of the Atlantic with a friend before the solo sailing race was incredibly funny. 'Too many people think that sailing on the high seas can be a romantic adventure without incident. Do not be one!
