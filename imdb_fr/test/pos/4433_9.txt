After visiting the Kimbell Museum in Forth-Worth, Texas (USA), enjoyed art and architecture (also from the adjacent Museum of Modern Art), and had a lovely conversation with a knowledgeable lady bookstore , I bought this DVD about a rather high quality. expectations ?? and was not disappointed at all. <br /> <br /> The thematic approach, dramatic tension, revealing interviews, archival footage and breathtaking architecture also blend into a coherent whole to explore the life of the iconic Louis I. Khan. <br /> <br /> The documentary begins: contemplative classical music plays, the archives are digitized with a superimposed reflective shaded face, fuzzy letters symbolically referring to a train window traversing a landscape in the backdrop ?? a journey, concentration and blur, the search eventually leads to an article in a newspaper. Nathanial Khan reads on the front page of The New York Times where his father is simultaneously praised as the best living American architect and his announced death. <br /> <br /> "When I read this obituary for the first time, I must admit, I was looking for my own name, I was also his child, his only son, I did not know very well Well, my father never married my mother and he never lived with us (??) He died when I was eleven years old. "<br /> <br /> Thus, more years later, this illegitimate son is still haunted by unclear fragmented thoughts and feelings about his father who seems to be a great professional and public figure, but the secret life that is secret to him escapes him and affects him to the point where he wants to do something about it. <br /> <br /> "For years, I had a hard time satisfying myself, the small pieces of my father's life allowed me to see, but that was not enough, I had to know him, I had to know who he really was, so I went on a trip to see his buildings and find all that was left there, that would take me to the other side of the world in search of the man who was there. left so many questions. "<br /> <br /> The documentary is so two -fold, by a slow and systematic discovery of the world-famous architect, we get to know: 1) his ideas, his buildings and his architectural perspective and 2) his families, his colleagues, the lives of the people he has affected and his human perspective <br /> <br /> The DVD also provides additional lighting with a question-and-answer session with the screenwriter / director and additional footage including such brilliant quotes from Louis I. Khan : "All that everyone says is the truth. It's their truth. This might not be factual. "And" A good idea that does not happen is not an idea at all. "<br /> <br /> This film is a journey of discovery.The discovery of oneself and the discovery of a man, great man, yet human, imperfect as all of us, we know him through the eyes of a an admiring and slightly bitter son, but with the openness and objectivity necessary to really explore without drawing easy conclusions and without judging. <br /> <br /> Through key interviews with people who have exchanged with him various We gradually collect some pieces until the last interview with this man from Bangladesh who seems to really bring him home with visceral and sensible comments. <br /> <br /> Brilliant architect, brilliant documentary.
