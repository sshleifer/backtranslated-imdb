If I classify the movie a bit too high, you can blame it for the feeling. This is one of the first films that I remember seeing and totally loved. I saw him at the driveways here in California at the end of the 70s. I was already a big fan of "The Muppet Show" on TV, so I prepared for the movie, and the movie was was not disappointed. Basically, he takes all the absurd philosophy of the Muppet show and carries it vaudeville road movie. Kermit the frog is looking to become famous; not because he wants to take a bath of champagne and ride in a private jet, but because he wants to "make millions happy". Of course. <br /> <br /> On the way, he picks up all his beloved muppet friends, the most endearing Fonzie Bear he meets in a dingy bar standing up. They sing "Movin 'Right Along", a song that has always charmed me with its catchy melody and theme of friendship and shared discovery. He also meets enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy stars such as Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle and Mel Brooks. Brooks in particular looks rather boring, and you still have the feeling that Henson could have removed some of these cameos if he was not afraid of offending the stars. Anyway, as it should be for a travel movie like this, the first person he meets is Dom DeLuise. <br /> <br /> This end is one of the strangest examples of destruction of the fourth wall that you will find in "children's" film. The Hollywood dream seems to collapse around them when a true rainbow pierces the Hollywood scene with its authentic joy and mystery. I'm sure this was meant to relate to some of Jim Henson's personal or spiritual experiences. <br /> <br /> It's the best movie with Muppets by far. If you or anyone else were asking why the Muppets were so popular in the '70s, given the poor movies over the last few decades, I think this film has at least grown old enough to provide a clue.
