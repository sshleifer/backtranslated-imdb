Sally and St. Anne is a very funny movie. The first time my mother told me about it, I was 7 years old and Sainte-Anne had just been the saint I had for my saint of communion. My mother knew it, so she told me to watch that with her. I did it and have seen it many times since because it's really funny. Aunt Bea of ​​the show Andy Griffith was present and Sally's grandfather was the one playing Santa Claus in Miracle On 34th Street. So we saw a lot of actors on television. There is a villain who keeps trying to steal the house, and Sally continues to try things with Ste. Anne to help raise money so that they can keep the house. This includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian playing his older brother. It's a good fun movie that I still love.
