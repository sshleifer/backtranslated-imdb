John Schelesinger's career as a director has been extraordinary. We had watched this film on its first release, but we wanted to see it again when it was recently on cable. The film has a faded appearance, as it looks today, but it is still interesting because of the intense performance of the two main. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, please do not read further. <br /> <br /> Chris and Daulton were two childhood friends from the upper middle class. Chris went to a seminary to become a priest, but he gave up. Daulton has become a small consumer of drugs and traffickers. The two lives seem to be parallel while both men are involved in an illegal activity that will prove myopia. In fact, it shows that the two young men make miscalculations in their attempt to fool the CIA and the Soviet Union. In a way, these two were so naive to think that they could pull something that bigger and better equipped people could not even imagine doing. <br /> <br /> Chris's motivation is legitimate because he feels scandalized. discovering the devious role of the agency for which he works in relations with other nations, in this case Australia, which he discovered by coincidence. When it involves Daulton, we know that all of this is doomed to failure, because no one, as it is, will ever be used to anything. In fact, Chris and Daulton had no idea of ​​the scope of what they were trying to do or its consequences. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton was, at this time of his career, a moving actor. He had proved that he had talent with his work in other films. So it was a natural choice for Mr. Schlesinger to choose, a choice that pays off. Sean Penn, was also a young actor who showed an unprecedented intensity. In fact, Mr. Penn has sometimes reminded us of young Robert Mitchum in the making. The contribution of both actors to the film is incredible. We can not think who could have played this duo if not them. <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and the Snowman", though not up to John Schlesinger's other films, is an interesting look for our past too far away.
