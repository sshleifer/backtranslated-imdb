This film is pretty good as is, but the unprecedented Producer's Cut is my favorite movie in the series after the original. Jamie's story is handled differently, death scenes are ten times more effective, there are more sequences of ritual-like stuff giving more story about Micheal, Jamie and her baby. There is also an alternative ending that is also better. Why they did not publish this version instead, I have no clue. If you can find this version, see it.
