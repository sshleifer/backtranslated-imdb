A touching love story that recalls "In the Mood for Love". Based largely on Chinese poetry and how the people of the East use it to communicate their feelings, the story focuses on a teacher who so desires to be a model teacher, as well as a good father and a good father. A senior student is very attracted to him. As the story unfolds, we see the emotions beneath the surface during his 20 years of marriage and the way he struggles with the moral dilemmas facing him. A beautiful and moving story.
