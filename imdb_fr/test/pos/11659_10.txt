I really enjoyed this movie. It challenged my emotions and beliefs, making a true work of art in my book. The acting game was unmatched. I would never watch this movie with anyone without crying, I do not think I'm crying harder than any movie, maybe because it makes me look at myself, I do not know. It is to see absolutely.
