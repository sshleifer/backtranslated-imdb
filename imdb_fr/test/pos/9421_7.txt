Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, respectively, the second in the Universal series, where he is again established by means of a prologue writes that the famous detective is legendary and extends over time . This helps put things in place here in the "present" era of the early 1940s. <br /> <br /> In this offering, Holmes goes under different disguises (with the very salient features of Rathbone, is it- he probably would not really recognize his true identity?) since he protects a physicist from the hands of the Nazis as well as Holmes' greatest professor, Moriarty (currently played by Lionel Atwill). The scientist developed a bombshield that will greatly facilitate aerial bombardment and he promised his plans to the British. But Moriarty wants to buy it so he can sell it to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> A good entry reinforced somewhat by the participation of the villain Atwill, who now plays the role of Moriarty (although George Zucco is not left behind) himself in THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES). It is always intriguing to see Holmes and his greatest enemy launching into witty jokes together ("the last needle, huh, Holmes?").
