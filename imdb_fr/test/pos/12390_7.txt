Of course, how could he. He obviously co-opted several aspects of this excellent film, which is also based on the sensational French case of the so-called "doctor of the World Health Organization" who murdered his family and himself after being unmasked as a fraud. Emilio calls his son a "monster", sings on the radio in his car, hangs out on park benches and specializes in investment schemes to defraud his family and friends - all this and more directly from "Time Out", which came out the previous year "The life of nobody". It's a shame because this film is pretty good in itself, with good actors and good writing. While Vincent of "Time Out" is a much more subtle character that seems to have a sense of ethics even though it is sometimes twisted into knots, the protagonist seems devoid of any character apart from his appearance and charm. Seriously, the part where he used x-rays showing his mother-in-law's cancer to earn more money from his father, then uses a subtle trick on the same scam to avoid expelling his fancy house for n have not paid the lease time - it's almost too much. The guy has no shame, in fact, he looks more like his role in "Stepfather" than a poor fool who gets fired and is so humiliated that he can not face the disappointment of his family and his friends and feels compelled to invent a brilliant new life for himself, as did Vincent in "Time Out". Thus, one could feel the tension rising in "The life of person" and the violent conclusion to come. One of the things that was definitely missing at "Time Out" in "The Life of Person" was a lover's interest outside of the protagonist's confident wife. It's not difficult to understand how the sexy babysitter was able to fascinate and trap Emile to the point where he ignored the danger of his natural curiosity and allowed him to expose his evil spirits. built. Given the mentioned reservations, this is a very good movie that we found entertaining. If you aspire to something that touches on similar elements, that can go further and that is more satisfying intellectually and spiritually, I strongly suggest "Time Out".
