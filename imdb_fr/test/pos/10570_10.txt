This television adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel has been done with such care that I can hardly find the words to appreciate it. I've never seen such a performance from the lead actresses, this time from Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy, since "Tipping the Velvet" (also highly recommended). They acted with their souls, and that's what passes to the public! Supporting actors were also well chosen, they formed a superb ensemble. <br /> <br /> For those who think that history is a lesbian relationship story - no, it's only a part. The other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. And the plot still has some surprising twists. The film should be interesting for both straight guys and guys like me.
