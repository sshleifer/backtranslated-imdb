I rented this movie without hearing anything (or read) about it. Too bad! This film is intelligent, witty, hilarious, fast and ridiculous. The characters manage to develop without relying too much on stereotypes clich√©s and tired. It was refreshing to watch. I could not help thinking that marketing would have brought this not-so-mainstream film into the mainstream hungry for smart comedies. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors perform a huge range of inconvenience, sorrow and comedy are so rare nowadays - I thought the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something so rich . How is it that National Treasure has been number one at the box office for three weeks in a row - it is so weak to talk about too much. I guess I'm just happy that movies like "Seeing ..." are still produced somewhere.
