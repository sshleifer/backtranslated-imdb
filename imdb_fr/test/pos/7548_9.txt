So Udo Kier won like nine dollars and free food for that, so it's a victory in itself. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, this film tells a very interesting story about a group of rescuers meeting Demeter down. I should warn you, I am gunna bouncing through this review very quickly so fasten your belt. The first thing is the first. Coolio plays a guy named 187. 187 likes drugs. There's a lot of coffins on board and ... now, I do not know anything about the future, but maybe they're smuggling drugs into coffins. Gunna does not say it was the craziest thing in this movie. Later, the vampire comes out of his coffin filled with mist and the real hilarity begins. First, although the word "Dracula" appears in this film, it does not appear in this film. I have a theory though. Unexpectedly, you see the relief team's ship leaving without them. My theory is that Dracula was on board with his late brother, Orlock. Dracula told Orlock he would come back right away. Dracula had the hell of that movie before he could be seen leaving Orlock to play the vampire for about six minutes that he is in the movie. The best part of this film, and for those of you who have seen it, you know what I'm gunna, it's after 187, that we adopt something. He has this huge monologue about ejaculation from different parts of Erica Elaniak's body and ... other cool stuff. Coolio, seriously, you're the best thing. <br /> <br /> Other things also happen in this movie. As Casper Van Dean works. Orlock screams a lot and loses his arm, then we lose a bit of his track for the rest of the movie. And thank you my god really. We discover that Erika's character is a police bot. At the end of the film, we discover that the ship is about to project into the sun. The police bot and another surviving character are sentenced. Rather than avoid certain death, the police bot Erika reveals that she is also a fucking bot and they decide to fuck and die. Before dying in the sun, they die for no reason, yes, their ship explodes for no real reason. <br /> <br /> This movie got the incredible rating for a reason, Coolio. God, if they gave academic rewards to black rappers, he would be the first to get one. The only reason it did not get a perfect ten was because there was not a drop of nudity. Now, I know what you think, how can you judge a movie if the ladies show their goods or not. Very easy. A film like this requires it pretty much. It's part of the process. Gore, gore, monsters, nudity, gore, end of the final shock of the movie at the end. This is the formula. It was a little gore, the monster was great because he sucked so much that he did us the favor of staying away from the camera. It was considerate of him and I respect that. Nudity, not a drop, even though there has been a long talk about ... well, see the statement above and regarding the shock / twist ... I certainly have not seen the end come. It counts. <br /> <br /> I hope Hollywood does not think that Coolio has given it all and has nothing left. He deserves more work. Well, until Dracula 4000, I went out.
