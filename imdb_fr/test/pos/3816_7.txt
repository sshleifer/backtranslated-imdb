This film has attracted enough attention to be able to watch it several times. The plot has holes, but the main artists make it work. <br /> <br /> Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge) is doing a great job as a 37 year old woman who sacrificed everything to become a doctor. She worked for years to earn the money needed to go to medical school. She does her homework brilliantly and is about to take the jury exam and realize her dream. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are murdered and, as a close relative alive, she is forced to take her niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) to avoid to become a ward of the state. Amanda is about 7 years old. Amanda is so traumatized by the murder of her parents that she has become dumb. Needless to say, Julia's 16 hours of work take longer for Amanda. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor in his building who mixes with Julia and Amanda's life. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda cope with her distress. Amanda really starts to warm up to Kevin as the movie moves on, maybe more than her aunt. Julia starts counting on Kevin to take care of Amanda as she tries to take care of her workload and prepare for her exam. Kevin is always there every time a crisis breaks out for Julia. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You keep watching to see them meet before the end of the movie. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was also good. Arlen managed to convey a lot without the benefit of words. Julia and Amanda gradually warmed up. You can watch them build a relationship as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> We discover that Julia's sister and brother-in-law (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable chip prototype from their employer. Three of their associates intended to share the proceeds of the robbery. Julia discovers that the Meyers planned to pass the country under supposed identities. The plot does not know if the Meyers intended to double or double their staff. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Meyers are murdered at home by two of their former associates. The killers do not attempt to extract the location of the Meyers microchip before killing them. The killers search the house and do not find their price. They leave a living witness of their crime, Amanda. The killers then spend the rest of the movie in clumsy attempts to extract the chip from Julia and Amanda, who do not know where the prize is at all. Finally, the killers kidnap Amanda in the hope that she knows something about the location of the chip. <br /> <br /> Finally, Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip. After a few difficult moments in the relationship, they manage to save Amanda and send the bad guys. The predictable end makes the three form a family and happily move towards a common future. <br /> <br /> What struck me in the plot are major holes. Kevin moved into the same building as Julia and Amanda the day after the Meyers were murdered. How does he know that the chip is not yet in the hands of the killers? The killers happily leave their fingerprints on the scene of the murder, without bothering to hide their identity. The murderer who claims to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remains of red paint from the scene of the murder on his shoe soles. He was not shown in the scene of the murder at the beginning of the film. There are other weaknesses in this sense, too numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> The film could have been better if the script had been refined further before the shoot. Filling the holes with the plot would have resulted in little expense and greatly improved effort.
