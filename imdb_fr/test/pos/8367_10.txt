I could never imagine that I would start to like movies like this one. After seeing Yimou Zhang's "hero", I decided to watch his other films, perhaps looking for something similar. The second film of Yimou Zhang that I watched was No One Less, after which I realized the type of cinema in which I am now. No wonder I immediately become "Keep Cool". It is a simple, touching and brilliant piece of cinema, I pay my respects to the director. <br /> <br /> This film shows that it is not the amount of money that is good for the film. It all depends on what the director wants to show and the success with which he succeeds. The story is very simple, a typical excerpt from a typical everyday life. In addition, the movements of the camera enhance the impression and feel of the film. I give the best score to this film and I look forward to seeing the other films of Yimou Zhang.
