Finally, I discovered what I thought I would have at age four. After seeing the 1960 color version on VHS, I kept telling myself that I remembered seeing her in black and white twice before. Now, the IMDb has helped me to know the truth, namely that it has been broadcast twice (2 productions) in black and white in 2 successful years, 1955 and 56. These are the ones that I remember best at four years old. I did not realize that the broadcast was not the same as the 55. In 1960, I was 9 years old and the color production just did not make it. The black and white version was wonderful and had an impact as impressive as today's high-tech movies, even without computer effects. You had to be there! Please comment if you had a reaction similar to the black and white version.
