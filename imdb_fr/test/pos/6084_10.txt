I will not go to a generalization, and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. That's good, people feel this movie very deeply, either you like it, I think ... or you just hate it. I do not want to say the best of everything, because it's simply too "big" for me to make such a statement. However, I am very passionate about The English Patient, as well as millions of others. <br /> <br /> Rewards say everything. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the critics, but in many ways, those who chose this one, I totally agree. <br /> <br /> 9-Oscars. <br /> <br /> 41 wins. <br /> <br /> 37 nominations, makes this love story at the top of the list. <br /> <br /> According to director Anthony Minghella, the story on the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from TVs Seinfeld) said: "Elaine, I just can not leave the eyes!" In this case, I do not agree with Elaine's answer. But the story is built and takes the time, it is necessary for the case to be beautiful. Cinematography (John Seale) has also won numerous awards, as it should be. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche, so far. Well, it's not quite true that I liked her performance in "Sabrina". Beautiful story of a relationship a bit complicated, next to Harrison Ford. But it was simply an incredibly different character for her, and as deeply talented as she was, she was just shining in a subtle and graceful way, she was exactly what this movie was looking for, I'm really glad it was her performance. and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes was also spectacular in describing Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! What can you say, other than see this picture again. (*****)
