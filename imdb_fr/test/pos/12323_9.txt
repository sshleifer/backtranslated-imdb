So many literary adaptations are disappointments. There are many reasons for this, but it usually involves reducing a complex novel to the size of a scenario. The Dead is unusual - it had to be "padded", because the news is in itself a relatively short gem. In fact, this is perhaps the best English-language news. In nicely spared language, he tells Gabriel Conroy's realization that his life and that of so many others around him are controlled by the memories of the dead. Even his own wife for many years loved a man now more dead than him. <br /> <br /> It was always difficult to bring such a short story to the movies. John Huston did a wonderful job. He never gave in to the temptation to play or use a sophisticated technique to develop the story. It's simple and true, with an exceptional acting game. The only slight omission is the use of music to accompany the devastating final monologue. <br /> <br /> It is rare that a film version of a literary masterpiece is itself a masterpiece, but I think its use is right. this term for this film. This is not a brave achievement of cinema, but it is simple and pure. I always think of Ozu's films when I think of The Dead, it's at this level of purity, simplicity and deep wisdom.
