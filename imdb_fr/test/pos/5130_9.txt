Hoot is a nice simple movie with a simple message. It seemed like this movie was for young kids, but I know adults will love this movie. The scenario is quite simple. A kid who moved to Florida has to help a soccer jock and a pariah save burrowing owls from building a pancake house. The message contained in this film is particularly interesting for activists and animal lovers. The message is about everything you can to save endangered animals. The game in this movie is decent. All three children seemed to have good chemistry. The music is not too shabby. I liked the songs of Jimmy Buffet in this movie. Overall, it's a good family film. I note this film a 9/10.
