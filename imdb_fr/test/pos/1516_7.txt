I do not know exactly what it is, but the movie is happily sitting on my shelf, without any thought of leaving me ... Fulci has directed one of the most ridiculous, weird, infested and unique movies. that I know. I never saw. I do not know what else to say about it, but I LOVE THIS FILM !!! The Tartar steak scene is absolutely scary, and the Nazi tortures orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious ... I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but did anyone hear that, according to this film, Fulci accused Wes Craven of having torn him with "Scream"? "Cat in the Brain" is a must for bad moviegoers from all over the world ... Yes, I will certainly say that it's not a "good" movie, but I guarantee you that certain scenes will remain forever etched in your mind ! It's an exercise in madness, people ... I guess if I were a "serious" critic, I'd give it a 3, but for the biggest pleasure (again, I can not really explain my affection), I would do it. 7 .... Really smothered movie ...
