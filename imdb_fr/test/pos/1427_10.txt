Clifton Webb as "Mr. Scoutmaster" is one of the greatest comedians and remembers an innocence, now reduced in the world. I do not understand why channels such as American Movie Classics, etc., do not show this movie, even though I have asked it many times. <br /> <br /> This film should now be shown to children for its image of loyalty, respect, dedication and determination to achieve the best possible on an individual basis. There is so much talk of low self-esteem in today's daily life, but this film, among many others, would be a great learning tool for today's young generation, allowing them to see what the common sense and decency can accomplish. pride in yourself and your accomplishments to improve yourself. Sad that this type of film does not please the modern public. This certainly attracted our generation of baby boomers yesterday. The old lessons are universal and timeless.
