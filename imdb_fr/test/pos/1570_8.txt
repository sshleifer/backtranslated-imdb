It's sad in Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking the roads you see in the room since the first day. I literally did not know how this movie was going to end, because it was going to the left when I was expecting it to go well, zigging when I was expecting a zag, and so on. It could easily have turned into a generic thriller thriller or a sad and depressing drama, but it remained its course until the end. It's a sad story, though. Not because of what happens to Alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her in this way. <br /> <br /> The plot has a quiet dignity, a form usually reserved for the theater. use a little tightening. Anyway, it's a very good film and, for some reason, I suspect the tangy grapes of those who got the lowest score.
