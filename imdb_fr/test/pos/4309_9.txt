If you have not seen this movie, do it. It's a great mix because I've never seen another one. Very surrealistic scenes, hilarious funny things, a film noir, musical numbers with swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best orgasm played on Film, beaten only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles merged to make a work of art. As a work of art, it must not be logical in the end, at least not logical for everyone ;-). I had a television copy on VHS, but I lent it to an ex-girlfriend and now I can not get it back. But the film should be released on DVD in Austria on 10.06.03 and make sure that I will buy it.
