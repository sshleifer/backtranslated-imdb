It is an exceptional photo with a lot to recommend. The acting and writing are fantastic and there are a lot of twists in the plot. As a French "Noir" film, his language is certainly much more earthly than his American counterparts, but for me it only served to reinforce realism. Plus, I appreciated the fact that everyone was not glamorous - especially the husband and the lieutenant. The only negative, and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10, is because there was a black hole. Like another famous French movie, Funny Drama, the confusion between the cops and the accused could have been solved at first, but the characters made rather stupid decisions. For that, all you need to do is suspend disbelief and keep looking - the payoff is worth it. <br /> <br /> It's simply one of the best French movies I've seen. Period.
