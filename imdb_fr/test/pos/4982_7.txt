Violent Men is a very good western that certainly benefits from its excellent distribution. <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson is the big breeder trying to get the youngest of the breeders, including Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to appease his fiance (May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother (Brian Keith) kills one of Ford's hands. Then you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck will play Robinson's accomplice in the kind of role she specializes in. Dianne Foster plays their daughter who comes to admire Ford. <br /> <br /> The Violent Men is nothing more than a "B" plot with an "A" movie cast but it's done very well.
