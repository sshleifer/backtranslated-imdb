This movie is an amazing comedy ... the screenplay is too funny ... if you watch it more than once, you'll enjoy it more. Although the comedy is sometimes stupid, it makes you really laugh !! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have done justice to their roles. After 1994, I did not encounter a Hindi movie as funny as this one.
