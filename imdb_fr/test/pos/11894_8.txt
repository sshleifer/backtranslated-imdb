I saw the film and I'm very happy to see a film so different from the character and story of the stupid big American productions. It is a film with an interesting background for young people as well as for all age groups. Contrary to some critics, the public seems to divide my evaluation because the film meets a great success wherever it is still exploited. For example, in the Netherlands, it was ranked number 3. Negative statements must be respected, but it is to be expected that they are based on facts. If you have the chance to see the movie and enjoy it.
