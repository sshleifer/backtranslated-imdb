The film Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 smart humor movies ever made in Bollywood, maybe even in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out, I was 8 years old and I heard it was a flop, but I never understood why it was a flop. .. but let me tell you one thing ... this movie would have more money selling cassettes and DVDs at home and spreading it on movie channels on TV than any hit movie in the movie theater. This film has been broadcast countless times in movie chains and I think even now, the love of the public and the TV producers continue to rehearse the film again and again. I have personally watched the film in its entirety over 80 to 100 times and I still love it so much. <br /> <br /> The performance of Aamir Khan, Amar and Salman Khan, Prem is breathtaking, but most of all, he loved the performance of Aamir Khan as a clever street guy ... his dialogues in the film are hilarious. .. the story is simple and here is how it goes ..... <br /> <br /> Amar and Prem are poor, lazy guys and come from a poor family of tailors and the father of Amars is a hairdresser. Then they both learn that a millionaire girl from London is coming to India to look for a suitable partner ... Amar and Prem think this is a great opportunity to become a wealthy rich man. go to court with Raveena Tandon .. (the girl of the millionaires) ...... in their trip, they hate each other and everyone tries to deceive the other in order to marry Raveena ..... the comedy scenes between the two are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in the stomach laughing ....... and then there is Raveenas uncle (the millionaire's brother) Teja who wants to take revenge on Raveenas's father ..... since he is broke and Raveenas's father is a millionaire ...... his projects include the kidnapping of Raveena to blackmail Raveenas's father for whom he hires 2 butlers ..... <br /> <br /> but later, we learn that there is a twist in the film (watch the movie to know) ....... so there to Shakti Kapoor as crime master Gogo who is also incredibly ...... <br /> <br /> What struck me most was the film's dialogue that became a legend. Aamir Khan uses his "aaila" brilliantly and Salman. goes like "OOima" ........ and for Gogo there is "Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega" ...... every scene is so Funny ...... <br /> <br /> I especially liked the one in which Aamir khan and Salman got Raveena de Teja and both go to a Luna with money "chillar" in a bag .... This scene is so much fun .. <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ...... it's a movie I would recommend to have a DVD and you will never regret it. ......
