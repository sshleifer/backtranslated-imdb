I bluffed like an idiot for the last ten minutes of this outstanding TV show. I must say that the idea of ​​sitting down to watch 90 minutes of what was to be a pretty depressing topic on Sunday was not welcome. Thinking of another, more deserving opportunity to win BAFTA did not make me excited ...... However, the final result hit me at 6. That's one of the best TV channels I've seen in a long time. For years, I had the impression that all the originality had left the theater department of the BBC. Our friends from the North was the last production that really blew me away, it was 10 years ago. However, faith is restored and the honor is satisfied. David Tenant was amazing! So many actors I can think of would have been in town, but I've never seen Mr. Holder as an actor or as a doctor. All I saw was Alan Hamilton. I have not had a broken heart so much since the performance of Daniel Craigs in the role of Geordie Peacock years ago. Sarah Parish was also amazing and I really hope this role will bring her better roles in the future. All the actors were great but a special mention must be given to the director who really placed us in the mind of Alans. The toaster scene, in particular, made me feel uncomfortable.
