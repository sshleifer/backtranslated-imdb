Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye is an excellent family film. Salman Khan is beautiful and beautiful than ever! There is even a scene where he takes off his shirt! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is great too. Pooja Batra had very little to say, but I'm glad she was recognized for her role because she really has potential. <br /> <br /> This is Prem (Salman Khan) and he is a wedding singer. He is about to marry Nisha (Raveena Tandon) but gets up. Prem goes to Nisha's house and asks him why he was abandoned. This is because her brother is ill and she has to marry an NRI, Rahul (Inder Kumar), to get the money needed for her treatment. Prem moves and arrives Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Priya's first love falls <br /> <br />, but it's a pity she marries an NRI! Who could be this NRI ?! Priya falls in love with Prem also while Rahul is with her. Prem makes an insulting comment to Priya one day and goes to Agra for the wedding with Rahul. Will Prem stop it? Watch KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The movie was very funny! The songs were great, especially the song "O Priya O Priya" It's a pity that the film has collapsed in India and I do not know why ?! Every movie in India is falling apart nowadays !! This film deserved to be a success. The only problem I found with the movie is that they had an obsession with NRI! They think all NRIs are rich! The film deserves a 9/10!
