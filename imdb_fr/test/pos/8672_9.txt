One of the best films I have seen for a long time, precise in his vision, beautiful and very imaginative in his realization. I can not say more without revealing it, and I do not recommend reading a lot about this movie before watching it - watch it. <br /> <br /> But ah, you have to propose ten lines of text to have a revision listed on IMDb. Enigma. What can I do? Do you talk about the movie? Nope. I can not do it. I think I enjoyed this film precisely because I saw it without preconceived ideas. Please do the same. <br /> <br /> I suppose we can say that: the acting is excellent and unobtrusive, and what I liked about foreign films is that the films are reality of MOVIES, not stars.
