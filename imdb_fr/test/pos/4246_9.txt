The film begins with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope sits on the board only for the fact that he is black and that the agency needs a "symbolic sign". Swope ignores the meeting, reads Jet magazine at the big table and everyone ignores Swope ... Suddenly, the CEO croaked on the spot. No time wasted. A concierge is called to remove the corpse and the board immediately and unceremoniously attacks the election of the new CEO. And as the votes are counted one by one, the tension grew and finally ceded to the vote with a hilarious ironic climax that gives the viewer a delicious dish of logical implications to savor for the rest of the film. If you've already responded to a stupid TV ad, you'll love seeing this movie. Too bad, there does not seem to be real Putney Swopes in the world.
