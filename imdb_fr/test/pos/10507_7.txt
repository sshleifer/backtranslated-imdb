In the DVD, I was expecting a perversion from the creators of Society and Re-Animator, and I was quite surprised to participate in a truly suspenseful tale. The acting was first rate (nice to see Vosloo in a protagonist role after a long string of bad guys), the story told and the few surprising twists. I imagined that I would do a lot of my work to advance to the rapture scenes, but instead I looked through, I was dropped at the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too indulgent, but I said before, I did not expect much more than foreign sex. Of course, if you're looking for hot alien sex, you'll be disappointed. It was essentially a quick nonsense at the exam table, with a quick glimpse of an interesting 'impregnating' extraterrestrial.
