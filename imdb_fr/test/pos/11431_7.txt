Based on the bestselling "The Dismissal", The Missing Star, the latest film by acclaimed Italian director Gianni Amelio, tells the story of the growing friendship between an old Italian maintenance man and a young Shanghai-based performer. guide through China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is responsible for the maintenance of a closed steel mill in Italy and a blast furnace sold to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that a control unit in the oven is defective and potentially dangerous, he goes to China in search of the steel mill where the piece was sold in the hope of avoiding a fatal accident . <br /> <br /> The film, of course, deals with the journey and not the destination by using a familiar clich√© and, during this trip, we have the right to look closely at China with all its beauty and complexity, via the remarkable cinematography of Luca Bigazzi. The film takes us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongquing, Baotou and a trip along the Yangtze River showing us the coastal areas that should be flooded when the Three Gorges Dam is fully operational, a Chinese mega-project that caused the displacement of 1 , 2 million people. The trip puts travelers in the face of poverty, overcrowded housing and children on their own. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and the translator Liu Hua (Tai Ling) who met for the first time in Italy where his impatience with his translations during a dinner makes you lose your job. When he finds her in Shanghai, she works in a library and resists Vincenzo's approach. Considering her offer to help her travel to China as a well-paid job, she reluctantly agrees to accompany her. Their relationship, however, grows as they move from city to city, his interpretive skills being at the service of Vincenzo's misunderstanding who does not own a cell phone. <br /> <br /> By slowly opening up to each other, they expose each other's vulnerability and the film explores their past and present lives and how they arrived at their current situation. We meet Liu's son (Lin Wang) at his grandmother's house. In a child's politics of China, he is one of the unwanted children who have been "hidden" since the boy's father abandoned the family. Although the encounter between Vincenzo and the boy is relaxed, their relationship plays a central role in storytelling. <br /> <br /> Castellitto is an excellent actor (although we hope that a younger Enrico Lo Verso plays this role). However, he is emotionally distant throughout the film, his expression rarely changing from a distant drag dog expression. Although Tai Ling brings a lot of presence to the role, his relationship with Vincenzo, much older, never seemed to me real and the end seemed to exist only in a reality known as film. Even if Amelio is one of my favorite directors, closely followed by the brilliant Keys of the House, Missing Star is a disappointment.
