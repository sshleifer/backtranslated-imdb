'This Is Not a Movie' works because that's what we're trying to say. If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus on the message, you will see a bit of yourself in the main character, Michael. Whether we are a man or a woman, we have all come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and re-examine a situation or relationship. Did it really happen as we remembered? What did not go well? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. More than anything, he wants to feel better about the situation. But even then, he's a nice character because everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships. We would not be in them otherwise. At the end of the film, I do not know if Michael has learned anything new about himself or not. Our best indicator of the relationship is through her friend, Nadia. She is the soul of the film and reminds us that there are always two sides to each story. I found Michael pompous, arrogant and totally helpless. That's why I liked him. He's a real character. If you've always wanted to go back and analyze an earlier relationship, this movie is for you. In closing, it's a movie for everyone.
