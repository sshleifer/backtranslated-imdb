This film is all about reality, WW2 underwater warfare was not a precise science. There was no computer giving the exact details of the enemy, there was no precise instrumentation to control the submarine 100%. Not all team members went to fight with a song in their heart and a smile on their dial. <br /> <br /> People who expect to see a "nice war" in this film will be disappointed, ... ........... GOOD, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to be confronted with reality. <br /> <br /> The war is not clean, nor accurate, delivered by people about to break in the song. He is endured by frightened people, cold / burned, hungry and desperate, ready to do anything to survive. <br /> <br /> "We dive at dawn" is a fine example of the desperate situation requiring desperate actions.
