In the movie "The Falcon and the Snowman", as they showed the complex to Christopher Boyce, the satellite in the background was the Ryholite satellite currently in space. TRW cleared the shots inside. TRW has also licensed indoor and outdoor shots of one of Star Trek's original television series. (The episode is when Spock goes blind when a chain of satellite lights is activated to kill aliens). Christopher escaped from prison (Lompock) and was featured on the show Most Wanted in America. He was drinking in a bar when the show aired. He said, "Hey, it's me." Needless to say, he was captured and transferred to a maximum security prison.
