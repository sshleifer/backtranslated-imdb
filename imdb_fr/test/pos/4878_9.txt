I was on vacation when my host suggested I attend this B-Movie festival in Breda. I was resistant, because I had not made the trip to go to the cinema, but I must admit that I do not regret a second of it (especially with the contribution of Stephen Malkmus). It probably helped me not to know what to expect. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST begins as a typical drama. We have a young medical student who will help a doctor whose city is being destroyed by a mad plague (which involves somehow the explosion of heads). Along the way, he stops to visit his fianc√©e and gets fired from the property by his father. Traveling, he finds a girl lying on the road, another victim of the plague, and takes him to the doctor. Yawn, I thought. Everything seemed pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> And then everything went crazy and the film became quite different. Tom Savini comes in the guise of Dracula, the characters begin to travel from "the other side" of reality and the dialogue becomes more and more humorous. <br /> <br /> And just when I thought it had settled in a groove, the image changes again, becoming really dark and weird. I will not spoil it for the first time, but there is an amazing sequence of people on the loose, a lot of talk about religious abuse on the part of society, and some perverse effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This is not a perfect movie (in case you have not understood it since its appearance at the B-Movie festival), but it's really worth the time for adventurous viewers. Superb graphics, a great soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. The acting is sometimes a bit crazy, but I think that's what counts. <br /> <br /> It's funny that I had to go to Breda to find an American image that looked like a British horror movie. You understood that ...
