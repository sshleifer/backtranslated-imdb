The Thing must be one of the best movies of all time. Of course, it was revolutionary special effects at the time of its release that had impressed me so much. In 1982, it had dazzled me, I had never seen anything like it! However, although the effects themselves have made the film more horrible, it is the story, the score, the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic, as well as the interactions and tensions between members of the research station condemned who make it a classic. <br /> <br /> The movies are not better than that! In the opening scene with the helicopter pursuing this husky, you assume that they were scientists bored of a certain post who were venting. Yet when you see them pursuing their pursuit at the American base, you think that Norwegians suffer from some form of advanced or extreme cabin fever. Yet this is counterbalanced by the threatening opening score that sets the tempo! You just know that something is wrong! At this point, it's a mystery until "the thing" is revealed. <br /> <br /> However, the mystery comes back because it becomes a kind of sci-fi style Agatha Christie "it's the movie" (ie ten Indian films) because the members do not know which of their an alien. The suspicions continue to go back and forth between them, one by one, they end up being overthrown or revealed as extraterrestrials. Mistrust between the crew of the station is absorbed as the film advances to the final showdown. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of progress in computer graphics and filmmaking, the special effects of "The Thing" do not carry the same weight as in 1982, but apart from that, it holds very good with good performance of the cast.
