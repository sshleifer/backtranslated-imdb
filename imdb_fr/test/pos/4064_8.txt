I will not go into details, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There were no funny slap-to-knee scenes (that I can remember), but there were times. The casting is good enough, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy performs a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was very good in the film, no complaints there. I liked two characters in the story that they did not explain much. The first was Trey Sellars' buddy (Eddie Murphy) at the gym played by Ken Campbell. I guess he was just a friend of Trey, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character I liked was Mitch Preston's friend / partner (Robert De Niro) played by Nestor Serrano. I guess he was just another policeman working with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or not. I think I think maybe I think too much in a movie, I mean after all, it's a comedy ... who cares about the characters? I guess I do however. I was very happy to see that it was directed by Tom Dey, who also directed Shanghai Noon. Since I saw this movie, I was looking forward to seeing his next job. I think he did a good job with this movie and I'm looking forward to his next job again. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a good movie, but I would not recommend paying a high ticket, unless you're a hardcore fan of Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo. It was worth seeing at the theater, but not at a high price, I would recommend seeing it at the price of the morning. <br /> <br /> In addition, here are some anecdotes about the movies. The guy who played the cameraman, played by Judah Friedlander is the guy from the Dave Matthews band's "Everyday" video. He was also the "Meet The Parents" clerk, also played by Robert De Niro. ... And on top of that, he also played Derek Zoolander's brother in "Zoolander" (Ben Stiller, Zoolander and Meet the Parents star). Just some useless anecdotes for you. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
