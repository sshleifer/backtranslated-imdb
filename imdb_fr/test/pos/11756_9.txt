William Holden (as a war journalist) delivered these prophetic words to the beautiful Jennifer Jones (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining her failed marriage on the beach. They begin an affair, despite enormous odds of adultery and racial problems. In Hollywood in the 1950s, interracial romance was allowed, but with disastrous consequences in the end. A beautiful Hong Kong landscape (although some beach scenes seem to be linked to a studio), a famous title song, a poetic script, a delightful background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, exceptional performances, especially Jones ( directed here by Henry King "The Song of Bernadette - 1943, Oscar for Jones) still make it a world-class romance weeper.
