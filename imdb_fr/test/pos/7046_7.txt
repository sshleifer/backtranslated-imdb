I rarely care about watching comic movies or television these days. They are tasteless, vulgar and especially not funny. This could be considered a refreshing breath of the past. It's worth watching, and I do not think it's significantly dated. Classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing no matter when it was created. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie again; I thought after watching a somewhat similar "summer school" on television recently. Like this slightly newer movie, "Meatballs" is funny without being cruel, overly sexual or engaging in bathroom humor. The key, of course, is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the adolescent character - maybe even a life-saving change - and how they both grow up in the summer.
