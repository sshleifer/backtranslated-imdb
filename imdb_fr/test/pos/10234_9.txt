By adapting his own novel "Cabal" for the screen, writer / writer / director Clive Barker has shaped this wonderful story of horror and fantasy. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man suspected of being a serial killer. The cops shot him in front of Midian, on the surface of a cemetery, but it is actually a refuge for monsters who have been shunned by society. When they claim Boone and make one of them, it has repercussions on everyone, including Boone's sweet girlfriend (the lovely Anne Bobby) and the dubious psychiatrist (one of the most agreeable David Cronenberg). <br /> <br /> "Nightbreed" displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that I do not see often in movies. Among other things, Ralph McQuarrie, a regular in the conceptual arts who worked on films such as the first three entries of "Star Wars", helps Barker to create excellent visuals for "Nightbreed", starting immediately with the sequence of credit initial. The visual and make-up effects are elaborate and the design of the production and cinematography are impressive. Barker and his team are doing a great job creating this other world with fascinating characters. It is a colorful and flamboyant entertainment that is a pleasure to enjoy. And, of course, there is a keen sense of social comment on intolerance and fanaticism, not to mention the heavy consequences that can result from a person's actions. <br /> <br /> Great support performance adds to the fun. Cronenberg overflows with malevolent intent and is a real gas as a bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a good kind of antagonist of the love of hate, a rather naughty police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley is once again buried under Lylesberg's sullen makeup, a tired, rock-solid man. Hugh Ross is very entertaining as Narcissus, as is Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (as a bonus, she shows her breasts in a sequence). Simon Bamford, who played the "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two images of "Hellraiser", also appears here. John Agar, the star of the science fiction of the 50s and 60s, even made a pretty shades. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman provides another of his fantastic scores, and Barker regularly guides us through the intriguing plot to a formidable apocalyptic ordeal. <Br /> <br /> "Nightbreed" is an excellent genre film not to be missed by anyone who has not seen it. I give him a warm recommendation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
