This Royal Rumble basically had the message of struggle these days. The gadget and the image are more popular than the fight ability. <br /> <br /> HBK vs Edge. Pretty good match. A lot of heat for Edge who was just starting to hike and what better way to measure against HBK. It slowed down a bit at the end, as usual. Overall, this match gets a 6/10. Undertaker vs Hedinreich. Not a good match. Undertaker was to lead Hedinreich through this match that seemed really lost and messed up his maneuvers. It became interesting to see Raws Gene Snitsky and a little later Kane enter this game. Overall, fans seemed more interested in the end of this game. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs JBL vs Big Show. This match was slow at first, but was pretty good in the end when Angle managed to accelerate the match. Kurt Angle has made very good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler in the game. JBL and Big Show are organizing a slow match. The end of this match was bad. On the whole of this match was a 5/10 mostly because of Kurt Angle. Randy Orton against HHH. Good match, surprising heat for Randy Orton who was the face of this game. Randy proved he could reach the limit with any star. This match also marked the first match that HHH fought against someone who did not run out to save him from a defeat. Overall, this match was roughly equal to 6/10. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble match went off without a hitch. Some surprises. Some not so good surprises. I was a little upset that Kurt Angle did not have enough time for this game. But during this whole game, there was a guy who, I never thought, would be pushed so early. I will not tell you who wins. I give this game a 8/10
