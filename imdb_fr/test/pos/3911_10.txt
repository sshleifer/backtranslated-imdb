I loved this film !! I was waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw her at the opening night and I loved it. Some people told me that this movie was not good and that we had to stay away, but I thought it was great. The actors played very well and it scared me. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everyone makes her have a hard time, but she did not even play such an important role. The set was great if it was made of all the wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job and the sense of death was excellent. The killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. I can not wait to watch this movie on video so I can get it and see it again and again. The overview of my review is to see this movie if you like Hororr movies and you will not be disappointed to have liked this movie. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS !!!
