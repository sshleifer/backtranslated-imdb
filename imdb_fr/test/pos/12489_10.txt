The director loves the actress and it shows. The actress lives in the character we love at first glance and sound. The character loves her jealous, shameless husband and he loves her. His childhood friend secretly loves his wife and the fact that his friend is a beautiful woman makes love tragic and ironic. His wife is jealous of his childhood friend and thinks that his attentions result from a hidden love for her husband. <br /> <br /> Then there is a murder and the police lieutenant who investigates, who only loves his bi-racial son, The characters mentioned above, who had an unpleasant contact with the deceased and who lie to one degree or another, remove the mystery of some of the most precise and authentic procedural details ever recorded in a film. <br /> <br /> And then, there is the atmosphere of a post-war Paris, where coal is rare, music filled with erotic nostalgia and nostalgic memories, and where the rain has washed innocence for a long time. <br /> <br /> All this in an environment of magicians whose turns do not always work, dogs walking on their hind legs and who express musical criticism, hungry reporters and exhausted cops. <br /> <br /> And then there are many of the best actors of their generation who have gone through a very bad ye ar realized by, to conclude, a man who loves his main actress and who, with all justification, was a respected friend of Picasso. <br /> <br /> I have often seen this movie and I love everyone and that.
