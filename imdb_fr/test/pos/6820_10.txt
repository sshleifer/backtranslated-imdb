Youth In Us is a perfect jewel. I saw this beautiful short film at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005. The story took me on a deeply transforming journey. Directed by Joshua Leonard, acting by Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas, artistic direction, cinematography, score - each element was true to the bone. One can only hope that this exquisite and excruciating film is the prelude to a film from this talented director. <br /> <br /> Just as a short film is presented before a feature film at Sundance, commercial theaters have used a similar format in past times. It would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like The Youth In Us could reach a wider audience.
