Having seen and loved this film in Australia, I really wanted to get some paws on a copy. In the UK, I received one on DVD, but I noticed that it was a very different edition. <br /> <br /> The Australian national edition I saw is more alive. The UK, and I guess the European editions, spend a lot more time on the narrator played by Jimmy's dead brother. And, indeed, he insists that few other points have any real benefit. <br /> This is not a serious criticism, but the Oz edition is more daring and I think more assured. <br /> <br /> I can not say why they found it necessary an expansion for the overseas market? <br /> <br /> one that you are going for. <br /> <br /> I went for both.
