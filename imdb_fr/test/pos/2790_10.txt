My favorite movie this year. Great characters and intrigue, and the direction and editing were fluid, visually beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> Located in Barcelona, ​​the film follows a year in the life of six foreign graduate students and various others. Cultures and languages ​​collide, but hearts and lives intertwine. The main role would never have been played in Hollywood, but he played the role perfectly. The characters were well developed and their interaction was honest and accurate. There were two particularly remarkable scenes, the climax was really inspired. The film is sentimental and the last ten minutes could have been shortened, but it was wonderfully entertaining. <br /> <br /> I hardly watched the video, but I just saw Audrey Tautou. His role, although presented second or third, was minor and was eclipsed by several other characters. I wish more movies like this one were made. It evoked the Big Chill or the Breakfast Club. Do not start this movie late if you plan to go to sleep halfway.
