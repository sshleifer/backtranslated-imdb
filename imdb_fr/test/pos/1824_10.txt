It was in 1983 and I was 13 years old. I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were working. After that, I wanted to talk to someone right away. It turns out that my best friend looked at it too and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that, we watched until we could recite it. We woke up his parents late at night laughing hysterically. We started to love the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying it's a classic. Although it is for me personally. And I understand that all the talk of Valley Girl becomes annoying, but it was in the 80s. But at the bottom of the film, it's a love story, well known and familiar. Girl meets boy and there are sparks on both sides, an instant connection. Julie's friends do not like him - he does not make his way, does not go to school, has no money. They like him better with his ex-boyfriend the footballer even if he is an idiot. She makes the ultimate sacrifice, her own happiness for the happiness of her friends. And she has these hippie parents really cool support. This is one of Nicholas Cage's first films and his first lead role. One minute, he is absolutely hilarious and the next incredibly touching and romantic. His friend Fred is pretty funny too. If you were a teenager in the 80s, you will love this movie or at least it will bring back memories. It's not my favorite movie anymore, but it's still one of my favorite movies, probably in my top 10. I can not wait for it to be released on DVD, if it's there. You can go to Deborah Foreman's website to sign a petition for her DVD release. Two soundtracks of the film are essential if you like the music of the 80s.
