Ronald Coleman was a screen star for several years when the talkies came in, and what a thunderbolt for his career. His Oxford English accent is so captivating that I could hear him reciting the farmer's almanac without getting bored. Coleman plays Willie Hale, a 30-year-old playboy from a wealthy family who spends his time playing poker. Yet he is a friendly thug, not only from the point of view of the public, but also from family and friends. He once again went bankrupt because of his constant gambling and sold his property in a foreign place to settle his debts and facilitate the return home to England. When he arrives there, he is first met by a father who insists he will kick him out. He had it with Willie and his flippant manner. However, five minutes alone in a room with Willie and his charm, and dad forgives him not only Willie, but daddy gave him a hundred pounds. <br /> <br /> Willie then leaves for a day of play with his sister and friend Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). Dorothy must get engaged to Grand Duke Paul that night, mainly because his father wants kings in the family and there is no one else in his life. That changes after his day with Willie, and soon a scandal is preparing: Dorothy refuses to respect the marriage as planned. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman is always thrilled to watch these youth films he made for Sam Goldwyn where he plays the confident adventurer or cad or both. He has a similar behavior to Errol Flynn, but he is unable to display Flynn's physical agility due to a disabling injury he received during the First World War. However, what is lacking in physical agility has never failed to create soul agility. Loretta Young, only 17 years old when this photo was made, shows the beginning of her trademark, the sweet girl, who can turn into a fireball when the opportunity arises. Myrna Loy plays Willie's daughter of the past - Mary Crayle - a dancer. Here, Myrna still plays a role similar to the exotic vamp games with which she often found herself stuck at Warner Brothers when she was contracted from 1926 to shortly before this film was shot in 1930. <br /> > <br /> This is pretty much a light and airy romantic comedy from start to finish. If you're in the mood for this kind of escapist entertainment that has thrilled audiences during the Great Depression, this little movie is perfect.
