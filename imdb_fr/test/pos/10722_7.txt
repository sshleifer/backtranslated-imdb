Since "Midnight Cowboy", I'm looking for movies with Dustin Hoffman and I have not been generally disappointed. Since "Kramer vs. Kramer", I'm looking for movies with Meryl Streep and I have not generally been disappointed. She gave a great performance, really one of her best, in "Sophie's Decision" and I defeated her in "Out of Africa". The fact that these two actors met more than 20 years ago for Kramer vs Kramer was certainly a very good idea: the result is an excellent drama of characters whose theme is still relevant in today's society. hui. <br /> <br /> On the verge of divorce everyone is having a bad time, although children seem to suffer the most ?????? .. Beautifully manipulated by Robert Benton in an original staging presenting memorable scenes: even the passage takes a character and should be included in the throw! And for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), just beautiful. How do you get an eight year old to act? Benton succeeded, and of course, with Hoffman, there seemed to be good electricity: the result is certainly engaging, endearing and convincing. The performance of Justin Henry must be among the best performances of all time for 5 or 6 children. The best thing, again, was the natural, there was no going over there, so often these days. <br /> <br /> This movie came back to the screen the other night, even though I had it in my collection of videos for years: it is always interesting to watch and pay attention to everything. About 7Â½ out of 10
