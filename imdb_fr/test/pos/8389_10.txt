Inglorious Basterds does not apologize, does not ask for forgiveness, it is an assault on all the senses. Tarantino does not care if he offends, if he passes stereotypes and clich√©s, it is the realization of a film in its pure state. It's great to see a filmmaker whose work is clearly not influenced by the powers that be. Tarantino is the master of tension without effort and its sudden mixture with bursts of laughter. you do not know if you should look elsewhere with disgust or laugh, anyway it's a roller coaster and one not to be missed! It's not for everyone and I do not know how the Germans will take the film, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, it may be a bit difficult to swallow, but nevertheless, it's a movie that has to be seen. This should not be missed by movie lovers. And the performance of Christoph Waltz ... Oscar do not dare to ignore it!
