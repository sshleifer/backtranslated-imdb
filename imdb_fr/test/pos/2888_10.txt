After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is that it was worth the wait! "Rush in Rio" may well be the largest existing rock DVD. I am not joking. It's incredible! All the noise that the sound is rotten is true, but that does not make the concert unassailable. I think you feel like you're really in Rio watching the public gig. This is one of the reasons I like this DVD. You feel as if you were there. Plus, Geddy, Alex and Neil have never been so fit! Geddy's voice is flawless, Alex's guitar playing is still amazing and Neil - absolutely no word to say. The camera work on this gig was very good, I must say. They looked at everything that was happening on the stage and in the audience. Congratulations to the cameramen! Anyway, enough of my delirium! Go watch "Rush in Rio" for yourself. You will be surprised. I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
