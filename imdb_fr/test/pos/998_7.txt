With her ww2 timing, fall in love and out of love, and easy to look at Kira, it's a new atonement. <br /> <br /> This is a relational story with concentrated main characters working on the balance between first love and quick love at home from the Second World War. Poet Dylan Thomas sneaks between woman and ex in the dark and smoky blitz of London and later in windy Wales. <br /> <br /> The ex-Vera and the following get excited as the poet and the soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. An easy watch that works well at the time bouncing with some lows in the rhythm. It would work well with French subtitles, but I may have gone to too many art and essay movies lately.
