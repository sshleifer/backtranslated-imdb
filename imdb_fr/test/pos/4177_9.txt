Head should have been a moment of pride not only for his stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or his director / co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also for his other co-author (and his brief cameo), Jack Nicholson . In the current state of things, most of them seem to avoid it and the film is considered at best as a curiosity of the outside world. <br /> <br /> While the TV series was famous for its antics "Help!", This film is also judged by the same agreement, yet far from the banal and painfully overrated Beatles movies, and even the dated Monkees TV series, Head has a depth layer.A sub-current of the darker nature of man is at work here, and though it may sound strange about a pop group made, the use of certain themes and images (hitting women, laughing at crippled and real life of a Vietcong POW is dead at close range) gives the film an advantage to which many "serious" films would not dare pretend. <br /> <br /> There are also fun moments, from James Bond parodies to "Big Victor" and my favorite, Mickey Dolenz, under the spell of Arab soldiers on horseback. (One of them turns to Mickey and whistles 'pssst!', Only for the 'pssst!' To appear in the subtitles!) The group is aware of the image it has made in the film ('I am the model, Mickey' I 'I am still the model,' says Tork, summing up perfectly his role as a one-dimensional sheet of the series), which means that their characters ?? they play "themselves" acting and not playing here ?? are more open and, therefore, are less generic and irritating than they were in the series. This level of parody and self-awareness even takes on its fab-four origins, with more subtle Maharishi grips and endless thanks to a waitress who asks, "Well, if it's not a gift from God to the eight - years?? Are you still paying tribute to Ringo Starr? Also listen to Tork whistling "Strawberry Fields Forever" in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Then there are the songs, of course. Six of them here, slightly more psychedelic than usual, may have alienated their fans, and even a Frank Zappa cameo would not have seduced an adult audience at this stage. The best is probably the charming "As We Go Along", although the first, a "Song of Porpoises" written by Carol King, speaks in an interesting way of the desire to live while the weather turns and that death is getting closer to more. On a lighter note, his chorus "the porpoise laughs" seems to be a direct catch of "I am the walrus". <br /> <br /> Constantly inventive with direct references to silent film and drug culture, Head's most remarkable feature is perhaps its narrative structure. Not the only ?? but the most important ?? That's why it improves with multiple views, the story goes left, right, forward, backward, circular and at many levels of reality. In essence, a series of sketches are loosely tightened, its cohesion is reinforced by the space-time plot defying all internal logic by means of a backtracking, a sequence of dreams, a prison of the mind and a channel changer with remote control. <br /> With a perfect beginning and end, this cleverly written, intelligent film was not what the pre-teen audience of The Monkees had expected and subsequently underwent a reception negative criticism. Now that these expectations have disappeared, it is in serious need of reconsideration.
