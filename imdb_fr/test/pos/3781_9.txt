Chaplin enters the trenches of the First World War in this animated comedy that never minimizes the horrors of war. Rain, mud, explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to everyone. He is in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, which he accomplishes with incredible success. <br /> <br /> It almost sounds like a long ego trip for Chaplin - very fun, until the last minute. when he reaches a new level of emotion and everything makes sense. <br /> <br /> This may be what all soldiers dream before the war begins.
