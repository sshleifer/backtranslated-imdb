OK, most of us agree that this is a weak remake attempt, but at the same time, it's also a different movie. Do not get me wrong, "American Werewolf In London" is a top quality movie, but "American Remake In Paris" is also a decent movie. <br /> <br /> First, the only real similarities are the TITLE. , 2 US BACKPACKERS and WEREWOLVES. In addition to these 3 elements, "American Remake In Paris" stands out quite well with its particular mix of humor, action / adventure and horror. Most people who say that this film is better than the original are the young generation of the current generation who think that any film made before 1990 is a total crap. Those of us who grew up in the 80s can enjoy older movies and what they have added to today's horror movies. What many people do not realize is that without the old classic movies, including the black and white ones, the horror would not be what it is today. Now I'm off the beaten path ... <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a good attempt to recreate a classic, but it will never surpass the original. That said, it's still a very entertaining movie to watch and I really recommend it. I give it 7 out of 10. Maybe it's a bit generous, but I've seen much worse attempts to recreate a classic.
