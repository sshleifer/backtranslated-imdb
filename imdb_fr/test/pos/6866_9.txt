This film will make you shudder even if you do not understand German. I first saw this in my German high school class and found it for $ 5 at my local Wal-Mart. I've seen it at least 20 more times since * this only a few years ago * and it's great to watch a movie night. The plasticized bodies are for the most part real, used in Body Worlds. This movie was an out-lash to that. A German Dr. * nicknamed Dr. Death * began to laminate human bodies for display and Body Worlds is now a business on tour in Chicago, IL Many people were opposed to this and a great German horror film was turned. Personally, I love this film and would recommend it to anyone who loves thrillers.
