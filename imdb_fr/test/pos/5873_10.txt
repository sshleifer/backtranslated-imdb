The brilliance of this film does not lie in the process of making the film, which is a conventional interwoven narrative, but executed, lies of three soldiers after the Second World War, but in the fact that this story was told. Samuel Goldwyn deserves the credit of passing a film whose head is a disabled veteran with hand forceps, an alcoholic and an underachiever.
