The mascot is the masterpiece of Ladislaw Starewicz. It tells the story of a stuffed plush dog looking for an orange after hearing the mother tell her daughter that she has no money. The dog is chosen with other toys to be sold. In the truck, after the others have jumped while the vehicle rolls, the dog stays and waits to be picked up at the store before leaving alone. He managed to get the orange after biting a woman's leg as she held and sold the fruit. When he runs, he meets the devil and accepts his offer to stop at the disco. There he meets the other toys that jumped off the truck. The cat that was next to him in the vehicle is particularly determined to get the dog's orange. I will stop here to mention that other wonderfully bizarre things happen in a nightclub that you will have to see for yourself. In other words, if you like Starewicz and are interested in all the animations of the past, I highly recommend you to search for it!
