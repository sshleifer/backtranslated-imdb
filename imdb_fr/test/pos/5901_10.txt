Everyone agrees on the technical excellence of this film by Jutra (whose life ended so tragically). As far as the content is concerned, of course, it makes a difference if you are a Quebecker, and that partly explains the difference of opinion. For me, it is in the cinema what "My country, it is not a country" of Vignault is to the song. In addition, Jean Duceppe himself was part of the legendary Quebec. <br /> <br /> This film can be contrasted with "CRAZY", a current Quebec film that is sufficiently popular to be broadcast here in Spain. 1960s Urban Quebec (crazy) vs Rural Quebec (Antoine). But also a film that must be very different for foreigners and for those who know Quebec from the inside.
