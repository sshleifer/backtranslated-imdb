I did not believe much at first, but as a citizen of Costa Rica, I can confirm that the film shows the reality, that we live from day to day, and shows a lot of our culture, such as our way of speaking , our music, our way of defending our rights without any fear, without any weapon. <br /> <br /> I'm really proud of the work they did and how they did not forget this message throughout the film they wanted us to receive, without worrying about the money but working with a small budget, allowing us to enjoy the beautiful scenery and the beautiful photography. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend seeing this movie, you will not regret it.
