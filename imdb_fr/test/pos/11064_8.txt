I have to admit that my vote on this film harms me, but I have good reason to know the true story that has been given to Hollywood treatment. Edna Ferber's novel on which he is based goes back to a time when real names could not be used. In a way, this movie is all smoke and mirrors. Although it was released in 1946, it was shot shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is at its peak in this film as a brunette. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman who tries to exchange her beauty against a rich husband. Today, it's a gold digger, but in this social era, it's desirable and the kind of woman that makes all men want it, and all the old, pretentious types of society talk about it and the 'avoid, while wishing they are her. Ingrid is at her best and plays this role well. <br /> <br /> A little sympathy for the character of Ingrids in the New Orleans section of this film when she managed to get a decent late grave for her mother scandalized as part of the deal between his relatives and forcing him to leave New Orleans. The snooty family of parents there is so outraged by her that she will do almost anything she asks him to leave the city. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is good at this film, although he seems to have grown old enough to play a dashing Texas Bachelor / Gambleur. He is doing well given his disability that seemed older than that due to his smoking in real life. Flora Robison as Ingrid's housekeeper was nominated for an Oscar as a supporting actress in this film. Jerry Austin as Cupidor has been neglected in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief of the film and does it well. <br /> <br /> When the film moves to Saratoga, it shows precisely how important Saratoga was at that time. I like the sequence when Bergman goes to the Saratoge spring to fetch "sulphurous" water that everyone then considered healthy. When she drinks, she forces herself not to grimace and comments how good it is and that she must have more. <br /> <br /> The real story is the rail battle that really took place on the Tunnel railway line in New York, which is the real Saratoga Trunk whose title is derived from. This battle actually took place in 1869 between agents of Andrew Carnagie and J. P. Morgan. The line was the country's economic key in 1869, linking coal and the east coast. The references to this film are very real throughout the film. There are even dialogues describing Carnagie as "Scottish" although the reference is vague and unknown to anyone who does not know the story of the battle. <br /> <br /> The railroad and tunnel tunnel in Tunnel, New York (postal code 13848) still exists although the film was shot in California. The real tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of a key freight line today, years after. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's phrase in the film as he climbs the tunnel is right, it's still "a beautiful, powerful country".
