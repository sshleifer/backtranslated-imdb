A huge cast met for this remake which was unfortunately a failure at the box office despite an excellent soundtrack. I can not say it was captivating entertainment, nor a cure for insomnia. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film - it allowed me to escape after an afternoon. A good look for those of us who are looking for the ideal life, although a fantasy. Expect foolish moments, chills and occasional laughter.
