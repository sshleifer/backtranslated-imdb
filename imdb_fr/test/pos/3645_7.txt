As I said before, I'm not a fan of Tweety. It's so annoying that I'd like Sylvester to eat it and finish it. <br /> <br /> In this caricature, Sly is homeless again and starts feeding on garbage cans again. He spots a cruise ship leaving the nearby harbor and decides to board when he spies. Tweety is one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship provides a suitable scene for the following hijinks and Sly tries desperately to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once, he succeeds in chewing and swallow, thus completing the irritating Canary forever. But, as the cartoons featuring Tweety show, this one is pretty good, but it's ALL thanks to this brilliant cat.
