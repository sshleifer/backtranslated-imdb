I loved this movie, it was cute and funny! Lauren Holly was wonderful, she is funny and very credible in her role. Costas Mandylan was also very good, nice to watch too !! Brenda Vaccaro, as usual was a pleasure to watch, she did a great job with her character. It was a pleasure to watch a funny, interesting movie that can be watched by the whole family. It's hard to find beautiful, healthy movies anymore. Thank goodness for Hallmark movies, they are wonderful! I wish I could buy it. If anyone knows where I could buy this movie, let me know !! I bought several Hallmark films and I am very happy. I hope I can buy this one !!
