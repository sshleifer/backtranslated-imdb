This film in particular was the one I wanted to see in the theaters, but which I never managed to understand. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001, I enjoyed it so much that I went to buy the DVD soon after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake have done a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to in the audio commentary that is included on the DVD. They did a great job creating characters that are important to you. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film, including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job showing the importance of the family (a rarity in today's movie), like the director Bonnie Hunt, from the comments she made on the DVD. David Duchovny showed me here that there is a life beyond Fox Mulder that gives a wonderful performance with quite poignant scenes. I highly recommend you watch this movie. I am really grateful to the creators of this film. They gave me a wonderful movie that I will recommend to all my friends. I have seen a lot of movies over the years and it is very rare that I come back with so much satisfaction after watching a movie. I will look at this over and over again for years to come. Coming back to me reminds me that there are still directors who know how to please their audiences sincerely. Thank you!!
