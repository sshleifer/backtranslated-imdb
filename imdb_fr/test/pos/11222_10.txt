I recently attended Sundance, as I have done many times in the past, and have been treated to the small pleasures of peevish indies, the overabundance of dark comedies, and now-predictable portraits of dysfunction. But then, I saw "Northfork" by Mark and Michael Polish and I remembered why I fell in love with cinema. "Northfork" scours the screen with visionary audacity and revisits Terence Malick's primal work and Antonioni's existential landscapes. It's an impossible-to-explain film that is one of its many assets. Suffice it to say that it is a fairy tale for adults with many levels of meaning carefully superimposed. It awoke my imagination and cast an impressive shadow on all the other films I've seen this year. It is a meticulous craft work and a sophistication of writing that is not seen in most American movies. I plan to see this film several times for my neighborhood theater. For it is an enticing piece of magic and mystery, a mesmerizing work that allows you to explore the plains of Montana in search of angels and the very nature of the sky and the earth. The actors interpret this luminous play with striking conviction, especially James Woods and Nick Nolte, which remind us of the courage and daring they have shown throughout their careers. Maybe 'Northfork' will help us find a new wave of American cinema where excellence in craft and writing becomes more the norm than the exception. Observe him when you meet him and take your friends because the questions will be many and the thoughts and feelings of seeing "Northfork" will awaken memories of the good film you saw in your past and hopefully , will return Polish brothers.
