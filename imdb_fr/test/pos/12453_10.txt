I saw most of Tarzan's episodes. Certainly the X movie with O'Keeffe & Bo Derek, which is totally deplorable. <br /> <br /> I have seen this version several times since it first appeared. <br /> <br /> All cast actors had memorable parts, an excellent interpretation of the sequences of monkeys. <br /> <br /> Last night, I saw the same thing on a Spanish radio station and some dialogues in French, all in Spanish. <br /> <br /> As far as Hudson does not want Andie voice he did not do anything until the end. He looked at the dailies and could have engaged a dialogue coach. <br /> <br /> It seems absurd that a story about monkeys and a man raised by them all speak of the mumbo jumbo that Hudson attacked Andie. she was an American cousin. The last time I checked that Carolina was in the United States. <br /> <br /> She was beautiful in the cinema and her eyes, and her beautiful hair, her alabaster skin mystified all men. She did not have to resort to Bo's level. <br /> <br /> She has remained a LADY throughout her career and should watch this movie (half of her life) as a starting point. His performance, his sincerity, made this film enjoyable, believing that a half-wild man could discover his inner beauty. <br /> <br /> Excellent starting point for Sir Richardson, he stole the film.
