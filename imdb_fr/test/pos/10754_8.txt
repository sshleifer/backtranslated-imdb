<br /> <br /> As a fan of Harold Lloyd, I share the opinion of the other critic, EXCEPT that I feel that "Movie Crazy" was his best sound movie; "Cat's Paw" is a close second. (But, this is just my opinion.) <br /> <br /> This movie is a "joke" from beginning to end and, in many scenes, George Barbier (the scammer who gets him elected mayor ) is almost stealing the show! (Especially at the end of the film). <br /> <br /> We hope that Una Merkel's character will be a little more sympathetic to Harold, especially as the film progresses. It is only in the last minutes of the film that we discover his true feelings for him. (And even then, there is no "romance" - kissing, etc.). <br /> <br /> It's a must-see movie!
