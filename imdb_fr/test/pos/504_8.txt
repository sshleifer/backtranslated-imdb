As close as the movie is to comics, it does not matter. This film is radically different from the boredom of "Interview with the Vampire" (although the acting was good) and slips into the wonderful action scenes. Very compelling and interesting story with a surprisingly good acting act of all. Disadvantage - poor graphics. Does it matter? Nope.
