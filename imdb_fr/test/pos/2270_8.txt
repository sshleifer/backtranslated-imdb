Actor turned director Liev Schreiber (The sum of all fears) makes a version of the film titled Everything Is Illuminated by author Jonathan Safran Foer above average. This story of travel and self-discovery is illustrated by strong overall performance and precise direction with a scenario that enriches and illuminates the soul. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who saw his grandfather, Safran, die. Jonathan's habit is to take small objects and memories of life and seal them in plastic zippered bags to display on his wall. Saffron gives Jonathan an old photo of a young saffron standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. Thus, Jonathan undertakes a long journey to locate this mysterious woman in Ukraine, without knowing if she is still alive. He calls Alex (Eugene Hutz), his young guide, and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to lead him to his goal. At first, the journey was elbowed and false, but as the group approached its target, the men found themselves among the ruins of a dark chapter of history, with memories of the war and the ghosts past of a non-existent city. They will find their own destiny and will be forever changed by what they learn. <br /> <br /> It looks like it was made by someone who knew how to get the most out of his actors. Sometimes the film is spoken in Russian and looks like a foreign film. The title itself is a self-discovery game. It is a thoughtful journey of a man into his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey also becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather. It is a story of long-term connection and guilt that one must carry all one's life. At the end of the film, these characters have all experienced events that will change their lives and that will result forever. This proves that memories can be powerful to traumatize and cleanse the soul. It also concerns our heritage and the way others perceive an event or person in the past. Alex ends up seeing his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these people will have changed with the end of the film, which is a tribute to a well-told story. <br /> <br /> The story is deceptively simple. It works like a road trip movie (like The Straight Story) combined with an interesting mystery story. It really involves a lot of emotions and secondary intrigues going from the past to the present. The end is a little surreal with his sense of déjà vu. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Sin City, The Eternal Sun of the Unblemished Spirit) has chosen a wide range of roles since entering the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Here he does a good job with an essentially minimalist role and not much to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin are doing better than Alex and his grandfather, respectively. Even the grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. (that's right) is funny as a fiercely faithful companion. <br /> <br /> The musical score of Paul Cantelon is a compliment of bad mood to the thoughtful nature of the film. Editing is effective because past and present images are linked and effortlessly transitioned. Matthew Libatique's (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream) cinematography is literally dull and lifeless, with some impressive images of the war and its consequences. <br /> <br /> The coincidences that emerged during the last half of the drama movie but are a bit too fortuitous. We never fully understand the background story of Alex's grandfather and his motivations. In the same way, Jonathan's empty looks and lack of apparent substance and depth give us little more than a sketch of a weird man. Sometimes the film is a bit dark and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed. But these are minor critics of what is a good introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure. The fact that Schreiber not only directs the script, but adapts it to this commendable slice of history, is a tribute to his talents and his promising potential for the future.
