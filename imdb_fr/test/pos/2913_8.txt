... as precious as the tomb of King Tut! (OK, maybe not so precious, but it's worth looking if you can). I notice that nobody has commented on this film for a few years and I hope that a new message will elicit new comments. It's a film I could not remember but excerpts from my childhood, which I had recently seen when I got tired of waiting for Fox to honor his past, and I'm hunting the Korean DVD (in English, but with irremovable Korean subtitles). I will not go through another long description of the plot - suffice it to say that seeing it for the first time in its appropriate widescreen format has left me speechless in front of the perspectives and scope of the film. The matte paintings still stand and the decorations of the palace are breathtaking. But it's the smaller-scale details that give this movie its depth and richness, providing insight into the lifestyle of the poor and the Egyptian elite. Bazaars, slums, wharves, embalming houses and taverns are as fascinating as Pharaoh's throne room. While errors abound on a large scale (notably the dynastic succession), the details are more carefully studied than the vast majority of Hollywood films. Visually, it's not without flaws: the interiors are often too bright and too colorful to blend in perfectly with the exteriors. Nevertheless, it is a film that deserves to be as audacious in the small as in the big one. Tedious? In some parts, absolutely. Too hectic? Underused? Yes, both - although "understated" may be a more appropriate description. Too long? Absolutely not. I would have liked them to spend more time with the Sinuhe experiences at the House of Death and the Hittites, and less with his "love affair" with Nefer. Historically inaccurate? Yes, that too, but Shakespeare was too. Nobody chastises him for that. I appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next, but we must not forget that cinema is a theater, not a lesson in history.
