I watched Asterix and Obelix in Operation Cleopatra, which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comics. Like the comic, the whole film is full of jokes based on puns, anachronistic jokes and stick gags that rarely fall flat. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix are Gauls who use a potion of force to fight the Roman legions in their home country. Gaul. Here they end up in Egypt to help a friend build Cesar's palace (yes, it's puny) in three months to prove that the Egyptians are as good as the Romans. <br /> <br /> The reason I chose this was because of Monica Belluci is Cleopatra. She is good but the role is a little more than a cameo. However, even though she is rarely in the film, I did not care, because it's so smart and jokes so funny that I was in a fit of nerves. I liked it. I loved it so much that I do not understand why the movies were never released in the United States. <br /> <br /> The import DVD contains the film in English, which is quite good, especially considering that when you look at the longer French version, the word games (and therefore the jokes ) are not always apparent because they are auditory. Therefore, if you read the names wrongly, the jokes are lost. Most of the jokes between the full French version and the shorter English dub seem to be exactly the same, although some have been modified sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. Personally, I will stay with the dub when I watch it again because it is easier to understand the jokes and enjoy the humor. <br /> <br /> You will really want to see it if you like word games and low eyebrows, but smart humor is a great comedy
