BACKGROUND is everything when we are going to evaluate a movie. When evaluating this film, you have to consider when it was made. We did not really know what the inside of the EARTH looked like at that time, so you can not ruin the movie for the plot (based on a much older book). For the time, it was special effects of the first order and the quality of production was excellent. I watched this movie in a masterfully restored HD master. For now, makeup and effects almost make the guys in the rubber suits seem plausible like a monster. This is a pure film cheese complete with bad rubber costumes, mannequins and scary costumes. IMPRESSIVE. PS Doug McClure ROCKS!
