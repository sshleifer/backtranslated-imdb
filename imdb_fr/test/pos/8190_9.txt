Based on the actual event, this epic takes place in the year 221 BC. BC and tells the true story of the unification of China. Action full of intrigues, passions, betrayals and sequences of unforgettable battles, it has caught my attention despite its 160 minutes. <br /> <br /> King Ying Zeng, played by Li Xuejian, is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of China and becoming the first emperor. Her lover, Lady Zhao, portrayed by the beautiful actress Gong Li, conceives a plot in which she will travel to the neighboring kingdom of Yan to set up a fake assassination plot that will give the king an excuse to invade Yan. However, she falls in love with the murderer as the king becomes more and more ruthless. <br /> <br /> There are secondary intrigues, tragedy and constant drama. There are scenes of great beauty and abject cruelty. There is excellent cinematography and a brilliant use of physical space. <br /> <br /> The deep characterization made me think of Shakespeare. And tragic events that are reminiscent of Greek drama. And yet, it is totally Chinese since it deals with age-old questions of whether the ends justify the means. And raises questions about life and death and about good and bad, and all the fuzzy boundaries that separate them. <br /> <br /> This is the story of individuals on a background of history, a story that has shaped China for the past two thousand years. History swept away me as well as the moral issues raised. There is no easy answer and this is one of the highlights of the movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended. But be prepared for violence and violence. <br /> <br />
