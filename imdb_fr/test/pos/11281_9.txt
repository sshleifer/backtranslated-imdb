God cuts himself with a razor, after, he gives birth to the mother earth, who then gives birth through the sperm of gods, sons of the earth. <br /> <br /> This is a one-and-a-half hour film that kind of describes a dark version of how God created the world. It's surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the film is for me the visual. His filming is a very grainy black and white film, using both slow motion and normal shots. Sometimes even a quick movie and stop-motion. The scenes are long and drawn, which creates a very strange atmosphere. No sound was recorded during the shooting (I think), sound effects were added later, such as criccets, water and other ambient sounds, repeated several times. You'll understand, this movie is certainly not for the impatient ... <br /> <br /> I often thought it looked like David Lynch's Eraserhead, only this one is even more difficult to understand and more dragged on, but that's fine for me, I like that kind of stuff. It's certainly not entertainment (at least not the Hollywood genre), so if you're going to take a look at it, I recommend you get ready for it. Be open minded and save something like the end of 2001: an odyssey of space.
