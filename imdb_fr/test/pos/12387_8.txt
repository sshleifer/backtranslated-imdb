I guess this movie is not your typical Spanish thriller because it is based on a real story that took place abroad. The film is based on the true story of Frenchman Jean-Claude Romand, and the real case is much more bloody and scary than the movie. In the true story of Mr. Romand, the family did not escape. After years of lies, he decided to end his life by killing his wife, two children, parents and dog. Although he tried to commit suicide, it seems he did not try very hard as he survived. I watched the movie with people next to me who said it was impossible for all these lies to be undetected in real life. I laughed when I read the book about Mr. Romand and that I knew it had happened. I like Jos√© Coronado in this movie, he gave us a good performance, like the rest of the team.
