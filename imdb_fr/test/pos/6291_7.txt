I did not expect much when I decided to watch this movie. So I was surprised to appreciate it thoroughly. Some scenes made me laugh almost uncontrollably. The characters were engaging (no pun intended); However, the story is predictable. The pleasure comes from looking at Crawl (the character of Shore), a Californian guy said wise and yet wise that a country student brings home for Thanksgiving, trying in his clumsy (but endearing) way to adapt to their style of life. I was also surprised that in all this there was a message. If you have a chance, see this movie!
