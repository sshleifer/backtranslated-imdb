"Nemesis" was the last book to present Miss Marple written by Agatha Christie (the last official case "Sleeping Murder" was written in the 40s) and I always had a soft spot for this title. I loved the characters and they are kindly staged in this great BBC adaptation with Joan Hickson, as great as Miss Marple. <br /> <br /> Overall, he is very faithful to the book. Some characters are abandoned, the first (new) murder is slightly different and some new characters are introduced. Personally, I felt that the addition of Lionel Peel's character was useless and rather irritating. The Madge tour guide was irritating in a different way but often very entertaining. It is largely because of Lionel that I do not assign 10 out of 10! The other characters are beautifully created, including Helen Cherry as Miss Temple and the three strange sisters, but especially Margaret Tyzack, who impressively plays Clothilde. It threatens to overtake but avoids it. The female bodyguards are also good value and the episode contains one of my favorite lines from Hickson ... "An archdeacon ?!" <br /> <br /> This is another relatively early group of the BBC Marple that looks wonderful and has a feeling of glorious nostalgia. Highly recommended.
