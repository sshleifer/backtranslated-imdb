I have seen this film twice at the Transilvania International Film Festival (TIFF), the film is in competition and I really hope Esteir Sapir will receive one of the prizes (at least the prize for the best image). <br /> <br /> As a silent film fan, I am interested in contemporary films that quote or recreate the language of the cinema of yesteryear. The previous comment pointed to the quotes of Fritz Lang and p. W. Murnau. In my opinion, the film refers directly to Lang's metropolis and the allegorico-parabolic character of its intrigues. But I did not see Murnau inside. There is, however, a more obvious tribute to Melies: the Moon with a human face (here smoking the cigar), and the mountains and urban landscapes painted in paper. I appreciated the film mainly for its graphics and, in the meantime, I found very interesting the story about the mutism and the creative means of communication used by the inhabitants of the city without voice. From this point of view, this film is a unique reflection on the silence of the silent cinema, because in the films of the silent period, it is difficult to find stories with dumb characters. In this case, one may wonder if the story about stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film's form, or if there is an intention to play on the muteness of silent films. Another example of this kind of thinking that I found in Guy Maddin's Careful, where the inhabitants of a mountain village have restrictions on the use of their voice. I intend to write an article about it. If you know any movies on this subject, let me know !!! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Esteban Sapir's film to all the audience (one of the critics called it: the jewel of the festival). <br /> <br /> PS: The winners were announced and the film was won. the prize for the best cinematography!
