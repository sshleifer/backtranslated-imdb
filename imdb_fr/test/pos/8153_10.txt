If you have a box of tissues, a comfortable sofa, a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on Friday night, it's definitely your movie! It's romantic, it's hot and it's hard. For most of us, homosexuals, religion is just one of the things we did when we were kids and we probably played in the alter boy and how cute he was! But in the Last Days, you see the difficulties of being gay when your whole world revolves around beliefs that totally contradict the fact of being gay. The two main actors were totally hot, but managed to capture your heart and even make me almost cry (I never cried in a movie!), Which I thought was quite impressive for a category B movie. I highly recommend this movie, you will laugh, you will cry (unless you know me) and you will certainly drool! I love it so much that I even bought the DVD for my collection. It's really the most beautiful movie of all time
