Simon Wests' thriller pg-13 about a babysitter who receives disturbing joke calls while sitting in a mansion is neither original enough nor exciting enough to be called a good movie. Although there is some suspense, candy for the eyes and decent characters, the film is just another. I know what you did last summer because it is not taken seriously. The performances were ok, but nothing special with this movie, please skip it. If you're looking for a mediocre movie, you can find better movies than this one for life, sometimes maybe not for life, but at least USA or something, haha. ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
