I remember seeing this film when I was young enough and being quite disturbed by it. I found the scenario very painful and I still remember the different bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. It was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. However, I feel that even if he had been good at games, he would have been bullied because it is difficult to decide what makes someone popular. For me, he is the type of person who would always be chosen, because that is how children work. Popular kids are popular because they are kind of cool. Popularity is a difficult thing to define. So even at the end, when he succeeds in his career, it makes no difference and he always feels tormented. I found the end quite painful because there was no resolution.
