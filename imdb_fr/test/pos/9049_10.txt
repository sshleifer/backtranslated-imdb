If a joke does not offend anyone, she's not funny. <br /> <br /> Inki's cartoons are shocking, no question. So is rap music. To move on. I suspect that any sane black man will find hilarious Inki drawings and those who will take offense at them will be whites who still think Black needs their patronizing protection against racist humor. <br /> Seriously, Inki's drawings are fun. It saddens me that not because someone is really offended, but because someone might be offended, I can not buy Inki's cartoons, or The African Queen or Song of the South on DVD.
