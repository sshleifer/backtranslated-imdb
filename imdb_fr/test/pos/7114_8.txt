Many people want to compare it to House Of Frankenstein. Although he has the same casting and the same director, he can be autonomous (it seems that Erle C Kenton has directed most of Universal's horror movies. 40s). <br /> <br /> Summarizing the plot: Baron Latos goes to Dr. Eidlemann's home in search of a "cure" for his vampirism.Larry Talbot (who survived the Frankenstein House) appears after an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Talbot and the doctor find the monster Frankenstein. To complicate matters just before biting the dust, Dracula infects the good doctor with his blood. The doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at times. When it gets you to something, you'll have to see it for yourself. <br /> <Carradine gives a very good performance as a Dracula. He does not mince the landscape as he will in later roles. It's hard to suppress laughter when it appears in a top hat. The cloak / cape is traditional but the hat must go away. Where does the hat go when it changes into a bat ...? <br /> <br /> Onslow Stevens gives an excellent portrait of the doctor. He is torn between his fundamental kindness and the thirst for growing blood to which he is now inclined. It is a very underrated performance. Chaney gives even more life to the werewolf in his 4th appearance in this role. <br /> <br /> The monster does not have much to do this time.Just on the table until the end (some archive footage of Frankenstein's ghost is used). At least in House of Frankenstein, he stood a little in the corner. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is true to the Universal base model, with the angry village mob amok running with torches.But this is not a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes.It gets a low 8.
