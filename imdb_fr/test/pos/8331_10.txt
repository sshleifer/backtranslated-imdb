Big "documentary" about how scientists believe that dinosaurs behave, captured with some of the most spectacular computer-generated images that "Jurassic Park". Made completely seriously, like a prehistoric episode of "Nation Geographic". Attracts your attention from the first image and never lets go. My favorite part was when the Diplodocus was fighting the Allosauros. <br /> <br /> 10 stars. That's what science is all about.
