I'm really surprised that this movie has a rating of 6.4 from the time I made this review. Although it's not really a good movie, I think it's one of Dietrich's best films and it's a shame he's not being considered anymore. I think the reason I liked the film so much is that Dietrich's ridiculous character, the "Ã¼ber-vamp", is not present and his role forced him to play. I just hate to see film after film, film after film, at the beginning of her career, where she looked more like a caricature or a cliche than a real woman. I do not necessarily blame Dietrich for the idiot vampish movies she made in the 1930s - the public loved them and made her famous. But here she showed that she could really act. After all, just watch it in movies like MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and THE BLUE ANGEL, who would have guessed that she was well placed to play a Gypsy! I was quite ready to hate the movie because of this casting decision, but it worked - it was pretty believable and very fun to watch too! The film is essentially a vehicle reserved for Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich - the other secondary characters are very secondary to the film. Milland is a wanted spy in Germany before the Second World War and, in his efforts to escape, he comes upon a gifted (Dietrich) Gypsy who takes it instantly for it to be a fulfillment of the prophecy - in other words, his new love! Milland is quite muddy but reluctantly agrees to travel in his wagon - even with body paint and pierced ears to make him look like a Gypsy (hence the title of the movie). Over time, he slowly begins to realize that, behind his very rough appearance, there is a woman and that the romance blossoms slowly. <br /> <br /> The film in one word is "charming". A beautiful romance with a good dose of comedy and fun - just the kind of photo you still want in Hollywood. Please also note the performance of Murvyn Vye as "Zoltan". He was very magnetic during the short time he was filmed and I loved his deep, beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Finally, a sad note to consider. Although the film takes place in Germany, there is no mention of the Gypsy Holocaust. During the war, all over Germany, the Nazis exterminated a considerable percentage of Gypsies. The final end of the film is a bit far-fetched.
