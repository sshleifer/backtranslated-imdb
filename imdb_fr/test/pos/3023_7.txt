Carl Stargher, a serial killer, kidnapped and murdered young women by letting them drown in a cell filled with water. He is apprehended by the FBI, but is in a coma and his last abduction victim is waiting in a cell scheduled to fill with water. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the places above and you will see that there is a very great deal of it all before looking at it. The magic of Mark Protosevich's script is that he turns an old, brown plot into something entirely different from what you expect. If I mentioned that the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of Stargher, then prepares a totally different movie. <br /> <br /> It would not be enough to make THE CELL a different thriller class, but the director Tarsem Singh creates a surreal and striking thriller. Paul Laufer's cinematography where the opaque primary colors are at the front is amazing but Singh does not stop there. Things like costume design where Stargher wanders in his idiosyncratic world dressed in sumptuous costumes has a visual impact that goes far beyond a current thriller. <br /> <br /> What prevents THE CELL from becoming a classic movie, you are beginning to become more and more aware that the whole film revolves around visual elements rather than a natural narrative. We see a third character, an FBI man entering Stargher's domain, but it's more like an intrigue invented just to present to the audience more amazing but very disturbing moments <br /> <br /> It should also be emphasized It's a rather disturbing thriller with a very depressing atmosphere that prevents the film from being pleasant, catchy. A scene where an FBI agent reports a case in which a pedophile beats a rape to later cut his victim's heart will fill you with so much desperation that you could reach out to the stop button. You will probably have to watch a huge amount of thrillers until you see another as disconcerting as this one.
