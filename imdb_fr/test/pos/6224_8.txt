I guess it depends on when you actually see the film for the first time and that the impression is as it is formed. <br /> <br /> I saw him as a child on television in 1973, when it was "The Stranger" and I loved it. It was the time when the space program on the moon was a reality, when shows such as "Search", "UFO" and "6M $ Man" showed a 12-year-old child what the world could bear in his to come up. Adventure and technology. <br /> <br /> You only saw programs once and that's when the network broadcast them. The only way for people to reduce your emissions was to make their own parody; they were unable to take your program and add their own comments. <br /> <br /> I did not know what this concept of "pilot" was. I saw the movie and hoped that Stryker would come home; I did not know it was possible for this to continue beyond two hours. <br /> <br /> At the time, would I have understood what so many people hate about the movie now? I doubt it because I do not remember it as such. Do I understand now? Not really to understand the story, it should not be seen from his point of view, but rather from that of the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> If you look as an American, the lack may seem funny. security in a police state ..... but if a subject is in this state, compliance may be expected and security may be less. When things are supposed to be perfect, perfect to an extreme degree, perfect without suspicion, we are not likely to wonder as quickly when things go wrong. <br /> <br /> the films are interesting as the old man who remembers the time but observes his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere. Or that the police state values ​​knowledge to a certain extent, because it pays attention to how it controls or hurts its brain. <br /> <br /> These days, it is likely that we know exactly what the film is talking about before seeing it. so much suspense, the surprise is lost. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the film is a perfect exchange if we consider that this film was made well before the cold war and that the greatest fear of the astronaut is that it was crashed in the USSR. It takes enough distance in the film before it becomes obvious that such a possibility is the least of its problems. <br /> <br /> This is the main difference between "The Stranger" and "Doppelganger". The latter can be considered as timeless since all the comments he has on the USSR are relatively minor and lost at the beginning of the film. In the first case, these links are present throughout the film, supposedly directly at the beginning, then in the form of a variation of theme after each fight. <br /> <br /> That said, despite my memory of the film, it's pretty easy. to see that he would not have done it like a series. Every week Stryker made friends, Benoît hunted, Stryker retired. Finally, Benoît's society would get rid of him. Someone else would take the pursuit. A rut would develop. You may see something new, perhaps another member of the Stryker mission team, but that probably would not be enough for the show to continue. <br /> <br /> If one enters with the knives, it is because others used to reduce the film, there is a good chance that they reduce it too. But if we remember that this was done during the Cold War and what fears and estimates from the other side were at that time, what the popular environment contained for the viewer, then they could find there entertaining themes and intellectuals.
