I was at friends' house for Thanksgiving and I watched a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years (I loved the McMullen brothers) and I was impressed by the quality of this movie. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this film was shot on Super 16. The picture was so good that I felt it was a 35mm shoot. In addition, the music combined with the direction of Fred Carpenter was art. The scenario was original and led to an end that surprised us all watching ... very cool. The role play of the entire cast was good, especially the actor who played, Uncle Benny. He was amazing. This film was a feast for the holidays and I was delighted to be one of the first to watch a movie that many will see in the future.
