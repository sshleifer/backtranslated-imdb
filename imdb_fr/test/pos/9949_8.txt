I remember coming home from school almost every day to watch KTLA Channel 5's monster movies, but I would never run faster at home than when this movie was planned. In a way, the idea of ​​being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend seduced me in a very unique way. Of course, I pretended to be Spiderman, Batman and other superheroes, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sakko in their place. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for 30 years and I still remember it very well. Who can forget how Giant Robot fired missiles from his fingers! Or how about how Ghuillotene threw his nails to make explosions! Damn, I can still whistle the musical theme of the end, so tragic that I remember crying a few times! <br /> <br /> Only another movie has the kind of magic that this movie does in my mind and it's the Wizard of Oz. But I have seen this movie many times since I was a kid. Of course, the Wizard of Oz is a true classic while Space Travel is a low-budget nonsense. These two movies should not even be mentioned in the same sentence, but for a young boy, it's not high production values ​​or continuity that capture your heart, flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> PS My cousin used to make a very accurate impression of Giant Robot (he pronounced it "Giant Robutt".) If you remember, Giant Robot had a special way of fire his missiles and my cousin had coldly. I made him repeat the endless routine for my personal amusement.
