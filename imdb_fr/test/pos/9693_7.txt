This is not the kind of movie that really deserves critical attention. It's not going to win Oscars - it's really not a very good movie at all. Heck, it's not even really a movie - just a series of disgusting, disgusting short sketches that come together to make fun. And although all the critical bones of my body claim the failure of this movie, damn, I'll do a much better score. The kind of people who will appreciate this film are not the kind to worry about what the critics say, so I'm not going to give a sneaky critique of Jackass's surrealist quality of existentialism that permeates and comments on society. .. oh forget that. <br /> <br /> What to say? There is no plot development, no character development - no real beginnings - there is a semi-nice ending that is not as funny as the skit that precedes it, and all the rest of it improper humor in the bathroom that kids laugh at. It's actually quite funny. <br /> <br /> Leave all your preconceptions on a good movie at the door. Jackass: Number two is just a rough shit. That's really all that it is. However, I give this to the filmmakers: they offer some pretty imaginative stuff. You will probably want to go back a few times, wanting to vomit several times, squirming and moving around with discomfort while the people on the screen are deadly and vomiting stunts. Vomit, shit, urine, semen ... practically all body fluids can be seen in Jackass: number two. There is nudity, sexual humor, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's fun. If you are the kind of person who finds this product nice, you will surely really like Jackass: Number Two. I laughed a few times. As I said, it's pretty imaginative. I have never wanted to vomit - even if I have a pretty strong belly. Just accept the principle of the film: a bunch of idiotic guys make strange crap for fun. Once you have passed this, accepted and accepted, you will appreciate it. The only flaw in the movie is the extreme excesses of all this weird and disgusting stuff. There are several very imaginative sketches, very disturbing, but it's very slow in many places as well as in less interesting ones. Towards the end, things get better, but in the middle of the film, the drag damages the overall quality of the film. In a half-hour TV show, it's not a problem, but with a celluloid film, it's inevitable that boredom will come at some point. After a while, the coarse shit just becomes desensitizing. <br /> <br /> Overall, Number Two is a fun, imaginative and mostly disgusting comedy that will leave you feeling pain, nausea and hilarity. Go see it if you must, but hey, if you know you do not like this stuff, do not bother. You will be just disappointed.
