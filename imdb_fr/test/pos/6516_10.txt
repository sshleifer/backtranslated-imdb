I watched this movie a long time ago, but I have always loved it. The story tells the story of a young girl, Sally O'Moyne, who discovers early on that her prayers are answered when she prays to Saint Anne, hence the missing lunch bucket and a nasty neighbor who is watching her. who prays. that someone should give him a black eye for the groping. Well, a minute later, something hits him and he has a black eye. Sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use it wisely. She is well known and loved in the neighborhood because she has notebooks / journals filled with all her requests for friends in Sainte-Anne. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a boy from the area is coming home from university (I think) and Sally is impressed how he grew up. Sally has a crush on him, but is so shy. Should she use her power of prayer for St. Anne's for her own selfish desire or simply watch the school's most popular girls try to trap the man of her dreams? It's a funny movie with such a charming and irish grandfather, hilariously boring brothers and a sworn sworn enemy thirsty for big-pop every day. He has his own story of wanting to buy the O'Moynes property, which is a small house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes (his own), in other words, O'Moynes House is a sore spot for his beautiful buildings. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely worth watching. It is good enough and rare enough to be added to your movie collection. I hope you enjoy!
