I thought it was a very good movie, especially since it was a real charge for me. I was bored, I had it in the library and I really enjoyed myself! I watched it twice in the two days and the more I look at it, the more I love it. I thought the plot was going to be really lame, but in the end, we could really say it would be true. I liked the main characters and thought they were well chosen and you could see the true friendship. I thought they were all doing a great job. The end was good. And you really hate the bad guys and you really like the good ones. What is supposed to be a movie.
