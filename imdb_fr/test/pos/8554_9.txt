I came across this movie while returning channels on the teevee late at night. About twenty years later, he continued to arouse my interest, because of the important lesson he teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And while it tells a true story that unfolds during the Second World War, it is surprisingly about the horrible things happening in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you thought about "ethnic cleansing" as it is called today, it has nothing to do. With race or ethnicity, you will think differently after watching this story. <br /> <br /> I guess I was pretty naive in thinking that evil followed all the prescribed rules. Evil is like evil. <br /> <br /> This film gives a valuable lesson, and I recommend it especially to p. Eg religious groups or civil rights organizations. <br /> <br /> I do not expect it to be too easy to find and rent, but I would really like to see it again, because there is an amazing scene in which gives a totally involuntary glimpse but interesting of the banal complexity of "racial expertise". In this scene, the protagonist, who was taken prisoner by the Nazis at the beginning of the war, is "discovered" by an SS race authority and driven into a room. There, both play a sort of guessing game, where the SS officer is able to determine where our hero (Anthony Quinn's character) comes from - and where his ancestors are from. Well, "come discover" that Quinn's character is not a member of an "inferior" race after all, but on the contrary, he is a perfect Aryan, archtypical! Which does not mean much to the character of Quinn, who is more interested in the cities, rivers and mountains that the SS had just named ... Nevertheless, being a perfect Aryan archetype has its advantages. Among other things, he has to leave his labor in a forced labor factory where he wears striped rags, then in a slave mannequin work where he has to wear tailored Nazi uniforms. Yeah, it's definitely a better job for a guy who has always loved to wear nice clothes ... until the arrival of allied armies, and who recognizes his face from the magazine covers. <br /> <br />
