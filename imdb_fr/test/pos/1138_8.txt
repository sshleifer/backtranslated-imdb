Ten years before "The Matrix" and in full boiling of "They Live", this awesome low-budget science fiction movie was shot. If you like weird, unconventional, intellectual challenges, David Lynch meets director John Carpenter style you will love "Split". There are moments of true genius in framing and cinematography. Watch closely a video shot through wine glasses during an artistic opening night and, just after, a scene featuring memory cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society and wants to wake us from the dream. Similar to "They Live", "1984" and "The Matrix", it is based on the premise that we are all constantly monitored by shadowy Big Brother government agents who know all about us and have invisible robot probes who constantly patrol the city. All of this is revealed early in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker invented a drug that, once placed in the water supply, will wake everyone from the illusion of reality. In addition to cinematography and ingenious resources available to the director to manage his budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues. I challenge anyone not to rewind, memorize and quote the classic quotes from this movie for years to come.
