This heartbreaking tragedy based on a real incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their family by embarking on an outgoing ship. They think that if they succeed in the trip, they can improve their lives by earning enough money in New York to be able to bring their family. Unfortunately for them, the ship they have chosen is a ruined Russian cargo ship, which has already been heavily fined in a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first lieutenant are determined not to let this happen again because their tasks are at stake. The group of blacks begins its journey in the hold and is finally discovered, forced to hide and murdered by his ruthless companion (a performance Sean Pertwee's remarkable.) escape and are ruthlessly pursued across the ship, their lives being lost if they are caught. In short, a fascinating film that will incite the public to bite their nails and cringe, wondering how such events could unfold in modern civilization.
