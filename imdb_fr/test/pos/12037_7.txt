The Turner Classic movie channel spent the month of January shooting the films of one of my favorite actors, Robert Montgomery. His films are mostly rarely seen today, with the exception of those that have been atypical for most of his career - which means that the roles that are often on television are: THEY WERE EXPENDABLE, LADY IN THE LAKE, THE MARRIA JUNE, THE NIGHT MUST FALL, THE CHARMING SAXON, RIDE THE ROSE HORSE, RAGE IN HEAVEN, THE CHICAGO'S OWN (in short, the movies that he fought to get the roles because they were not the usual comics in which he had appeared). It is ironic that nowadays, when one thinks of Montgomery's career, it is the films that were made for the most part after 1937 that are pushed - those who broke the original image that MGM and Louis B. Mayer have thrust. What is a pity is that Montgomery was a talented comedian and saved many movies from the routine. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is one of those films. Made in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and TROUBLE FOR TWO, it was a record year for Montgomery and allowed him to convince MGM to allow him to play "Danny" in NIGHT MUST FALL next. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER takes place in Labrador and Montgomery is a weather station operator in this city, named Dascom Dinsmore. He has lived there for five years and has not accompanied a woman (with the exception of Inuit women) for most of this period. He has a girlfriend named Clara (Winifred Shotter) to whom he has proposed, but it has been two years since he has heard from him, so he believes she has abandoned him. <br /> <br /> The world of Dinsmore is shaken when Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) introduce themselves. They were going to Toronto for a working meeting at which Felton had to go. Felton is betrothed to Campton, but Dinsmore finds her delighted ... and little by little she finds him just as attractive. It is certain that Felton, pompous, important and hopelessly inept, is not a competitor (it is a measure of how Owen plays to keep the character entertaining, even though it is hard to believe that such is a Canadian captain of the industry). <Br /> <br /> There is something unreal in this film - probably due to the original piece. Although the landscape of "Labrador" is rather fictitious, it fulfills its role in the comedy (witness of the sequence of polar bears). But the pinnacle of surrealism is the dinner Dinsmore serves to his guests, a dinner of "pemmican steaks", which Owen eats with real enthusiasm. Owen (a minor noble as a baronet) is dressed in normal clothes - a winter suit for the climate). But Montgomery is dressed in his evening suit (as if he were attending a ball at the embassy). Loy, seeing him dressed, also puts on a dress. They are served by the servant of Dinsmore - the assistant, Inuit Kimo (Otto Yamaoka), who also wears a suit in formal wear - it turns out that it is in Owen! Owen, who had previously insisted that Dinsmore change into clothes more suited to his station, is the only person badly dressed for this dinner !! Montgomery was MGM's most elegant actor, wearing a tuxedo or evening dress (Franchot Tone was his closest rival). It's a film in the film if Montgomery or Fred Astaire was the most elegant figure in such costumes. Hard to decide. <br /> <br /> The course of love does not advance in comedy or drama. Clara arrives (we were warned too early at the beginning of the film when we see her on a ship blocked by ice). Will Dinsmore break with Clara? Will Irene break with Felton? The film is funny and Loy and Montgomery are a beautiful couple. They had appeared together in another movie, and the two were in separate scenes in a second, before that movie. But that would be their last film together. <br /> <br /> One last interesting point: at the beginning of the film, when the credits are shown, you see illustrations of men and women in a comic strip situation. They are based on the artistic work of John Held Jr., the great draftsman / illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s - who was the burner of flapper and "Jazz Age". This is an unusual choice because it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the film or Labrador.
