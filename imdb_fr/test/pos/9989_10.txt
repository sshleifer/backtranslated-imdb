I thought this movie was amazing. I really loved it, even though my brothers did not like it very much. The special effects were outstanding and this movie talks about my favorite sport; Golf. The only thing that has been disappointing about this amazing movie is that it's hard to watch twice or more in a row. This film exceeds absolutely everything I have ever seen. It was all I expected from a movie. I just loved it. It was more child-friendly. This film helped me realize that when you think about it, everything is possible. I would give it a 10/10 pure! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants and the two Pirates of the Caribbean movies together. Absolutely amazing. Love
