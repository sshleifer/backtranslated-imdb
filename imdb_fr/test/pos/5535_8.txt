I am surprised by the number of negative reviews on this movie. If you do not like this movie for what it is - a stupid, stupid and stupid story - then you read too much. This film is a classic tale of a woman from the crowd trying to escape "life" and the troubles that follow her. Michelle Pfeiffer is a great jersey of the 80s. She is a rather uncomfortable and uncomfortable woman in the crowd, while Matthew Modine is a stalking police officer who takes himself to the police. The plot is usually predictable and cutesy and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as the queen of the Mob wives. If you're not looking for something too dynamic and complex, this movie is absolutely entertaining and a cult classic of the 80's. You will not be able to stop watching if you start.
