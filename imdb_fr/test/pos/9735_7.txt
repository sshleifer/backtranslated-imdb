I do not understand all these bad reviews. I think this movie was one of the best in the Puppet Master series. Made with a small budget, we understand why the special effects and the acting are not spectacular, but they are not completely horrible. <br /> <br /> Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma to the role of Andr√© Toulon. He has a lot of potential and I hope to see him again soon. And although the cinematography is not excellent, and the violence and the gore are minimal, this film was very amusing. I'm a big fan of Puppet Master and I was expecting blood and gore from the movies in this series, but I can say that I never got bored throughout the Retro Puppet Master movie. So, if you have the opportunity to see this movie, do not automatically consider it unworthy of your time. Give him a chance. You could love.
