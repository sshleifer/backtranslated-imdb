This film requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on the development of mood and character, the plot is very simple and many scenes take place on the same stage - in the apartment of Frances Austen (the character Sandy Dennis). But the film reaches a disturbing climax. <br /> <br /> The characters create an atmosphere of sexual tension and psychological cunning. It's very interesting that Robert Altman realized this, given the style and structure of his other films. Still, Altman's trademark audio style is obvious here and there. I think what makes this movie really work is Sandy Dennis' brilliant performance. She's certainly one of her darkest characters, but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary. Michael Burns does a good job as a "dumb" young man. Michael Murphy, regular Altman player, has a small share. The solemn and gloomy set is very suitable for the content of the story. In short, this film is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual repression and despair. Be patient, soak up the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written text. <br /> <br /> I congratulate Robert Altman. This is one of his many films dealing with unconventional and fascinating topics. This film is disturbing but sincere and will surely provoke a strong emotional reaction in the viewer. If you want to see an unusual movie - some would even say it's weird - it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find in video stores. You may need to buy it on the Internet.
