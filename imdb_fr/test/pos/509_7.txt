I hope that the summary line will not annoy you much (it's a small tribute to the Chappelle Show / Charlie Murphy, but also to the character of Daywalker). But I will try to put everything I liked about the movie in one paragraph and all that I did not like in another paragraph, so that it is easier to read! <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things! The quotation "strong bloody violence" (used by rating boards to describe the content of a film) is very suitable here. This is not a movie for kids! Or for sensitive souls! character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a story crazy enough to hold / justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are excellent here too. things I did not like The story is too thin. It's enough, as I wrote above, to keep the action scenes together, but there could be more. It's not the best ... it's also the use of clich√©s that does not help Some characters are subscribed ... That's it !: o)
