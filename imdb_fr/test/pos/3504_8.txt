Ali G Indahouse, who usually despises Ali G, was absolutely brilliant. When I looked at him, I was in a hysterical crisis. Yes, it's sexist, rude and extremely rude, and I loved it. As some comedies have only one or two comic scenes, this movie has been laughing forever. I've never seen a comedy as original as Ali G Indahouse. For a comedy starring Ali G, it would be worthy of an 8 out of 10. Absolutely brilliant.
