A city in Japan is seizing an extremely brutal abstract form: the spiral. It becomes a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twists, mentally and literally. This film shows that this happens to several groups of people. Demonic possession is implicit, but nothing is entirely certain except that the best is to get out of the devil. The film is progressing really well, from a normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant and crazy snails) and a real supernatural (walking dead). <br /> <br /> As a jaded American horror movie fan, that was what I needed. Maybe it was just the novelty of a film from a different culture, but it seemed to have a very original progression, a set of characters, and the premise was definitely new. The Japanese may think that the "forms of horror" (uzumaki means "spiral", I'm told) are old, but it was nice for me because I'm used to monster / extraterrestrial movies / viruses / disasters / deaths- living. In an American movie, you know who will die (the annoying / wicked / lascivious / racist characters) and who will live (the children / the heroine / the dogs / the cats / the nice boy). This is not true in Japanese horror. It was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end. In addition, there was this really new (but probably typically Japanese) leached color on a cloudy, cloudy Northwest Pacific day, which was a cool visual effect for me. The horrible moments were really scary, relying on slightly excessive but extremely impossible facial expressions (imagine The Ring) and bodily manipulations. This should be one of the biggest, with ideas once original like the first Nightmare on Elm Street or Night of the Living Dead.
