Lackawanna Blues is a touching story about Nanny, a woman who gives herself to help people in need. This is told from the point of view of a boy, supported by Nanny when his own mother is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> I respect this film for three main reasons: 1) It is moving. but not sappy. It is told in a very real way, without much baggage aggravating stories in Hollywood. And the end is pretty good (crying but not too much). <br /> <br /> 2) Although it's clearly an African-American film, taking place in the black post-segregation community of Lackawanna, New York. he does not wear his ethnicity on his sleeve. The story is based on the strength of the characters and dramas (and comedies) that surround their lives. It's not a preaching, it's just good. <br /> <br /> 3) The soundtrack is excellent (impossible to beat the old-school blues R & B and Chicago). <br /> <br /> Generally, acting is strong, but not universally so. Some of the performances simply do not fit the characters that the actors are supposed to represent. But since it was a movie for television, it was to be expected. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10. Pristine but friendly, good movie for a rainy day.
