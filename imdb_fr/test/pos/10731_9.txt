Kramer vs. Kramer is an almost comforting drama about the radical and shocking increases of the two subjects of a lost married couple. Meryl Streep, a prey to her well-known maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy stay-at-home mom who feels confined to such a role and, in the first five minutes of the film, leaves her husband inattentive, in a fantastic show by Dustin Hoffman. find another role for herself. Hoffman is stunned, not knowing what to do with himself, he took for granted that he did not know what had to be done for his son to go to school in the morning. <br /> <br /> Hoffman perfectly characterizes this husband as such a juicy backhand load. He is agitated, implacable and impatient, but even if the positive side of these three adjectives should include exactly the opposite, he is immutable, fixed on everything he turns his head. He is focused on his career in advertising and when he is forced to raise his son Billy alone, chaos sets in immediately. It is he who throws tantrums and stops furiously in the middle of an activity. After a while, as he befriended his neighbor and Joanna's former friend, played by the sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cooled his jets enough to understand why his wife left. Meanwhile, his overflowing energy redirects to Billy's breeding and he loses his job. <br /> <br /> The battle for the title guard is a brilliantly gray situation. Even if the end is a little unmotivated, subjective for the public, the last line and the last plan still have that touch of spiritual writing that seemed to have diminished after the magical 1970s.
