Funny and scathing criticism of Russian society and culture during the transition from communism, OKNO V PARIZH also shows the West in an unfavorable light. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg ("the window to the west" of Peter the Great) discovers a magical portal that transports them instantly to Paris. Mamin's movie is really hilarious, and just "weird" enough to keep the jaded viewer constantly on the feet. The songs, dream sequences and deliciously disgusting fringes of the society of both cultures blend together to create a memorable and meaningful film. Anyone trying to understand the evolution of Russian cultural sentiments since the fall of the USSR should start here.
