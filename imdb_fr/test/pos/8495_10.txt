This film inspired me to be a better person. In life, you do not know who you are going to meet and sometimes our prejudices make us mistakenly prejudge a person. I learned to give the benefit of the doubt to a person through this film. I also learned that a hard love can build a stronger person. Now, I want to know where to find the soundtrack of the movie. There are songs in this soundtrack that I've been trying to get for years. Can I comment on the action for a second. Jamie Fox was exceptional. Man has become the actor of actors. Plus, Regina King's performance was great. If I can make a woman look at me like she looked at Ray ... I can only dream. I've plucked $ 18.00 for this movie and I do not have a lot of money, but I'm ready to see it again and again. This film touched me.
