I like the phrase "post-war British suburban paranoia" used by one of the critics. He describes so well the kind of films in which John Mills excelled ("The October Man" (1947), "The Long Memory" (1952)) between two "big" images ("Scott of the Antartic" (1948) and "War and Peace" (1956)). <br /> <br /> John Mills plays the role of Dr. Howard Latimer in this "Eric Ambler" style plot, which promises his friend Charles (Invisible) to meet a German actress, Frieda Veldon (Lisa Daniely) at 'airport. Jeffrey Windsor (Lionel Jeffries), a terrifying "journalist", is in his consulting room at that time and offers to take charge, but while tracking down the actress, Windsor informs her that she is already in the car waiting !!! (something fishy is going on !!!) Howard is fired for his appointment and no longer thinks of it. <br /> <br /> The next night, he finds his body when he comes home from work. In addition, he discovers that his friend Charles could not have called him as follows: he is still in New York and Windsor does not seem to exist. Earlier, Mrs. Ambler (Rene Ray), whom Dr. George Kimber (Mervyn Johns) referred to, talks about her recurring dream of finding a cadaver and a brass candle holder with a square base. It's a nightmare for Howard, but of course, when Detective Inspector Dane (Roland Culver) interviews her, she denies having knowledge of the conversation - the candlestick will be found later in Daimler's trunk Howard. <br /> <br /> When Howard is lying down, Robert Brady (Wilfred Hyde-White) visits him. He calls himself "friend" - he has a photo of Windsor that he wants to trade for a box of matches that Frieda gave to Howard at the airport. Howard returns to the apartment, Charles rings and while he is on the phone, an unknown assailant knocks him down and steals the matches !!! Who can he trust - who does not have something to hide !!! <br /> <br /> It's a high-level thriller - not quite in the same class as "The October Man", but with John Mills doing what he does The best - playing ordinary men caught in the trap of impossible mysteries !!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
