This movie could make you crack. The film was well worth the black trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is the only "acceptable" groupie of soap that exists. Her character is so charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness because she is such a blunder. I could even allow myself to lose myself in the adorable fantasy of Bettys, if the real name of Dr. Ravell was George ... And speak of the devil; "spectator" Greg Kinnear fulfills his role very well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) makes you wish his wish come true, Wesley (Chris Rock) makes you want to tie him to a chair. And Rosa (Tia Texada) brings you back to these bright friendships. The sheriff encourages you to give him donuts and lose his name. The rest of the distribution is fine. Never one does the same movie twice, Nurse Betty is the exception. One of those long and cold needs to smile in the winter.
