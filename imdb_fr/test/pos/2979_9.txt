Super movie! The soundtrack is great! Its very relaxing. Elton was ahead of his time, even in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a wonderful job producing and producing this film! The film was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The soundtracks written by Sir Elton compliment the film. T. Rex Morris did a great job with the tenor saxophone on the song "Honey Roll" and the poem "I wanted to do my job today" by Richard Le Gallienne was amazing! Congratulations to everyone involved in this fantastic movie! It was not surprising that many people involved in this film have become the best in their field.
