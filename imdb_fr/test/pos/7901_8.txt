Winner of 26 of the 28 awards for which he was nominated, there is no doubt that this film will be one of the best of 2007. The fact that it was made with non-professionals trained in theater and dance makes it all the more special. <br /> <br /> This is not a Bollywood production, but a matter of art. A low caste girl wants to sing and dance. She wants to progress in society, but there is a limit. Not everyone can be president in India, there is a caste system and narrow minds will not let him rape. <br /> <br /> Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) leaves school at age 15 and goes to work for the boss (Urmila Dammannagari), who was once an accomplished dancer. After working with animals for some time, she learns to sing and dance. The film is strikingly beautiful with a rich color. It's amazing what you can do with $ 20,000, because this film was a master's project for the screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The son of the owner (Karan Singh) returns from America to stand for election and is struck by the girl. But she is an inferior caste and can only be a vessel for her lust. Things are not better at home since his father drinks, eats and steals his money. She gets pregnant and has to sell the baby to the owner. <br /> <br /> Finally, she never goes beyond her caste, but the story was fascinating and the acting was really good.
