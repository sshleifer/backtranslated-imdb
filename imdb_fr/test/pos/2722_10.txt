From "36 Chowringhee Lane" to "15 Park Avenue", Aparna Sen has indeed come a long way. If the first title of the story is a beginner, the latter will certainly occupy a special place as a "mature" film. Until you see 15 Park Avenue, you can not feel moved and moved at the same time. Delighted to see the ingenuity and agility of the director in the portrait of situations seriously difficult and moved by the sensitivity that resonates throughout the film. It's not a film that just makes you feel "how hard it is for schizophrenics to live," but asks you a much deeper question about the reality you see and believe. Sen did a brilliant job in highlighting the supreme fact of our existence that we all try, one way or another, to live in an imaginary world, trying to run after mirages called happiness, peace, contentment. In addition to depicting a delusional spirit, Sen's magic has created many nuances in human relationships, while maintaining stress and tension. The fact that sometimes we all lose our composure, we collapse, we make bad choices, we haunt guilt, we behave in a selfish way, etc., are captured with extreme skill. to have to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and children for herself. And by always acting alongside her sister, always being a strong character, providing support, making judgments, etc., she unconsciously cut off some of the oxygen that her sister needed to flourish. Is not it a very hard truth that sometimes, in an attempt to do the best for someone, we strangle his self-assurance and end up hurting his self-esteem? Of course, the roles of Konkona and Shabana deserve, as always, to be rewarded, because if the ingredients had not been so good, the dish could not have been so extraordinary. Aparna Sen once again directed the masterpiece of a film for those who crave "food for thought". Bravo!
