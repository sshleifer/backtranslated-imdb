"The Man of the Year" tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), a political comedian (like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert), who has his own TV show. On his show, he talks about all kinds of things, but he focuses mainly on political issues that he has a lot of opinions on. One day on his show, a public fan raises the idea that Dobbs should be a candidate for the presidency of the United States. After the broadcast of this episode, millions of people flocked to the Web to launch various petitions and express their opinions on why Dobbs would make an excellent candidate for the presidency of the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run in the presidential elections and sees the election won. Everything seems to be going as planned until a woman named Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) comes forward and starts a controversy about her position. A political thriller both funny and serious follows ?? <br /> <br /> Everyone who enters this film and hopes to see a comedy without brains will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people sell movies when I see how misleading their marketing campaigns are. "Man of the Year" is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from posters to trailers to online ads makes this movie look like a comedy. Honestly, I would say that one-third of the film is funny, while the rest is like a political thriller that presents good arguments and allows its audience to think. In this case, I wonder if the marketing was done on purpose, because this film addresses serious problems between his comedy scenes. <br /> <br /> But enough about marketing, let's go to the movie itself. I really liked "The Man of the Year" even though I was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious movie. This film deserves a lot of credit, is that the film does a decent job, from comedy to drama, although at first it seems a little embarrassing. I really think that after realizing that the film will be more a political thriller than a comedy with which you will feel comfortable. Some people may not think so because they are led to believe that they are watching a comedy and do not understand what this movie is trying to say in the end, but for these people, they may blame the marketers not to promote this film properly. <br /> <br /> "The man of the year" speaks of many things and seems to have a very strong opinion. While Tom Dobbs speaks, he says things that need to be said and does not concern candies. I also think that the whole political sub-plot, even though most critics say the film was hurt probably still because of misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​a computerized vote has been launched in recent years and, given all the problems faced by computers, the problem dealt with in this film could certainly be realistic. Corporate control over voting is also discussed. <br /> <br /> Regarding the role of actor, I think everyone involved did a good job. Robin Williams was lucky to be both funny and serious playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams has exceeded his stay as a comedian, but personally, I still think he is funny and he is also a good serious actor. This is probably one of the rare occasions when we have seen him go from serious to funny and I think it works well. In addition, it's nice to see the co-star of Lewis Black in a decent movie. Once again, I like Black when he appears in The Daily Show and gets up, but most of the movies he went to were terrible. It was a good movie for him because I think his political views were consistent with the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to tell. Laura Linney is a good addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress. Finally, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are both doing a great job, as always with this role that was given to them. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who brought us movies such as "Rain Man", "Good Morning Vietnam" and "Wag the Dog" ". Levinson writes the film very well and realizes it. As I said, a lot of critics did not like the political thriller aspect of this movie, but I thought it was fine. It was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a good job with this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, do not go into this movie hoping to see the movie that the commercials sell you. He had a good laugh but at the same time, he plays more like a political drama. It's not as stupid or stupid as the marketing campaign leads you to believe. I really liked the fact that this movie was a typical Hollywood movie. He tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me. I like the fact that the film does not alleviate the problems and has no typical Hollywood ending. I was trying to call the end from the start, but surprisingly, it did not end as I thought, which made me happy. It's a movie that will make you laugh but a few minutes later you will think and ask yourself what will happen next. I think it's a good movie that will suffer from bad marketing.
