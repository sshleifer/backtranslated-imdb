I went to see this film with caution. Suicidal "comedy" did not seem consistent. Having a brother who tried to commit suicide and seeing the devastation that has caused our whole family, I know first-hand how difficult it can be to solve this problem. I must say - This film deals with allowing the viewer to "introduce" someone who is suffering and who simply does not know why or how to stop it. Although the film is not perfect, it respects the subject treated and, above all, makes it accessible to the masses. I know that for our family, humor has helped us to overcome a lot of suffering. And Max and Grace are what he is supposed to be - a suicidal COMEDY. It's funny - and I also felt that the characters were real and dynamic. It's also extremely intelligent, but simple. It goes hunting and I appreciate that! I give it a 9 and will recommend it.
