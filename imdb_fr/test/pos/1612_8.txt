The controversial novel by Thomas Mann is the basis of the film "A Death in Venice." Although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film, director Luchino Visconti, who also wrote the screenplay, turns him into a composer. As such, the author / composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde), on the brink of mental exhaustion, is an exhausted craftsman. After a long and successful career, now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on holiday to Venice where he hopes to revitalize his decreasing ambition. However, during his stay in the picturesque seaside resort, he captures the attention of a handsome young teenager, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), who looks at him with curious interest and is immediately struck by him. Although Gustav is captivated by the wonderful youth, he still needs to find some time outside the boy's housekeeper (Nora Ricci), as he faces a plague invasion that seems to have plagued the city. The dialogue of film, like the novel remains subtle as are the brief meetings between the boy and the artist. At the end. the public, unlike the book, is embarrassed by innuendo and imaginative flights. Their connection has never been entrusted to a substance, a substance or an opportunity. Without the brief resolution of the book, the film only allows the possibility of knowing what to do. Nevertheless, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment of rest to obtain what is forbidden, elusive but definitely criticized with the indiscreet eye. Beautiful story and a classic Bogarde. ****
