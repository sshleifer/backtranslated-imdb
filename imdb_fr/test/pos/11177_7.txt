Being a big fan of Monkey Island, I ran away that this one would be terrible since Ron Gilbert did not do it. Boy was I surprised! Although it's still not as good as the first two, it contains the comedy I wanted. I was a little worried about the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine and the fact that it's on CD. But everything was set up and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. I particularly appreciated the fact that SWORD FIGHTING came back. And the whole story about looking for the big curved ring was just amazing. Go ahead and try this two CD adventure. And now we can rejoice because Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island will REALLY REALLY come out! This autumn!
