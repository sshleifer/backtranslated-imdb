I had just seen it during a screening, I had not read the book, but I had heard a lot of good things about it. <br /> <br /> The film was absolutely fantastic, very moving. With roller coaster of emotions, you connect completely to the characters. Shaun Toub was great, it was completely different from his usual roles and his role for those who understand Persian / Dari was amazing. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is that Khaled Hosseini really liked the movie that is unusual for the book adaptation movies. Even after watching the film several times, "he was crying". <br /> <br /> The animation of the intro was also exquisite, with names displayed as if it were a Persian calligraphy, quite unique! Sometimes the translation did not convey the message clearly, but overall it was a very good movie.
