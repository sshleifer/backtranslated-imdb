This is the kind of movie you rent when you are incredibly tired or have another disability. a scene where the puppets come alive, where you can see almost a whole hand holding the puppet, moving it. The film appeared to have been filmed with a camcorder. When I saw this movie for the first time, a fight almost broke out when my friends and I called each other names of this film, that's how terrible it was. If you like to get angry at the movies, I recommend it, otherwise, run away as if your life depended on it.
