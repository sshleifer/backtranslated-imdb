There are a lot of movies that we say we have to see twice. In most cases, this is mainly a recommendation: you still understand the film after the first viewing and watch it for the second time helps you to catch the twists you have not noticed. However, for Mulholland Dr., it's different. The sequence that worked for me was this: look the first time - spend a day on the Internet trying to figure out what it's all about - and visualize it afterwards. Otherwise, you probably will not be able to take full advantage of this movie. Then you begin to understand that this piece is ingenious, that the work of the camera is superb and that the aftertaste follows you for weeks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
