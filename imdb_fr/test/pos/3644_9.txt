Fairly decent for his early work and without Kokaku Kidotai without that, and gets a 2-point surcharge for Easter eggs. For Shirow, it's really a step in the ladder. As a fan of Shirow, I am biased but it was a big step forward from Dirty Pair, which I knew about him. Violent fun with a porn soundtrack! You can not help but notice that. I know people like it for Ghost in the Shell ... but all the deep spiritual nuances have been addressed in Appleseed. ESWAT killed terrorists, fighting for humans to remain viable as bioroids eliminate them and Deunan remains lean despite eating junk food. Certainly like the characters even the traitor..and I do not know why.
