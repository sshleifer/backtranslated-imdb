I was surprised how much I appreciated that. Of course, it's a bit slow, but what can we expect from Rollin? In addition, there is a lot of nudity, nothing abnormal, especially since it includes a lot of the beautiful Brigitte Lahaie. There are also dead women spectacularly eroticized, a little more dodgy perhaps, but more effective. There is also a sci-fi scenario with a brief explanation at the end, but that would not bother me too much. No, we have here a very interesting exploration of memory and the effects of memory loss and to what extent we are still "alive" without memory. My DVD cover mentions David Cronenberg, and while he may not be as good as his best films, he has some similarities, particularly with the great use of seemingly threatening architecture and the effective use and scary of the interior space. As I've tried to point out that it's by no means a heart-rending thriller, it's a captivating, nightmare-like film that makes the most of its location, including a gorgeous railroad setting. end.
