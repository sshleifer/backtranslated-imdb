Sublime - perfect - deep - a real lesson on the idealized meaning of life. We are completely caught up in the life story of Martina and Phillipa and <br /> <br /> Babette. Their aspirations, desires and sacrifices resonate well after the end of the film. Seeing it years ago - while gaining a lot of notoriety because of the audacity of its subject - half of the film being a single dinner - the audience was "blood boozed" some of the courses having taken their final form glorious form, laughing at the reaction of the guests, totally seduced by the taste pleasures that Babette presented to them, and totally surprised by the turn of events at the end of the film. After seeing the film years later, after my own adventures, I realized how deep the film was. On this vision, tears flowed freely. The <br /> <br /> meditation of the film on the passage of time and the way it uses a seemingly simple story to comment on life, love, art and generosity are really something to cherish.
