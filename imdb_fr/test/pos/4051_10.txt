In the middle / late 80's, an FVO anime by the title "Bubblegum Crisis" (which, in my opinion, is a term of military slang denoting the moment when the technical equipment gets scared) has debuts on video, drawing inspiration from "Blade Runner", "The Terminator" and maybe even "Robocop", with a hint of Batman / Bruce Wayne - Iron Man / Tony Stark and the feminine power of Charlie's Angel for good measure. Since 8 episodes, the general story is that in the twenty-first century, in Tokyo, Japan, between 2032 and 2033, living machines called Boomers performed manual work and sometimes caused problems. A special SWAT-like police, the Advanced Police (AD Police) was formed to handle the baby boomers, but remained ineffective, pushing millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, daughter of the scientist who created the boomers, to create four armor. of motor combat (hard combination) to be worn by women to fight the baby boomers and the demonic society that has produced the boomers, GENOM. This group is known as Knight Sabers and, in addition to the band's leader, Sylia, her ragged rebel group included Priss Asagiri, a rock'n'roll wrestling with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain. for the cops, Linna Yamazaki, aerobic instructor looking for money and tending to get through friends, and Nene Romanova, a young ADP officer and expert hacker (the first in a long line). GENOM, meanwhile, is represented by Quincy, a tall, lanky old man who owns the company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and a shocking man named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two police detectives AD (Leon appeared in an animated film / pre-movie titled "AD Police Files" which I had heard was very dark), their leader, chef Todo, overweight and overweight, Sylia's younger brother, Mackey. and a funny little mechanic known as Dr. Raven, who apparently helps Sylia maintain the costumes. In addition to the global story of Knights Sabers & Police AD ​​VS GENOM, there was also another story involving a friend of Linna who was apparently a girl in a big family of the big crime family, the boring Largo trying to seize GENOM, and various Priss-will-revenge-story of a minor character. Oh, and did I mention that there were hints that Sylia herself might have been a boomer? Well, it was an excellent watch, full of chaos and chaos and even very nice pop songs, but it was not without its faults, some of which, unfortunately, were due to the fact that the series was interrupted after the episode 8, whereas it was initially planned for 13 episodes in total. Thus, some stories, such as the project (s) of Largo, the family of Linna's unfortunate friend and the origins of Sylia, have never been resolved. Another problem with the series was that at the time Priss was the most popular character, so a good part of the series was focused on her and, unfortunately, most of the Priss-focused episodes focused mainly on Priss, who was seeking justice / revenge for some. a secondary character who had never been before, but who was her friend, but she rarely went out of her way for her, the Knight Sabers, who always saved her from trouble and who, for some reason, cared a lot about her. to be fair (just to be fair though, she went to Linnaan's rescue in episode 7, and her boyfriend was killed by a baby boom and the ADP acted badly in the investigation). This means that we have not really been able to focus on Sylia's more interesting story, or even the daily antics of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes directed around her, which concerned her friend with the mafia family, while Nene managed to catch the last episode for herself, which showed that her eternal good humor was really good morale and not a distraction. . Nene was also able to take advantage of her computer skills, or sometimes she simply acted like an adorable blunder, which gave her a time slot and an evolution of her character superior to those of poor Linna, who was often put to the test. background with only her. greed and his tendency to eat boyfriends to attract him. Do not get me wrong, I like that and I like the overall concept of it all, but it pissed me off. It's also one of those finalists for the "worst English dubbing" of all time, which means you'd better stick with the Japanese. Some voices were acceptable (some really matched the personality of their characters), but others were simply flat and without passion or, in the case of Priss, really excessive. <br /> <br /> Well, the Tokyo 2040 is coming and pretty much throws it all out the window. After a few years, the GENOM boomers turned the city into an old paradise, after the earthquakes erupted in Tokyo, except that they still tend to fly away, prompting AD police to train, followed by knights are forming. So, the general story is the same, but the background of the characters, as well as their appearance and their attitude, have changed a lot. <br /> <br /> 1) Originally, Sylia had short purplish black hair and brown eyes. dressed like a businesswoman fit and stern and away from others. 2040 Sylia looks more like a supermodel, dressing more provocatively and having white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (the range goes from blue to violet to silver and eyes sometimes look purple or gray) and also in 2040, Sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who loses her sense of conduct when she is not in public and who perhaps keeps even more secrets than before. Moreover, Sylia does not take as much risk on the battlefield as she is more of a kind to stay here, but she fights when she has to. <br /> <br /> 2) Originally, Priss was a small, very afro-humble woman who was arguing with people who offended her, who always bit more than she could bite her. etc. 2040 However, Priss has taken the path of Clint Eastwood's solitaire - very cold, very stoic and emotionally aloof (more like the original Sylia, you would say), so she's really attached to no one. In addition, her hair is more like stripes and cats (a big improvement) and she is covered with leather like Trinity of "The Matrix" (although much less annoying than before, unfortunately, the writers have screwed her up in the end by revealing his reasons, hating the ADP). <br /> <br /> 3) Originally, Linna had those big dark hair that attracted her, but now her hair is shorter, browner, and more like the 90s. 2040 Linna is also an office worker who has the misfortune to be sexually harassed. As if to apologize for the way she was treated by the writers of the FVO, the writers of 2040 actually devoted the first 6 episodes to Linna, writing it as a new countrywoman in the city but determined to meet the Knight Sabers and win a place with them. what she ends up doing. <br /> <br /> 4) Originally a little girl with red hair who was often ridiculed and who ate a lot of candy, Nene is now a little girl with blond hair who likes to tease and take punches to Inspector ADP Leon McNichol (a revenge for him playing in the OAV?) and other characters, even his alternate big sister, Linna and Mackey, Sylia's "brother", with whom she is enthusiastic. Cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of sweets and is a master hacker, but she eventually deflates and grows beyond her comic relief status. <br /> <br /> 5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic and robust man with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul from Highlander on TV), he replaces Dr. Raven from the previous series and now serves as a man in defense of the hard tailors of Sylia. Nigel is also Sylia's lover, but you would not know him by his behavior. He is a bit of Mackey's father / big brother / mentor. <br /> <br /> 6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course differently. The original Leon was a tall and handsome boy built like a baseball player with brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, narrow blue jeans and always fitted with a revolver that could hold more than one whallop by magic only by magic; Although he was not really a bad guy deep down, he was more of a fool, but he mostly served comic relief, as he tried to pursue Priss in a romantic way (what he saw in her is a mystery), but from time to time he and Daley served as informational guides for the important points of the plot. In addition, the original Daley was a pretty muscular redhead dressed in pink / purple, as he was an extremely homosexual character who always made fun of Leon when he did not provide important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a handsome boy, but rather a sturdy man, with spiky black hair, brown eyes, big and sporty muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (he looks a little like Arnold Schwarzenegger, or maybe a pumped Colin Farrell, or Hugh Jackman), and he still carries a revolver, a big one, but he's not as powerful as before. Although 2040 Leon still has an attitude problem (especially when approaching Priss), he is not as staggering as in the old series, but he has a bad temper and he is easily thwarted by Nene and Daley. (He drinks too much coffee too). Oh, and Leon is still after Priss, but he's a lot luckier this time around. Daley, meanwhile, is now a bigger boy (with a red mount, a white suit, green eyes and light brown hair), and he carries a big machine gun (he looks like James Marsden of X-Men movies); Daley is much smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the FVO, and although it is not entirely clear, his homosexual tendencies have almost completely disappeared, except for a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears talk about Leon inquiring about Priss's email. <br /> <br /> 7) Brian J. Mason (what does this "J" mean?) is back, as is Quincy, but Mason is much more the main villain here, with Quincy as co-wicked, as he is no longer an imposing terrorist, but a vegetable with a battery of batteries and wires connected to him. Mason now wears brown and brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the OAV (he actually looks like the OAV Leon in a suit) and he is very well from the school of the wicked Alan Rickman. <br /> <br /> 8) Although perverse in the first series, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, there are many different things about Mackey in 2040, but they will not be revealed here. <br /> <br /> 9) Sylia now has a mate, a guy named Alfred-the-Butler named Henderson, who worries about her and the gang. <br /> <br /> 10) In the original series, the baby boomers looked like Replicants of "Blade Runner". , armed with their own thoughts, feelings and ambitions, but in 2040, they are more of a monster idiot type on the rampage. Most of the time, they are just big robots doing everything they are programmed for (hard work, fighting, cleaning, etc.) and they have the tendency to "get naughty", which means trying to evolve and become a monster. in the process. <br /> <br /> What remains of the same theme as humanity against technology (machines do they have a soul?). Unfortunately, this series, although well animated and well written, contains only 26 episodes. She moves faster than we could like, especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters. Unfortunately, it always ends. on a cliff support with unresolved plot pieces (which I will not discuss here.) What records this show and in fact what it is is the characters, a colorful group of ball screws that they are, ranging from stoic solitaries, psycho women, genocides mad men, rough cops, sardonic intellectuals, wise old wise and innocent adorables, much more diversified than before and with much more to do, they are enough to make you wish that this show lasted longer. <br /> <br /> It's not great, but it's a good watch. The English dub (by ADV) is pretty good, although not without a few flat dots, but certainly better than the original dub.
