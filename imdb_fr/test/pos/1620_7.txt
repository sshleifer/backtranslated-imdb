Like many films of this kind, my non-Catholicism prevented me from understanding it. The church has this mass of rules that have been put in place over the centuries. We have little time to learn them and have to accept them for cash. Then invite villains who take revenge for a distant act against them, who respect these rules and try to circumvent them, and you have this book and this film. I found myself thinking, "That's pretty cool, why did they do that?" There is this casual thing in Robert Langdon's character where, no matter the problem, he always seems to be making the right first step. I guess it's like watching CSI, where they solve incredibly complex cases in a few days. They know the configuration of the earth. In this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that's going on. But if you create Robert Langdon, you have to put him to work. It's good because the heroic nerds like him saved the day forever. I thought the movie was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. It's a marvel to watch and never stops for a second.
