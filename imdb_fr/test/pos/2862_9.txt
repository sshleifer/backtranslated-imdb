Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave Theater in Plainfield, Indiana, I was not expecting much. I went to this movie only because I thought it was a WWE film that would make you laugh. Then I sat down and looked and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the most bizarre types on the big screen (much worse than Freddy or Jason in my opinion) and has a big advantage over other movies that attract me to a horror movie. This shows Jacob Goodnight as a human person. He has a heart, no matter how twisted and scary he is. He feels pain, something that Jason never does or never seems to show. He feels grief and pleasure, again, both crazy that you will notice if you see the movie. Overall, it's a different experience than many cutters, which surprised me in many ways, like those who lived in the end.
