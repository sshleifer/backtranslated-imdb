It looks like the writer Robocop has looted The Vindicator wholesale. It's a very solid horror / action movie about a man set up in an accident to be used in a cruel experience. Everyone who has seen Robocop knows the story. Beware of Pam Grier, a crazy and damn good-looking assassin. This highly effective, violent and bloody horror movie may not appeal to everyone, but this Canadian release deserves to be sought by all fans of the genre. 8/10
