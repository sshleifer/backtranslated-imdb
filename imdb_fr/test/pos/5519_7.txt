I saw this film on my local cable system under the title "Beyond Redemption". I was looking for new material to watch because most of the reruns on Saturday morning did not interest me. I have always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this film. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Personally, I enjoyed the movie. Rich Roesing, who commented that the film had been spoiled by seeing scenes from the film on the back of a video rental box, is perfectly justified. I did not have the disappointment of knowing anything about the movie in advance. This led me to give the movie a score above the average rating on the page. <br /> <br /> I like thriller movies, and this one is no exception. The film let me guess until the end. I was surprised by the end! <br /> <br /> The moments of reflection and remembrance of the main character's past experiences during the film only added to the suspense. His reactions to these memories gave the film an idea of ​​the humanitarian, but conflictual, nature of police work. The struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies, but also movies that expose the feelings of the character, his side of personal inflection, this film is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this film on the guide of your local cable or satellite TV system, watch it! <br /> <br /> However, if you're looking for a rental video, follow Rich Roesing's advice and have someone get it. for you before watching.
