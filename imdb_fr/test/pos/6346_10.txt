I saw Lonesome Dove, Dead Man's Walk and The Streets of Laredo, and now The Return to Lonesome Dove. If you are hungry after watching Lonesome Dove, it will fill your belly. Beautiful distribution, beautiful story. Most definitely a second close to Lonesome Dove. I will buy this movie to add to my collection. It's the best, or at least my favorite Jon Voight performance. He is captain call. Lou Gossett Jr. playing Isom Pickett is not someone I'm kidding with, he's bad with perspective. William Peterson is also doing a great job. Rick Schroder is back in the role of Newt with an anguished performance that reminds me of his time at NYPD Blue. My only problem with this film (and it's really bad) is that I felt Call wanted to be "the first man to graze cattle in Montana," and it's obvious that Dunnigan was already there for a long time. A bit incoherent, but easily forgotten because you get lost in the fantastic tale. I particularly like the apparent growth of characters from Jasper Fant and July Johnson. I have watched this movie many times and am ready for another sequel.
