(WARNING - CONTAINS SOFT SPOILER) A film almost designed to make you pause and check your memories - it's confined to an almost empty motel where the big yard looks like a circus ring and the rooms seem like retreat points temporary rather than shelters; As the characters become more and more preoccupied with the past, the present becomes weaker and weaker, until the Countess's ultimate incendiary appearance in the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether their stories are true or not, and that Stanton really is the father or just a crazy old man entering their stories, seems impossible to determine. The theme seems to be how the love of an extreme and inconsiderate nature disturbs stability to the point that reality itself collapses; where the exotic and misplaced fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. The image of the motel on fire, symbol of dislocation assaulted by destruction, is a strange end for this strange but effective film, an astonishing imagination.
