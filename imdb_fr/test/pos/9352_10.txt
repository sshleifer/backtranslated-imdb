What a beautiful movie! Unfortunately, from 1947, the film's script could not have followed the book from which it had been adapted, but the murder of a homosexual would have been too difficult to handle at that time. <br /> <br /> I thought everything was fine. the performances were exceptional, as well as the script, the production, the brilliant cinematography in black and white, the music and the atmosphere of film noir. <br /> <br /> I understand that in 1947 the film can not describe racism against blacks or prejudices against homosexuals. (The story of Robert Young's prejudices against his grandfather, who was Irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago, was rather lame, but at the time the film required the film to avoid a deeper examination of racism.) <br /> I have an observation and a question to ask the viewer: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young had not aimed his weapon when he shot and killed Robert Ryan who ran fast in the dark and that Young fired from the window of an upper floor in the dark without aim? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was shot in 1947) and Young was 40, the timing would not make sense. If the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago, the delay would be realistic.
