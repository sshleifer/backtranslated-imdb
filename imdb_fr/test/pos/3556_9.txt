I almost did not see 'Hi-De-Hi!' I think it must be the title that turned me off. At that time, the Welsh language editions of "The Radio Times" only used titles of certain programs without giving any information about their content. 'Hi-De-Hi!' suggested me a bad quiz led by Leslie Crowther or, worse yet, a useless US import. But I managed to catch up with an episode later, and I was surprised to find it written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. <br /> <br /> As was the case with "Dad's Army" and "This is not a hot mom" Perry based on his personal experiences, in this case his stay in a holiday camp Butlins. Before the arrival of low-cost air travel in the 1960s, these camps sprang up along the British coast, providing entertainment for working-class families and generating millions for their owners. <br /> <br /> one of those camps in the 80s as a chef - Barry Island, South Wales - known as 'Shag Land' for reasons I will not go!) /> <br /> Established in the late '50s, it all started with academician Jeffrey Fairbrother (Simon Cadell) as Maplin's director of entertainment, a job for which he was unprepared. comic resident Ted Bovis (Paul Shane), his sidekick Spike (Jeffrey Holland), miserable Punch and Judy, Mr. Partridge (Leslie Dwyer), posh ballroom dancers Barry (Barry Howard) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves) Diane Holland) and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc), who coveted Fairbrother at every opportunity Bubbly Su Pollard still stole the show as a housekeeper, Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose ambition was to become a "cloak" "All the important staff members wore them.) A number of sexy girls have These cloaks, such as "Sylvia" by Nikki Kelly and "Betty" by Rikki Howard, were also used. We have never seen Joe Maplin, the owner. He communicated to his collaborators in the form of non-grammatical missives that poor Jeffrey was obliged to read aloud. "Hi-De-Hi!" was the greeting of the campers, usually met the equally stupid 'Ho-De-Ho!' <br /> <br /> A late fan, Sir Fred Pontin, told Perry and Croft that he had recognized most of the real-life characters. <br /> <br /> I always found that Bovis was the most convincing of these. as well as the most tragic, like Archie Rice, he was the actor whose breakup never arrived, reduced to spoiling nerdy gags for the greater amusement of drunk spectators of the night. He took advantage of his position to take advantage of some advantages and, in a memorable episode, Fairbrother's patience broke and he dropped it: "Lie, Ted, all the lies!" <br /> <br /> Like all the other Perry / Croft series, the cast was excellent, especially Cadell and Shane. Gladys, the daughter of Ruth Madoc, pissed me off (no wonder Anne Robinson hates the Welsh!), But Leslie Dwyer's "Mr.Partridge" misanthrope and Felix Bowness's "Fred Qulley" jockey were more than rewarded. <br /> <br /> Everyone remembers this visual gag that Mr. Partridge is drunk on seeing a pantomime horse riding a real horse along the beach. Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stay with her and instead throw the banana he had eaten! <br /> <br /> With its sparkling blend of 1950s nostalgia and cheeky gags, 'Hi-De'Hi' was a big hit for BBC-1 in the '80s, resulting in a massive increase in bookings for Butlins and Pontins. It slipped when Cadell left to return to the theater. I never named his replacement, Squadron Leader Clive Dempster (David Griffin). Worse, the death of Leslie Dwyer deprived the show of one of his best characters. Kenneth Connor was invited to replace him with "Uncle Sammy". <br /> <br /> The adjustment of the period was sometimes problematic; in one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy who, for some reason, was disguised as a shark. The revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that time. Yet, they looked good in them so who complains? In another film, Ted sang Tom Jones' hit 'Delilah' for campers. It was composed (among others by Les Reed and Barry Mason) only in 1968. <br /> <br /> Maplins closed in 1988 and the last blow was that of Peggy (now a Yellowcoat) , alone in the camp. , jumping up and screaming (what else?) 'Hi-Hi!' <br /> <br /> I do not like it as much as the other series of Perry and Croft, but its popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate huge public affection, mainly because it featured friendly characters in a recognizable setting. Good evening campers!
