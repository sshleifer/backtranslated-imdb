finally, a film that deals with the probability of extraterrestrial visits with the appropriate affectionate depth and warmth. Just in case we are not alone, I think these visitors are too touristy to take care of us or to give this pile of anthropocentric blunders a steady proof of their existence. we would not interfere in the battle rites of a restless tribe of the desert, unless we wanted to play with our travel insurance, right? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film describes the transient investment of a tired mind and body by a superior entity. it's not very spectacular and quite unknown, but we're dealing with a movie here, right? The hospitalization of prot is therefore only a trigger for the plot. <br /> <br /> Jeff's bridges behave as usual, but the space is hilarious. the role seems to him perfectly adapted, convincing and lovingly "crazy". eat unpeeled bananas, sit in a tree, give your doctor difficult moments with speed, wisdom and (especially!) great quotes. They made me think and philosophize for hours. <br /> <br /> This is an encouraging film, to say the least, and Edward Shearmur's soundtrack is simply beautiful. just go get a copy. catch a beam of light. now.
