I am torn about this show. Although most of the items I found were HILARIOUS, other parts seemed stupid and just shocking for shock. The shifted parody of some of the caricatures is brilliant, as are many scenes with children. However, I do not think it is smart to make small children say rude things. It's not that I think "oh poor kids, they are exploited" - it's just that it's really not smart !! Anyone can do it, which makes it as simple and useless as making a paper plane. In order to make this show better, they should stick to the children's natural responses, which I think can be funnier than what was written at the time. <br /> <br /> By far the funniest part of Wonder Showzen is Clarence, the blue puppet who marvels in the streets talking to annoying strangers. It's really funny and it's mostly improvised. To see him in a long scene about the importance of patience, to test the patience of an extremely patient man, was by far the most amusing scene in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But you should watch this show because on the whole, it's very funny, even if it's sometimes stupid.
