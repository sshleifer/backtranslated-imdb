Although many call it movie B, it's a well-written, well-done comedy. Red Skelton is great, Wally Benton is better known to radio fans than The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fianc√©e, Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very well-rounded criminal gang. I read a story in this movie where it is written that Vincente Minelli directed this film, unless it is now called S. Sylvan Simon, who directed the three films of the Fox. It's a very entertaining film made when the imagination was encouraged. So overcome your prejudices in black and white if you have one, sit back and enjoy a really great comedy. It was also the main role of Red. Take note during the climax of the reference to Orson Welles' show War of the Worlds.
