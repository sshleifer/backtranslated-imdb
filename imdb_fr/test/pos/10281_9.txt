Beautiful, original, beautiful movie. The acting is great, the settings and scenery are superb (Paris at its best - but then the real Paris, not the famous settings) and the music will also. A brilliant story, very detailed, that I really like. <br /> <br /> The best French film I've seen (and French cinema is very good)!
