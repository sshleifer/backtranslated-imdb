I just bought a DVD on Zhan (Out of Time) and it's a great movie, I have to say. Not really action packed, in terms of the game of weapons, but definitely exciting and spiritual. I do not think I saw Andy Lau in better shape. And the editing of this film was very well executed. Go watch this now if you're a fan of Lau or HK Thiller / Action Movie!
