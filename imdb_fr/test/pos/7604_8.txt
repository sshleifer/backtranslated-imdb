This film turned out to be pretty much what I expected. Of course, it's shabby, of course, it's predictable. We all know the fairy tale. But knowing that when you go to watch it, it's pretty nice to watch. It was funny and nice. I found it boring to show that the geeks were either kids who do not wash their hair, or kids who love mathematics and join math clubs and wear math t-shirts. In high school, I was excluded and I did not do these things. It goes much further than that. Many things depend on your money, your desire to hide your identity, and the nastiness with other children. In any case, I will not enter it. I do not agree with other opinions that Drew is not convincing as a geek. With suspenders, no makeup and unwashed hair, I do not think too many people would drool it. And even when she returns to high school and gets rid of these things. She always wears "bad" clothes, "bad" hair and has the "bad" attitude to be considered cool. And her other friend "geek" can be beautiful but whatever, where I come from, you can always be excluded and be beautiful. (inside and outside)
