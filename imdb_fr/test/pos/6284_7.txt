I think it's Pauly Shore's best thing, he played the perfect role. I really enjoyed this movie. Patrick Renna is really funny as an annoying little brother. Her In Law is a good comedy that deserves your time, but the only thing I wish for Tiffany Thiessen is the farm girl instead of the one she had.
