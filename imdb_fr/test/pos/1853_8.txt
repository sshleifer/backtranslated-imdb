When I saw the trailer of this movie, I said to anyone in particular that "this movie will explode". I also said that about THE MATRIX and look at what happened there. Now, I'm not a box office guru, but I usually have a good idea of ​​what's going to be good and what's really going wrong. In this case, I was blinded by my total and absolute apathy towards David Duchovney. Let me tell you otherwise: I do not like his as a person (from what I read from him in interviews, he is incredibly pre-Madonna and he is full of him- even, since he only made X-Files) or as an actor. PLAYING GOD was a very bad movie, but he came to think that for some reason he deserved a lot of money on the big screen. But I'm happy to say that even though these things can always be true about the man, Return To Me is delightful and has his heart in the right place. Bonnie Hunt had a great story and she told it with class and grace. This is one of the most romantic movies I've seen and although it may seem a little sad and mudlin in its premises, give it a chance and you'll be addicted. <br /> <br /> It must be said (and it hurts me to do that) that this movie works so well because of the story and the cast. Duchovney and Driver are so wonderful and believable that I honestly wanted to cry with them. There is a particularly powerful scene when Duchovney returns home after the death of his wife and collapses on the floor of his house. As always, the family dog ​​looks out the door to wait for his wife to enter. She does not do it and with her shirt collar still stained with blood, Rob (Duchovney) tells her that she will not go home, ever. He then calls the dog towards him and they seem to share a cry together. The dog lets out a small moan and Rob cries. And it's one of the most realistic moments of pain I've ever seen in any movie character. You can feel his pain and at that moment, I forgot to look at an actor I do not usually like, and I felt that I was looking at someone whom I knew was crying the loss of his beloved . It's powerful. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the film is the support cast. Bonnie Hunt has combined an ethnic mix of Irish and Italian characters who share a common bond. They share a pub called O'Reilley Italian Pub. It's a delicious name all by itself. Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia lead the diametric scale of cultures in conflict. They are two proud old men who love their homeland but who love their granddaughter and their niece respectively (I think that's the case). And this is the character played by Minnie Driver. This scenario is conducive to comedy and Hunt lacks nothing here. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share fun moments as a middle-aged married couple and Belushi gets the best points while accepting humility with grace and showing off his wide bole. stomach to laugh. With his family of three or four children, he has very little time for himself and his wife to spend quality time. And again, Hunt handles this with perfect elegance. <br /> <br /> It's a great story to find true love, knowing how lucky you are to have the true love and power of friendship and family. Return To Me is a wonderful love story and although I still do not have much admiration for David Duchovney, I must admit that he was perfect in this role and I could not imagine anyone else play his character. He was sensitive and credible and the film was good because of him, not just because of him, but he certainly added to the flavor. <br /> <br /> If you are fond of good relationships and want a good cry, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10 I'll see all that Bonnie Hunt publishes with her in the director's chair.
