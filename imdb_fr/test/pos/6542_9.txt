It is a high-level automotive film (a work of art / YER a work of art!) All classic cars without fantastic plastic, I watched it again and again, I used two video cassettes, and I will wear many more. Many more car enthusiasts, young and old, will love this movie & watch it more than once! then rent it or buy it (just see it). I wish they would make more movies (cars) like this one. The V8 is not fed with turf by hand. (motor magic) (the chariot pile) <br /> <br /> (you have to learn how to feel the power)
