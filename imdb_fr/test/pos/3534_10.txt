In 1981, Just Before Dawn is one of the best horror stories in the desert. He is one of the best slashers of the '80s and he easily shoots movies like Final Terror, Do not Go Forest, or Prey Out of the Water. <br /> <br /> A group of young adults come to discover the mountain property that one of the members of the group has just bought. However, they are not alone in nature. A big murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is hiding and apparently hating intruders. <br /> <br /> Director Lieberman, who has given us great B-movies such as Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), is also doing a great job with this clever thriller. The film is pleasantly atmospheric, with a sense of creeping tension and a strong suspense. This film gives a frenzied impression of claustrophobic even in the wilderness. The places in Oregon are beautiful and well captured by cunning cinematography. The score is a real original and impressive in contrast with the scenic visuals. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson takes a big lead, her presence was captivating. Gregg Henry delivers a good performance as Benson's lover and Chris Lemon provides an occasional charisma. The actors, especially the veteran Kennedy, are also doing very well. <br /> <br /> A true jewel of the slasher genre, which does not need to be gore. Well worth looking for slasher fans and horror buffs. See! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 on ****
