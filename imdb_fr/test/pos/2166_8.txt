Black Scorpion is Roger Cormen's Batman. Which is cool and there are a lot of cool things in this movie. As Breathtaker is a cross between Doctor Doom and Darth Vader, it's pretty cool. The mental control gas contained in the inhalers was worthy of Mad Hatter. The Cormen B-movie style is everywhere on this puppy that is not always a good thing. There are many waterfalls and hot babes that will delight action fans. This film, the good weighs the bad. But if you are not a fan of comics, I would advise you not to watch Black Scorpion. However, if you like comics like movies and do not care if it was a comic book before. Then take a look at BLACK SCORPION, for me, I give him 8 STARS.
