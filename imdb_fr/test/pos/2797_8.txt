As a European, the film is a nice step back for my student time in the 1980s and the experiences I've lived abroad and in interaction with other nationalities, even if the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982 to 1985, so you'd think he's taking advantage of that experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the film balances the message that "we must not generalize" with the notion that "for each stereotype, there is an underlying truth". For example, the Italian character is more based on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype. The German character presents some more tried and true stereotypes. But the most stereotyped aspect of the film is not a character but the central theme of infidelity. As one critic has observed, infidelity is at the heart of French film, just like the class in British cinema. <br /> <br /> The main character and his girlfriend are played in an unfriendly way, which, in my opinion, is deliberate and remarkable. This may be unintended, but some nationals of some countries have elements that could be interpreted as a metaphor for their country's perceived role in the EU. The British woman meets an American (who is an artist - in the manner of an American president of the 1980s), while the French presents himself as the natural leader (when the owner appears). <br /> <br /> Although Europe is not as diverse as New York, it is striking that we only see two non-white characters. One of them is a Chilean woman with indigenous features, who despite the age of our main character is not described as an object of potential interest. Another is a Gambian-Spanish or Gambian-Catalan man who seems a little invented. <br /> <br /> One might wonder why Klapisch chose protagonists, all of whom came from long-established European countries, members of the EU. Although these nationalities reflect what we would like to meet as students in the 1980s, I think exchange programs in contemporary Europe are much more diverse. The Erasmus program includes some 30 countries, from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not EU members. I understand, however, that the choice of nationalities better known to the majority of television viewers may have been deemed necessary to avoid distracting the contrast that Klapisch wishes to create between Europe of peoples and bureaucratic Europe. <br /> <br /> Despite minor inconveniences, it's a good film that made me consider returning to live in Europe. One of my French friends, also an expatriate in the United States, captured our common feelings in this contradiction: "If Europe looked more like the United States, I would leave without hesitation".
