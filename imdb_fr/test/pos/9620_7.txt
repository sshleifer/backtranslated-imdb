The film "The Five Fingers of Death" by Hong Kong director Chang Chang Ho (1972) is widely regarded by a large number of film experts and by kung fu film fanatics as the martial arts film that has all started. <br /> <br /> In 1972, "Billy Jack" (1971), with his famous confrontation at Hapkido Park in the park, was published. This is the second phase of the three-step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts films in the West. The year before, Bruce Lee starred in "Enter the Dragon" (1973) two years later, consolidating the place of martial arts films in Western cinema. <br /> <br /> But what makes the delirium around "Five fingers of death"? The film, with its terrible dubbing, its explosive action sequences (if not highly improbable) and its technical flaws, has quite a plot, even if it is very thin. Chih-Hao (late Lo Lieh) is a young and dedicated Chinese gong-fu student, selected to represent his school at a future martial arts tournament. His teacher offers him to train himself in the fighting style "Iron Fist", a style so deadly that he could very easily kill a man in one fell swoop. <br /> <br /> In addition, Chih-Hao The arrival at the school coincides with a violent conflict with a rival school, its students and a trio of heavy hitters and murderers of Japan. Before you know it, a major setback threatens Chih-Hao's formation and ability to represent his beloved school at the next tournament. <br /> <br /> Let me say that "Five Fingers of Death" is actually the film that started everything. As mentioned by another viewer, "Five Fingers of Death" has established many standards in martial arts films over the next three decades - Asian, European and North American martial arts films. These standards include the dedicated student, the learning of patience and endurance, conflicts between rival schools, the intense ethnic animosity between the Chinese and the Japanese, and the learning of a struggling system for this. good old action movie: revenge. "Five Fingers of Death" would also have a major influence on the films "Kill Bill" by American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino (Tarantino borrows quite generously from this project, among others, as you know). <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, since it's a martial arts film from the early 1970s, the best of which is Lo Lieh. As an atypical martial artist, his performance is quite innovative, but at first glance, you would not really know it because of the way this arc of character has been destroyed over and over over the years. He is very humble in his game, doing all he can to persevere against his enemies and not fight them in anger or stoop to their level of stupidity or arrogance. Moreover, when he suffers his major setback, your heart sinks a bit because it is so brutal and you wonder if he will recover enough to achieve his ambition of a lifetime. <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers of Death" is a classic in every way. This is by no means perfect, and viewers would be foolish to expect something of the caliber of "Godfather" martial arts movies. What it offers you is the ultimate example of Eastern body-to-body combat since the days when Oriental cinema had become a major event in the West. <br /> <br /> 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS: "Enter the Dragon" Bolo Yeung also appears as a Mongolian street fighter at the beginning of the film.
