My interpretation is that the term "distant" is used in the opposite sense to "warm"; people who are not hot with others. The film reminds me of the teachings of the Dalai Lama in "The Art of Happiness", where his essential point is that the key to happiness is the connection with others. Not only are the characters in the film insular, but they are also humorless, unattractive, timid, calm and unfriendly. These characteristics seem to prevent them, among other things, from forming and appreciating their relationships and being able to talk about their problems and solve them. And as a result, they are terribly unhappy. I see this as a strong justification for the teaching of the Dalai Lama (I am not a Buddhist by the way). If you are one of those who think that their behavior is a natural reaction to life in a big city, I think you may be right, but I recommend the Dalai Lama's book. City life is not necessarily the same thing. <br /> <br /> I understand why some people find this boring: it's a bit of a drag in some places and the characters are not particularly nice. And this contrasts with Lost In Translation where the island characters are much more friendly and connect to each other even if they do not connect to people in general.
