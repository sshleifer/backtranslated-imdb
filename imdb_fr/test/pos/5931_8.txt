Probably the best Royal Rumble in years. <br /> <br /> Match 1 sees Edge beat Shawn Michaels in a good but long game. Heidenreich faces the Undertaker in a boring coffin match. Match 3 sees Bradshaw defend his WWE title against Big Show and Kurt Angle in a surprisingly good competition. In the next match, Triple H will defend his 10th heavyweight title against Randy Orton. <br /> <br /> Next, the Royal Rumble will run in which 15 Raw Superstars and 15 Smackdown! The superstars hit the ring to try to win the rumor and face any champion at Wrestlemania 21. Among the highlights, Tough Enough 3 winner Daniel Puder gets kicked by Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly! All the superstars defeating Muhammad Hassan, and the superstars of Raw vs. Smackdown! superstars! <br /> <br /> Not a bad PPV at all. Edge vs HBK - 8/10 Taker vs Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs Angle vs Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple H vs Orton - 8.5 / 10 The match Royal Rumble - 9/10
