I watched this movie for the very first time on the Sci Fi channel and I must say it was just great. For those of you who love 'The Never Ending Story', it's the one who brings back memories of this movie. Although it's a 1996 film, it has a blurry decor and a look that feels like a fantasy. The acting was brilliant and the music was excellent, especially the battle and end songs. To those of you who have not seen it yet, WATCH IT! I completely recommended!
