Overall, a movie done well. There were parts that made me wince, and there were parts for which I threw my hands in the air, but I left with something more than I entered. <br /> <br /> I think the film suffers serious over ambition. Without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to Ramayana's fire trial go far beyond what this film represents. The Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200-page book that denigrates women in India. The film is about two married girls in a very distinct Indian family. While the basic principles of the "unwritten laws of family tradition" seem to be those of conservative India, let me assure the reader that I (having lived in Delhi for 12 years) found whole parts that just did not ring those bells. I mean certain things and some actions are very true, but some others are completely irrelevant. Especially today. <br /> <br /> Delhi is complicated. India is complicated. The director tries to simplify both. And fails miserably enough. <br /> <br /> Why in English? Can you imagine a film about Native Americans in English? Or English speaking French. Seriously discordant. Even the servant spoke accentuated English (though with a hint of familiar words in the language for "credibility"). <br /> <br /> But the chemistry between the threads is palpable. If you like it hot, it's a movie for you. I think it's the greatest grace that saves - the development of a true love story in real life. <br /> <br /> If this film spoke about Radha and Sita, then he would have received all my marks. And by being about them, it could have made a subtle statement. But this movie says that's what India and Indian society are. And in this respect, he succeeds as much as he fails. Take everything you see with a pinch of salt. The dark secrets of India are not revealed. Just two girls fall in love. Just like everywhere else.
