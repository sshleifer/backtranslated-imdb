I can not understand why the rating given to this film is so low. It was one of the most beautiful films I've seen this year. It really touched an agreement with me. I had been waiting for this movie for several months and I thought, it can not possibly live up to my expectations ... since I built it in my head as much as I did. Needless to say, not only did he meet my expectations, but he far exceeded them. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every respect. Their superb game by far. They were both in their element and completely natural for the roles. The places were absolutely beautiful. Each filmed shot has been perfectly captured and perfectly matches the mood and atmosphere. I found this film very touching and I took it very much to heart. I would even say that it could be one of my favorites of all time. At the very least, I could certainly see it again and again. <br /> <br /> I swear I did not find anything wrong with this movie. It's hard to say about any movie. I highly recommend this one. It's touching, it's significant and it says a lot about human nature and the family. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10. Well done by all.
