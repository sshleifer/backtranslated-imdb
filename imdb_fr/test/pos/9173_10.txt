I just wish I was eloquent enough to say how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> I ... it's hard to say. <br /> <br /> I may just say what comes to mind. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I really laughed. I could not believe it. I laughed and it was not a bitter laugh. it was not a cynical laugh. it is laughter generated by genuine joy. <br /> <br /> joy. it's a foreign word for me. I do not often feel this word, but I did it watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Will. That may be Will's face. He is a great human being. "Mouse on my face and there is a twinkle in my eyes." This line in one of Will's songs perfectly describes it. He has the joy of living. Trey is a lucky boy to have a dad like Will. Jada is a lucky woman to have a husband like Will. He is someone special. <br /> <br /> Happy. I feel really happy. It's a strange feeling. I do not feel like that very often. It's so nice to see, to see ... other people really happy. I mean really happy. In this movie, I did. As Will says in the movie, "Maybe I'm not happy with" well, "maybe I want" extraordinary. "You know, watching this movie made me think: me too. /> <br /> Fun Being yourself We all know that we are supposed to be ourselves, but we feel punished if we do it, maybe it has to be won. is something that we show after not being ourselves for a long time.That's why I just loved the end.Will, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta and Julie Ann Emery all dance at the wedding. No, we are not drunk, except being really happy, I can understand that, at least, I think I can (at least I enjoyed seeing them happy, really happy). > <br /> Women and men I do not know anything about relationships, but I think, watching this movie, I want to communicate with someone, to strive, to push, to to be with someone. It seems to make life ... something else. I do not really know. I'm just guessing. but I felt something while watching this movie. I thought this connection had to be ... must make life worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of film it is about. It's funny. It's CLEVER. It's TENDER. It evokes feeling. It made me think that maybe, just maybe, life is really a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> Do you want to laugh? Do you want to feel really good! Want to get answers about girls (and girls, answers about guys)? Look at the team. YOU WANT-YOU-GO-ALL !!! <br /> <br /> GO OUT !!! You are a great human being.
