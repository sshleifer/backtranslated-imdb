Although I brought this movie by accident (I thought it was the original Halloween (stupid eh!)), I was surprised how good it was, many sequels just keep going the events of the previous films, which has nevertheless tried and succeeded in explaining the events. Among the precedents, why Michael Myers kills people and why he seems to have supernatural abilities. I thought it was a horror movie full of action, suspense and surprises, I'm very happy to have brought it. I gave him 9 out of 10.
