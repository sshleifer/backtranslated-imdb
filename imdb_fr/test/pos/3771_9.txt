It's one of those rare comedies where you try not to stop laughing, chuckling, joking and even laughing out loud. The performance of the main actor as Hyde is a pure maniacal genius. See if you can keep an impassive face when he makes his transformation. Good luck. :) On the downside, there are times when the movie gets bogged down. It seemed longer than his 90 minutes.
