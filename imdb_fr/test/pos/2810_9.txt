Amazingly well done for T.V. Thriller. I was not expecting too much of it, but I'm happy to say it's one of the best of its kind. It is fast and offers solid and interesting actors games. <br /> <br /> The story is passionate from the beginning and with many successes, you can not help but find the film very interesting. <br /> <br /> The story of Thiessen's character is difficult but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is much worse than the father-in-law of his childhood friend. <br /> <br /> The concept of "stranger" and his actions are troubling if we consider that this is a common disease in society. A serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family and this film presents the disease and the crime perfectly. <br /> <br /> The film was my first concern with the movie: Thiessen's character comes home with her disturbed husband after being released on bail. At that moment, she knew what he had done to her young parent (played by the pretty Allyson Hannigan). But it is only the typical Hollywood scene that causes more problems. <br /> <br /> The culminating scene shows that Thiessen follows her husband when he is about to commit another rape, and then calls the cops who arrive just in time to capture him. The end tells us that the husband was sentenced to 99 years in real life. <br /> <br /> The acting game is also very good, and Tiffany is awesome and gorgeous as always. The direction is also very good.
