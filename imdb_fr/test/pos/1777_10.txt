It would be nice if the discussion on this medium-length film was launched with a short story about the hypocrisy of Hollywood. It was in 1988 that Chuck Norris saw this film at the Cannes International Film Festival. He made a stupid remark saying that The murder described in Dekalog 5 is far more effective than the murders filmed in his Hollywood films with him as a powerful star of action. He was talking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in Kieslowski's film by a reckless psychopath who strikes him cruelly with a big stone. There should absolutely be no justification for the violence and its perpetrators in a This is the reason why Chuck Norris's statement appears as a cruel joke defending violent means in an increasingly agitated society. An honest critic would not be mistaken if he claimed that Kieslowski's film "Dekalog: Dekalog, Piec (# 1.5)" has a universal connotation. The best lesson Kielowski gives us is the levels of violence that are acceptable in a just society. That is why the brutal murder of an innocent taxi driver is capable of causing We would not feel the same hatred for homicide. when it appears in movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme, as they look far too artificial.One can easily grasp the special effects and modern studio techniques Kieslowski also defends the helplessness of human beings to save other human beings from the clutches of death and misery. This is particularly interesting because it has been proven time and again that strict laws and punitive laws have not been able to prevent homicide.
