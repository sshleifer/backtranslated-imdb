It's another John Travolta film "come back," and if he continues with characters and movies like this, his return will be right. <br /> <br /> It's so sweet ... so disgusting that you're not in the romantic comedy scene. If you are, this is an innovative RomCom. Each performance (including Skippy the Dog's) was beautiful, with little more than a trace of the irreverence found in "Dogma". (Although the movies are going, I loved Dogma!) <br /> <br /> Travolta is not as fierce in her performance as the glimpses would suggest. He is an angel and if you consider yourself well read, then you understand that the angels were far from perfect. You will not be insulted by this movie. Even those who are too sensitive to such things should not be insulted by this work, as Nora has done her best to ensure that it is as abrasive as possible given the subject matter. <br /> <br /> I like this and I love it more each time I look at it. It's beautiful and sweet, engaging and endearing. <br /> <br /> He notes 7.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
