It was really an episode of tension and darkness. Excellent performance, wonderful actor and atmospheric director, 'Ice' is one of my favorite episodes. With 'Pusher' '' Grotesque '' '' Wetwired '' and 'Home' (which is pretty good in a dark atmosphere in my case), it seems to me quite realistic, their paranoia, their suspicion and their growing anger have been perfectly executed by the big actors. However, "Ice" had a problem that I overcame after a few watches: IT WAS TOO SHORT! I WANTED MORE! <br /> <br /> Overall, "ice" has 98% of X Files episodes: excellent acting, intense scriptwriting, serious staging. All the works. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
