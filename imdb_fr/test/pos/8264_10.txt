I had the chance to record this wonderful drama, both parts, when it was originally broadcast on Masterpiece Theater. I loved it but lost it. Then one day, while browsing old cassettes, I found it again. I recorded it on DVD and watched and --- WOW! I still like it! The tracks are excellent and my only complaint is that I would have liked to see more Kester! What a man! And Prue. She is so strong and wonderful ... she lives at a time and a time when her affliction and her treatment are considered unhappy and perverse. Even his own brother tells Prue in front of him that he doubts that a man will ever have it. * sigh * Unfortunately, my copy is not the best, it has been worn continuously over the years, and I would love to be absolutely thrilled to own it on a professional DVD if it happened one day.
