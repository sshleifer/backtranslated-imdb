Obsessed!!!!! I have each season of Gilmore Girls and I think that if I like it so much, it's because the script is smart, it's not your average humorous series, there's no pause after a joke , it goes on, if you missed you missed that. And it's not a television soap opera either, because it does not use dramatic music and the actors never look stupid and stupid. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the best T.V. shows of its time. It's funny because they talk so fast that you can not get everything the first time, it's nice to go back and laugh at other jokes. They also have so many references that it's amazing how smart it is. <br /> <br /> And you can also tell the characters their characters so real and their actors are superb, from the spiritual spirit Lorelai to hermit Luke to the immature Kirk show is just amazing. I recommend it without hesitation to all those who want to spend good time and spend time with their family is the show for them. There is only one word that can describe Gilmore Girls .... CLASSIC !!!!!!
