These guys combine low-front with low budget. That's wonderful. <br /> <br /> If you want Bergman, rent the "7th seal" or something. If you want to see rude humor and exploitative sex, that's it. <br /> <br /> I think Jane Jensen as Julia makes all this visible. She can really play (really well), she is a do-it-all boat, and she does not seem to feel above all else.
