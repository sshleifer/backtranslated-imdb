Totally different, with a lot of discretion and dark comedy, it's a movie that few people can see, but those who do will remember it. This film creates its own universe and fascinates in every way. What it is about? Strangely, I believe. Probably to the viewer, but I found that this film tries to say something about the coldness and emptiness behind all the designer furniture and the perfect facades. I do not know if I'm right. But this movie really touched me. Seeing it I really hope that the team behind this movie makes more films and will continue to do so in a weird style. And I forgot: The casting here is superb, with Trond Fausa Aurv√•g as Bothersome Man, who does not understand where he is, what he does and why. The recognition of not understanding the purpose of life (in the city) is what bothers him. All others do what they are told and pretend to be happy. This movie is a good humorous commentary on life in 2006.
