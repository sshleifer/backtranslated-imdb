Emilio is a successful businessman, a perfect father and a good husband. Or that's what everyone thinks. The perfect plot he has carefully crafted throughout these years will suddenly close around him. Will he be able to follow his own lies? <br /> <br /> This is a very well presented drama, with an excellent interpretation and a firm direction. Even if the plot is pushed to the extreme to increase the tension, the film explores some of our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we are dealing with? Can we be so sure? <br /> <br /> The story is growing at a faster pace, to the point where Emilio is no longer in control of his lies. A good number of Spanish films have interesting stories but are far from technical mastery. The perfect rhythm and the well-filmed scenes make the actors so credible. We enter Emilio, we hate him and suffer for him as his situation becomes more and more desperate. There is no need for Spanish folklore, nor trying to create a movie in Hollywood. This is the reality of Spain in 2002, and despite the unlikely appearance of Emilio's life, there is a good chance that someone we know does not really look like the one he claims to be. Not only an excellent commercial product, it will allow you to ask where lies can lead us. Can we follow? <br /> <br /> Well done.
