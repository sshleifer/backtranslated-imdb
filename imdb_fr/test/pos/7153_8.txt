It's always a pleasure to see in a film characters who are good-hearted and well-intentioned, even when surrounded by those who are not. The moderately ridiculous premise of the movie is that Franklin's conservative and religious family (mother, father, teenager, and daughter) is involved in an accident in which parents and brother experience an imminent death experience in which they meet Jesus, a pleasant but somewhat exasperated feeling. soul that takes away the burden of "original sin". When they returned to life, many of their opinions and attitudes changed, much to the dismay of the girl, who did not share the experience. The religious side is, I think, presented with a good balance, from the good (Jesus) to the horribly terrible (those of his "disciples" who are obsessed by the sins of others and who are completely unaware of theirs). It's a movie to make you think, make you laugh on the way, and leave you feeling good that the world might be a better place than you think.
