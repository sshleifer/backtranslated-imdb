"Snow Queen" is, of course, based on the fairy tale of the same name, collected in (at least) Andersen's fairy tales - and, unlike many other recent productions based on other tales of fairy, it retains the spirit of Faerie, a realization difficult and misunderstood by many, especially by the Americans. Animals that speak, arbitrary prohibitions, appearances of goblins, dragons and demons must not be doubted in a fairy tale; They are a natural element of Faerie, such as gravity in the scientific world, and their reason or explanation is completely outside the subject of history. Nor is history bound by the modern rules of composition of Hollywood: direct, often to become linearly grotesque in works of less importance, and obvious (at least retrospectively). <br /> <br /> With this defense against the common criticism of those who do not understand fairy tales, "Snow Queen" is a charming film with incredible visual effects, a skillful action game and a deep feeling . I think that the only flaw in the film is not that it is too fantastic, but that some parts of the dialogue were too modern in terms of slang and expression, an attack on its otherwise timeless nature.
