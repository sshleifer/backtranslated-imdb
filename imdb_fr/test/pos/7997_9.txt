So what is 'Batman Returns', anyway? <br /> <br /> It's been marketed as an action movie, and many people who have seen it seem to think they've seen an action movie - but really, is not it so much of action, and Tim Burton seems barely interested. <br /> <br /> People often line it up with the comics "superheroes" of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read Dark Knight Returns, it sounds a bit absurd; Burton's excessive imagination has more in common with the day-glo sixties television series (the Penguin walks in a giant plastic duck, for God's sake). <br /> <br /> Burton's style is often described as Gothic. a little closer to what we see on the screen; the Penguin - distorted, clever, with a tangled history and an underground hideout - is a Gothic threat dressed in more respectable Dickensian clothes - Udolfo pretending to be Uriah Heep. <br /> <br /> But what about Catwoman? It may be resurrected, but this PVC costume is resolutely twentieth century and its alter ego universe, Selina Kyle, is composed of meeting rooms and apartments - evoking a romantic comedy of the 1930s. <br /> < Then you click. The intelligent but oppressed secretary romanticized by a lonely millionaire? The resulting complications caused by deception and disguise? "Batman Returns" is, obviously, a romantic comedy of the old Hollywood style, filtered through the sensibilities of the dungeon S & M of Burton. It has more in common with "The Hudsucker Proxy" (including Expressionist sets) than with other superhero movies. <br /> <br /> Like many romantic comedies, it revolves around the transformation of heroin; no ugly swan duck, but domineering doormat. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her career (often remarkable); she is iconically sexy as a Catwoman (poor Halle Berry has never prayed), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, however, it is his scenes as Selina that impress; almost every one of them is a comic gem, especially the glimpse of his lonely family life. It's a tragicomic performance that is delicately balanced, and it's in these scenes that the film really comes to life. Nothing moves me as much as Selina and Bruce Wayne dancing under the mistletoe of Siouxsie and the Banshees, a gun held between them, both strengthened and trapped by their alter ego, doomed to conflict. Forget the easy sentimentalism of "Big Fish" or the bright emotions of "Edward Scissorhands" - this is the most heartfelt scene of all Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, madness, self-hatred and lack of spirit, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors, especially Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost resembles him, regaining the dignity of a wounded man buried under these long, disgusting clients. The villain of comics comics is revealed to be nothing more than a simulacrum; Burton's Penguin is a wild creature subject to its own transformation, in the manner of Eliza Doolittle (almost literally an "ugly duckling"). This is the most radical - and funny - reinvention of Burton. Max Schreck by Christopher Walken completes a perfect triptych of wicked, slippery with disconcerting ease and white-eyed psychosis (and is it just me, or does his company's logo remind of Mickey Mouse? ask the former Disney animator, Burton). <br /> <br /> The film Batman Begins by Christopher Nolan, a real action film, was hailed as the first film to do justice to Batman; I admire Nolan's film, but it would be a shame if he was allowed to hide this idiosyncratic jewel.
