Having grown up with GWTW, I avoided both the "Scarlett" follow-up book and the miniseries so far. When I first watched the video for the first time, I was amazed at how much I enjoyed watching Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Rhett Butler and Joanne Walley-Kilmer as Scarlet. I think that "Scarlet" should be judged on its own merits rather than trying to make a comparison with Selznick's venerable masterpiece, GWTW. Although the story "Scarlet" and some dialogues suffered from a lack of inspired writing, I thought globally that it was an interesting dramatization of what could have happened between Scarlett and Rhett.
