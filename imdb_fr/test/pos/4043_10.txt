Enchanting. The best time to watch this movie is sometimes unhappy or sad. Everything is so cute, even the way the polar bear secretly loves the queen and gets it to the end, as well as the success of the two young actors of Gerda and Kai. It's music so it's very nice. The two of us will always be a combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if we look at both parties at once, he will see that the Frozen is not so bad. She's just trying to surround herself with love in the wrong way. The night this movie was shown here (part one), I only watched it because I was bored, but I liked it a lot later and I was very angry when they did not not shown the next part because of the pope's funeral .. Yes, it was terribly sad for me. But when they said it would be next week, I was so happy to have it recorded and now I'm glad I did.
