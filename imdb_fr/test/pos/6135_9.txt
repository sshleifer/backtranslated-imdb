Like most other reviews, I really enjoyed this TV mini-series. I had not seen it when it was released for the first time, but my grandfather - a big fan of mysteries and war movies - recorded it in 1989. I remember seeing it at the my grandparents' cabin one night and I was completely drawn to the movie. story! It has a very intriguing plot and a good mix of drama, romance and spying. I saw a lot of movies that happened during the Second World War, but none of them look like that! Fortunately, I was able to make a VHS copy of the film several years ago. I have watched it many times since then and I still enjoy it. I would like this film to be published on DVD. It would be so much easier to see with chapters.
