A film of high intelligence and activity. In addition to being a capsule of time and personality of the 60s, the film is truly a surprise by its avant-garde themes and the unique presentation of the power system in a group. William Greaves gives himself the role of authority in the group. He asks members of his team to film and film and continue filming. First the two actors, then the film crew of the actors, then all the scenery, including passers-by, policemen and finally a homeless man living in bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks. <br /> <br /> Greaves mounts the film (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong story with a bow and interesting motivations. Do not expect to be bothered by this movie. All team members make exciting conversations and often express the thoughts of the observer watching this film. Greaves successfully integrates multiple shots using three-in-one synchronized images and other ways to shift attention. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film will be really effective only if you wish. If you are looking for an abstract artistic film that feeds your own indulgent ego without ever asserting your point of view, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a film that will make you talk and think long after the desire for honesty and sincerity in the documented "reality" and inevitable transparency that results, then this is the perfect movie.
