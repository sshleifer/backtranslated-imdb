The episode begins with scenes of a dead woman bathed on the beach, an abandoned Jim walking along the beach lost in reverie and a return to the night home that ends in murder and a mystery. Yes, it's a small atmospheric number with a great twist at the end. Jim does well to unravel what is, a priori, an inexplicable case of missing woman 20 seconds after entering her home. Certainly, the final explanation is a little exaggerated. Why, for example, substitute a woman halfway for a car trip while rubbing her AND her companions would have been as easy and would leave less traces. However, aside from that, this is a memorable episode of TRF, full of inventions, though, again, Jim is trapped by an ever-suspicious police force. how many of their files have been resolved by my dear Jimbo?
