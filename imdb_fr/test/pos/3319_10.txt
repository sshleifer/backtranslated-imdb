If it's not my favorite movie of all time, it's definitely in the top five. I like that. Everything is perfect - the clothes, the decor, the lines - yes, they are not normal people who speak, but ... Even in small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office, girls change shoes, choose a wedgie, water the office ivy plant, put the lunch in the fridge ... Same as we do the office girls today in 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful. If someone like Joan Crawford is at the top, it's all part of the package. If you cite a lot of things in the film, it's very obvious that it was the early sixties, when women were starting to not "let go", at least not if they did not want to. For example, if the characters are contradictory, for example, the character of Suzy Parker behaves like crazy, but attaches too much to the character of Louis Jourdan, is not that what many people think - contradictory? They mingle with real scenes, like that of Diane Baker's character finding the love of her life after a miscarriage of her illegitimate baby in an accident - lying in the hospital with a big old bandage around her head. That's also part of the package, it's the charm - the glossy escape. I like the mixture of true stories relevant today (the stereotypical career woman who only has relationships with married men, so has no family when she is older) with stories that give you "Oh, if only I could fall in love with a doctor and he will love me although he knows my sordid past and he saw me ruined after the scandalous accident!" In addition, I just received the DVD, widescreen, it's even more beautiful than the full screen ... Yay!
