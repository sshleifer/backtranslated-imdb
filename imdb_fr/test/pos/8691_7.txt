Why did Jessie Matthews, one of the British music stars, be in this movie between her glittering movie "The Good Companions" and the classic "Evergreen" is a good question? When I saw it for the first time, I was really disappointed. I wanted to see her sing and dance - she was introduced as "Millie - the girl of the non-stop variety" but there was more stop than variety. <br /> <br /> Now, I see it as a good little drama. <br /> This is a bus crash and stories that preceded people on the bus. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jessie Matthews, who is great as Millie - Sir Ralph Richardson plays his fianc√©e (yes, that's right). <br /> <br /> Edmund Gwenn - who went to Hollywood co-play in Lassie and also with Natalie Wood in "Miracle on 34th Street", plays a grumpy businessman. Gordon Harker is his very annoying partner. <br /> <br /> Emlyn Williams - who wrote "Night Must Fall" was the villain of the mailing and Frank Lawton, who went to Hollywood and appeared in "David Copperfield" and "The Devil's Doll" is the young man in trouble. Sonnie Hale who was married to Jessie Matthews at the time was playing the role of the bus driver.
