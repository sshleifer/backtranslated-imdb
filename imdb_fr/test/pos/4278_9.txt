I have to admit that I have a penchant for the humor and storytelling style of British films, though not all of them have succeeded, of course. <br /> <br /> This film made me think and finally let me smile quietly on my face. It concerns the development of character and relationships, truth and lies, and if love is not enough sometimes. Some very nice actors, including the two main actors, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of noise around Gosford Park, but I think this piece was produced by Fellowes. a better movie, although it was not a mainstream release. <br /> <br /> An intelligent and mature story about real people who are undeniably imperfect, but who are also capable of acts of real kindness.
