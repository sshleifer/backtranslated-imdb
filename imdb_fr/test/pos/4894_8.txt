After three exceptional television series from the BBC and a special Christmas program, the strange and grotesque characters (but incredibly likeable) of the dark fictional city Royston Vasey make the leap in celluloid, accompanied by their creators - The League of Gentlemen. <br /> <br /> Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the three-quarters most familiar of the quartet, with central roles being shared between the three. In a new twist, the last member of the team - Jeremy Dyson - is portrayed by actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Dyson (Sheen) is in conversation with his cohorts of writers when, horror of horror, he receives the visit of two of his greatest characters. Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are unhappy with the League's decision to kill residents of Vasey. "You are not real!" Dyson screams in vain, as local hell traders take their revenge. Mayhem ensues, while reality and Vasey converge with the vast array of characters entering our world to save theirs. <br /> <br /> Confused? You will be, like the camp, Teutonic to hints, Herr Lipp (Pemberton) is forced to take the daily aspect of Pemberton (Pemberton), while Pemberton (Pemberton) is removed by the cannibal butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Geoff Tipps (Shearsmith). <br /> <br /> Briss tries to force Pemberton to rewrite the film - thus continuing his life - but leaving Geoff in charge is never a good idea. The former actor becomes involved in the latest The League's adventure in The Post's Vasey - The King's Evil - by entering a typically twisted England of the seventeenth century, with cameos from Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Known as George of Asda (because of his chosen line of clothing), Geoff saves the day and is treated like a hero. However, for the outcome of the film, he joins old and new characters at Royston Vasey Church to meet their decision-makers. <br /> <br /> For the fans of the series, the film is a must. And yes, there is Papa Lazarou (a little too fleeting). Pauline, a feathers lover, Mickey, Barbara and the cursed veterinarian Matthew Chinnery are some of the favorite favorites. The portrait of themselves by The League (plus Sheen's as Dyson) is also a fascinating insight. <br /> <br /> The League of Gentlemen is the leader of the British comedy on the radio. She is ambitious, revolutionary (see the excellent series 3) and is not happy to rest on her laurels. They also divide opinions accordingly. <br /> <br /> Certainly, their macabre sense of humor is not suitable for all palates, and although it is not written exclusively for "fans", an understanding of the plot would be useful for those who have already watched the series. Nevertheless, Apocalypse is a film in its own right and The League will undoubtedly attract a new generation of fans, as well as soothing and enjoyable films.
