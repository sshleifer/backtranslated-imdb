The true story of perhaps the greatest football coach that the game has ever known. Knute Rockne led football out of the "Stone Age" with innovations such as advanced passes and offensive training changes. But he is probably best known for his motivational speeches in the locker room. Along the way, he brought glory and glory to a small unknown Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O'Brien is unmatched in his role as Rockne. The cast is fantastic and includes Ronald Reagan, who is an excellent performance as the first and true superstar of Notre Dame, George Gipp. <br /> <br /> For football fans, this is the biggest football movie ever made. Do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version. (Some versions have deleted scenes for some reason) If you have the right version, look for a quick glimpse of the immortal Jim Thorpe who passes his head in the locker room to inform Rockne and the team that they only have few minutes 2nd half begins.
