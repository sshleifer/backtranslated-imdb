I always wanted to see this movie and when I finally understood, I knew I was going to have a nice surprise when the name of John Boorman appeared on the screen. Known mainly for his epic films (he directed the first Conan and wrote Apocalypse Now) in the classic Hollywood structure, it fits perfectly into his catalog. It was a good time to consider that Myanmar (Burma) is once again experiencing an uprising by monks and students against the government headed by the "military junta", which is the same film of 1988. Now more than ever , this film must be broadcast on television (captured by the IFC) because of recent events.
