I watched Love Life on vacation when it was shot at a film festival in Florida. It was a nice surprise to find a British film that is neither derivative nor exploitative. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will delight the pants of the public prepared to sit down and enjoy the sweetness of the film. Transitions between scenes seemed a little awkward, but overall, I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby ​​in the dust. One for the whole family. A nice change to see a British film for the teen audience that is not littered with four-letter words. Try to see him.
