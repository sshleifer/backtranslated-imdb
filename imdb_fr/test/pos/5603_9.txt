Although the filming of the camera was certainly "funky" - perhaps a "Dutch" in less than "stoned" - the premise of the film was fantastic. It really took a scathing satirical look (in the true Hal Hartley tradition) on God, Jesus and the devil. The interaction of Jesus and Satan provides hilarious scenes ... Even Jesus' monologues were excellent - it was by far the best Jesus I have ever seen. So relaxed, zen, son of God, but still so kind. At a certain level, it is a very general look at the paradoxes of Christianity, but there is nevertheless a personal level, where you can relate to Jesus Christ without having a divine complex (thanks to Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
