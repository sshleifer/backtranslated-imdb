My second favorite movie of 1970 (after Five Easy Pieces) was totally rejected by many idiots, thus calling a waste intended to attract the public. Peter Boyle, a known Liberal, is amazing as a hard worker who has some problems with the younger generation. He's a scary guy, but he's very imaginative and very funny. I was a liberal teenager when it was published, but as awful as Joe seems to me, it also pissed me off! Susan Sarandon, in her first role, is perfect and is a rich fox in mixed stones. Dinner in Queens is hilarious and insightful for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> This film was NOT an exploitation film and the Oscar-nominated screenplay should have been won that year. The director simply did not waste enough money to gain enough credibility in Hollywood. Whatever your political pursuit, then and now, you will love someone in this movie. A total of 9 out of 10. It's on DVD and video. Check it out!
