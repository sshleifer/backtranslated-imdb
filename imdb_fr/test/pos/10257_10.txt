"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies EVER !!! I think I saw this film a few years ago on TV with my mother, late at night, when I was little and I found it so funny. This film has also been described as "American black graffiti". Glynn Turman is wonderful with Preach and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs is great with Cochise, Preach's friend. There are also other great characters, and this film contains a lot of humor. From the beginning of the movie where Cochise goes to Preach to get ready for school and ends at the end of Cochise's funeral, this movie will make you laugh all the time. There are a lot of scenes in this movie that I like a lot. The scene where Pooter (another friend of Preach and Cochise) goes to the zoo with them and is thrown the feces of the gorilla on his shirt (very rough, but also funny), the first scene in the cafeteria at the corner of the street , the neighborhood party at this girl who became a disaster as a result of a fight, and some others are wonderful to watch. This film even has a great companion album, full of great hits and Motown artists from the early '60s (only six songs from the soundtrack were played in '75, the others being' 60s). The film is mainly about two friends who dream of moving away from their poor and rough neighborhood after high school, but their future seems almost out of reach, because of their joyous drive in a stolen car under the responsibility of two others. Preach with his girlfriend, Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis) is almost imperiled. Go out and rent or buy this movie and get ready for a lot of comic entertainment !!! Get the soundtrack too. It's also very fun !!!
