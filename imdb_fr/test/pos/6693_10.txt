Life is composed of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what about the vast unknown, areas beyond which knowledge has no boundaries or established parameters? Who is saying what exists or what is possible? Valuable questions, all of which are raised and explored in the story of a particular individual's personal journey, a bizarre and dramatic odyssey that challenges facts and logic, in K-PAX, directed by Iain Softley, starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Following an incident in New York Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a mental hospital in Manhattan, where he is entrusted to Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), who is trying to reveal the truth. about his patient, who claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell because Prot, with his calmness, his direct attitude, his sense of the future and his propensity to produce (he eats banana peels and all, and the apples Red Delicious, his favorites ) is quite convincing. But it is Powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. Prot's claims, however, remain intact and hold up even under the most intense polls and under the watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in a sort of dilemma - Prot√© tells him even the exact date and time where he will leave for K -PAX, a scheduled round trip that allows Powell to have all the time needed to settle it. And Powell just can not understand the idea that he's dealing with a real extraterrestrial being; and that is something he will have to solve quickly if he wants to know the truth. And he must know. After all, truth is the only thing that will leave him free in his mind. <br /> <br /> Softley has created and produced a sensitive and stimulating film that inspires the viewer to challenge the mystery. surrounding Prot while forcing you to reflect on your own conceptions of what is actually possible. And since you never know for sure about Prot until the denouement, you can identify with Powell, see the situation from his point of view and try to solve the riddle with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and creates a real sense of being confronted with something truly unique as the story unfolds and you begin to realize that Prot is perhaps what he says he is. And in the context of the reality the film is about, it's exciting to try to make you think. How do you react when all the evidence is contrary to the physical limitations we have set for ourselves? At the heart of the film, there is a resounding depth of humanity that is evident, not only in Prot, but also in Dr. Powell. Which makes it an extremely engaging and captivating drama. <br /> <br /> As expected, Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Prot, presenting his character from top to bottom, emotionally deep and physically convincing. at the same time. He is a unique individual, and Spacey makes him live with care and his ability to share these particularly revealing moments, which reinforces the credibility of the character and the credibility of the story itself. For this film to work, it is essential to believe in whom and what Prot is; we do, and that's the case. Spacey does it simply beautifully. It's a memorable performance, from which evolves a character who will stay with you for a long time. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, emerges on a par with Spacey, making him a real Powell person. It's a fairly simple role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make it unique, which, unlike Prot's character, was not a small task. And, again, for this film to work, it was necessary that Bridges be up to it. And, with exceptional skill and an accomplished professional, he succeeds without problems. Bridges infuses Powell with an underlying complexity and gives so much in his performance that it makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant, and sometimes intense. It's a demonstration of two of the best players in the business doing what they do best, creating a vibrant and inspiring dynamic. This is an excellent work by Bridges, who never tries to steal the spotlight at Prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher level. <br /> <br /> The secondary cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). K-PAX, an entertaining and emotionally emotional film, is a thesis about the possibilities as well as an examination of the ever-evolving complexities of the human condition. It is a film that requires openness and rewards those who are able to approach it on its own terms and accept it. In the end, you realize how real K-PAX is; and that makes you appreciate Prot's journey and all that we share and have in common with those around us, whether human or extraterrestrial. And that can make you think about your own journey - where you have been and where you are going. And that's the magic of cinema. I note this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
