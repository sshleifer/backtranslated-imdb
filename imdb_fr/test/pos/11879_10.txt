I just do not see what's so bad about this movie. I loved this film! I thought this movie was the best movie in the series. Although part 3 is the best of the series, I still gave this film 10 out of 10 because it's great. I do not see what everyone hates this movie. Who would not want to see a little creature action. I wish Brad Brown appeared in this one as it could make him a little better. Those who like a little drama because ... wait, I will not tell you, you just have to watch it. This film also contains some popular actors who are ... (I will not tell you because I hate when people give faults of disorder, so I do not want to be part of it). Well, I guess that's all I have to say about this movie.
