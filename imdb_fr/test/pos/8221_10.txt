I saw this performance on television and I recorded it. My daughter played again and again. I lent to work and everyone loved it. It's just a brilliant physical comedy. Bill made an appearance here in California (he worked and lived in New York) and played the role of Regard of Flight on stage. I was able to take my daughter and girlfriend to see this brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Bill received a federal endowment, and my daughter wrote him a congratulatory letter and Bill was very kind. Write back and attach a photo. <br /> <br /> People ask me and I can not decide if he's a comedian, an actor or a clown. In fact, he is all three. I really wish it to be on DVD, my tape is lost.
