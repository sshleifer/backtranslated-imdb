Well, the day that Rob Schneider goes deeper into the notoriously bad movie black hole playing in the absolutely unstoppable movie "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" And now there's Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo followed by the Deuce Bigalow sequel : European Gigolo ....... I feel a motive, maybe soon there will be Spiderman: European Webs are Hotter ..... or not) I'm writing about this much-maligned film (at the time of his exit). I was one of those clever people, I must admit. I laughed at the question even though Chris Farley was putting cocaine on him and SNL actors were going through one of the worst seasons in their history between 1994 and 1995, despite Norm McDonald's stance. Films like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out a few years after that time and we realized that the future of Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler was dark. However, I watched this film the other day, ten years later and eight years after Chris' death, who kept laughing. Yes it is not particularly sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does (not very different from Manny being Manny) but his motivational speaker "Van Down By the River" in which he complains about not "washing himself enough" or "wearing tight fitting clothes" or "using a deodorant more than twice a week "translates well here by the still erased person who realizes that he is neither the most brilliant nor the most beautiful and that he risks losing a few pounds. Nevertheless, he does his best to do what he is supposed to do. And David Spade gets rid of his fine lines as he did for "Spade's Hollywood Minute" and basically stakes Farley's self-esteem. There is really not much more to say than that. I love the scene where Farley catches Spade spanking his monkey, then makes fun of him. I do not remember the first one, but the second, they're lying in their hotel bed and Farley tells Spade, "Do you like baseball?" Spade mumbled something inaudible in response and Farleys said, "YANK-ees from New York?" In any case, Farley makes his clumsy shtick, painfully sensitive. If you like, you like that. I could not help laughing.
