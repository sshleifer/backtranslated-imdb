I love this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = Which is a bit difficult to do. This movie is one of the best cartoon adaptations of all time. It does not distort characters like other movies. Everyone is in the character and has a role to play! <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Buster and Babs coming down the river after a flood (courtesy of Buster), to Plucky party on a trip with Hamton (hilarious trick), Elmyra running around torturing animals (as usual), Fifi following him for an autograph, and Shirley and Fowlmouth going to the movies. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like the Buster. and Babs segments that much, although they have had some notable dialogues and jokes. I must say that the Plucky and Hampton 'Vacation' rooms were the best! Hamton's family is HILARIOUS! I particularly like Uncle Stinky. Fifi at the hotel was also hilarious. I love the cameos during this scene. : D <br /> <br /> The most famous part of this film, again in my humble opinion, is the one where Fowlmouth and Shirley are in the movies ... LOL! You must see it to appreciate it! And when Hamton and Plucky pass through the tunnel to make a wish ... :) <br /> <br /> Although this movie has moved slowly during the Buster / Babs games, the rest is just about gold! I note this movie 8/10. Show this to your kids one day ... or even to adults yourself - WATCH THIS FILM! You will not regret it.
