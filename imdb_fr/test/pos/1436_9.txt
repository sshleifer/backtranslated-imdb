EVALUATIONS: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Once addicted to heroin, Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) comes out from jail to his prison partner, Sparrow (Arnold Stang), a needy woman's helper Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and biting aside Molly (Kim Novak). he's stuck doing the only other thing he's good at, other than being a junkie, handing out cards in high stakes games. And despite all his efforts, even the prison has not cured him of his penchant for the devil's drug, has incited him to lie and deceive all around him and to push him to take desperate measures to feed himself. His desire to go out is his only motivation for a happy ending. <br /> <br /> When people think of Frank Sinatra, they usually think of classic songs like Pitch Under Skin, New York New York and It Had to Be You. But if no one forgets that he is also a renowned actor, and if his performance in the acclaimed film From Here to Eternity was not enough, he will be remembered for this cutting edge drama, dealing with what was the time an extremely taboo subject. addiction. <br /> <br /> The film is often cited as one of the first to present the graphic use of heroin (probably the reason for Certificate 15) at a time when it was a subject that was still very pushed underground. In her portrayal of the main protagonist, Sinatra is doing well, expressing perfectly the despair, despair and sincerity of a man losing every second chance he is given. Her cold turkey scene is much more intense than Ewan McGregor's in Trainspotting. The first co-star to make a good impression is Parker, as Machine's demanding and disabled woman, using her husband's guilt and sense of duty to its full effect. Novak, her secret lover, still manages some strong moments but is less a star than Parker. Stang does his usual comical relief, like the weak-witted companion who drags the leading man with his wasp accent in New York. <br /> <br /> Director Otto Preminger lets time slip a bit, but it's still absorbing film with power all the way through, with lots of unexpected twists and should be admired to be one of the first movies to give life to such a sinister subject. ****
