As a mother of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I love AristoCats. It's a movie that does not contain two-way words, no words almost swearing like the devil, no parents who are functional idiots, and no jokes about the crotch or flatulence that prevails even in " best "children's movies. The story is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is pretty romantic. The kittens are adorable and the various other characters are unique and captivating. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing. The characters are also very well cast. I love listening to the velvety voice of Eva Gabor. There are so many others who have been familiar since childhood and who are also perfectly suited to characters. It's really a film about love, tolerance, good manners and fidelity. Who does not want their children to be exposed to these values? It's a movie that I'm not afraid to watch again and again, unlike Happy Feet where I could not watch everything in full, even once because it was so irritating. I wish the production companies are starting to make more movies like this one.
