This film makes you think. This shows how a woman's weaknesses can lead to nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so I felt even more uncomfortable seeing the behavior of the lead actress. I think women might think about this behavior, but I do not think they act accordingly. The dark scenes added to the feeling of evil that had to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I hoped that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but it was not the case. Maybe it's more realistic. Life seems to be going in the same direction instead of creating a new riverbed that goes up the hill.
