This film was different. It took a kind of typical thriller story to reach a more interesting and in-depth look at a character's struggle with faith. Of course, Andrew McCarthy's main performance was excellent. The other performances were also very interesting, although less consistent. The end was a little disappointing, but there were a lot of good times. The filmmakers tried something different here: they were not content with the obvious chills and frights. It's a dark film (not for everyone) but if you want to entertain yourself and not be criticized, try this one.
