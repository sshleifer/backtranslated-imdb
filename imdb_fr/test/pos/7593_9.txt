I am very surprised that so many people do not like this movie. I think it's a lot better than most of the teen movies that came out recently - Ten things I hate about you (can we say adorable movie and what is the principle of writing these porn novels?) Gives up their virginity because of a fun car ride) and She's All That (mediocre). If you are looking for something fun, I recommend going with Never Been Kissed. My mother loved it and she hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACHES). It's a great fantasy about what you would do differently if you could go back to high school. People who were outcasts in high school will probably like this movie better. It reminds me of "The Romy and Michele High School Meeting". And the end puts me in a good mood. Of course, the plot was made, but how many recent movies can you honestly say have not been done in one form or another. The cast is so charming. And for those who think Drew can not be geeky - she's just fine. Another good teen comedy I recommend, which was recently made, is ELECTION, but it's more of a satire of school and politics.
