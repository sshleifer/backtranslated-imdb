I rarely watch short films because they only seem to be on television and are not advertised enough for me to know which short films are worth it. As The Room is an additional feature on the Hitcher DVD, it gave me a wonderful opportunity to see a high quality short film with Rutger Hauer in great shape. <br /> <br /> Artistically shot in black and white, The Room explores a man's obsession with a play in which he spent his early adulthood in a documentary / interview style. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man who expresses his feelings for a woman, but is also juxtaposed with occasional drifts and impairments of fluidity. It adds a lot of realism and depth to Hauer's performance, which is perfect as an eccentric man with most of his life behind him. <br /> <br /> The music for piano heard by Harry (Hauer) in the room is constantly in the background and reinforces the touching atmosphere of the film and intensifies the feelings of sadness expressed by Hauer. <br /> <br /> Hauer proves that he is more than just a psychotic Hollywood villain with this role and perfectly displays his more sensitive side. Mattijn Hartemink is also effective in flashback scenes as a young Harry with a silent role. It shows how much he is affected by the music and his disappointment when he leaves. <br /> <br /> The end is prophetic and leaves you in an atmosphere of reflection longer than many feature films. A very good effort.
