... But it's also Minnie's and Pete's! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but he does! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both are very nice and friendly. It's worth noting that Minnie is more of a woman in this field than she is today and Mickey is less than considerate in this area. Pete is still the same old villain, but he looks a little different. <br /> <br /> In this famous episode, aboard a small steamboat, Mickey, Minnie and some of the side characters are having a lot of fun and a lot of trouble. Even in their first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. <br /> <br /> I like this episode quite well, although overall I prefer the Mickey Mouse in the future. I love animation, the theme of the steamboat and music, clever gags - and of course, Mickey and Minnie! <br /> <br /> Like many early cartoons, it's very random, Walt presented a very basic plot and just added gags to "put it on". There is also a character on the parrot side that is very boring and rather useless. These are the things I do not like about it. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this episode, that a color version was not made for him (or if it did, I never heard about it)! <br /> <br /> Everyone who just loves Mickey Mouse and Disney will appreciate that.
