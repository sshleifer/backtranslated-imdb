The congregation of all the monsters in the latest film of Universal's famous series of universal horror stories. Count Dracula (John Carradine, an intense and dapper man), calling himself Baron Latos, addresses Dr. Edelmann (Onslow Stevens) to ask him to seek treatment for his affliction. Of course, this is just a trick. Then, coincidentally, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney), aka "The Wolf Man", introduces himself and of course, he * really wants to be cured. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, monsters do not get the same time on the screen. The monster Frankenstein (Glenn Strange) is added at the end for the sole purpose of including all the universal monsters. Archive sequences and library music are also reused. The film may spend a little too much time with the Dracula story, although Carradine gives an impressive and unadorned performance in the count's role. The film is primarily a showcase for Stevens, who runs through a tragic arc of characters and does a great job. The women are beautiful and I must say that I loved Jane Adams as a bright nurse - who happens to be hunchbacked. <br /> <br /> Of course, this would not be complete without the inclusion of angry villagers. <br /> <br /> A professional cooler, done competently, is, to my taste, not really scary, but entertaining anyway. It's a respectable serial entry overall. <br /> <br /> 7/10
