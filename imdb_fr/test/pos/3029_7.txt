This film is a good case of style, but the style is good and certainly more unique to make "The Cell" a memorable film and above average. <br /> <br /> "The Cell" is beautifully looking with impressive sets, costumes and make-up. Yes, it's a real treat for the eyes. The film contains perfectly "dreamy" sequences that are certainly strange but also very beautiful and imaginative to watch. This film is a perfect mix between an art house movie and a typical Hollywood thriller, accessible to both fans of the genre. <br /> <br /> The story itself is rather far-fetched and does not always make sense. For this reason, the film is not always pleasant and enjoyable to watch, but as I already mentioned, the style compensates for that. The style allows you to watch until the end and offers you the best moments of the film. <br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio is unforgettable as a serial killer with a twisted mind. Vincent D'Onofrio is really underused as an actor and this film shows his talent again. I'm not particularly happy about Jennifer Lopez's casting. I know she can play in some of her films, but she really did not suit the main character of this movie. Her character was not strong enough and she was overshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Nevertheless, I felt that Vince Vaughn had also been badly treated in this film. He did not fit the role well enough and no, I do not say that because I'm used to seeing him only in comedies nowadays. The rest of the cast is good and still gives the film some credibility. <br /> <br /> Howard Shore's score was also surprising and sometimes sounded like "Se7en". It suited the movie well and gave the atmosphere and atmosphere of the scene a little more. <br /> <br /> It's a far from perfect film and the concept is highly sought after and is not always treated properly. Still "The Cell" is a perfectly listenable film and maybe even a must, because of its style, originality and creativity. <br /> <br /> 7/10
