As John Grierson has pointed out: "The genre of documentary can be defined as follows: the creative interpretation of reality" <br /> <br /> This fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time that a project generated by computer on the dinosaurs respects the intelligence of the viewer. <br /> <br /> When I saw Jurassic Park, which I was waiting with great excitement, I was extremely disappointed. Of course, the dinosaurs were great, but the narration was useless. I thought, "What if they made a documentary on dinosaurs, without crying children or bad word games, but only with dinosaurs as realistic as possible, to let us marvel at what was once a reality." has become reality. The BBC has produced an exciting documentary exploring the different epochs of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> This part is for all people who seem to disagree with the fact that they have had to guess many points regarding behavior, skin patterns etc: of course they must. There was no one. I think it's fantastic that they can present something as realistic as that. Assumptions are all based on the knowledge of many paleontologists and allow the viewer to have a pretty good idea of ​​the situation. If you want to stick to what we know for sure, visit a museum of dinosaur bones. That's why I incorporated Grierson's quote at the beginning of this commentary. <br /> <br /> Anyway, congratulations to the creators.
