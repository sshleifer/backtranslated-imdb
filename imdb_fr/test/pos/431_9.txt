I made the promise that if I ever posted a comment that was not laudatory, and then felt different, I would come back and make my heart change. So far, this is the first time this has happened. <br /> <br /> I really start to appreciate Hack. Something has clearly changed. The intrigues seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a little surreal, but the characters have grown so deep that a surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute that to a beautiful interpretation. <br /> <br /> It's not every show that can win the grid. Some need time to gain speed. I'm happy to have continued watching this program and I really hope it will last.
