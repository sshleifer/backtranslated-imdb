My wife and I saw this at the age of 17. The only good thing my dad ever did (get us in). This is "our movie" and the music is "our songs". Michelle's song is "our" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked kids on screen, but we fucked at 16, why not these kids? The film is that a rich boy impregnates a poor girl, then a rich father steals her at the end, after she gave birth in conditions of poverty. She is left alone with her child. It's a love story and a story of "growing up". The music is fantastic and the story is a story that anyone could relate to. Maybe someday it will be published on DVD.
