I always liked this guy with the hoarse voice in all these westerns. He was the teammate (Jingles) of the Wild Bill Hickock show in the fifties. In this, he possesses the perfect vehicle for his wonderful bragging character. He is harmless and no one believes him, but he is not angry and continues despite everything. When you have a guy like this, there is no challenge because the details are not there to challenge. Of course, in this episode, he is taken aboard a spaceship by a group of strangers who have no sense of humor and who believe everything they hear. They do not have the word lying in their vocabularies. In the end, it is so unbearable that they can not stand it. and then, of course, there is the secret weapon. See this just to watch Andy.
