This film is really unique. It really captures the spirit of the room, but makes it entertaining for the modern generation. The romance between Tromeo and Juliette was credible and erotic, and was not completed by many adaptations. It's also funny that I almost cried laughing. <br /> <br /> As with most Troma, it holds you in the head, taboo subjects, gore and sex, while adding very good actors and a plot of Shakespeare. You really have to see this movie to believe it! <br /> <br /> There are some rising jokes in the credits (best generic I've seen since Hot Shots) tons of Troma in jokes as well as general satire and shakespeare refs. And Lemmy from Motorhead's house tells. I lent this film to a friend and I had a job almost impossible to find. Troma at its best, this movie is truly a jewel and is part of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Although it's not the kind of movie you would watch with your mom, it could shock some people. For all those who are bored of ordinary cinema, with a delirious sense of humor, YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM.
