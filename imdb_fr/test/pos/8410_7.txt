<br /> <br /> This is public knowledge and it has already been said: No one can play Scarlett and Rhett like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley Kilmer (Kilmer no longer divorced from her ex-husband, Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett and although it is a sequel and not a re-make (God forbid !! !), she still can not live up to her voice is diabolical many times, she has brown eyes (Scarlett in both novels had green eyes and even Vivien Leigh's eyes were green) and her vocal power was not up to the task either. Scarlett is a Southern Belle; incredible talent for flirting (as she did in SCARLETT, the novel and GWTW, of course) and to be a great flirt like Scarlett, you would probably need a sharper voice, like Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br /> I guess I'm comparing Kilmer a little too much to Leigh, but when someone assumes a role as masterful as Leigh with Scarlett, you can not help but criticize any new Scarletts future. Timothy Dalton should never have emphasized anything, because Margaret Mitchell and Gable's two Rhett's in the fi I did not have any. His acting has never been really remarkable (with the possible exception of his portrait of evil that embodies King Phillip of France in THE LION IN WINTER) and he gives very little (if any) of freshness or vitality to his Rhett. <br /> <br /> Tina Kellagher (an actress born with great authenticity in her deliverance) will be the tragic victim of Mary Boyle. And then, of course, there's Sean Bean, cold, calculating and flawless, Lord Fenton, almost demonic, the sworn enemy of Mary and the future Scarlett violator. One thing I could not forgive the author was the fact that Scarlett was raped in this film (a fact that never happened in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and bad-mouthed among the Irish of the book, but it is far from being insensitive The character of Belle Watling, interpreted very horribly by Ann-Margret in a cameo role, without which we could all have lived, is another omission in the novel, but whose film was refurbished for the best-seller movie without the help of Mrs. Watling. <br /> <br /> SCARLETT is a very good movie in itself, but not quite up to this place to be GONE WITH THE WINDs more ... Another actress was highly needed for Scarlett and Rhett. <br /> <br />
