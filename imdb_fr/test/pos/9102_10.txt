I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Jack Black and Kyle Gass have certainly put thunder at the center of this epic story of friendship, rock rocking and fate. <br /> <br /> Filled with useless swear words in each sentence, sensual humor and general attitude, This film is a must for fans of D of the world, tough and tough. <br /> <br /> We follow the course of the young Jables (Jack black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) who try to recover the destiny pick, win the open-mic evening and become the largest group on the planet. The duo must overcome obstacles such as a room filled with lasers, a man with a leg and the devil to accomplish his task. I let you see if they succeed or not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack itself is impressive enough, and we now see the D in person, which makes the experience even more magical. A must for anyone who calls themselves a fan of tenacious D. Beware of the inner jokes of the first album!
