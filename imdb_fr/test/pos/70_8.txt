This film is certainly well built, begins and ends in the dark, and focuses primarily on Lili Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, who first sang "The Angel" and then the notorious spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and I watched it again recently. In the 70s, critics called it "vulgaris cinema" and lack of structure (among others), but the time was wrong. Blake Edwards has certainly produced a film of almost lyrical quality. <br /> <br /> The film skyrockets and swirls (aerial photography, Julie Andrews on the move) and captivates. Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission went bad. Given the warm chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, we must believe that they are lovers - who, in all innocence, attack each other. And in the end, love is much more important than winning wars. The same goes for the maintenance of innocence. <br /> <br /> There are many sober actors and the film reaches emotional depths that are often not seen in comedies. <br /> <br /> There are marvelous comic elements (prefiguring French Goons in Victor / Victoria), interesting diplomatic aspects (reminiscent of The Tamarind Seed, about 18 years ago) and a general sense of goodwill . <br /> <br /> Suspend any disbelief and this movie will carry you away. The songs of Julie Andrews extracted from the war and whistling "Whistling Away the Dark" are sufficient reasons to turn on the television, just for the soundtrack. And the striptease number, like the number "Jenny" in Star! works. <br /> <br /> This film has, like a good champagne, well aged. Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible. The same goes for the transfer of the laser disc from Star! on DVD. These are two interesting pieces from the meticulous and then underestimated works of Julie Andrews.
