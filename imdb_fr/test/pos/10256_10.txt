Cooley High is such a great movie that, even with the soundtrack, the cityscapes, the wardrobe and the slang of the time, it still does not seem old fashioned. The soundtrack is also a timeless classic. <br /> <br /> Instead, she absorbs you. It's a staple of a good movie. From start to finish, there is a beat and I do not get tired of watching it. <br /> <br /> Its end is unique in that it is one of the saddest and at the same time edifying of any film terminations. There may have been some since (Backdraft comes to mind), but Cooley was the first and much more emotional.
