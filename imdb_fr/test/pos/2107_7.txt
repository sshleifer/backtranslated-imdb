Alexander Lou, star of classics such as "The Super Ninja" and "Mafia vs Ninja" made the headlines here in this entertaining martial arts festival. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the evil Abbott White (who boasts of some rather scary white eyebrows) by calling on a ninja clan to overthrow the Shaolin Temple. <br /> <br /> This goal that it reaches and in addition erases most of its members, even if needless to say, one or two manage to survive and rather plan your revenge on the scoundrel Abbott. <br /> <br /> .... Ok, so the plot does not really push for creativity, but anyone watching A movie with a title like "Wu Tang vs. Ninja", aka "The Ninja Hunter", cares a lot about something as insignificant as a conspiracy? Of course not! - These are the fights that matter in these movies and chewing gum - you get what you pay for! Everyone involved in this event presents marvelously choreographed martial arts and rarely a minute seems to flow without a fight breaking out for some reason. <br /> <br /> If you like martial arts movies, then this is a must see!
