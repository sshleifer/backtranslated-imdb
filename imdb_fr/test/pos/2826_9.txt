Ok, where to start. Did you know that part of the main robots was offered to the famous teams of mime Shields and Arnez? I bet not. But they refused, complaining about the makeup of the robots. Then they faded into the darkness. Now this movie has it all. A crazy killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Many cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect rendezvous for those who love science fiction and romantic comedies. This is the first robotic romantic comedy. Now, of course, very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues. But there is very minor and can be neglected. I think couples will enjoy this movie and will want to watch it again and again. 9 STARS.
