I just watched the DVD of this award-winning movie. One Life Stand is a striking drama that, through its rhythm, black-and-white shots and atmospheric music, paints a very convincing and honest picture. It is a story about the dilemma of life around power, sex and control, highlighted by some sad and lonely lives. The mother (played very well by Maureen Carr) is tense and attracted to herself. The father only appears on the sidelines and yet constitutes a powerful and crucial element of the drama. The money is hidden in boxes and shoes. <br /> <br /> The writing was superb and I loved the close-up sensual shots such as nails, red lips, a candle, mirrors, etc. used made very intimate. It's a harrowing tale, with sexual undertones, while the Glasgow fog in the dark streets adds sadness to the desperation of sad characters. <br /> <br /> Very memorable shots are transmitted simply by a walk or a fallen shoulder. - like Trise walking away under the bridge. And the stunned, wounded look on the face of Trise's call center, who hopes to help people by using tarot cards, while she listens to a caller talking about her own abuse. <br /> <br /> At first, we see John Paul, wide-eyed and innocent, being photographed while he wants to try modeling. Trise, his mother, is deceived and makes bad choices for him, pushing him away as she tries to keep him. John Paul's models turn into escort work and Trise's boss offers him money and ends up going to an appointment. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. An excellent scene is one where they eat a fairly normal meal and begin to open a little, when the father appears with his dark presence and blurs everything. But this and other things offer moments of hope. <br /> <br /> I sometimes felt that the film's rhythm was too intense, but it's a small detail in another difficult, memorable and memorable film. a little different. This contrasts with most American films that are either total fantasy or the real "world" seen through dirty glasses. This film describes life with all its asperities and displays unforgettable images. <br /> <br /> This is not a "light entertainment", but a drama that provokes reflection and real life. <br /> <br /> One Life Stand is a truly engaging film and emotionally honest.
