* The places of Al Capone <br /> <br /> * Who shot JFK? <br /> <br /> * Cynthia Gibb wins the part of "Gypsy" in the remake of television <br /> <br /> These are some of the great unsolved mysteries of the 20th century. If not, how can I say it except that I thought she was unbelievably terrible. Mannerist mannerism, bad reactionary play (that is, that empty, stoic look as he co-starred in the scene speaks) and a singing voice that most vocal coaches would describe as "mediocre". But she's incredibly beautiful and after all, is not that what Gypsy's character is? Stop her appearance because she did not cut mustard in the talent department? <br /> <br /> For the rest ... Bette is fantastic. Whether she's playing herself or playing Mama Rose, it works one way or another, and I thought Rosalind Russell was as exciting as the original gypsum. Peter Riegart as "Herbie" is the perfect sober aluminum for Bette's exuberant mother. It is medium-temperature porridge between Midler's hot dish and Gibb's cold stone porridge. Riegart is right. <br /> <br /> One last word to the man responsible for Cher's jokes for decades: Bob Mackie. Drag queens would kill for the pomp and glamor exhibited here. Everything is coming glitter and bugle beads! <br /> <br />
