The second film about the adventures of the Gauls couple Asterix & Obelix is ​​10 times better than the first. The humor is great (and irreverent) and the script is well executed, taken from the original Goscinny & Uderzo comics from 1965. I fell asleep with the first movie (although I'm a big fan of Asterix) and I was not willing to see this sequel, but I'm glad this movie proved the opposite. Excellent comedy for everyone. Highly recommended!
