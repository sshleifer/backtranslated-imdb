This extremely entertaining short film is considered one of the best short films of all time, and I certainly will not discuss it with that. Even in a country where high-caliber animated shorts are regularly created, this film still manages to stand out. If you ever have the chance to see this movie, please do it. It lasts only ten minutes and yet contains a man obsessed with saws, a woman who vacuumed in the tub and a nuclear war. What more do you want in a movie?
