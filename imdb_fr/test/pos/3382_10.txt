It's the best movie I've ever seen. He has all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that even war can not destroy. <br /> <br /> The most gorgeous casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were the best students in this film. <br /> <br /> If you see Part 1, you will want to see everything. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at home and then went to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> I am a civil war buff, but this film has aroused my grandchildren's interest in history. Any movie that can get kids to learn the story is great. I have books I, II and III and when girls come from Florida every year, they want to see North and South.
