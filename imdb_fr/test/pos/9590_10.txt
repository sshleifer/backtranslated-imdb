I'm like other fans who love this comedy, I was waiting for it on DVD. I have it on VHS and I'm so sick of waiting for a release and worry that my VHS copy would ruin the material needed to burn it to DVD. The picture and sound are excellent to my surprise. If someone else wants a copy, send me a message to <br /> <br /> stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and for £ 7, I'll put it on a DVD, and then print the DVD. and get it in the post to you. £ 7.00 only covers my costs and the registered delivery etc. with maybe a little more, so I'm not after making money on it, I'd just like the whole world to see that gem ignored in a comedy. I recently saw a copy of ebay gotten for over £ 26, amazing. How can they not take out this classic. Write me for payment details like check or Paypal etc etc
