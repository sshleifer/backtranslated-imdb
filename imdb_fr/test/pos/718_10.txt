Jennifer Montgomery's "Art for Teachers of Children" is a surprising and disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's rough camera and cinematography combined with the brilliantly non-emotional performances she evokes from her cast reinforce the shocking and brutal realism of this autobiographical story of the seduction of Jennifer, her married, elderly boarding counselor. 14 years old. The scenes between the incredible actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen filmed. The lesson finally learned here? "There is nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art." Well, I would highly recommend this remarkable work of art to anyone who is interested in independent cinema that inspires reflection.
