Imagine that you have just flown for 18 hours. You have been on a business trip to South Africa. You are a well paid professional. You live in the United States for 20 years. You are in your thirties, you have a wife a little boy and another baby on the way. One thing, even if you have a green card, you are still Egyptian. In transit, you are asked to come with 2 security guards, you now know that you are overpowered, hooded and chained, and that you will be returned after a brief interrogation (but still reasonably civil)! This is what happens to Anwar el Ibrahimi at the beginning of the film. It's a story of pain and (literally) torture. This is one of the lines of the story. We follow his wife's attempts to obtain more information. We follow the (cold) bureaucrats behind the restitution. Another story concerns the family of the man conducting the interrogation of Anwar el Ibrahimi. There are also other stories and at the end, they all come together perfectly. Although the most famous actors like Reese Witherspoon (as a distraught pregnant woman), Jake Gyllenhaal (as a CIA recruit required to watch the interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (as Whitman Horn, CIA specialist), these are the most unknown story actors and give him his heart. For me, the actor playing the unfortunate Mr. El Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) was the heart and soul of this film. His portrayal of a man in distress was scandalously well done. It's almost like he's being tortured for real! Israeli actor Yigal Naor was also very impressive as a worried father and leader of extremely cruel torture. Hard to watch and not really fun, but still very useful.
