Sometimes reading user comments on IMDB distresses me for the species. For anyone to reject 2001: an odyssey of space as "boring", it must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of filmmaking. Finally, I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and empty: they understand their audience. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, those who can not appreciate the work of Kubrick are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and pure virtuosity that contributed to the creation of this epic. It is the film that has put science into "science fiction", and its description of the journey into space and the future of humanity remains unmatched to this day. He was so ahead of his time that mankind has still not caught up. <br /> <br /> The year 2001 is above all a technical film. The reason it is slow and full of minutiae is that it was a realistic look at the future of technology (and the past, in the breathtaking opening scenes). The greatest strength of the film lies in the details. Remember that when this movie was shot, the man still had not arrived on the moon ... but here it is in 2001 and this is just the beginning of the trip. To create a vision of the future so incredibly detailed, that 35 years later is always what we have best, it's amazing - I still can not understand how some of the photos were made. The only notable mistake of the film was the optimism with which it predicted the technological (and social) development of humanity. It is unfortunate that the year 2001 does not look like the movie of 2001, not that of Kubrick. <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible special effects, camera work and scenography, Kubrick also gives the viewer a lot of food to think about what it means to be human and where the human race is going. Yes, the end is strange and hard to understand - but that's the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of considering it, it's now up to the public to continue. There is no clear resolution, no final stop, because the public could then stop thinking after the last round. I know this is what most viewers seem to want these days, but Kubrick will not let us go lightly. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see that this movie is one of the IMDB's top 100 films, and only wants it to be even higher. Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest filmmakers in the world and in 2001, his greatest achievement. 10/10.
