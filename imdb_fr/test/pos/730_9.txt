Nemesis Game is a captivating film full of riddles, death, mystery and philosophy. In its simplest sense, the film deals with the search for answers and what happens when you finally find them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak on a path that darkens as he becomes more convincing. The final answer seems more dangerous than it's worth, yet Sarah is so close to understanding all of this. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally give meaning to the chaos of life? <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by Jesse Warn. Although this is Warn's first feature film, the film does not reflect that at all, but rather shows polishing and an artistic approach to telling the story. Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a fascinating depth of complexity to watch. I would really like to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> Being based on riddles, it's a very cerebral movie. That's my thing, as it's mine, so I totally recommend seeing Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5 / 5
