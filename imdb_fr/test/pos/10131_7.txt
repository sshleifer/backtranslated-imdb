Can black youth with intellectual disabilities be a catalyst to unite people in a city in South Carolina? The answer seems to be that, despite his disability, James Kennedy understood much more than what he was credited with and became a staple of the sports scene. In addition, the film says how many of us neglect people who have problems that can be solved if we had only the patience that coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart. <br /> <br /> "Radio", directed by Michael Tolllin, is a film formula inspired by a true story. However, the film is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances that the director was able to draw from his superb cast. <br /> <br /> The coach Jones plays a determining role in the research of the young man, called Radio by passion for the collectors, involved in the sport, a passion which he discovers in this retarded man who has not had only hard knocks in his young life. Originally from underprivileged backgrounds, Radio lives with his mother who protects him and questions the intentions of the coach. The radio is first seen by schoolchildren as a mascot, then his sunny attitude wins everyone's acceptance because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body. <br /> <br /> The film owes a lot to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who are a great couple as coach and radio. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our time, is never bothered by anything that gives thanks to his presence. He gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility of repairing something that bothers him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at its best representing the young man with an intellectual disability. <br /> <br /> The support cast is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does an interesting job as a mother of Radio. Alfre Woodard, another good actress plays the principle of high school with style. Debra Winger has only a few scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> "The radio", although sentimental, will be hot in everyone's hearts, because it shows how much we tend to see some people in our society do not know anything about and how speed we are to judge them. Michael Tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us.
