I love the premise, but its reading value only concerns certain parts (the opening scene of course). Some characters are a little outrageous, but they entertain no less. I think the Ballping sh-t was pushing him. I know it was to show that Nick and Casey were living abroad in LA and to explain why Casey abandoned his lifestyle. I just think the story of the flashback could have been better. In addition, the Jamaican guy who hits on the phone is smart and fun, but again, I think the story was told sloppily. It seems really amazing. I actually believe that Swordfish (Woods' other movie) is more important than some parts on Thursday because the government keeps the secret all the time and organizations are set up that the public will never know. <br /> <br /> Thursday is the best Quentin film I've seen. I think Woods is imaginative, smart and in the spirit; However, his work needs more maturation to reach the level of the Natural Born Killer script (not Stone's movie). How old is he anyway?
