It's probably one of the best Portuguese movies I've ever seen. I really liked the plot, because as the story unfolded, you'd get more involved in how their world was really upside down ... There's just one part that does not does not really seem to be part of the movie, namely the girls' strip ... It does not add anything important to the story, it looks like it's only for men. The end is a little unexpected, although, at the same time, somewhat expected. If you do not understand, then follow me: after so many strange events, the viewer is so used to the quirks that ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susana) seems totally natural after seeing the rest of the movie . But most importantly, Sorte Nula is a film that makes you think about trying to solve mysterious occurrences, making fun of their unlucky lives and screwing up your perception of what can happen in minutes, when you turn your back away from whatever thing ... so far, I rate it 8/10
