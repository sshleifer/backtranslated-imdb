Suzumiya Haruhi no yuutsu (The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) might at first glance make you think that this is just another animated comedy / school drama. Well no! The frame has just been a school environment. It's a comedy, but very intelligent with a lot of sarcasm. And the characters have a psychological sublime almost of the same kind as that found in the works of Ingmar Bergman. The episodes are broadcast, it seems, broken down, that is to say that the pilot is in fact the episode 11. This allows to present small clues for the next episodes. The show is an adaptation of Nagaru Tanigawa's popular novels series about Haruhi Suzumiya. <br /> <br /> And history, then? As in all episodes, the story revolves around Haruhi Suzumiya, who tries to calm his own boredom by embarking on adventures. Haruhi herself has no interest in ordinary humans and actively searches for extraterrestrials, time travelers and espers (people with supernatural powers). To find this kind of people, she formed a club that she called the SOS brigade (Save the world by overloading it with fun: Brigade Haruhi Suzumiyas). With the exception of Haruhi, the other members of the SOS Brigade are Kyon. He is the real protagonist of the series. It is his point of view that we follow the story. He just sat down in class when Haruhi came up with the idea of ​​forming the SOS Brigade. He is skeptical of most of the club's activities to make sure Haruhi does not go too far, and he is the only one in the class Haruhi likes to talk to. Another member is Yuki Nagato, who is "the indispensable member of silence" and is also the only remaining member of the Literature Club, a room occupied by the SOS Brigade in search of a free club room. She does not mind if the SOS brigade uses her club room, as long as she can sit in a corner and read her books. She also participates in the activities of the brigades. Mikuru Asahina was "voluntarily arrested" by Haruhi because the club needed a Lolita-like mascot to make everything suspicious happen. She often plays the role of maid. The last member is the always smiling Itsuki Koizumi, who happens to be the "mysterious transfer student" (that is, he has transferred two months in the semester that Haruhi considers to be mysterious). <br /> <br /> Haruhi thinks that All members, except Kyon, are randomly selected at school, but they actually have their own interest in it.
