I note this film on a curve, in other words, it's not the biggest film that has ever been shot, but it does exactly what it was intended to do. It's an excellent T & A movie. I do not know how many T's or A's were seen in this movie, but I saw a shot with 16 T naked at the same time, just to give you an idea . There are topless girls all the way through. There is a wet t-shirt competition scene. And the highlight is a touchdown football game between two women's teams and every time a touch is scored, the entire opposing team loses a piece of clothing. I do not know why this gets such a low rating here. Maybe those who got low scores thought to go to Citizen Kane. I love this movie and I hope to find other similar ones. If you are looking for a good movie T & A campy, I recommend this one.
