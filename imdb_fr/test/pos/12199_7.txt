Once again, despicable government agencies will stop at nothing to prevent the public from knowing some memorable events. In this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the ecology of the planet. Although the creature is not an E.T. it seems to be a friend of a young, who protects him at all costs, not realizing that it is a baby of the species and that it will become much bigger ?? and badder This 2005 series had a lot to offer. It's a family drama, science fiction, a thriller with more than a few comical moments. The characters are credible, well played and well photographed. The show holds the attention. Of course, as in any science-fiction show, you have to put an end to disbelief. And I think it's here. Alas, the series crashed after the first season, so we never had a resolution. It's infuriating. There is a general comment that deserves to be made here. Many television networks and / or film distribution companies cancel, quite arbitrarily, an apparently excellent television series ?? particularly intelligent ones of science fiction. There can be very good reasons for this, even if hearings are treated with the greatest contempt and are rarely explained. This in itself is annoying. What really makes my goat is that, after canceling the series, they emit it as far as possible, on DVD, for the obvious purpose of milking the cash cow as much as possible. For the previous viewers of the series who are doing well, they know what they will do but ?? many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger. Two that immediately come to mind are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5". If you've heard good things about the show and have not seen them, you buy the sanded DVD and you have an unsolved plot problem. it makes me very angry !! I really appreciated "Surface" and did not realize that the poor characters would end up in a situation that seemed totally untenable. and we will never know what happened next. I think there should be an important note on all these DVD issues, stating that the story is unfinished. Today, I'm checking out TV series purchases (IMDB is a great starting point) to find out if a "full" series is really complete or not. Beware of the buyer.
