In my opinion, Flatley spoiled the first show with his ridiculous ego. He was disrespectful to his dance partner, tried to defeat everyone and had no awareness of the spirit of Riverdance. It's good that he left the series. Colin Dunne, the new male lead, is superb. When he and Jean Butler dance together, the magic works! Eileen Ivers 'violin is amazing (as are Noel Eccles drums) and Maria Pages' "Fire Dance" is worth the price! When Pages and Ivers meet, towards the end of the show to form a musical duo, it's a real treasure. I agree, the edition is not free, but no technical gap can stifle this extraordinary feat. This is the one to get. Riverdance never existed! It's true!
