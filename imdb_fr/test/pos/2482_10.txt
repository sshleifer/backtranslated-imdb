This gives you a kick in the belly. There are other movies with more convincing characters, a more realistic story and perhaps even more in-depth about political invocations. But again, most of them are not led by Peter Watkins. Perhaps the only British Film genius to emerge from the 1960s, Watkins has produced a host of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the world of exterior aesthetics - the world of political events, social problems and government solutions. Thus, his work is probably less "filmic" than, say, political, what some might call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality. Again, why would not art allow itself to engage? Watkins dares. And succeeds. You will not feel good with this one. You will not feel happy. In fact, you will not really like the movie; it is uncompromising, honest, direct, without shame; a blow in the face, in short. You can not help but get angry, you can not resist what the things you see affect you. That's what makes Watkins' films so rewarding.
