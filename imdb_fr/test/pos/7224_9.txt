Tromeo and Juliet is perhaps the best modernization of Shakespeare I have ever seen, not because there is a lot of competition, but still ... <br /> <br /> In total, Tromeo and Juliet is certainly one of the best films of Troma, one of the little pearls hidden in a huge pile of dung. It's a funny, action-packed action that tells the world's greatest love story, but still manages to follow the original story as closely as possible, except for this kind of movie . Well, except the end, where Tromeo and Juliet killed Juliet's abusive father and live happily together in a sunny suburb for the rest of their lives with their mutually mutant children. <br /> <br /> THIS is the high-school movie school literature classes should show instead of having poor students read hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare's scripts. Thumbs up!
