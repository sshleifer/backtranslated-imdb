Barbara Stanwyck is a pure delight for this war comedy about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with the family of a popular magazine writer on his Connecticut farm. The problem is that she does not have a husband, baby or farm, as she writes in her column, and she can not even cook; his good recipes are provided by his good friend "Uncle" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York. <br /> <br /> Things get even more complicated when his strict publisher boss invites himself for Christmas. A ploy is hastily planned, with its stifling fiance providing a Connecticut farm, neighbors providing a borrowed baby and a quick wedding planned when the publisher does not look. But when the handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications ensue, because the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks for the nice boy of the navy, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> It's a charming and warm place. A film that skillfully balances humor and feeling is a great showcase for Barbara Stanwyck, who stands out for her considerable comedic talent, aided by such wonderful actors as Sydney Greenstreet, Una O'Connor, SZSakall and many others. A Christmas party at City Hall is a feast for the eyes, and the unexpected and feminine side of Stanwyck is a wonderful surprise for the viewers who saw her mainly as a hard, bitchy woman and in women's roles fatal. Really a wonderful movie that has stood the test of time.
