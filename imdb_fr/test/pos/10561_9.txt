After watching Sarah Waters' Tipping the Velvet, I decided to watch Fingersmith. The characters were just as good in both performances, even though Rachael Stirling was missing in Fingersmith's adaptation. <br /> <br /> The whole story was good choice, the twist and the denouement of the characters were incredible! Rachael Stirling misses only the excellent watch! <br /> <br /> If you love two girls' romance, this is not one of the best movies to watch. <br /> <br /> It takes a different twist from Tipping The Velvet but just as well. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to everyone!
