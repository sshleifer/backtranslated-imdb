Rock Star is a "beautiful" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who are not supposed to be nice are really nice. Chris is a nice guy who is learning a life lesson. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, despite all the kindness. Maybe I'm just used to all the anxiety of X Gen music. In some ways, the film was a caricature of rock stars and was not hard enough to be credible. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg's game is pretty good. Jennifer Aniston did a good job, but it was not complicated. She was a nice girl. <br /> <br /> Go see him. If you have ever attended a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, go see it.
