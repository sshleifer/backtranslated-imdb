The film is really very well done, which is great, beautiful and directed with passion. You can say that every plan is thought and executed perfectly. For movie lovers, this is particularly an excellent watch that should be able to appreciate its beauty and passion for cinema. <br /> <br /> Difficult to place this film under a label. It's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy. Instead, it's more like a movie with its own style that does things the way it does. It does not necessarily follow the rules of cinema and includes many elements of different genres. <br /> <br /> But just like the film, its main character, the movie becomes a bit slow and boring. The artistic style of the staging attempts to hide the fact that the story is actually quite simple and that it's more like the film relying solely on its style and the general atmosphere created by the film. This does not make the movie horrible or anything, but it prevents it from being a real absolute must. At times, the film also has the impression of being too poetic and letting the images speak too much for itself. This seems a little exaggerated in some places, even if, overall, the film works wonderfully. <br /> <br /> It features great camera work and unique stories, making it an original good movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
