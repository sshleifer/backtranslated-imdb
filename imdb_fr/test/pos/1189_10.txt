Thank you my God for this movie. It is a talented document that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The music is just amazing. It is full of writing, performance, arrangement and infectious production skills. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. Undervalued talent performances such as Nell Carter and Ren Woods lift my mind every time I hear them. Although the film may be different from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the casting album, which I find really rude and underdeveloped. Here, the arrangements are completed and developed into dynamic pieces that could not have been produced in a staging. <br /> <br /> But music is not the only thing extraordinary in this film. The juxtaposition of almost hyper-realistic dialogue scenes (which reminds me of Altman films) interspersed with exuberant music and dance numbers, really works. All the talents of this film - directing, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costume designer, artistic direction - blend perfectly into one of the best musical films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how much we know about "Hair" characters, based on very little information or intrigue. They are not drawn as caricatures, but as realistic and very human people. We see a small glimpse of their origin, but the portrait is complemented by vignettes reminiscent of characters on the surface through a successful acting, staging and editing. The misogyny of Berger and Hud is an underlying theme that colors their characters by exposing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. The scene of Berger's family life reveals important details about her psychology and the brief overview of Claude's house tells us a lot about his past through the simple, realistic and authentic interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father . <br /> <br /> I like fashion in this movie. It mixes provocatively ideas of the sixties with looks VERY seventies (we must neglect the hair extensions of Treat Williams ...). It is a document showing how chic the late seventies was, contrary to popular belief that the era was made in bad taste. Claude's beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979, and the hair and clothing of singers and dancers (especially those in white during the Central Park scene) mix decades to suggest the timelessness of the themes of the music. These elements merge with Twyla Tharpe's extraordinary, ultra-modern choreography in a way that enhances the artistic talent of both. <br /> <br /> "Hair" is not a movie that rewards cynicism. If you succeed with expectations, you will probably be captive by artists who are not bound by your rules. For me, it opened my eyes, ears and mind to an insightful and passionate musical dialogue about war, friendship and family that transcends its time and still has meaning and relevance to me at this day.
