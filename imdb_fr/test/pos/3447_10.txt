I saw some of Mr. Boorman's films and I did not like them much. Not that they are bad movies, on the contrary, good movies, but not content that I personally found entertaining. However, I think that Where the Heart Is, although intended for the American public with little knowledge of art, is a master like a satire and a social commentary of the time when it was shot. I had to replace this film in my collection at least half a dozen times, since every time I lend it to someone I know can appreciate his art at all levels, my copy does not come back to me. the house, lol. The last time it took 7 years to replace it because it was exhausted for VHS sales, it was never made in DVD format, and it was not until one of the premium cable channels was released. executes to be able to record it again. <br /> <br /> After the clear social comments, my favorite thing is Timna Woollard's paintings. It's been 15 years since I was looking for someone or anywhere that could take me where his job is available for sale. Or even better, a copy of the paintings of the film without having generated them. I have a piece of my house in which I have dedicated myself to putting copies of his paintings, and nobody seems to know if it has already been published in the form of a salon book, a video aquarium or a documentary of his work. . If anyone knows where I can get a copy of Timna's work or if his studio is in England, do not hesitate to contact me by email.
