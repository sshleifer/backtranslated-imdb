Cardiff, Wales. A group of 5 companions are bored deeply in this city. There is Jip working in a clothing store. Coop, an easy-going DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they are waiting for one thing: the weekend. At that time, they went out to a nightclub and, to the sound of tech no music, they experimented with different drugs, including ecstasy. Then they usually continue the party at a friend's house. At the end of this great time on Sunday, the feelings are: fatigue, melancholy, nothing but the memory of a night of madness ... <br /> <br /> Surfer on the wave of the notorious success of " Trainspotting "(1996), this first film written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variant of the concept of hedonism. This means: how to have fun as much as possible knowing that you have a reduced amount of time. Indeed, as I wrote previously, for the 5 main characters of the film, the week is a hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and live a raging period without the pressure (in addition , Jip speaks in a sequence of the positive aspects of shooting in the skin: you are numb, you feel no pressure, you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth.Kerrigan's relentless director's style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and attention reserved for the 5 protagonists, live only to enjoy as much as possible of a hedonist weekend.To add a little more the festive atmosphere in which bathes his film, Kerrigan n ' is not afraid to include dream sequences that represent the fantasy or embarrassment of his characters. "Human Traffic (1999) is also served by a particularly dynamic soundtrack, a perfect symbiosis between sound and music. The weekend of euphoria finally makes it possible to put aside momentarily the usual dull image of the popular social classes, the British cinema has studied a lot. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, when a film exploits (whether it is conscientious or not) the fame of another famous, it is rarely at the height of its brilliance. predecessor. "Human traffic" is in this state. There is little inventiveness in terms of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and we can note some unnecessary digressions (Jip who in the nightclub goes into the office of the director and tells him a story of cock and bull to allow Moff to enter the club but it is useless because it succeeds to come without problems). Kerrigan can also be criticized for ignoring the dramatic aspects that the story might have involved. His film can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole are virtually unexplored. Too bad! This could have conveyed the message that even in the happiest moments, there may be something terrible that is getting ready and that can collapse them. The same remark could also be made when Coop suffers from jealousy because Nina is talking to a guy. <br /> <br /> It may not be the last big film of the 90s because it is indicated on the DVD cover, but "Human Traffic" is to be considered as a good little incisive film that translates, with the styles and fashions of the late twentieth century, a desire to have fun without ulterior motives or problems. An ideal movie to start a party or before going to a club.
