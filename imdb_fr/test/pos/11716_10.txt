Meester Sharky, you look so ... normal. You will never get a table at this posh cocktail restaurant / bistro. On the other, I eat grapes and pâté every day. Do you like my fur coat with all the finishes? My huge rings in gold? Or maybe you like these blondes, the bombs, all qualified in aerobics and petanques naked, which decorate my long brown velvety sofa like so many skylarks on a plate of foie gras and fried figs. You like? You can not have! Zey are all mine. <br /> <br /> You will never own 'er as I possessed'. Domino was the best, except Mom. You do not understand the art of making love. Just look at your lower mustache. It's almost funny for me, no, to think about this ridiculous protrusion on your silly face, while you choke around Domino's love hill like a pig looking for truffle in the forest, the forest growling and swaying in the burning wind of desire! You're still losing Sharky. <br /> <br /> When I make love to women, I know it, Sharky, I know it. Zey learn, zey learn until he becomes the teacher. No nano-maths, the arts of love. Domino was the seedling that I watered. I watered it very often. Sharky everywhere. Its fragrant petals, its proud stem, everywhere. She will wither under your ridiculous pipe, like the puffed out five minutes too early. <br /> <br /> I have to leave now, Sharky, you bother me so much with your shameful behavior. It is you who will throw the pissoir like a nauseating odor. <br /> <br /> Good luck!
