I was still living with my parents when they broadcast this on Dutch television. Usually, I watch movies and the other does not care. But we all sat down and watched this movie. This kind of film was broadcast Wednesday night. This is the story of a woman who will soon die. But before she dies, she wants to make sure that her (many) children will have the best possible foster parents. We were looking at this and my father (the most emotional of us four) started crying. I followed almost immediately and soon my sister and mother were torn too. We were there, totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. If you want a good cry, this is the one for you!
