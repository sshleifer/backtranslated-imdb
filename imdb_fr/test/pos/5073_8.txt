The cast of the group attracts the crowd in the theater, despite the ominous title. Jake Gyllenhaal invited Conan O'Brien to promote the film and explained that "Rendition" was a euphemism for obtaining information through torture. Since September 11, "extraordinary renditions" have allowed the government's intelligence services to extract people unconditionally and to use all necessary means in exchange for information. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaal plays the CIA analyst, Douglas Freeman (remarks the irony)) who is torn by his assignment, which makes him look like a mere observer in an unorthodox interrogation procedure in an underground detention center located outside the United States. <br /> <br /> Omar Metwally embodies the alleged terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, the Egyptian national and the green cardholder of the American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son wait for Anwar to return from a scientific conference after his sudden disappearance of the plane's passenger manifesto. She is looking for help from her academic friend who works in the government and learns that intelligence chief Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind all this. <br /> <br /> Rendition is directed by Hollywood novice Gavin Hood (who is to make X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and raises the question of whether such "extraordinary rendition" is exercised in real life. The film came out locally as a result of the explosion of Glorietta (bombing?), And a pivotal scene in the film occurs when a bomb explodes on a public square, which had to give chills to the spine of every spectator. See the explosive chart with a single red and yellow sign, Aajala (Ayala?) At the top right of the screen, as well as the effect of silence and slow images amplified the impact of the scene's actual coincidence. <br /> <br /> There are lessons to be learned from this film and it all comes down to personal decisions we make every day. We all have choices that we can exercise at will and we often do not always (how we want to) affect their consequences on others, who can become unfortunate victims of the circumstances. The "common good" should not be an imposed choice that our leaders must make if each of us already chooses correctly at the source. This is a utopia to build.
