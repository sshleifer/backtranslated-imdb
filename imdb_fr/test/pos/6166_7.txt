It seems that no matter the number of films made on the subject, the stories of the Second World War are not lacking. It goes without saying that a conflict of such magnitude that the world war would captivate the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with sufficient material to found a story. Dark Blue World is a film that does not deal with the great traditional battles of war, does not tell the story of many of its personalities and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the major powers allied or axial. Dark Blue World ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for the nations they occupy. <br /> <br /> The film beautifully portrays the challenges faced by the Czech pilots piloted by the Royal Air Force the frustration they felt both at the language barrier between them and other travelers, but also to refrain from revenge on the Germans until their new formation. <br /> <br /> Dark Blue World also works very well outside the arena of the war movie as being a story about human relationships. A love triangle develops between the two main characters and an English woman, which complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers. This relationship is extremely well played as a whole, becoming almost a father-son relationship many times. <br /> <br /> The aerial fight in the film is among the best and is also very interesting to explore the cultural challenges. mentioned above as men struggle to fly their machines, fight the enemy and relay commands and responses in an unknown language. The tension and struggle of these scenes continue the tension between the men on the ground, just as the tension on the ground continues to be felt in the air. <br /> <br /> This may not be a movie for everyone. The hardcore war movie buff will perhaps find his exploration of relationships a little confusing, but overall, it's an excellent film, whether or not warlike.
