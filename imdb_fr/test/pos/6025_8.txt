The plot begins in an interesting way, however, towards the end, too many people die in too short a time, turning into a massacre the thriller aspect of the story. <br /> <br /> The only real highlights were Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, which was once again their excellent self. Nice attempt with a last third inappropriate, but a good end.
