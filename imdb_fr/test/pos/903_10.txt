It's a well done action movie. There are a lot of fight scenes, the acting is convincing (for this genre) and RS1 is great. I do not know why people feel obliged to get rid of RS1, I thought that its effects were very well executed and that its graphics were superb. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie. <br /> <br /> That said, I must tell you that Richard Sun is one of the worst Hong Kong actors I have ever watched. At least RS1 had the good idea of ​​killing him. Now, for anyone who thought that Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actor ... he was not supposed to be taken seriously! I just had the pleasure of watching Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same character in the same way! DO NOT JUDGE THIS IS A FILM OF MAN THINKING! IT IS NOT EXPECTED TO DEMAND TO THINK! Just to be appreciated, that's all. I hope they will do another soon.
