I do not understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently available only through an Australian video production company, but that is the unfortunate darkness of this Peter Sellers classic (Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide continues to give him the same criticism they gave him in the 1970s). With so many thieves exposed scenes, Sellers plays what is perhaps his most hilarious role. It all starts with the discovery of a patient who has expired at 11:15, but Sellers says the corpse is still alive, because the new day does not start until noon! The last straw for the beleaguered hospital commissioner arrives in this room itself, the sign "Do not disturb" still on the door; once he has left the room (a handkerchief holding his nose), he has a brief conversation with the doctor. DOCTOR: "We can not save them all!" The man was at least 85. COMMISSIONER: "How old was he when he passed away, 63 years old? "Harold Gould plays an inept surgeon who closes his eyes when the knife comes in, Richard Lenz (whose" pompous "reporter in" The Shootist "was kicked in the back by John Wayne) plays the patient exposing the fraud (He only came for a chest x-ray, until they discovered he owned a house.) Also in the on-screen cast (and providing excellent flavored music in the countryside) , Keith Allison, former guitarist of Paul Revere and the Raiders, who also worked with Michael Nesmith on some recordings of Monkees (and co-wrote "The Municipal Court of My Aunt" with Nesmith on "Birds, Bees and Monkees "from 1968. Alas, it lacks some images of this engraving, including a topless sequence with Uschi Digard towards the end, also a scene with actress Kathleen Freeman (who wants to use green stamps o finance her operation), who gets screwed in his office by the seller, will never be seen again (in the uncut version, he returns to his office to find that she wrote in large print on the wall "PRINTE INJUDI"; his answer? "misspelled price!").
