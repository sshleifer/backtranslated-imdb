When I was young, I was a big fan of Naked Gun movies, but recently I watched Police Sqaud! and I think it's great! Leslie Nielson is great, Alan North is cool, and who the hell is Rex Hamilton? Anyway, it's a crazy show. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of this show when they perform the freeze frame during the closing credits. I think my favorite is when Norberg (not O.J.) enters the scene and tries to adapt to the freeze frame. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem for me is that the cigarette gag becomes very old (when Drebin shows someone a cigarette and asks him "Cigarette?" and that the person replies, "Yes, I know. ") I think they used it too often, whatever their choice. <br /> <br /> Good game, good gags, great show! <br /> <br /> 7/10
