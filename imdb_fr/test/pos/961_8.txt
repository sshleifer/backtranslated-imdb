Who said it had to be credible? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before sitting down to watch this movie. You will enjoy the experience a lot more. You'll find yourself forgiving some of the oddest plot configurations of the movie and simply accepting it for what it is: a family film. I enjoyed not having to worry about "dubious elements" in a children's movie for once. This is worth to me the price of the ticket. And he manages to maintain his health without being obvious about it - older kids will enjoy this movie. Enough good mood to keep interested adults. Very good movie.
