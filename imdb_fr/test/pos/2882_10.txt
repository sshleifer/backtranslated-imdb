I will always think of Mr. Firth as Dorian Gray, if I live to be 100 years old. <br /> <br /> Perfectly interpreted and directed, bringing Oscar Wilde's vision, spirit and humor with utter absolute perfection on television. <br /> <br /> More evidence that the BBC is largely catching up with the talent it does not always have money. <br /> <br /> A must for all Wilde fans and for all others. Inspired and perfected, all the actors looked perfect for the role and each shot was well played. <br /> <br /> In the end, I discovered that I loved each character in a unique way. the guy had never inspired. Look at it, then try to look at another version. It's just not the same thing, is it?
