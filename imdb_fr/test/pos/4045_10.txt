People comparing this film to big blockbusters like The Lord of the Rings or Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the turn that this film will have had. Although the big special effects department is missing and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a successful fusion of two old folk tales here. Actor's talent, although not a list, is always excellent and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger film with a list distribution. My favorite of this film is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as a Snow Queen herself was very moving, aided enormously by an extraordinary wardrobe and make-up. She has injected humanity and a feeling of pathos into the character of the fallen season, corrupted by the evil magic of the devil. Fonda aside from the acting game was not what we expected from Hollywood, which is, I think, a good thing, because Hollywood seems to be running out of ideas on how to train his comedian talents for interpret roles. CGI and other special effects take us away from actors who all use the same tips. Instead, it shows new ideas and a real reflection of the actors on how they can find new variations on the old themes of love and danger.
