Whenever Hayao Miyazaki does "tri-fecta" (writes, directs and animates a film), he makes a classic film for all ages. He did it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of a fish girl on a tight leash with her younger sisters by her father, a former bitter sorcerer. named Fujimoto. The fish escapes from her father and climbs aboard a jellyfish where she is caught in a dredging operation and gets stuck in a bottle. This underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborate animated scenes ever made and is in itself a reason to look for theatrical release. Miyazaki, who does not fear having an animated scene, has outdone herself. There were literally hundreds of individually drawn sea creatures of all sizes imaginable, all moving at the same time. <br /> <br /> When the fish escapes the dredging operation while stuck in the bottle, a five-year-old boy named Sousuke sees her in the water and can break the bottle, saving her . Since she is the result of her father's magic, she is capable of magic herself - and her father is actively trying to get her back. The boy names the Ponyo fish. Just when Sousuke learns that Ponyo can talk, his father picks it up successfully. <br /> <br /> After a war of will with his father, Ponyo manages to escape again with the ability to transform himself into a human being. She meets Sousuke again during a storm and the story continues in an interesting way. There is a factor of kindness in this film that rivals and surpasses no doubt that of Tonari no Totoro. Joe Hisaishi once again provided exceptional musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simple - as are Miyazaki's movies in general - and should attract a wide range of viewers. Although I have not seen enough to be sure, the film does not seem to make it a topic of discussion for researchers, as Sen did in Chihiro no Kamikakushi. Nevertheless, it is the ultimate entertainment movie. I gave the film a rating of ten out of ten.
