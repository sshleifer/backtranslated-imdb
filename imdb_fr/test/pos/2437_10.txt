It was a sweet introduction for the most intelligent sailor in the world, Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "in croud", Merciurios. At first, he wrote a love letter to Ami, which was going to put it (of course) and, now, Friend regards him as a chibi-Einstien, and he's attractive (he ended up looking like Umino (Melvin )). It was a scene "Halarios" (expesialy of Minako, "It's not a skin of my neck" (HOT!)) Well, I really like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon series, I personally think it's is the best anime of all! funny, but not as adventurous as Sailor Moon R- It looked more like the movie "S". I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with a real Player, and it was very good. (On all)
