It takes a lot for a film to reach the already numbed particles of my brain that have not yet been exploited because of the overload and conversion of the film world. But this movie has been added to my list of "Magic Movies". To become a "magic film", it must let each string of what I can only define as "happiness" and "complete satisfaction". This film has tapped into the fibers of the thought of my mind. Without the deep personal connection that exists between my head and the one who made this film, it would look like another "dead rave" movie of the time when the 90s exploded. Madness of ecstasy. That's not how the film seemed to me. He reached into me and raised something that I thought had been dead for a very long time and pushed me as far as criticizing him. I have forgotten how long I have not seen something that makes me feel so good inside. I strongly suggest to see this movie.
