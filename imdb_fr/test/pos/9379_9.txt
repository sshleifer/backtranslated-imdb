Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive thriller, an unlikely "message" movie using the look and features of the black cycle. <br /> <br /> Bivouacked in Washington, a company of soldiers facing their hustle and bustle in bars. Three of them find themselves in the apartment of a stranger where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats his host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young is investigating with the help of Robert Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion weighs on the second of three (George Cooper), who has disappeared. Ryan kills the third friend (Steve Brodie) to ensure his silence before Young gets closer. <br /> <br /> Encouraged by John Paxton's superior scenario, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three stars, Bobs. Ryan naturally makes his male prototype, Angry White Male (and the guardrail), while Mitchum plays with his characteristic and alert nonchalance (his role is not central, however); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first full-fledged interpretation of the clever and vulnerable wanderer to the mouth and, as a sad bag that lasts in her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that makes it memorable. <br /> <The committed politician Dmytryk may inevitably succumb to sermons, but it is more limited to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (which , incidentally, tends the chronology to the limit). At least, nothing is tempted to explain, whatever the reason, why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and ...). <br /> <br /> Curiously, Crossfire survives even the major change that takes place there - the novel is based on (The Brick Foxhole, by Richard Brooks) a murder denigrating homosexuals. But homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond poverty. The news of the Holocaust, however, began to emerge from the ashes of Europe and Hollywood felt encouraged to record its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios have always feared possibly offending any ticket buyer). <br /> But if the shift from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specificities are not so harmonious. The victim discusses with a lonely and drunk young soldier and then invites her to return home looks strange, though (or especially since) a girlfriend is in its place. This raises the question of whether this scenario was inadvertently selected or quietly left to the original engine generating Ryan's deadly rage.
