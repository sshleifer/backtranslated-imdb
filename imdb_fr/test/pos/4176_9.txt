"Head" is a film that holds well since its original release in 1968. The film is a total contradiction of the image of Monkees. He presents the Monkees in such a way that their fans have never seen them. men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees had the opportunity to tell their version of the story. The film makes fun of their image, the entertainment industry and American companies. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a film that deserves to be seen again and again.
