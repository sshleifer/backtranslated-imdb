This film was shot only 48 years after the end of the civil war - probably in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film, there are reconstructions of battles and period characters rather impressive and realistic. It also offers a different and more balanced vision than BIRTH OF A NATION, a racist and absurd film. For this reason, this short film would be excellent for use in class to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man who runs away to enlist as a drummer. The boy is doing well and is a hero, although the film ends in a rather melodramatic way - a definitive convention of the day. Not a good movie, but a decent plot, a decent acting game and a bit of the excessive acting you've often seen in other movies of the day. <br /> <br /> A boring aspect of this movie was the all too common use of title cards to describe or set the stage for things that were really obvious. It became annoying from time to time.
