Fans of the Pink Panther, Naked Gun or Get Smart will certainly appreciate this farce that won a Caesar and was nominated for four more. <br /> <br /> Jean Dujardin is the agent OSS 117, a man who would not know it a clue if it hit his head. It is also a reflection of the revealing colonialist attitude of the West. <br /> <br /> All Russian spies, Nazis and radical Muslims who surround her are just as stupid, but there are Larmina (Bérénice Bejo) and the Princess (Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> The amazing ability of OSS 117 to learn languages, to play musical instruments the first time he learns them, and to sing like a native are all more impressive than Bond's towers but he is still stupid.
