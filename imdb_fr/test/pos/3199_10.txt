I saw this movie for the first time when I bought a DVD of shorts at random some time ago. it's the only short film I liked on the DVD, but I do not just like it, I love it ... if you hang out with me, you'll see it. it's beautiful, simple and passionate, no bells, no whistles - it could have been done with a sharpie (but do not get me wrong, the animation is elegant and insightful - this person clearly spent a lot of time with cats - but it's just black and white) and then there's writing and music ... it's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, drink wine and watch it again and again ... <br /> <br /> nothing else, I'm waiting for Pedro Serrazina to suggest something else .
