Well, it must be said that Monster Man is a huge mess of film, but in a way, several different genres and a clich√© plot come together to form one of the most enjoyable modern horror movies I've seen of all the time! The two biggest styles that the movie mix are a teenage Road Trip style comedy and a Texas Chainsaw Massacre style redneck horror vibe, and while one often gets on the road to other; Director Michael Davis manages to keep things moving because the constantly changing tone means that we never know exactly where the movie will be shot. Things start worryingly when we discover two irritating characters in different ways. Adam is a naughty virgin, while Harley is a big "A-hole". They both cross the desert to attend the wedding of a girl they both loved in high school. After some strange events, they take a hitchhiker, then find themselves chased by a maniac in a monster truck for unknown reasons ... <br /> <br /> The idea that one person is pursued by another no one in a larger vehicle is hardly original, but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film's main assets. The truck itself looks scary because it is so haggard and rusty, and the fact that it bounces off the screen makes the current action exciting and suspenseful. After a while, you get used to the characters and once Aimee Brooks gets into the fray, things start to get better. The comic side of the teen movie works pretty well, as Justin Ulrich is always available to deliver entertaining dialogues and the scenes between the virgin and the powerful hitchhiker are quite interesting. Just when you think the movie could not be more complicated, things get complicated in the last third. Without spoiling things, it must be said that Monster Man presents the type of end that could not be seen coming, and with the twist, is a big surprise. Some people may feel torn by the sudden turn at the end - but I actually thought that it worked quite well because it corresponds to the film as nothing here is perfect ... Overall, it's not Not at all a "good" movie - but if you're looking for silly entertainment, Monster Man should go!
