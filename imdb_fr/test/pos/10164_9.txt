I put this second version of "The man who knew too much" in my top 10 Hitchcock movies. With "Frenzy", it's probably the most well-argued movie among Hitchcock fans. I consider it much better than, for example, "Rebecca", who has acquired an unreasonable appreciation. <br /> <br /> The film contains many ingenious scenes (most of them have been mentioned in other reviews), but to be expected of Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour before things really happen, but this time is used to prepare for the following events, which are full of intriguing suspense. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore clumsy retroprojections, the only weakness of this movie is the main villain, played by Bernard Miles, who is a rather flat and undeveloped character. Fortunately, there is a scary assassin in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the little boy, is not as irritating as most children of old movies.
