Less than zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals the apathy of teenagers in its most extreme form if they had respected this damn book. But where they did not, this movie does the job and leaves you with the scariest feeling when everything is finished in a way that was not realized until the late '90s with Larry Clark's films, "Kids" and "Bully". <br /> <br /> The marginalized teens in society are confronted with a rather curious dilemma (they do not treat it much as such) when their friend (Daniel Roebuck) tells them that he has killed a teenager on the river in their suburban city. Keanu Reeves is perhaps the only civilized character in the group, the only one to want to show any consciousness, anyway, while the others do not do anything for the girl's death or want to help their friend hide the body . <br /> <br /> I do not know who is the sickest in this film - Crispin Glover - who becomes almost obsessed and quite paternal trying to protect this friend and hide the crime by smuggling it the state. Dennis Hopper, a drug dealer (who clings to an inflatable doll) befriends teens (as a reseller, of course) and suddenly participates in the events. Or Josh Miller, who plays Reeve's little brother, Tim. He seems to be the most apathetic of all, at least until the end of his emotional depression. Obviously, this is not the price of the 80s for teenagers at all. And clearly makes clear the serious detachment with which these children (despite a series of bizarre events) faces, thanks to many great performances (even Reeves has proven his ability to act). <br /> <br /> Help yourself to a comedy to recover if it rocks you too hard.
