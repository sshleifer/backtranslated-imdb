The Reader is an exceptionally well-made and very sweet short film. Each piece of the piece helps to elicit a pure emotional response to the script. Well done, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a reading. The performances testify to a good instinctive game in response to a well written scenario. The work of the actresses was excellent and nothing indicated that their work would slip into the pure sentimental. Less is much better in this case. This film is an excellent example of how low-budget contracts benefit actors and directors alike.
