Traffik is an excellent mini-series on drug trafficking in Europe. This is the PBS series of European production on which the Oscar-nominated film Traffic is based. If you like Traffic, then Traffik is a must. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone who wants to see drugs from a social point of view. The scenario is exciting and unexpected as it goes through the lives of drug traffickers, traffickers, farmers, police and police. Unlike other films that sensationalize the drug problem, Traffik presents it as it is.
