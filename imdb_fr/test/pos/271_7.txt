The third entry of the "Stepford" franchise, but apparently the three obscure suites made for television are incredibly obscure and hard to trace, while the original 70's as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are known and very popular . I did not see the movie "Revenge of the Stepford Wives" of the early 80s, nor that of "The Stepford Husbands" of the mid-90s, but this movie "The Stepford Children" is a rather charming little film and very entertaining. It's basically the same movie as the original; obviously less mysterious but much crazier and incredibly 80th in the nth degree. The main difference here, as the title suggests, is that not only the released wives, but also the rebel and punk teenage offspring of the city undergo the typical and highly effective "Stepford" treatment, licensed by the local men's association . For some reason, the screenplay tries to keep Stepford's mystery alive until late in the movie, although no one is likely to watch this sequel until they have re-read the original and presumably everyone knows the outcome. The Harding family is packed and ready to move from the terrible city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford. Father Steven is particularly excited about their new life as he was already living in Stepford and still wanted to go back there since his first wife, his new wife Laura and the teenage children Mary and David know very well, died under mysterious circumstances. . The city is almost too perfect, with quaint neighbors and model students, and modern teens in particular face tremendous adjustment difficulties. Their efforts to modernize the premises and bring the local youth of Stanford are confronted with prominent citizens, especially the members of the Men's Association, and put the family relations under tension. David meets and falls in love with the last "normal" girl in the school, Lois, but when she turns into a domestic model overnight, David can convince his skeptical mother to open an investigation into Stanford's sinister secret. . The first hour of "The Stanford Children" is slow and rather tame, but the finale is trash and corny, just like the promise of VHS coverage and as it should be a thriller of the late '80s. operandi behind Stanford's secrets is illustrated in more detail, and I think horror fans and fans of the original movie will appreciate that. At least, I did. The plot still does not make much sense and the scenario is full of irrational aspects, but it is still an attractive formula and undoubtedly raises an atmosphere of suspense and fear. The performances are well above average. The arrogant and odious members of the Men's Association describe in particular plausible characters. Even teenage girls, Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff, offer impressive performances. Recommended without hesitation!
