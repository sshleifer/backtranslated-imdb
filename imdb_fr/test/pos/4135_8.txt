I first saw The Buddy Holly Story at the age of seven. I did not know who Buddy Holly was, and I did not remember what had forced me to sit in front of the television, listen to HBO and watch this engaging biopic. What I remembered was to realize that it was a (a little) true story of someone who was really living. I remember the music, good songs that I still love today (I can not believe that Gary Busey sang his own songs and so - What a stallion!) Then, the end has arrived. He is dead. He died of fear. I could not believe it. I had no warning, no prior knowledge like most newcomers in this movie. It taught me a hard lesson about life and how it does not follow the rules that most movies teach us. I just watched the movie again tonight and was once again engaged ... and a little saddened. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I will admit a little bias.
