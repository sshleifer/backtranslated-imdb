Now it's classic. One of my friends told me about this film, saying he's incredibly lame, stupid, retarded, and stupid. He also said that I would love that. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I found it available from netflix and rented it immediately. I'm just shocked that I've never heard of it before. If I could give him an eleven, I would do it. <br /> <br />
