I had the chance to see this film at a festival last year and I was pretty much expecting it to come out. The fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder certainly undermined its success, but as I understand it, the director never intended to make it look like a movie, it was more to about relationships. Is not that what movies are supposed to be !? But there was a quality in the texture of her visual appearance that suggests that May Thomas is on something we should be paying attention to. For filmmakers and independent producers who are talented and lack money and motivation, you can learn a lot from watching this movie. Technically, he has everything for him, the use of light, music, etc. another digital feature I have ever seen and so deserves a lot of praise. The performances of the actors are credible to a point, if not slightly underplayed, I felt that there were many more things in there, more in depth, especially from the male leader John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really bothers me, as a filmmaker, is black and white film a need to hide a multitude of sins only if it were color? Do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology? Or is it the future of making wonderful and affordable films?
