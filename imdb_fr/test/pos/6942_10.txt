In nineteen eighty-two, when it was announced that the Dismisal was going to be manufactured, there was a storm of controversy. It was an event that still left wounds in the hearts and minds of the Australian people. After a few changes (listen to the well-programmed phones ringing to hide names), the dismissal was broadcast. It was nothing short of brilliant. The tracks were perfect. Max Phipps in the lead role of Gough Whitlam, followed closely by John Stanton in Malcolm Fraser and the ever green John Mellion in Sir John Kerr. Time has been created, people's feelings have been well done and the political elements have not been transformed into two-dimensional melodrama, as in so many American series. The dismissal was a faithful reconstruction of a time in Australia that some would prefer to forget and that we can not forget. he did not take sides and pointed out the mistakes and lies on both sides. This leaves someone wanting to maintain rabies and change the constitution, which still allows this to happen again. The dismissal is now available on DVD in Australia. Watch it, learn about it and discover our modern history.
