Excellent drama about 2 alienated and spoiled punks who go against the federal government, each for his own reasons. One, a drug addict, only wants to earn a few dollars for his next match, but the other has a much more sinister program fueled in part by his father's resentment. Good performances and a hot script make it a winner.
