In Sherlock Holmes' Universal Series of Modern Stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND SECRET WEOPON is not one of the best movies, even if it's entertaining. I think the problem is that much of the "duel" of the film between Holmes and his arch-nemesis, Moriarty (here played by Lionel Atwill), seems to delay the very purpose of the professor's work. <br /> <br /> Moriarty appears in three of Holmes' films with Rathbone. In THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, he is played by George Zucco, who gives a real taste to the love of wickedness for the role he has played. For my money, Zucco's performance as a teacher was the best of the three (there's even a brief comedy moment in his performance when he's disguised as a "police sergeant" at the end - as if he was preparing to sing "A Policeman" by Gilbert & Sullivan). Then comes Mr. Atwill's performance here - more of that later. Finally, there is Henry Daniell Moriarty's intellectual in SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE LADY IN GREEN. It's a typically cool and elegant performance of Mr. Daniell, but his confrontations with Holmes seem like a boring boredom. They prevent him from completing the main plan. In the stories in which the professor appears, he really feels that Holmes is a nemesis that will remain a danger as long as he is alive. Yet, because of the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) actually felt that Daniell was the best of the Moriartys movie. <br /> <br /> If Zucco captured the love of evil in the teacher, Daniell seemed to show the Oxford Don tired (in the stories, the professor is a famous mathematician, whose volume on the binomial theorem had a "vogue European "and who wrote a fascinating book, THE DYNAMICS OF THE ASTEROID), shows Professor as a pragmatic businessman. First, he sold (apparently) his services to Nazi Germany. This is never discussed, but it is assumed (as it is before the Nazis really start to collapse), he assumes they will win the war. Secondly, he is not a fool. When Dr. Tobel (William Post Jr.) showed that he was about to collapse physically because of Moriarty gang torture, the professor decided to kidnap one of the other scientists who assist Tobel, because he's as good a scientist as he is. Tobel and would be able to set up the bomb site. I do not see how Zucco would make such a sensible decision on the spot, and if Daniell were to do it, he would be bothered by the extra delay in his plans. <br /> <br /> By the way A tip used in all Holmes series about the teacher is how to get rid of him. If you read the Holmes stories, Moriarty appears three times as the villain: in the last story of THE MEMORIES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM"), in the first story of RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ("THE ADVENTURE EMPTY HOUSE ") and the last of the four novels / news (THE VALLEY OF FEAR). It's amazing how many times the professor has made so many appearances (he's also mentioned in two or three other stories - by the way). But because of his fate at the Reichenbach Falls in "THE FINAL PROBLEM" and "THE EMPTY HOUSE", we always see him falling until his death. Zucco falls from the white tower on Tower Hill. Daniell (with more imagination) tries to flee Gregson and the police, but gets shot while he jumps. Injured can not hang on the wall of an adjacent building. Atwill (here we do not see, but heard) seems to fall from a hatch he has planted in an evacuation tunnel). After a while, it is really tedious to see the teacher always fall in these movies. We turn to the comedy Gene Wilder (certainly a comedy) SHERLOCK HOLMES 'SMARTER' BROTHER, in which Leo McKern is a wonderfully wacky and naughty Moriarty (complete, with an Irish accent), who is not killed at the end but just reflective party - in rowing boat - on how his meticulous stratagems did not work. I liked it better. <br /> <br /> The use of the code "Dancing Men" here, like that of the "devil's foot" in DRESSED TO KILL, reveals some of the mystery of a new one. "THE ADVENTURE OF DANCING MEN" appeared in THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES and concerns a client of Holmes whose wife receives strange and bloody messages in this code. Charles Higham, in his biography, CONAN DOYLE'S ADVENTURES, suggests that Sir Arthur may have taken the code of a magazine game in the 1870s, but we do not really know it. The code is essentially a substitution of letters to the figures of dancing men. The story of the short story is dramatic, but deals with a triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes a slight change that confuses Holmes and Moriarty. <br /> <br /> The film will entertain, but I still think that THE HOUSE OF FEAR, THE SCARLET CLAW, and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACE TO DEATH are better films.
