"Eighteen" (2004) tells the story of Pip Anders, a depressed and extremely cynical young man, separated from his dysfunctional middle / upper class family and living on the streets of Vancouver. On his 18th birthday, he receives a cassette and a reader of his recently deceased grandfather, recounting his memories of his 18th birthday spent serving the British army in France, in order to help a comrade wounded to death not to be captured by the occupant. Germans. While Pip listens to the tape (Ian McKellen provided his grandfather's voice), we see the scenes he describes as flashbacks, alternating with everyday scenes from Pip's life, as well as more recent flashbacks filling the dark secret why Pip left the house. and find it impossible to trust someone who is kind to him. <br /> <br /> An ambitious second film by writer / director Richard Bell ("Two Brothers"), with a neat look, an excellent photograph, well developed - stereotypical characters (homosexuals and heterosexuals being treated equally ) and laudable efforts of some talented actors in emotionally and physically demanding roles (including Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as his grandfather at age 18). Alan Cummings also took a remarkable turn as a priest who tried to help Pip and a minor role played by Thea Gill ("Queer As Folk"). The complex story - according to the director's own words in his DVD commentary - is supposed to lead a "vortex of emotions" pushing Pip to its breaking point, and she certainly does. My only criticisms are that the overall effect is too "schmaltzy" or artificial so that an audience can really identify with it, much of the artificial and predictable support dialogue (and end), and management needed to be more precise in order to reduce excessive neglected acts. some scenes. I recommend it, 7 out of 10 stars, extra points for a remarkable effort.
