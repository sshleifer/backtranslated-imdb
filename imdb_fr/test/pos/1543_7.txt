The premise of the story is quite common; the average family wants to get out of the rat race; wants to find simple life ... so they move from Sherman Oaks, California, to Tomahawk Lake; children in tow. <br /> <br /> The lake is beautiful, they rented an old house ... but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are murdered and no one knows how (no matter why). Gerald McRaney is excellent, a face familiar to viewers for life; Valerie Harper is also good; Since this film was shot in 1988, the writer should perhaps produce a sequel !. <br /> <br /> You'll also enjoy Barry Corbin as an out-of-town and Darryl Anderson as Bruce Dern's military mate. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is a little exaggerated; if you are a movie buff, similar scenarios of "" Psycho "" will be recalled to you; "" Deliverance ""; as well as other horror stories of this kind. Several shots and sequences will give you an impression of déjà vu. <br /> <br /> Sit down and enjoy; if you do not take it too seriously, it's a lot of fun; and better than, for example, the more recent movie: <br /> <br /> "" I know what you did last summer ""; it seems they made better movies in the good old 80's!
