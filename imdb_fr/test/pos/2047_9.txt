Rent this, I own the DVD, I got it for $ 9.99. A robbery is so underrated. Of course, there are better films. Movies with little or no holes in the plot or action. But I do not have this problem with this movie. For me, if a film stays true to itself, honest and exploits its flaws (and its virtues, of course!) In the name of entertainment, it fulfills its function. I was concerned because its makers cared. The whole movie is ridiculous from start to finish, but its directors took the company seriously, and I did not feel manipulated to take the film seriously. And that's so true, because I want to take every film seriously, but many, many, let me down. Despite its nonsense, this film is almost perfect and completely entertaining! What a funny scenario! It has also become strangely relevant in the light of the events of 9/11. In no case do I seek to minimize the loss. But this film incorporates the compromise of the collapse of the WTC before it happens in a way that we will never see if the film was shot after these events. <br /> <br /> "... it's either gone for good or here to stay." "you do not agree?"
