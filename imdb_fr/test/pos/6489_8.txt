I bought it some time ago, during a massive martial arts film phase. Although this is certainly not the best, I love this kind of film making and there was a lot of fun in this one. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars. I still appreciate the fact that, even though he lacked formal training in martial arts, he generally gave a more than capable combat performance. He also has a good beard. This film puts him in a good heroic role and, even if he does not hit as much as in some of his other films, he still performs well. The first appearances of Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also interesting, especially because Chow Yun Fat attacks the bad guys without playing his own gun. He may not be a great fighter, but he is doing well. Eddy Ko is still mean, he plays the same villain as in many of his other films and does it very well, as usual. The guy who plays Bu is good too, I do not remember his name, but he's also in Magnificent Butcher. Although the fights are not as successful as other films of the time, The postman retaliates with a lot of imagination, a cinematography of quality and a pleasantly offbeat atmosphere. There are very nice scenes, good characters and a good mix of eclectic Hong Kong talent combined to produce a decent effect. Overall, I would recommend this to Kung Fu and Hong Kong General Action fans. It may not be a stylized classic like the Shaw Brothers movies, or as appealing as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's rock-solid entertainment.
