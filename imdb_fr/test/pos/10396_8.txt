It's a special film if you know the context. Antonioni, in his eighties, had been handicapped by a stroke. Mute and half-paralyzed, his friends - who are also the best in the world of cinema - have arranged for him to "make" a last significant film. The idea is that he can create a story simply by looking at it. So we have a film: about a director who evokes stories by simple observation. And the (four) story is about how the visual imagination defines love. <br /> <br /> The film emerges giving us the necessary tools to realize it through our own imagination. The result is purely cinematic: each person (except the director) is charming in appearance or movement. Some of these women are ultralovely, and they exist in a hazy world of sensual encounters. There is no nuance, no indication that nothing exists but what we see; no desire is at work other than what we create. <br /> <br /> I do not know of any other film that successfully manipulates our own visual desire to make us create the world we see. He understands something about not touching. No one understands Van Morrison like him. The music of the Celtic space of Morrison rests precisely on the same notion: the sensual touch which implies but does not touch physically. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's red-haired woman rightly appears as a shopkeeper and she also directs a making of dull film on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Rating of Ted - 3 of 4: To see.
