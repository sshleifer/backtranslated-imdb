OK, so maybe it's because I'm from north-east Scotland and I'm talking like the guys in this movie, but I found that very amusing. Not expensive, of course, but a lot of effort was made to give the film a beautiful appearance and the actors gave everything. I was actually pretty affected when they died. Especially when the captain finally fell. The scenario? It's a game of two halves. The first half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not terrible, and many questions remain unanswered. This will probably annoy others as it annoyed me. But nevertheless, good fun and first very smart feature of Sturton.
