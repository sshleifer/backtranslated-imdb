In general, I am a comedy guy. I rented this at the video store under the comedy, and thought "Albert Brooks! and rented it. It sounded like a romantic comedy, and I remembered that I hated it and hated it. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong? <br /> <br /> While it's a romantic comedy, it's played by a leading cast (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson), and everything works well in itself. The script seems real and not forced, as it could happen in the news channel you watch at night. It takes your emotions and makes you appreciate Hunter and Brooks and hates Hurt, which makes the end a little disappointing and unsuccessful, but it shows how much you do not need to have a happy ending to finish a movie, but a sincere end is what everyone has had. Everyone's life does not end well, and it shows in Broadcast News. Maybe people do not like the end because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies ... but it works, it's real and it's genius. Broadcast News is a classic in his day, and a good love movie with "Casablanca". Well, maybe not so high, but it's the only other romance I can think of that I like. <br /> <br /> Broadcast News: 9/10.
