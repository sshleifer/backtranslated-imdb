The plot: Michael Linnett Connors did everything in the movies except live, and is looking for his first chance. He discovers Molly in a play and knows immediately that she will be a big movie star. He signs a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and their career is already well underway. The following is a re-enactment of the silent film era and the first sound movies focusing on comedy. And, oh yes, there is romance and a little sadness too. The performances of Don Ameche and Alice Fay are excellent. Music is also a real benefit, with some familiar old tunes heard. Many extras DVD also in this restored version released in 2008. It should be noted that this film is a story in the first sense, not just a tribute to silent films. Years later would bring similar films such as Singin 'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner, The Comic (1969). The peculiarity of this film, however, is to recreate silent films in 1939. We see parts of it as the viewer thought it was in that bygone era (although some sound effects are included) in beautiful black and white photos, while that the rest of the film is in immaculate color. One of the greatest of the silent era, Buster Keaton, who was then in a difficult climb, is superbly used in 2 re-created silent movie scenes and he is at the top of his game! It is said that he also contributed to his scenes. But the real reason to watch the movie, if you're a fan of movie history, is that beyond all else, Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennett's film legacy. It does not take a genius to realize that this film is a "positive" overhaul of the lives of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand. The character of Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name is Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course, it's Mabel. Sennett had pie launches, bathing beauties and Keystone cops. He worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (cameo), Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (double body) and fell in love with his main wife. Not only all this, but Sennett was the technical advisor of this film and also appears there. Since most viewers today prefer sonic characteristics, those associated with short subjects and silence are left to pasture. As Mack Sennett fell into this category, he is happy that there is Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett played a decisive role in the evolution of comedy in the cinema. His career began in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director and producer. He retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit. He had worked with the best, such as Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle and even Roy Rogers (in Way Up Thar). As movie comedy is an extremely difficult path to pursue throughout a career, Mack played the wise and did selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931, he received an academy award in the category of short subjects and another in 1937 for a lifetime. In the 1940s, his presence was still felt, for example Here Come the Co-Eds (1945), where is reproduced the scene of oyster soup used in Wandering Willies Mack (1926). In 1947, The Road to Hollywood used some of Sennett Crosby's films. Two years later, he felt nostalgic with the film Down Memory Lane in which he participated. With his associate talent always with the right people, a guest role with the hugely popular Lawrence Welk & his radio show took place later in the year. In 1950, Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914) was reissued with his latest triumph. In 1952, he was honored on television This Is Your Life, then his autobiography, The King of Comedy (1954), an excellent companion to Hollywood Cavalcade, is published. 1955 brings a more concrete association to Abbott & Costello, in the shoes of A & C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally, in 1957, another tribute with the compilation film, The Golden Age of Comedy. So when you watch Hollywood Cavalcade, it's the legacy of a film pioneer. In the film on the banquet stage, the camera sweeps the guests around a long table. As we reach Mack with silver hair, he turns his head to the camera as if to say, "Here I am!" When he gets up to make a speech a little later, he is at his peak, downplaying the words that are given to him as mentally expressing: "I know that my influence on the comedy will never end, but people will forget Mack Sennett . " Maybe this movie will help. "
