An absolute classic of the 80s flix. This one is unlike any other, because it drives psychotic children the size of a bomb, huge, with a desire to kill against all adults in the city. Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (again gold of the 80s) plays one of the murderous kids and is paired with one of the little girls that Jake Blues tries to buy in BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy, but he continues to disappear from the movie for some reason. The violence is sometimes hilarious and surprisingly horrible in places. The demonic band of smiling children, although possessed extra-planetary, does not look much like the Damned Right Children, who never thought of using guns, crossbows and shovels to kill those annoying adults. Julie Brown (not downtown, Julie Brown - the other) shows her display about three times as she dances in her room. This film is a rarity that I can not believe I missed growing up in the 80's. That would have been my absolute favorite movie when I was a kid if I had seen it. Where is the result that demands the end? This movie is just amazing. Look for it at all costs.
