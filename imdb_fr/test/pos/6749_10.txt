This is an excellent B-movie horror film that falls between horror and comedy. It is a scorpion genetically mutilated in space. Can it be more unreal? It is a hybrid between "Alien" and "Chain Saw Massacre". The film was shot in Stockholm with a mixed cast of Americans and Swedes interacting wonderfully. Director Martin Munthe does a great job of finding the comic highlights of this script and making the audience laugh. The film was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger has all the qualities of a horror movie B-movie. It's both comical and scary. The actors and the team are dedicated to their cause. It's great to see that movies like this one can still be made! I would recommend to see it if you like this kind of movies.
