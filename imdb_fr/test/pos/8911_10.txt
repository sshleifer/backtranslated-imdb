First, the stranger saves a black boy and a Mexican, despite what the summary of the plot IMDb suggests. This film is the fulfillment of the purest of male fantasies, interracial rape. The main character of this film is a dope of George Michaelesque, who does not understand primordial human impulses such as drug abuse and murder. In fact, whenever he uses violence to solve a problem, he encounters an internal conflict that physically hinders him. What a square. Anyway, my favorite scene is when he writes to the gang members a letter saying if they want the $ 500 they get from the Reading Center to protect themselves, they have to meet him. At the meeting he is surrounded by countless chicano gangsters, but he keeps his head cool. In slow motion, he hits the wooden post with a stop sign that breaks on contact. Then, still in slow motion, he points to the gang leader and says, "Noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" The gang members are bending. Cool, no? The beauty of this film is reflected in these simple solutions to social problems such as prostitution and gang violence.
