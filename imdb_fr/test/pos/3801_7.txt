(Some spoilers included :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators have called this film surreal, the term is not appropriate here. To quote Encyclopedia Britannica, surrealist means: <br /> <br /> "Fantastic or incongruous images": it is not necessary to explain to the imagination how many manners a ten-year-old boy brave and in search of fortune the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: the curious could read James Kincaid; but if you asked your boy how incongruous he was in driving a sports car, he would surely protest, "NO way!" The fantasies and incongruities offered by the film generally appear in the first fifteen minutes. Subsequently, we get more iterations of the same thing, in a progression always more raw and more sordid which, far from being incongruous, proves quickly predictable. Not that it is, on the contrary, literally credible - but it was unfair to tax Motorama especially for this flaw, any plausible suspension of incredulity having fallen precipitously on the scale of the values ​​of the filmmaker and the spectator since "Raiders of the 'Lost Ark' has become a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> "Hallucinatory": how to know what is a hallucination if the fact of not knowing that one has one is one? In any case, some people know that they like "hallucinogenic drugs" - but if Motorama gives the result, then I do not understand why someone would take them more than once. There is of course the bad occasional trip. The film must be one of those, word game and all. <br /> <br /> "Juxtaposition of Surprising Words": How many times can a ten-year-old surprise you by saying "Oh, my God!" when he likes something, or "Damn!" when he does not do it? These two interjections are about equal for the course with this script. Unfortunately, any surrealist sense of what passes for a dialogue can only reveal, in direct proportion, its naivety about the language patterns of the rising American generation. <br /> <br /> "A completely defined and meticulously described world but has no rational meaning:" The world of Motorama has no meaning, but it is about as defined as the cartoon in the diary of a primary school. The many stars of the cast all have even less intelligent cameo roles than our little hero who exclaims "Damn!" in a flash but it takes several seconds to concoct any lie. And even his character, although he appears in almost every scene, does not experience significant development. This is an insufficient reward for any viewer who sympathizes, as I should, enough to wish to know him better and understand "where he comes from". One vaguely feels a much better story and a protagonist who has trouble going out. <br /> <br /> "Really recognizable and realistically painted images are removed from their normal context and put together in an ambiguous, paradoxical or shocking setting." No, we are witnessing a succession of stereotypical and increasingly dilapidated billboards, petrol stations, greasy spoon restaurants, cheap hotels, and their laid-back regulars along the roadways. campaign, exactly where they belong stereotypically. <br /> <br /> "Widely responsible for perpetuating ... the traditional focus on content". There is little content, moment by moment, at Motorama. <br /> <br /> To sum up: imagine British millionaires disguised as clowns or pirates on their way to a costume party, sitting serene and mute like cautious drivers The Rolls-Royces look like fragile skiffs crossing a sea desperate humanity, Chinese begging from the windows and smear the glass of blood. You can also imagine a stadium filled with abandoned antiquities, limousines like those above rusty and white pianos sounded by ghosts. In this trash, roam an exhausted boy and a sick woman to whom he clings to become a grandmother become a friend, who fall asleep side by side in the grass. He is awakened - on the feast of the Transfiguration, the "brilliant white day" of 1945 - by a bright flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. Finding that his wife became a corpse, he thinks at first to have seen his soul rise to heaven. Later, he explains a little less innocently: "I learned a new word today: atomic bomb. It's like God taking a picture. Now, there are just two samples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism whose irony is wavy enough to invade the very title of his film Empire of the Sun. If you're looking for surreal, * please, do not miss that. Alas, as hard as it is on the accelerator to run his chariot through and beyond the desert, no scene as deliciously strange, rich, subtle or beautiful is waiting for poor little Gus Motorama in his quest. <br /> <br /> None of these meetings. the above necessarily constitutes a boost on this film. Although somewhat disappointed, I can not deny it, given the respectable character of another genre he embodies - influenced, of course, by surrealism, but also by expressionism, existentialism and pessimism of Franz Kafka among omnipotent power structures. . Let's try for size: Theater of the Absurd. <br /> <br /> Coming back to EB's article on this style, I am amazed by the way, to the extent that Theater of the Absurd is a valuable artistic style, the above objections to Motorama disappear like a puff of smoke. I am tempted to quote the entire text in support of identification. <br /> <br /> The theater of the absurd attempts to show "that the human situation is essentially absurd, devoid of purpose ... humanity feels desperate, disoriented and worried.": Having achieved its immediate goal to get away from a depressing family life, parents squabbling, Gus finds himself aimless until he passes a bright panel reading "Motorama" and decides to win the lottery he promises. As others have already said, this ambition is illusory: although the game "never expires," the sponsoring company has no intention of winning players and has the means to deceive, confuse and leave all aspirant to the reward unfounded. Like the others, he ends up being disappointed by his dream. <br /> <br /> "The absurd dramatists have thus removed most of the logical structure of traditional theater.There is little dramatic action in the classic sense of the term, the characters play, their activity serves to emphasize the fact that nothing changes their existence ... a circular and timeless quality emerges. "" The tongue in an absurd room is full of ... repetitions ... repeating the evidence until it sounds like a nonsense." Under a surface sometimes "dazzling and comical", we find "an underlying message of metaphysical distress". Gus's obsession with an idiotic game, his insane language, the device of the plot in which he guesses a dark future and / or returns to a previous moment and takes a different but still dark turn - so many things now suit us . Even if an admirer of the surreal would do better with some movies, anyway, Spielberg, the admirers of Motorama as they are should find fellow travelers - not an addition, but an addition - in the works of Beckett, Ionesco and Broom. But we can not stop there. After his disillusionment with the game, Gus returns to "Phil" (ie, Love), the first companion he met and the only person who treated him decently, although he also scolded him - in a gas station announcing "Be filled!". Under the tutelage of Phil, he learns to wait for cars. We can note here that the absurd playwright Beckett had entitled his most famous play "Waiting for Godot" and that, for Godot, we had to read "God". God is also one of Phil's concerns. Moreover, as an indirect result of his previous encounter with Gus, Phil is severely mutilated and goes into a casting with his arms stretched out horizontally. In the last scene, Gus, who has become Phil's protégé, says he wants to hear some music. We do not hear anything, but we see Phil waving his fingers at the end of his outstretched arm, signaling Gus to get closer, and Gus responds. The End. <br /> <br /> Finally, another author I am currently reading is the Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel advocate is not recognized as an architect or founder of the theology of liberation, which is more of a Roman Catholic movement than an Anglican movement, he should perhaps be so. Police brutality and corporate greed are a cliché in film and literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and illuminates these sentiments with impressive mandates drawn from the scriptures, tradition and reason. <br /> His most significant work is the earthly activities of those fallen angels whom the Bible calls principalities and powers. The Principalities, wrote Stringfellow, are at the origin of our three I: Images, Institutions and Ideologies. All recommend themselves to our worship by making false promises. The more a person, a person or an image, an institution or an ideology becomes deeply involved in his identity, the more his personality becomes "exhausted" and becomes his slave. Promising power, control and immortality, they inexorably deliver impotence, chaos and death. As powers essentially defeated and defeated, they can not do more than that. Yet, they seduce humans with God's promised "dominion over the earth" in the book of Genesis, when in fact none of us controls an image, institution or ideology inevitably dedicated to its own hegemony and to its own preservation. They take their own life. "Dominion" is a flawed translation: a more accurate rendering of Hebrew would be "stewardship". But this is a galley beside a more fundamental problem: most of us neglect to notice that God had delegated this power to Adam * before * the fall. We have no reason to suppose that we, his descendants, are still exercising it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us. <br /> <br /> Two observations of CS Lewis could be added. First, this "conquest of nature by man" is only an illusion and a pretext to cover the fact that we are really talking about the conquest of certain men by other men whose nature is the same. 'instrument; and second, contrary to popular belief, Satan is by no means a good time, Charlie. At first, he may use pleasures, but he is very vicious with them and will remove them from every human being who is firmly assaulted, perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire feeling miserably sorry for himself and bleeding with resentment. > <br /> Now, applying this information to Motorama, we seem to reflect it remarkably well in Gus's experience. He is, if not nice, at least a pretty little boy before being a victim of Motorama's match. The first advertising signs sparkle glamor. However, the longer it continues and the deeper it is towards the corporate headquarters, the lighter they become. He is alone and does not meet anyone who plays the game. The stations that distribute the cards are either fallen into the ruins or managed by zombies. The people he meets along the way are increasingly ugly, misleading and hostile. (The fact that the principalities respond to a common dictator does not mean that they can support one another). Gus's humanity disappears from him as he becomes not only totally egocentric and unaware of the needs of others, but also partially blinded ... disfigured ... aged prematurely while he is infantile in the literal sense of the disputed term on the linguistic plan. Finally, even his precious Mustang is taken from him in an accident and he must continue in the wreck of a dead man. However, after having finally done all that was planned, he presents himself to the principality in his proud turn to receive his prize. Using the biblical power to confuse those who built such monuments to their own vanity, his agents avoid him, disappoint him, insult him and finally throw him from the top floor. It falls long and hard, landing, finally in a body of water. In other words, in classical symbolism, he dies. He has encountered the inevitable evil fate of anyone who believes in such a deceiver. <br /> <br /> But this spell is only a warning for a mutable future. He repents and returns to Phil. After seeing him, he performs the first generous and selfless act that we have seen for nearly an hour and a half: noting that Phil is now disabled and barely able to insert a hose into a gas tank, he asks, "Can I help you with that?" Then, seeing the sign "help wanted", he decides to apply, explaining to the motorist with whom he was hitchhiking that he intends to leave, because it is not too bad as a place. to work. <br /> <br /> This interpretation is hypothetical, of course, and it can surprise or even outrage aficionados of the "cult classic" film that see very different points. <br /> <br /> If Motorama is not quite my cup of tea, I'm at least convinced now that it's not the worst movie of all time.
