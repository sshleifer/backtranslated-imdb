AWWWW, I love this film in pieces. My cousins ​​and I both love this movie and I am such a huge fan !!! I hope they will soon release the TV show on DVD. Come talk about it, I have not seen the TV show for a very long time. Such moments! Where I come from Australia The Chipmunk Adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adulthood, which is a little sad because young children do not know what is missing . <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are Ace the ones I love most, Rock Doll, Diamond Dolls and the song that will not fail to make you want to cry my mother. <br /> <br /> This film will certainly excite young and old GET THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY !!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.
