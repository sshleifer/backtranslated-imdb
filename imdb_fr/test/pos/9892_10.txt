When I heard for the first time that Checking Out was a self-orchestrated suicide festival, my first thought was morbidity, lack of taste and then comedy. I was skeptical. But I was wrong. I totally loved that. The casting, the funny doublings and especially the surprise end. Suicide is a delicate issue, but it has been very well managed. Comic yes, but tender where it was needed. Checking Out also discusses other common issues with which many families can relate, and this is done with tact and humor. I highly recommend Checking Out. A MUST SEE. I'm looking forward to making it public.
