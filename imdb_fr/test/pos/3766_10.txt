Coming from the "druggie" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. Jekyll & Hyde has been updated, so to speak. My husband and I had a good laugh. I would love to have the movie in my collection. I talked about the film to my two teenagers and they would like to see it. They do not take drugs, but they know enough about them to understand the movie comedy. It's been so long since I've seen it, I only remember a few things. I must say that the funny thing is when Dr. Jekyll went to sleep on his laboratory table and inhaled the straw while snoring, then sniffed the powdered drugs he had invented. The funniest thing I have ever seen in a movie.
