ABC's version of the pope's life: They put her a little ahead of the CBS version and she may have suffered, but the program itself was excellent. He was quick to move, as he only had two hours (commercials also taking time) to cover the long life of this great man, but Thomas Kretschmann was admirably up to the challenge. Unlike the CBS biopic, he played his role of youth in the senior years and managed to appear "realistic" at both ends of the scale. His credibility has never weakened. It has amazing range and depth. It is unfortunate that the program could not have been longer and more detailed, but if they were running on time, I think they did a great job of getting it to the screen.
