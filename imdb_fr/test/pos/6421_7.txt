I had heard about it for the first time while searching the Net for reviews of another Italian giallo / horror effort, the contemporary of PARFUM OF THE LADY IN BLACK (1974), including Raro's DVD R2 SE , by the way, that I recently acquired)? ? where it is referenced as being in a similar vein but just as well. After watching Footsteps for me now, can I see where this criticism came from? in that the two films deal with the psychological collapse of their protagonist. Stylistically, however, this one owes much more to the Art-house cinema than anything else ?? in particular, the works of Alain Resnais and Michelangelo Antonioni (and more particularly LAST YEAR IN MARIENBAD [1961] and THE PASSENGER [1975]); as a result, some have accused him of being "deadly boring" ?? an epithet often attached to this tariff "pretentious" (read: cerebral)! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film involves the quest of a woman (Florinda Bolkan) to determine her movements over the previous three days ?? which she seems not to remember. After a series of enigmatic clues, she goes to the "mythical" country of Garma (nearby places then bear the equally fictitious names of Muda and Rheember) ?? where she meets several people (including Lila Kedrova as an aristocratic client of the station) who seem to remember the heroine who stayed there during her "black-out"! The most prominent people, however, are a young man (Peter McEnery) and a little girl (Nicoletta Elmi, of BARON BLOOD [1972] of Mario Bava). the former always seems to be performing on the stage at a propitious time, while the latter apparently confuses Bolkan with another woman (with long red hair and a nasty trail!). <br /> <br /> Although it is essentially a room of atmosphere, nevertheless, a seizing puzzle: inevitably, vague events take place at a deliberate rate ?? and where much of the power of the film comes from the remarkable central performance (which can be seen as an extension of Bolkan's role in Lucio Fulci Giallo's film: A LIZARD IN THE SKIN OF A WOMAN [1971]). However, we can not deny the contribution of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (who offers a large number of camera movements and an effective color palette - adopting orange / red / blue filters to create an atmosphere and offering a saturated look for this disorienting and bizarre final) and the melancholy score of Nicola Piovani (the composer is now best known for his award-winning work on the tragicomedy of Roberto Benigni, LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL [1997]). <br /> <br /> In this spirit It's worth discussing how Step by Step was introduced in the version I looked at: well, being apparently hard to get in its original form (I can not be sure that it's not cut or not, except to say that the film lasted 89 minutes while the IMDb lists it at 96), this edition is taken from a rather abused English VHS (dubbing is surprisingly good considering the international distribution) with Swedish subtitles engraved (in addition to the DivX copy) frozen for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story around the 82-minute mark)! We still have a welcome bonus, namely a 9-minute excerpt entitled "The highlights of the soundtrack" in MP3 format. <br /> <br /> I realize that I have not yet mentioned the sub-plot Moon Mission, in which Klaus Kinski participates. Restricted: Incidentally, around the same time, he had a similar but crucial role in another good artistic thriller with sci-fi tendencies (and also in a distinctive place) ?? namely, LIFESPAN (1974). As I watched the movie, I could not imagine the possible link between it and the central plot, except that Bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had seen before, but not to the end, called "Footsteps On The Moon" (an alternative title somewhat misleading for the film itself) ?? In a funny way, she first remembers that the painting is called BLOOD ON THE MOON (a classic 1948 black western with Robert Mitchum and directed by Robert Wise!). That said, I considered this "diversion" as just another touch to the film (since Bolkan had already been a translator at a conference on the future of the Earth)? and certainly did not think that the astronauts would arrive at the end on Garma's beach to follow the female thread, where the sand would then turn worryingly towards the surface of the moon ??! <br /> <br /> The plot of the film will probably make more sense during a second viewing ?? however, to be honest, it is better to think of it as a visual / auditory experience and do not expect it to produce a clear and rational narrative! For the record, the only other Bazzoni effort that I managed to get before this one is the very poor Straight Giallo, THE FIFTH CORD (1971), starring Franco Nero (whom I had recorded on television Italian late at night); some time ago, I got his western spaghetti version of "Carmen" entitled MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE (1968) ?? also with Nero and Kinski ?? as a DivX (having already missed a morning broadcast), but the conversion was found to be defective and, therefore, the disc would not play correctly!
