Now, maybe it had something to do with the fact that I saw this film at a low point in my life, when I was really trying to figure out where I was going and what I needed to make me happy, but this movie really talked to me. Jane is an ordinary woman: although she has many positive things, she is always vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but she has been battered by an unfortunate accident and leads a life of second choice. She seeks new challenges and happiness, desperately seeking to fill the hole in her heart. Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane. As we walk with her, we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her despair and, eventually, the strength of her conviction. The beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well cast and an asset for production. Allison Mackie is a thief of scenes as a savvy character with impeccable timing. I highly recommend this movie. Although his budget is low, he has significant writing and production values. PS- beautiful aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. Women will love the story and the characters, but there is something for men here too. :)
