Lifeforce is certainly one of Tobe Hooper's best films. It has great special effects and a lot of nudity. This is like the dream of a typical horror fan. The film is quite creative and I think it's due to the script of Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby. Good cinematography and a good atmosphere of goosebumps make it a solid film.
