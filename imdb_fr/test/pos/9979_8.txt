Rainy day with not much to do. We surfed the movie network channels and found it just starting. So we left our luck. <br /> <br /> The more we watched, the more we were absorbed by the story. It's the old story of a working-class underdog trying to get by in a sport that at the time (1913 I think) was usually played by the rich upper class, but this film was just as interesting than Seabiscuit and it's also based on a real movie. history. <br /> <br /> The acting is credible and the cast is brilliant. AND. . . . we are not golfers, so please, do not miss this one just because it's golf Any individual sport would serve the plot, because it's about people. Golf works well for this story because of the class distinction and snobbery that seem to involve some players in the game. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. . . . It's a good movie. It's well organized and is not it always fun to see those who think they are better than others being demolished?
