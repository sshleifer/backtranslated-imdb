I have seen this film many times and I'm never fed up. This is a man coming out of the closet and he does not know he is present. The character of Kevin Kline is a teacher and when one of his former students announces that Kline's character is gay, the people of his city start to wonder whether he is heterosexual or gay. Kline's character begins to wonder if he is also straight or gay. The acting is absolutely fabulous and hilarious by all actors. I found the film very funny and comforting. I love this movie, it makes you laugh and makes you feel good looking at it. I recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a good time watching it.
