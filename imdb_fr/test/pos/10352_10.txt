When I saw this on TV, I was nervous ... What if they made a mistake? Millions of families like mine who live with a brain-damaged man, in my case my father, would be abandoned. I watched it with my mother and we both ended up crying. It was so accurate and we captured the feeling of the family and the person who suffered the brain injury. The actors were all wonderful and I did not complain, my mother told me she had not been able to stop thinking about it. I hope this program has educated many people about living with brain injuries and family life. More programs like this should be done, I was surprised by its quality and it really upset me.
