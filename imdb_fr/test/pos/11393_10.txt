BOOGIE NIGHTS by Paul Thomas Anderson contains everything you need to know about pornography in the late '70s and early' 80s. Although the film is completely fictitious, it is supposed to be based on the story of King John Holmes. . <br /> <br /> In Southern California, in 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) worked as a nightclub at a nightclub. The pornographer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and two of his starlets, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) are among the usual customers. Jack and Eddie meet and realize that Eddie is fine ... a little ... talented. <br /> <br /> Eddie plays in Jack's films under the pseudonym "Dirk Diggler". He becomes a "big" porn star (no pun intended) and seems to be above all. Then come the 80s, when the video replaces the film and Jack's porn empire begins to collapse, alongside Dirk Diggler and all the other professionals in the industry. <br /> <br /> BOOGIE NIGHTS is a drama really well filmed. There is a bit of violence, but P.T. Anderson makes it more stylized. And it's sort of a scathing approach to pornography degradation, especially when VHS has become the standard medium for pornography. <br /> <br /> Many unique and strange characters are introduced. William H. Macy has an interesting role as a person working on movies, whose wife continues to have sex with everyone. I especially liked the role of Don Cheadle as a stereo salesman. The best performance is BOOGIE NIGHTS was definitely Burt Reynolds. A classic of the 90s!
