I do not think I've ever seen a movie in my life about a high school student setting up his own college just to impress his parents. Nowadays, movies are either remakes, sequels, or tracks used in many movies. This one has an original story and to follow it by turning it into a comedy only makes clear the affair. With that thoughtful story and mixed laughter, it's a good movie. Now, I've seen better, but on entering the theater, I was thinking of another drug / beer / fraternity party with some sexual insinuations thrown (a movie "American Pie") but I was surprised. To summarize, I enjoyed the movie and the next time you go through the paper to find movies, look for the broadcast schedules for "Accepted". If you want to laugh aloud, that's it.
