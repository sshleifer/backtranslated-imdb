I watched this movie probably more than 20 times. The jokes are now 10-15 years old, but every time I look at them, it makes me fall from the chair. Two of the best actors, Salman Khan and Aamir Khan, play the lead role here. Even though Aamir Khan is a much better actor and gets the best role (intelligent guy) in the movie Match Salman Khan and sometimes even better as a silly guy. All the characters are memorable. This movie is filled with hilarious one-liners and fun situations (a little too silly probably). Do not try to look for logic in this movie. Let your brain relax for a while. I promise it will be an unforgettable experience.
