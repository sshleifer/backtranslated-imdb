I just watched this movie and it's not bad; there are some moments of tension and not many long chains of dialogue. Emerges as smart enough; fastpaced almost like "documentary style". This film will evoke a certain nostalgia and a bit of paranoia of the cold war with cars, street scenes and life in the 50s. The acting is pretty solid and after 85 minutes, it is moving at a good pace . A film buff from the atomic era should not miss this one.
