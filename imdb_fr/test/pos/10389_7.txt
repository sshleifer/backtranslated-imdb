This is the latest film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, with the help of Wim Wenders, and adapts to his new collection "That Bowling Alley on the Tiber". Beyond the Clouds contains 4 new stories with familiar themes that we have been accustomed to in his previous work, and summarizes these themes in vignettes that are woven together through scenes directed by Wenders and featuring the character of The Director of John Malkovich. However, most of the stories seemed to offer little or no depth to which we are accustomed to an Antonioni film, while the supposed narration of the depth supposed by Malkovich resonated with an unclear diction that sounded a little pretentious and misplaced. Nevertheless, the four stories all seem to touch casual encounters, and extremely fast romances that looked more like lust at first sight, perhaps due to lack of time (as they are anyway short stories) to allow for a layered approach to carefully define and shape the characters as we know from a typical film Antonioni. And the obsessive approach here is that the characters undress themselves to show a deeper lack of connection, sacrificed for the immediate satisfaction of the flesh. Perhaps this is important to understand by observing the more modern relationship? <br /> <br /> The first story, Story of a love story that never existed, tells the romance between Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) and Carmen (Ines Sastre), who meet when the another asks the other to go to a hotel, then meet at a cafe. It's as if fate were playing games for them when they met, but ended up and ended up much later, but as players play, it's almost like an Avventura or a Notte with lack of communication and the expectations of the man. <br /> <br /> The character of John Malkovich's director plays a pivotal role in the next short film, which presented a very lecherous look at a young girl working in a shop, interpreted by Sophie Marceau. She is deeply troubled and uncomfortable, but nevertheless had the courage to approach her, and in order to frighten her, I told her that she had murdered her father by stabbing him 12 times. But in a flash, these two are heading for gymnastics in the bedroom. <br /> <br /> The next short film, Do not Look for Me, is the longest of the lot. Peter Weller plays the role of a deceitful husband who has to choose between his mistress (Chiara Caselli) or his wife, played by Fanny Ardant. Perhaps the most starred of the lot, Jean Reno also intervening for a coda at the end, which widens somehow the small universe in which this short film exists. But unfortunately, Reno's commitment has also been relegated to the choking of laughter as he enters the unlikely field with pretty romantic laser dulls. There was a key element adapted from The Eclisse with a kiss between a couple through a glass panel too, while the introductory story about the history of souls was quite interesting. If there is a negative theme here that this short film wants to play, it will be the duplicity of the man. <br /> <br /> Between this short film and the following was a small scene that brought together our couple La Notte, Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau, where the first painted a landscape reminiscent of that of Red Desert. Finally, we have the latest This Body of Dirt plan, with Vincent Perez in his youth, after a girl (Irene Jacob) that he just met and falling in love with her, to realize that it is a love that is too late. This is a relatively talking subject, as in the first story, where the characters engage in a conversation while walking the streets of the city in which they are located, which evokes a foretaste of Richard Linklater in Before Sunrise. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film may have been successful as individual pieces, but it has never been considered a combined effort, given that the "excuse" intended for them to link was the exploration of possible stories and the search for inspiration for his next film.
