It is important to point out that at the time of production of this short film, a state of war existed between the United States and the Empire of Japan. Add to this the enormous malice created by the beginning of the war, as well as the March of Death of Bataan and other incidents. The only thing surprising about this short film and the others is that they are not more numerous. Another thing: my only problem with this short film is that it seems to want to be funny, but it is not the case. I'm not sure anyone who's in contact with him really tried to make the jokes work, or even that he cared. It would have been much better if they had done what Disney had done with Education For Death and had been totally serious. But this short film is frowned upon and should not be judged out of context. The times were different then and this is an important consideration. Anyone who spends energy trying to save the world from a 60-year-old caricature needs to step back. Like me, spend energy to defend the same cartoon. This should be available to interested parties even if their distribution is not very broad. It is not a beautiful drawing but sometimes life is not beautiful
