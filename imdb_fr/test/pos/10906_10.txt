Joan Cusack steals the show! The premise is good, the plot interesting and the scenario was OK. A bit too simplistic in the sense that the news of a homosexual man was so positive when it is not generally so positive. Again, it's a fiction. :) All in all, a fun adventure. <br /> <br /> One of the things I noticed is the "inside of the joke" aspect. Since the target audience was probably straight, gay "content" may not be in context with the story. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that writers sometimes do not consider when they propose Kline for a part. <br /> <br /> This one hit home.
