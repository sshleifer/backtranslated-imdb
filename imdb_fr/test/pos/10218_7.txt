Clive Barker of Hellraiser has written and produced a fantastic, funny and exciting horror film. <br /> <br /> The makeup done by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic. It took a lot of imagination to find these mutants who lived underground. It was really a treat to see the quality of the work. <br /> <br /> It was not particularly horrible, because the worst creature was actually a human serial killer. <br /> <br /> I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he also did a good job in this movie. Nothing spectacular, but just. It was only Anne Bobby's third film, and she was good too. <br /> <br /> The end was spectacular and the rednecks got their just dessert, just like David Cronenberg. Ha!
