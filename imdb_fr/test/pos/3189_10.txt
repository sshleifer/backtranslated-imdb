Love In Limbo is my favorite movie of all time. (set in WA) It is hilarious and has an excellent cast including a group of three gorgeous actors, Russell Crowe (As Arthur), at the time he really looked WARM with short hair and no hair on the face. Aden Young (Barry McJannet) and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle. <br /> <br /> Ken is a sex-obsessed high school student who has been expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates. He starts a new job in his uncle's garment factory and gets close with another new guy, Barry McJannet, who buys a car so they can go out and pick up the chicks. They become companions of Arthur Baskin (Crowe), an adorable geek, and the three guys go to Kalgoorlie to go to a brothel and lose their virginity ... <br /> <br /> Look at him, it's a classic !! For so long that I try to get a DVD or a soundtrack, everyone lets me know if you have any.
