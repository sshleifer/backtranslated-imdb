The Venice merchant of William Shakespeare depicts Venice from the sixteenth century. Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish usurer who wants to take revenge on a Catholic who has despised him. The film is a slow intrigue at the beginning that is built during the two hours and more. The film gives a very good appearance to his characters, especially Pacino. Upon learning that Pacino plays a Jew, one would think that it would not work if one looked at Pacino's previous gangster-type movie roles. Nevertheless, it works very well, we must thank the costume designer and the director of the film. The look of all the characters corresponds to the period of the piece. The costumes resemble those of the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> The film depicts a very anti-Semitic atmosphere. From the first to the last minute, we see how Catholics try to make the best possible use of Jews, even to the point of locking them into "ghettos" and not to let them hold regular jobs. In comparison with The Passion of Christ, another recent film considered to be very anti-Semitic, Merchant of Venice gives Passion a Jewish festive air. The film shows how the Jews, or at least Shylock, wanted to take revenge for the mistreatment of the Jews. The shots also seem very relevant and the landscape is sometimes very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film, which makes it even more realistic. Showing the ugly and the ugly can also be considered anti-Semitic, as the ugly is usually shown around the Jews and the beautiful around the Catholics. <br /> <br /> Although the film clearly tries to have a serious aura in some parts adds a little humor to the act. The serious trial between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a bit of humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) enter the trial and decide who will be the winner and the loser. In itself, this may not be funny, but since they were women disguised as men, we could find it quite amusing. The whole scene of cross-dressing would have been probably as memorable if makeup artists and directors Michael Radford had noticed that the two women still looked like women and could easily be recognized. The director could also have realized that women speak with their usual voice instead of trying to sound like men, which partly removes the scene but does not kill it entirely. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film gets a 7 out of 10
