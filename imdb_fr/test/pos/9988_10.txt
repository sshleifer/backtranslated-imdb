The key relationship in a young man's life, his relationship with his father, was perfectly described in this film, "The greatest game ever played". The film showed how important it is for a father to validate his son and let him know that he has the necessary qualities to realize his dream. <br /> <br /> It did not matter what economic and social class manners were obstacles to overcome by both father and son. It did not matter that others cheered on the son in an exuberant celebration. What mattered most was to see his father's hand, then his face approved. The real challenge of father and son had been raised. <br /> <br /> The history of the story kept its amateur status and became a businessman, which proves that everything that happened before the match was the training ground for a valid father-son relationship
