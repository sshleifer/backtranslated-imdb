Charlie Wilson's story-based war tells the story of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent seeking funding to secretly support the Mujahideen in the 1980s in Afghanistan after invasion of the country by the USSR. This conflict played a major role in the last years of the Cold War between the United States and the USSR. <br /> <br /> When it comes to filmmaking, Charlie Wilson's war is a decisive winner. It's well written, well done and well shot. Although Tom Hanks caught the eye for another great performance, I was even more impressed by Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as CIA agent Gust Avrakotos. Scenes of Soviet attacks on under-armed villages and the refugee camp are effectively pulling the heart. The film also gives a good behind-the-scenes glimpse of the issues that Congressman Wilson has to overcome to get the funding he wants. <br /> <br /> There are however two complaints about this film. The first is that there is a secondary plot involving a scandal investigation that is not well developed and which, as such, only distracts the story. The second complaint is that the film misses part of the context of the war. The film gives the impression that the Mujahideen are innocent victims and, although they suffered heavy losses in civilian life, they were in fact rebels who were trying to overthrow the Afghan government. This government, totally ignored in the film, fought unsurprisingly to quell the rebellion, then calling on the Soviet Union to support it in its efforts. The film also ignores the fact that the United States was helping the Mujahideen before the Soviet deployment to Afghanistan. The film alluded to the unintended consequences of our secret actions - the consequences we still feel today - but it seems that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols have agreed to sacrifice a historical context to provide a coherent narrative. (Not having read the book, I do not know if George Crile made the same compromise.) Despite these complaints, I enjoyed watching Charlie Wilson's war and recommend it. I would have preferred a film describing more precisely the complexities of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syriana, but the audience was more in touch with the coherent narrative of Charlie Wilson's war than with the ambiguities in Syriana .
