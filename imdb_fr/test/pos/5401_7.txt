The New York Times magazine stated that Sigourney Weaver's character was tense and frustrated and that she might later be the sister of the MTM character in Ordinary People. Can you repeat that please? No way. This lady was weird from the start. Nothing like MTM in ordinary people. Sorry. <br /> <br /> Next, the NYT goes on to explain that Sandy Travis of Sigourney Weaver and Ben Travis of Jeff Daniel are about 40 years old, "children of the 60s". Mrs. Weaver must be dancing a jig. I think by the time she created Imaginary Heroes, she was 55 years old. She was born in 1949. <br /> <br /> Corrections of perception of the NYT aside, it was a very good movie considering that it was shot by such a young person. Obviously, Sigourney Weaver thought so, as well as Jeff Daniels. The young man who played Tim was exceptional. <br /> <br /> I could make some critical comments about the script. As such, I never really understood why Sandy Travis had missed his son. His type of blown behavior may have been triggered by his death, but this behavior lasted until the film, which, in my opinion, had more to do with his marriage of stagnation, his relationship with Tim, his real provenance, and other unresolved questions, than any mourning of his eldest son. Ben's mourning was much clearer. <br /> <br /> Matt Travis was a jerk. Does his mother think so too? Still, a very watchable film. What is becoming increasingly clear is not that there is no role for women beyond a certain age, but rather that a director such as this one is so clearly in love with an older woman (Mrs. Weaver) and that his film pays tribute to him. A kind of anti-Woody Allen.
