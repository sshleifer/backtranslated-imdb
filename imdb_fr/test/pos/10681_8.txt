Journey to the hidden face of the sun tells the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun that shares the same orbit as the Earth and that was therefore not discovered until a space probe from the other side photography. Of course, two astronauts (Roy Thinnes & Ian Hendry) are sent to explore, but due to a malfunction, they crash and end up on the ground only three weeks after the start of their six-week trip. Of course, they are avenged (at least Thinnes is, Hendry is badly injured) and grilled and asked why they gave up their mission, but they claim they did not. Until Thinnes seems to notice some very strange things about her "back home". It's excellent, although sometimes a bit talkative, and the scenery and feel are not far from the territory of "Thunderbirds", but they will live actors for once. This is not a big production like "Star Wars" but a more discreet science fiction that you have to think about a bit. It is worth seeing and it is criminal that the DVD is exhausted. 8 out of 10
