I had a horrible day but this film caught me and I could not push it to the end ... and I had forgotten my horrible day. and the end ... by the way ... where is the sequel !!! <br /> <br /> the budget is obviously extremely low ... but ... look what they did with it! it makes me think of a play ... they basically work with a tent, a "spare capsule", some firearms, uniforms, camping gear and a "scanner" device. that's all for accessories. It may even be a good thing to force the dramatic action to play and take their rightful place in the film, as the center of the work, instead of after-thoughts, as a pretext for do CGI fights (starwars). <br /> <br /> The cgi is fine. It's not exactly "seamless" ... but in my humble opinion, it still works. Why? because there is not too much, and what is there is not "take over" with an army of personal effects trying to stuff everything in the shot. it encourages the imagination ... it's about relatively simple things, with a decent composition (especially the weight of the heavy cargo ... there is a long stroke that must last at least ten seconds ... which follows the entire length of the ship ... it must be a record for sci fi battle sequence films made in the last 10 years, to have an action sequence that lasts more than 0.75 seconds), and a certain relationship with history. it may seem old or not "at the cutting edge", but it does not look stupid and it does not detract from the story. <br /> <br /> The acting is good, except that the characters die too quickly to get to know them. The captain was great, but some of his scenes could have taken another shot. I was also confused with his character losing his temper and stomping on a corpse. I like to think that captains are calm, cool and in control ... what was going on in this scene? the other crew worried about losing it at that time? did he feel lost control? <br /> <br /> Now, in terms of the plot, it's mostly good ... why? Because he does not try to explain himself. It just happens. It's called 'the planet', it's a mystery, understood? ?? Nobody knows why there is a statue and they do not discover it either. The mysterious cult? The strange scientist with the tattoo? What do you hope to discover in less than 90 minutes? It is not war and peace. And thank god, it's not Star Wars / Trek either. No midchlorians, no 5 minutes of boring dialogue with no content in the story. The characters are blocked and can only understand a few basic elements ... It's not an episode of Star Trek where they discover that it is Leonardo Davinci or a child like Space Wanderer. It's mysterious and I liked it. I do not know why, maybe I can identify more with these guys, since they do not know what's going on, and I do not know them either ... they do not talk a lot about gibberish in space or have no magic box telling them what's going on. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would say that one of the weakest moments is when the "traitor" attacks the crew and tries to "explain" the reason for the planet, worship, etc. The weakest dialogue, in my humble opinion, throughout the movie, interrupts the flow and some characters do not look natural in this scene. <br /> <br /> OK, I sometimes felt it was a little too mysterious. Like, why was the guy fried through his eyes with a lightning bolt? It was strange. Just weird. The "hamlet" ending ... I would have liked to know some of these characters again. And would it have been so difficult to have a 30-second rescue scene at the end? It's not a soap opera, it's a movie, and we like closing in movies, even though they may have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet without 'flight of angels sing to you at rest' <br /> <br /> Anyway. What can I say? It was well worth the dollar that I paid to the "red box" machine at the supermarket. It was also, in my humble opinion, a better story than Starwars (parts 1 or 2). As I said, it sucked me in, wanting to know what was going on, and I could not stop looking to the end.
