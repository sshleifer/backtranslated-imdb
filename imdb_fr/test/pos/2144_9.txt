Until today, I thought there were only three people, including me, who considered Heaven's Gate (1980) as a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western (after 1970), after Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972). The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). <br /> <br /> I was stunned and delighted to see that 22.5% of BDIM voters gave the film a score of 10, just like me. A recent book, The Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate. Through his production and release, he has been vilified, like no film since Cleopatra, almost twenty years ago. At one point, it was considered the most expensive film with a budget over budget, even exceeding Cleopatra. He was accused of dropping his studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios falling. Michael Cimino, recently out of his fame with Deer Hunter, was hated for his success and excessive film, but it was clearly a petty jealousy at worst. <br /> <br /> Cimino ended up shaping one of the best exhibits of the American experience. This film is not to be missed but any serious student of American cinema.
