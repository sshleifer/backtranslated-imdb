While the war was not going well for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted the prison volunteers and used the prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of such a battalion. There are small crooks, political prisoners, soldiers expelled from other units, gray-haired veterans of the White Army and dangerous criminals. <br /> <br /> They are launched into combat, poorly equipped, untrained and face the threat of NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rudimentary and many minor characters are one-dimensional, but the story is very human and captivating. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing. To see the show, it was necessary to use generously the pause button and the explanations of a native speaker of the Russian language.
