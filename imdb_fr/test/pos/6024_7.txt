I own this film and I love Canadian films, but I hire an actress like Rose whom I do not understand. She is completely useless in this film, a name is everything. The rest of the cast is fine, good enough to make this little thriller. I was surprised by the plot that is not the first time it was used. But these unknown actors did very well even Jergen, I'm not a big fan of her but I liked it in this movie. If you have the chance to see it go.
