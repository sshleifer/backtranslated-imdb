I watched this show as I grew up. When I think about it, I remember it pretty well. If you ask me, it was a very good show. Every time I think about it, I do not really remember the opening sequence or the theme song. On top of that, everyone was ideally thrown. In addition, the writing was very strong. The performances were also excellent. I hope a network will bring it back so I can see each episode. Before I finish, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory, although I am not sure I have seen all the episodes. In conclusion, if a network brings him back, I hope that you will catch him one day before his final disappearance.
