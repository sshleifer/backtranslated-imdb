While browsing the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the BDIM have posted on this film, I find it very interesting to note the few comments "in the middle of the road". Everyone likes it or hates it. After seeing Apocalypse Now about 30 times and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without these magic digital machines ?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those occupying a place very special in my heart for this movie. "Why would you want such a confusing film?" ask a lot of my associates. The answer is: forget the war, forget the brutality ... It is the classic history of society that protects itself from those who refuse to align with the status quo. Brando represents the person who has his own way of doing the work. They (Big Brother) sent him to do the work, he does it too well, without adhering to accepted "standards" of death and destruction (Am I the only one to be troubled by the fact that we have "standards" for death and destruction ????), then they send the "police of conformity" to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm .... Do you draw a parallel between that and what you see every day? With all due respect to Mr. Coppola, who, in my opinion, is one of the best directors of all time, I think he transcended the original intention of the film and probably did not made before the release of the film. The subtle subtext that permeates the entire film has too much to do to have been planned and described; instead, he seems to have "developed" himself, like a wild flower in the middle of a kitchen garden. Once again, I have to say again: I think that FF Coppola has done an extraordinary job on all this production, as well as the actors and the technical team, but the sum of the film exceeds by ten times the individual efforts. So, if you have not seen the movie, praise it, look at it, then look at it again, and maybe a few more times, and look for all the generic parallels with everyday life. Only then, make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you who have seen it, look at it again with the state of mind previously described. I think you can have a whole new appreciation of the movie. Or maybe not! Whether you like it or hate it, be sure to thank Coppola for his masterly narrative style!
