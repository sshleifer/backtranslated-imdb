To experience Head, you really need to understand where the Monkeys were when they filmed it. <br /> <br /> It was at the end of their series and when the group was about to part. Their inventive and humorous series (a kind of American Idol of their time) brought together four unknown actors and formed a super group built around them. Beatles level. They have always felt in a box, trapped and unable to find credibility despite their talents. <br /> <br /> It's also a triumphant musical hell, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises. <br /> <br /> See him with an open mind.
