I watched the pilot episode for this one with great expectations, having just finished my studies and moved on to "real life". I was not in a fraternity, but many of my best friends were, and I had the opportunity to participate in a lot of parties at home, so I know what's going on to a certain extent. <br /> <br /> This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life, nor even of university life, even if it contains a lot of truth, although exaggerated for most. If you watch the program for the value it contains as a television show and nothing else, it's very entertaining, much like movies like Old School, Porky's, Animal House, and so on. experiences in your own college life, you will probably be left wanting more, or crazy that they dramatize too many events.
