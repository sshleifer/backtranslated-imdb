This first (and probably not the last) feature of Wallace & Gromit is up to expectations. There are many jokes (some a bit cheeky) as well as great tributes to past science fiction movies. With the flood of horrendous and Hollywood-inspired movies, it's nice to see such a great movie like this that's enjoyable for almost everyone. If there is justice, it will be the box office top office and at least one nomination for the best animation at the next Oscars. The animation is beautiful. the characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are very entertaining. It's one of those movies that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, smart, fun and well done, why not enjoy it?
