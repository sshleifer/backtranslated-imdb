HELLO, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is simply a beautiful film! Writer / director Shemi Zarhin has created a story unlike any other and presents it with actors as good as it is hard to say that this film has not become a public favorite around the world. He is intelligent, emotional, uplifting, warm, entertaining and, in all categories, a winner. Shlomi (Oshri Cohen, in a brilliantly understated performance) is a 16 year old boy who cares for his very dysfunctional family: her mother (Esti Zakheim) is about as grumpy as ever and still angry at her deceived husband, and because she has to work double-handed to support her sick father-in-law (Ariek Elias who, as Shlomi's grandfather, is a brilliant, funny, wise and loving old man who cares deeply about Shlomi); a married sister Ziva (Rotem Abuhab) who periodically returns home due to ongoing quarreling with her husband who is not helping her to care for their twin sons; his brother Sasi (Assi Cohen) whose life consists of strong electric guitars, boast against female conquests and his mother's favorite son. Mix this mixture and you get the penultimate dysfunctional family unit. Shlomi prepares them gourmet meals, shops, cleans the house, runs errands, bathes and cares for this grandfather. In general, he leads a life of submission in a family that considers him a 'backwardness'. Shlomi aspires to a girlfriend and nearly fails school due to lack of time for family care and lack of care. of concentration. By chance, his math teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) notes his natural mathematical genius during an abandoned test. With the help of the director (Yigal Nair), the two encourage him to be tested and discover he is a genius ("with dyslexia?) And arrange for him to try a special school in Haifa. Shlomi's mother will not hear it, but between fighting with Shlomi's absent father (Albert Iluz) and clashes with the teacher and the director, they finally agree to be tested for school. Shlomi discovers a girl of her age, Rona (Aya Koren), who has moved next door and gradually the two are intertwined in a physical and intellectual relationship.The support of Shlomi's grandfather is still in the background and when her grandfather dies, Shlomi embarks on the journey to live her life for herself, to make her gifts, to find happiness.The way the family approaches this problem is the climax of the film and does not need to be revealed in order to lose nothing of the power of the message. t beautifully photographed, the score is creative and the end result. is one of the exaltation of the human spirit. Highly recommended at all levels. In Hebrew with English subtitles.
