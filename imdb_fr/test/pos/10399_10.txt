Beyond The Clouds is a work of elegance, of haunting beauty. The general softness of the light in which this film is bathed makes you want to touch the screen. The autumnal atmosphere evoked could only be realized by a director who has experienced several summers of experience. Or, to put it another way, an old man. I do not know of any other film that captures and uses the softness of light and the seasonal mood with a quality as beautiful as Beyond The Clouds. Almost all the characters in this movie are beautiful, unless your idea of ​​a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blonde bimbo, that is to say. The dialogue does not matter much, even if there are many, and in terms of scenarios, forget it. Some movies exist as visual experiences, it's one of them. Do not bother if you want a "simple entertainment", it's not for you. <br /> <br /> I could talk about the visual perfection of this movie for days, but I will not do it. If you are interested in cinematography, photography, film direction, etc., watch this movie.
