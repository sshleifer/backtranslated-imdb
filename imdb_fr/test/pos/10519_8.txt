I tried to remember the name of this movie for years and years. Finally, read today, 03/09/2005, something that mentions the name of Stacy Keach and it reminds me that I had seen a film in which he was in 1974 at the Atlanta Film Festival. and found the sauce train. We were supposed to see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they were unable to show it. So they replaced The Gravy Train. We were terribly disappointed not to be able to see the very keen Duddy Kravitz. We had never heard of The Gravy Train. We have not heard about it since. <br /> <br /> However, I remember We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film and, if I remember correctly, it was rather funny. I would love to find it on tape.
