Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole film is really shooting and fighting! For people who say do not shoot up as before. Well, this one is really hard! David Bradley is really good and his character is caught in the movie. He is hit by the stick more than a dozen times, gets stung in the back and stays in a coma for three days. He wakes up and fights again, gets beaten up, recovers and is ready for more action! His character is incredibly tuff! Charles Napier was very good too and he steals the show! Vernen Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka played a short and uncredited role in Hard Justice! Regarding the action, it's really great with all the rifle fights and the huge stand-off, as in the beginning, detonated the cars and made them jump in the air! There is so much going on in 95 minutes. For action fans, you'll be dazzled by all the firepower and fighting this movie has to offer! Hard Justice is a difficult film to locate and if you are in a video store and you see it for sale, buy it because this movie is a great goalie and the box is cool! There is a ton of action that must be seen to be believed! Look and see if you can find bargains on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place vendors! I highly recommend to all fans of action movies who love filming and fighting movies to have been disappointed by other films that have the look of a non-stop action movie but that fail to produce it to obtain Hard Justice!
