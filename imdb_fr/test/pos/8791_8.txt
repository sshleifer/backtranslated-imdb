Super movie! Oh yes! Full of energy, pleasure, presenting our generation, our alienation: a hymn to positive thinking despite the world we live in, a legend of a great party, a story of a group of friends who desperately need to do something at the end of the week and the only thing to do is the club. But fun and ecstasy ward off boredom! Very funny, nicely grotesque in a few points, beautifully shot ... and beautiful soundtrack!
