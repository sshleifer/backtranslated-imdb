I can not explain it, but I find this film not only funny, but so nice that I feel compelled to watch it again and again, or at least I did it when I had cable TV. I always thought it was a really bad movie, but maybe it was because I watched it on the cable. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to take a look honest, but especially to have a good time watching it. I liked the plot and the idea of ​​the film and I particularly liked the casting. I always wonder if the actors liked to make the movies in which they are and this is no exception. This film deserved a better fate than it had received and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Mrs. Holly. Who would not be? The characters in this movie were the kind of guy I could relate to when I was in the army and the zaniness was right. Nice goes troops.
