Seeing this film, or rather a series of films, in the early days of my adolescence has irreversibly changed my idea of ​​the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experiences. This monumental exploration of individuals and their historical background reveals how each human existence is full-bodied and intense. People are portrayed as they are for themselves: their experiences of internal and external phenomena, from the smallest to the largest, are detailed with the greatest artistic sense and perception. Edgar Reitz displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and aspirations. <br /> <br /> When these phenomena come up against the immense time allotted by the length of the work, we can not help but grasp the strength and vivacity of happiness, of defeat, covetousness, love, sadness, melancholy , that every person feels. When I saw these films, I perceived my future experiences and how my life would inevitably twist and wobble as a result of planned and accidental events. I gained a sense of longevity and what it meant to reflect on past lives, memories, and contexts. A masterpiece and a revelation. I only hope that the BBC will watch it again. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows where I can get a copy, could he contact me
