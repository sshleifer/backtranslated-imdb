I saw this movie just once, and I can not wait to see it again and again. Dear David (of Beligium), why did you take the trouble to write a comment on this film? I only think that we can think of you (after reading your comment) is that you are obviously a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie) and that you are not ready for the new cinema to come. I guess you're a little old and sexual expression is not part of your "face". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best film festival, and I am happy to say that this film has been awarded by: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prize. Isabelle Huppert is beautiful, as always, who would make this film like her? One of his best performances. The music is fantastic and once again, Michael Haneke puts reality on the big screen. It's like a kind of Dogma95 movie, because of the subject. Try to see him. <br /> <br />
