So, here's a little background on how I came to see this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French film, which was then redone (what a surprise) by Hollywood under the name of Wicker Park. Well, I avoided this movie like the plague on its first outing, simply because, a) I knew it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park and, living in Chicago, I did not see why they called it that - it was filmed in Canada to start! - b) I have a lot of trouble dealing with unnecessary remakes, only because Hollywood thinks we are too crazy to read some subtitles (I dread the remake of Infernal Affairs, by the way) and c I can not stand Josh Hartnett, said Nuff. <br /> <br /> However, I came across WP on TV the other day, probably about half an hour, and I must say at the beginning that it makes no sense, until about half a -the end time, when he started coming together. In the end, I was really surprised to find myself in it. And then, the end seemed so good: a perfect combination of story, passion and eventually ending with one of the biggest musical choices I've ever seen (heard?). ). <br /> <br /> Since then, I've heard a lot about The Apartment vs. Wicker Park and looking at WP, I always say it has everything to do with Chicago, but there seemed to be something about I looked at it - unfortunately, I still miss the first piece (I still have not seen it!), and I still thought it was pretty good. Heck, even Josh Hartnett looked good! But I was curious to know The Apartment and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So I waited to wait for the apartment somewhere. Netflix dropped me, so I ended up getting a copy of a website in Ireland. And I just watch it. <br /> <br /> It's really a bit weird, but good. A classic French film. Very good actor, Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she plays Monica Bellucci on screen in every scene. Vincent Cassel was a strange choice for the lead role but in the end he works. And I've seen Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in a lot of movies and I really like it - the scene where Alice throws him out to the restaurant and where he looks like someone told him that his puppy was crushed was awful! But, I can honestly say, after seeing WP and hoping it would have been a scene for the scene copy (about 75% of the rest of the movie had been - maybe in a different order, but go, the scene with the coffee in the glasses' word for word !!), you can imagine my surprise by watching the end of The Apartment !! I can literally say that I was blown away - hmm, a bit like poor old Lucien was really through the coffee window! So be prepared, if you've seen Wicker Park and you want to take a look at the original like me, do not make the mistake of waiting for an identical movie, because you will be either disappointed or intoxicated by a piece of French Film History - an excellent example of how you can watch a movie, think you're going to watch a happy ending, and get a whiplash of total spin in the opposite direction at the end. Certainly catch this movie. Oh, and as long as you're there, maybe not too close at the same time, but at the end of the street, take a look at Wicker Park, it'll surprise you too.
