Always funny after all these years. Midnight Madness is a good entertainment for all ages. He presents Michael J Fox as a typical 15-year-old troublemaker. Melio and Blaylak are by far the most funny characters and Leon is perfectly qualified as wierdo master of the game. The incipient romance between Adam and the girl could not have been more pleasing. Fagabeefe !!!!
