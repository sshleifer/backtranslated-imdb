I saw this movie and anyone who has ever worked with the Marines or any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this film. It is a must for any collection. Jack Webb does a great job as an experienced instructor. My dad went to Camp Penelton's Marine training camp and said it was so accurate that he felt he was going back to basic training. There is a line in the film where the character of Jack Webbs is angry at a boot for killing a flea. Well, let me tell you there are only sand fleas in the camp. I went there and I can appreciate it. In fact, the output of the camp is Las Puljas which means English city of fleas. you have to watch the movie to appreciate what I say. Anyone who loves movies about World War II, all battles start here with Exercise Sgt. A must for your collection
