It turns out that Chris Farley and David Spade only shot three movies together ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but it was truly the "Citizen Kane" of their couple. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the dark heir of a car parts company. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires Richard Hayden (David Spade) with gentle manners to take care of him. Big Tom gets married with a "ten" (Bo Derek), so everything has to be in order. After the sudden death of Big Tom, Tommy and Richard must try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. From that moment, the film is a good excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best: ruin everything. <br /> <br /> When this film was released for the first time in movie theaters, I grandfathered. He quickly realized that the characters of Bo Derek and Rob Lowe were hiding something. But you can completely ignore that and just enjoy Chris Farley's antics. Nothing is safe around her belly and hell has no fury comparable to her cheerful attitude. The scene where he sets the cars on fire, and later the deer scene, is a riot of laughter. Chris Farley and David Spade were really John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of their time. It's a pleasure to always be able to think of "Fat guy in a little coat".
