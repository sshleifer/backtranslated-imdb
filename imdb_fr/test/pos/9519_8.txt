Wow .... it's been a long time since I've seen such an hilarious movie like this !!!!! I have never been a big fan of French films, but since I fell in love with Catherine Deneuve's beauty and actress talents, I decided to see all her films ... but I did not think that this one would be. so fantastic that it turned out to be. Fortunately for me, I bought it even if I had doubts! It's really a film of "well-being" with class and quality. There are great social topics and moral dramas involved that are very close to today's modern lifestyle and that are shown to be very beautiful and realistic. I also loved the dance scene in the men's room! But my favorite is the rather shy attempt of Catherine Deneuve to sing ..... she brings it as it is, with a lot of grace and modesty at the same time ... very tempting! Further, I would also like to express my respect and admiration for Line Renaud, who played a fantastic role (I did not even know she had played ... I only knew her for her music). So, do not wait and see the movie ... you will be surprised in many ways.
