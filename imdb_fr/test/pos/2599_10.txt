Daffy Duck has signs hanging on every inch of every available tree, announcing the end of the rabbit season. But you guessed it, it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he is the only hunter stupid enough to crack. <br /> <br /> He is even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny approaches him and asks him about the rabbit hunt, Elmer admits he has not seen a rabbit yet. It's more than Daffy can handle. He leaves his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "Shut up," Bugs said. "He does not have to shoot you now." Daffy insists that it be so. <br /> <br /> After Daffy has returned his shaved beak, he is condemned to more arguments infected by the "pronoun disorder" that all have the same result. Later, Bugs dresses up like a sexy woman and flirts with Elmer for a duck dinner. Will Daffy have the last word? "Ha, ah, very funny! Ha, ah, ah!" <br /> <br /> What's funny about this classic drawing? An insect recedes, frightened by Daffy's howls. Bugs Bunny says "Yes?" while dripping with personal satisfaction. Daffy Duck stands on tiptoe, demanding to be shot. Elmer Fudd complains that he "can not wait for a wonger." Daffy sees bedbugs in women's clothes and makes that little noise with her tongue. Carl Stalling plays "You must have been a beautiful baby" during the Bugs drag act. Daffy demands an "honest honesty" of Bugs. Stalling plays "Home Sweet Home" at an inappropriate moment. Daffy tells Bugs he's "unstoppable". <br /> <br /> In five words: every detail of this film. <br /> <br /> NOTE: This short film is available on "Golden Looney Tunes Collection, Volume One," Disc 1
