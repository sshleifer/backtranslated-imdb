This film was not really about stereotypes, dance moves, or lines of recovery. This film spoke of the vulnerability of hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy without action and that a kind of movie as successful could succeed in this way. I do not intend to seem too attached to this film - it was not at all "revolutionary" - but it was a film that was worth the detour. Was it credible? No. New York could not be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of humanity who owns Hitch's "hutzpah". Of course, there are poles, but not those who can catch any chick at any time - with the exception of those who catch seven figures, of course. What worked best for this film was that it really focused on the dramatic side of things, not just comedy. It was a fun two hours, no doubt. But it's also two hours that brought you to your seat, immerse yourself in the characters and smile.
