Originally, I saw this film while I was working as a musician and playing musical theater in the summer. If you've ever worked in the theater - especially in a summer theater - you'll really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are moments of very bad writing in the film, but on the whole it is a beautiful tribute to the theater and why people love it.
