Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films such as The Beyond and Zombie, was previously a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A lizard in a woman's skin and her boss Torture A Duckling. This film contains all the elements of the Italian genre of thriller / mystery known as giallo, but really draws the audience by arranging each key character with a skeleton in his own closet. This allows you to do as much detective work as the detectives of the movie itself. Who kills young boys in town? The rich young woman who is so bored that she sexually mocks victims, the journalist who likes to manipulate a crime scene to get a better photo, the city girl with a mentally handicapped girl, the local witch, the idiot of the city ​​.. ..the list goes on, and you have to keep mental notes as a real game to play and solve. The themes of this film are very daring and made with this perfect Italian style of the early 1970s. Certainly no American studio would have even considered making a film with such powerful content, and that is precisely why it's such a satisfying movie (despite some unusual accent choices for dubbing) and will certainly get people to debate it long after. to look at it. As the saying goes, they are not like that anymore, so buy a copy and cherish a film as important as this one!
