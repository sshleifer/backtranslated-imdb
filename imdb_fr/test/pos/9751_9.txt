I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few games were slow, but that only served to set the mood and prepare for action. I thought this film was very informative, it taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louise Arbor and I can say she has a great influence on me. In April 2004, Time magazine named Louise Arbor among the 100 most influential people in the world. I recommend this movie to people who like historical movies (obviously). This film was very dramatic, but always said the truth about the events in the former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave heroine and I'm glad they made a film in his honor. If you see the movie, I hope you enjoy it.
