I thought this movie was really good. He ended up showing viewers in the end that Leila should keep what she had. Leila was tired of her husband Jim, who was more worried about her job than she was. He was so in his job that he forgot their birthday. He was also very sloppy. She could not take it anymore, so she left to see if she would miss him. The film shows that she misses him, he even tries to catch up with the night where he ruined everything. He goes to her house and tries to bring her home. She ends up finding another man named Schuyler. He looked like the man she had always wanted to look after and noticed her. In the end, she prefigures a bit when she looks at the Schuylers shoes and the way he drops his cigar as Jim did the same thing. Jim ends up making a lot of money and cleaning himself up. Leila finally thinks she should keep her husband because that's all she really wanted and he changed.
