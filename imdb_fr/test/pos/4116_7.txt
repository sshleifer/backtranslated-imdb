I thought it was a great movie, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have excellent chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character embodies a deceased woman, in love with the character of Richard Greico. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except that Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, but she has trouble conceiving. Richard Greico will do everything to make her happy and take extreme measures to make her happy. I thought that acting was great in this movie, and it lets you guess. It shows how naive we can be when we fall in love. Yasmine Bleeth is a good actress in this field and I wonder why she has never done so far in her career. Richard Greico is very impressive as a deceitful husband and plays the role of evil very well. I wonder why some actors do it and some do not. All a good movie I would recommend.
