I bought this DVD at Walmart for cheap, thinking it would be a typical monster junk, but it turned out better than expected. There are not really any criticisms to make about it ... it's obviously a small budget, but it just adds to the fun and old-fashioned entertainment. It's very cool and fun. <br /> <br /> There is everything: horror, sex, a nice plane crash and good characters. And I would say it's pretty original, because it really does not come like any other movie I've seen. It has its own unique look, which I liked a lot, which is why this movie deserves a credit. I can not wait to see these great films from The Scare Master, Brett Piper, which I have never heard before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is really creative with groovy music playing it so it's perfect to keep it when you're not ready to sit down and watch it. It also includes special features, which are really interesting. But we never see the director and we do not hear in the comment, we must be shy. This comes from Edgewood Studios in Vermont, USA. I highly recommend it to all horror lovers, you will love it!
