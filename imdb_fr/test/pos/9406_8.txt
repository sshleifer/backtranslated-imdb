This great TV movie recounted the murder of Martha Moxley in 1975 in Greenwich, Connecticut by a nephew of Ethel Kennedy. The use of Martha's "ghost" to provide certain details has been very effective and has added a lot of heart to the story. Christopher Meloni seemed to capture Mark Fuhrman's personality very well. Furhman, who had so bad publicity in the O.J. The Simpson trial was certainly justified by his contribution to bringing the murderer to justice after about 27 years.
