Double Shock is one of many good episodes of Columbo that reaches the level of a good movie. <br /> <br /> It contains all the elements we like in the episodes of Columbo. We have laughter when Columbo does something clumsy, and this happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee you will laugh many times if you decide to watch this episode. <br /> <br /> We also have the riddle as usual with almost perfect murder, but there is something about murder that troubles Columbo. The end is usual, we describe how Columbo solved the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is another good episode of Columbo, and I'll note it 7/10. It's almost 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Another question" - The acting game? Peter Falk is very good as usual.
