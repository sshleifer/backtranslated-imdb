Overall, we would like the film to be better, but it has enough intense power to be worth it. Peck shot this film at the same time as The Gunfighter, before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor. Pity! He was a good actor, perfectly willing to approach unattractive characters and do them extremely well. The character he plays here is determined and, if need be, ruthless. Given the mission that has been assigned to the character and the "men" with whom to do it, these characteristics are essential. <br /> <br /> Without being a spoiler, consider this film as an early and more graceful example of Dirty Dozen genre. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is a little tense, but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story that is worth it. It contains good work from all actors and even Barbara Payton achieves a credible performance. <br /> <br /> This is not often shown on television. Your local video store may be the only place to find a copy. Go forward! Devote an evening to this. This is worth your time!
