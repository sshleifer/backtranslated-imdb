Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) has just graduated from a six-month drug rehabilitation program and purified his gambling cards from illegal gambling card games. He hopes to clean up and find a new life as a drummer. However, as soon as he returns to his old crime-infested Chicago neighborhood, he quickly discovers the growing pressure from those around him, including his wheelchair-bound wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker), to return to the old style of crime. life of "Dealer" that brought in the money. He embarked on the path of self-destruction that is a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> It's very rare that a movie has as many great characters as this movie. Frank Sinatra is superb as Frankie Machine and realistically describes the symptoms of a drug addict who is in a state of withdrawal, which is probably better than anyone else has ever been before. Sinatra seems to possess an understanding and keen awareness of her character here and expresses the constant battle for control of her own life that is always happening in the heart of the man who is Frankie Machine. Parker, as a disabled woman, Zosch wants to own Frankie forever, to make him "earn" and earn money to take care of her and pay her ever higher medical bills. She seems terrified by anything that seems to her to be a threat to her control, such as the freedom that a drummer's life could offer, or anything that could change the status quo between them. <br /> <br /> The viewer Molly (Kim Novak), a girl who lives in the same building and seems to have real, sincere and strong feelings for Frankie, not wanting to control him, but only to help him prove the best of what Frankie has to do for the world if he can. Stay right long enough to wake me up and understand it. Darren McGavin as a heroin drug salesman, Louie, is still waiting behind the scenes, knowing that you have to press the right buttons to push, just what to say, for a former addict to come back to this old habit, profitable for Louie but deadly. for the addict. <br /> <br /> The decor also seems to lead a clean life, always dark, rocky, fishy and deadly, and there are not enough positive things to live in, a place where it is too easy to escape with a bottle or drugs, a quick fix is ​​really not a solution, but only to keep it away from the light of day and all the promising prospects that the world can offer. It's interesting to note that when Frankie is on the right track, the setting always seems brighter than when he's heading in the wrong direction. Some people claim that it's a bit old-fashioned, but for me it's a heartbreaking film about a realistic inner war within a man to control his own destiny, a film with very strong character interpretations by everyone involved. In view of this, THE GOLDEN MAN receives my highest possible recommendation.
