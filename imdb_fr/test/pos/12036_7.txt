Okay, when it comes to conspiracy, this film is far from credible and also a bit ridiculous. Yet, despite its many shortcomings, the film manages to work - provided you turn off your brain and just let you enjoy the zanity of it all. If you can not, this movie will probably not please you much. <br /> <br /> In one of the strangest scenes of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a guy living near the Arctic Circle wireless station. He is unsure of how he arrived in such a distant post, but in this very, very secluded and isolated existence, a series of guests follow one another - even though it had been years since he had seen anyone other than Eskimos. <br /> <br /> First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy arrive when their plane crashed. They are supposed to be on the way to Montreal - how wrong they were so far, it's amazing! Reginald is a stifling and boring guy who really cares for Montgomery, since Robert has not seen a woman for a very long time and Owen seems to constantly fear that Montgomery wants to steal Loy for himself. As for Montgomery, it's EXACTLY what his plans are! For a very long time, you never really understand why Loy is engaged to Owen - since he's as attractive as wet bread. <br /> <br /> Soon, Loy and Montgomery fall in love, but it's all for nothing when again, Montgomery's old fiancee arrives to announce that she's here to marry her !! Considering that for more than two years, she never wrote and refused to follow him, Montgomery naturally assumed that the relationship was over - but the sudden arrival of the chipper and the annoying fianc√©e is enough to destroy the plans of Loy and Montgomery. <br /> <br /> The way all this is solved is something you can see for yourself. As far as the film is concerned, the plot is very stupid and artificial - I can not defend that. BUT, it's also quite funny and charming and I see this film as a crazy comedy that is only a step or two under contemporary movies like BRINGING UP BABY. Silly, light but also very charming. It is worth seeing even though it is not particularly credible.
