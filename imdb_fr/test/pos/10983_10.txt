If Hollywood cared about the well-being of the public, we would see 20 films a year with the kind of courage behind that film. There are many experiences of personal growth in this film and although the characters are still very human, even the lessons learned are not that greed will benefit you, or that you will do to others what you want as long as you you want it. that's what our sad and desensitized lives need, more meaning ... more love ... more to do-to-others-like-you-would-you-be-made-to-do the shelter you ... more hope. (Thanks, Ursula!) This film has an intelligent mind, not "yo 'mama" cracks that are rampant in so-called comedies. People need to feel good. This film will make you feel good and will inspire you to improve your life and the lives of others. sidenote Every person counts in ticket sales. It's a really independent film. If you want more quality movies, you have to support them.
