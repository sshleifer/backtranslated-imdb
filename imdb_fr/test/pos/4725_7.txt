Patricia Arquette plays the role of the American doctor Laura Bowman, who goes on holiday in Burma to try to heal her mind after the murders of her husband and young son. She is left in Rangoon during the military repression and leaves the city with an elderly man who works as a "tour guide". But he is not a simple tourist guide; it's a teacher who introduces him to life outside the tourist traps ... the two find themselves caught in political chaos and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses its own people. <br /> <br /> This film is one of my favorites because of its themes. First, it is informative (describing some of the injustices that occur in Burma). Second, it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. Third, it is compassion and sacrifice, and people who meet - without even knowing each other - to endure pain and fear. <br /> <br /> Almost all the beautiful scenes in this film are important; nothing is wasted here. It's a serious and moving film. There is also a very emotional score composed by Hans Zimmer that completes the scenes well. <br /> <br /> A definitive recommendation, especially to those concerned with human rights ... and those who want to know: "What is the purpose of serving?" <br /> <br />
