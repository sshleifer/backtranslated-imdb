Although I have not seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius and that only a man of his talent would take charge of this daring subject - a comedy about Hitler. All the great satire is based on going out on an edge. In addition, all major comedy deals with the other side - pathos. Looks like this movie is going to graze both sides. Like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, The Great Dictator deals with history through the distorted prism of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is to laugh at it. And I hope that with laughter we can learn to see the world in a new light. Another film that comes to my mind is Underground by Emir Kusturica and Fando And Lis. So, let me watch the movie first.
