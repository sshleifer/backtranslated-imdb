This film has come a long way and generally receives far less credit than it is due. It addresses an omnipresent topic in our daily lives, but is considered a phenomenon so widespread that it does not deserve to be discussed. This phenomenon is that of caregivers (whether they are doctors or, as in "Broken Promise", a seasoned social worker) who abuse their position to harm those they are responsible for protecting. <br /> <br /> In Broken Promise, Patty Clawson and her family are abandoned by their parents; but are soon picked up by local law enforcement. Faced with a certain prospect of foster care, Patty begs a young social worker to keep her with her siblings. This social worker speaks to a senior manager in another department, but his application is denied. <br /> <br /> The children are divided into separate homes, which allows them to follow the prevailing opinions of the day and ensure a "clean break". But it is this event, the "unfulfilled promise" that gives its name to the film, that causes the dramatic tension that will continue throughout the film. Irritated by the apparent betrayal of the young social worker, Patty Clawson flees from the foster home where she was sent. <br /> <br /> Confronted with the difficult task of finding one's family in a climate where the ideal seems to be a complete separation from the past; she does the only possible thing to find out where they are and gets into the main social worker's office to steal the file. <br /> <br /> Arrested shortly after discovering that she had made herself a dangerous enemy. Furious at the embarrassment that this little girl caused her, as well as at her department, the main social worker decides to use her power and authority to destroy her; what he is legally quite capable of doing. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This subject, harms caused by caregivers clients, is relatively taboo. Admittedly, there has been very little discussion in the films because few filmmakers wish to follow the path that would imply that caregivers cause harm. <br /> <br /> I think this film plays a very important role in raising public awareness of this sort of thing. The case described is not only plausible, but has probably already occurred many times before for many other children around the world. This film is essential for changing public opinion in order to eliminate laws that protect pests like the main social worker in "Broken Promise". <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Broken Promise. It is particularly suitable for trainees social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and other health professionals. This is a lesson in avoidance that deserves to be taken to heart. <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> As for acting in "The Broken Promise." "Melissa Michaelsen plays a superb role as Patty Clawson, especially in films such as this credibility is critical.If the viewer did not identify with the character of Patty, the entire message of the film would be compromised. Melissa still does not play in the movies, as her performance in "Broken Promise" shows she has had exceptional talent.
