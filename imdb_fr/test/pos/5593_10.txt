The fantastic 5-star game makes this a must-see show. <br /> <br /> According to a play, THE SILVER CORD talks about "the love of the mother" at its worst. The film was highly controversial because of the implicit homosexuality of the younger son and the mother's "romantic" abnormal feelings for both sons. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne plays the role of the new wife (and biologist who travels with her husband McCrea) to visit the family before heading to New York for their new jobs. But something seems wrong. <br /> <br /> The mother, Laura Hope Crews, seems rude to the fianc√©e of her youngest son (Eric Linden) (Frances Dee). But Dunne puts such thoughts aside and ignores some of the strange things of the mother. Then she discovers that "her" room is at the end of McCrea's hallway and that it is contiguous to her mother's room. <br /> <br /> Later, she comes in while "mom" fondles McCrea and kisses her (on the lips) good night. Mom also worked on Linden and made him doubt his feelings for Dee. Everything explodes and Dee rushes into the snowy night towards the frozen pond. As the boys chase her, Mom screams from the window so that the boys come back for their coats! Dee falls through the ice and is saved. <br /> <br /> When the girls leave the house the next morning, Dunne lets mom know what she thinks of her and her attachment to boys. But Mom has a tight grip, simulating sickness and bragging about her sacrifices forever. The girls leave but the boys stay ....... <br /> <br /> Crews is gorgeous as a voracious mother (repeating her role on stage); it's a part that few actresses would dare to play. The sexual connotations are incredible for a 1933 film and Crews takes advantage of his best role in the film. Dunne is also excellent as she tries to maneuver the course without losing McCrea. Dee has great scenes after she gets dumped by Linden, perplexed. All 5 stars are fantastic in this drama that is strangely underrated and unknown. <br /> <br /> A neglected jewel for all those who love the game ......
