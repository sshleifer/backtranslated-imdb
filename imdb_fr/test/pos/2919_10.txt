As a lover of the Egyptians, this is a classic piece of the 50's as well as my other favorite, Land of the Pharaohs. "The sets and colors are simply beautiful and everything looks so" neat "in the quality of the production, Victor Mature was well chosen and Peter Ustinov is a real gem! The whole look of the film (as well as others of that time) has an appeal that you can not get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I see the 1999 film "Mom, but I'm sure I'll like it!"). <br /> <br /> The best!
