What some fixed-error dialogues and / or rejection as archetypal descriptor accurately represents how people spoke, lived and were before the Second World War, let alone whatever the years that "The Big Trail" represents on film. <br /> <br /> The film took my breath away the first time I saw it years ago. Reading the charts here helped me understand why the movie was a box-office failure and why moviegoers enjoyed Wayne's benefits in B Westerns for another ten years. In my opinion, Wayne was better in "The Big Trail" and the BS years than most of his stars turn after 1939 with Ford's incredible trilogy of cavalry, "True Grit" and "The Shootist" being exceptions exceptional. <br /> <What a shame that the theaters missed the boat in 1930. If this film had taken place, we might have had more movies with more realism and less hokum. In my opinion, it is not only one of the most beautiful Westerns ever filmed with a dialogue and a realization of specific character, but also one of the most beautiful representations of a passage of any kind ever set movie. <br /> <br /> take your breath away. Especially the dialogue and the precise characterizations of types that simply do not exist anymore. Some people celebrate the superficial homogenization of our culture, which in reality hides the greatest cultural degradation (in "people like us" and "people like them") and the political divide (corporatists vs. great streetists) in American history, but for me "The Big Trail" It was a moment when our superficial differences were more obvious, but under them most people wanted to understand the failures of the nation and most aspired to create a great culture and a great nation. <br /> <br /> "The Great Trail" is an epic melting pot movement to the American dream. Certainly the best movie on this path I have ever seen. this subject never filmed.
