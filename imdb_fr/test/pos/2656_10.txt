Spoilers to come. <br /> <br /> 2001: The Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most difficult and successful film of the late Stanley Kubrick. It's not a movie you watch to be entertained or entertained. Instead, he offers you a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind long after the movie ends. It's a movie you could meditate on. <br /> <br /> The film intentionally offers us more questions than it can answer, it is made to enigmate and mystify, but nevertheless leaves the viewer with a feeling of respect and reverence (ie to say that he is engaged in the process of visualization, the enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the part of the spectators) the questions he asks are vast and disturbing, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race it's the ultimate place in cosmic design and the existence or lack of creative intelligence behind the very structure of the universe. <br /> <br /> The first of the Four Quartets films gives us a distinct view of the past of the species. We see our distant ancestors, half monkeys, half human, in a state of near famine. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and vegetarian animals are on the verge of starvation. An extraterrestrial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by its presence in tool making and violence. Overnight they turn into carnevores, and when two tribes meet near a water source, the tribe that developed the ability to make tools, as well as beligerence, completely destroys the neighboring tribe. The new leader of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology, triumphantly throws the bone he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is torn by nuclear paranoia. The features inspired by the appearance of the monument that once allowed us to survive now threaten our very existence. <br /> <br /> Once again, humanity is in crisis, once again the supernatural presence represented by the black monolith will come to the aid of humanity. in the next stage of its development. When exploring the Moon, we discover a monolith identical to the one we saw earlier. The world's governments, normally deadly enemies, have met in secret to discuss the implications. A mission is arranged. the monument was engaged in a kind of radio communication with Jupiter. Some men will go to the destination of the transmission. Most of them will, for the most part, be kept in a state of suspended animation. The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL, a supercomputer programmed to mimic all the traits of the human being. <br /> <br /> The film presents many remarkable sequences. As usual at Kubrick, the use of classical music is remarkable. The most memorable are "Blue Danube" and "Also Spake Zarathustra" (particularly appropriate given the theme of the film that transcends ordinary consciousness.) Cinematography is also particularly excellent. your life. <br /> <br /> The character of HAL is the most important from the point of view of the central thesis of the film. By imitating all the characteristics of human beings, he also comes to have negative traits. The paranoia he develops and which almost leads to the ruin of the mission is an exact reflection of the paranoia that allowed the political situation to return to earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits we must leave if we want to move on to the next phase of our evolution. <br /> <br /> The architecture of the film also makes sense. The drawings of many spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the film. The end of 2001 is the most spectacular and the most triumphal ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film describes life in the same way as the one presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and the novel Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce. It poses as a historical and evolutionary model of man, both progressive and repetitive, the same events, while leaving the human race to develop according to the will to be, for a broader purpose. Although we have never learned what it is, the film assures us that the human race is not doomed to failure, but that its destiny far exceeds its ability to imagine. I am always amazed that, despite this film, many people still consider Kubrick a misanthrope. <br /> <br /> This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adherence to a specific creed, but it is an enchanted invocation of the vast panorama of existence and its implication in the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth. <br /> <br /> In the hands of any other director, all this might be a little too much. The vision of Hollywood life is too puny to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision like this. But Kubrick was a visionary, he runs with absolute confidence, not only the fact that he can handle documents of this type, but that he is the only one to do so. The process of making this film has used all its creative resources. The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most successful in film history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects used in the incredible climax of the film. The resources to realize his vision did not exist at the time, so he gave them birth. <br /> <br /> 2001 is an absolutely unique cinematic experience. Those who miss it do so at the expense of their own intellectual and imaginative abilities.
