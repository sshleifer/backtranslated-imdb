MICHAEL, from 1996, is a fantastic and warm fantasy comedy that features one of my favorite performances from the John Travolta Library. Travolta gives one of his easiest and most enjoyable performances as Michael, an archangel whose silent existence in a solitary innkeeper named Pansy (Jean Stapleton) is disturbed when Pansy reports Michael's presence at her house to a newspaper. "National Enquirer" type and publisher (Bob Hoskins) sends reporters (William Hurt, Andie McDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to check. Hurt, McDowell and Pastorelli are good enough for jaded press staff who have trouble accepting that they've met an angel, but it's the Travolta series and it reigns as chamomile, sugar, biscuit smell, Pie-like, love Aretha, hunt the bull Michael, an angel who just is not what you think of you when you think of angels. And you must love the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance in "Chain of Fools". I love this movie more and more each time I watch it and it's mainly because of John Travolta's completely winning performance.
