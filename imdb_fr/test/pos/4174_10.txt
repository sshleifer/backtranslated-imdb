What can I say about this movie that was not told by all the other reviews here, they sum up pretty much everything, people who love it love it, those who hate it ... well, they hate him. It's the film equivalent of Marmite. <br /> <br /> Personally, I memorized every second: cyclic, claustrophobic, introspective, magical, one of the most unique films ever made. Despite what many have said, I think it's really a cult film, it's a rough diamond just waiting to be discovered. Once uncovered, his fantastic psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable, which is a feat in itself. One of my friends who looked at it compared it more to a musical and, in many ways, to those who do not really appreciate the context in which this film is made, would probably draw more to see Head as such. <Br /> <br /> I've always loved the Monkeys, especially the TV series that was repeated in the 80's. My mom had recorded Head on TV late at night, knowing that I liked them. I watched it a day later and the message was memorized until I could find a copy on DVD about two decades later. What I would like now is a special edition. It would be fascinating to better understand the making of this masterpiece. We can only hope.
