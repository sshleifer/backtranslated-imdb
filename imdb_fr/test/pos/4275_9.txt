As a local performer, I thought that "Grease" showcased what Broadway producers are looking for and that it highlights a small part of the cast of actors. Although my favorites did not win (but came in second), I enjoyed comparing myself to them and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as an interpreter. <br /> <br /> They brought Olivia Newton-John is the obvious link between the Broadway production and the viewers. <br /> <br /> They sang songs from the movie ("Hopelessly Devoted", etc.) because these songs will be in the new production. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that B'Way's actors look a lot older, but you have to keep in mind that these are people who have been to Broadway and have worked tirelessly to be there. If the whole cast was green and cool, I think that would have compromised the casting process by which producers choose their talent.
