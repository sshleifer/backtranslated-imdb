The actual case of an innocent First Nation (Indian) leader in front of a Winnipeg municipal officer (the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie. The current case has caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small-scale affair of Martin Luther King. The injustice of First Nations people is becoming a staple of the Canadian film system. What makes this film worth watching is the focus on family reactions. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis asks for forgiveness and the brother by Eric Schweig asks for justice. The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach (WINDTALKERS, SKINWALKERS) have minor appearances, almost cameos. The future star Eric Schweig stands out in this film with a powerful performance. An honorable mention goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk, who has accumulated more than 100 films to his credit. His troubled soul portrait, Inspector Dowson, earned a Gemini (Canadian Emmy) award with Eric Schweig. Special effects (jump cuts, dream sequences) are occasional and non-dominant. Add to that beautiful landscapes of northern Canada and recent events involving police officers and First Nations people such as the Neil Stonechild affair. You get a very enriching and relevant viewing experience.
