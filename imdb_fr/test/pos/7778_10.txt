This film presents some of the best ensemble works I've seen in film or on stage. The actors play each other with a skill and vivacity that can not be achieved by editing. <br /> <br /> "Love Jones" a good story, simply. But it's also an excellent representation of the middle-aged, mid-twenties, urban African-American group that we do not see often.
