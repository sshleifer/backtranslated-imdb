Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) is wasting her time finding a job. His real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby. <br /> <br /> April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to stay so long and falls in love too easily, a dangerous combo. <br /> <br /> Greg (Suzy Parker) is a get-getter and wants to be an actress. <br /> <br /> All three are doomed to drama in "The best of all", a soap opera / film about the morality of 1959 / a sometimes solid film aging to the second. <br /> <br /> the sharp world of the pocket edition, is not as trashy as "The valley of the dolls" but not as vanilla as "Three pieces of the fountain". <br /> <br /> The men in the mix - Brian Aherne, Stephen Boyd, Jourdan Louis and Robert Evans - are smooth, well dressed and not good, for the most part. Aherne is the resident sex offender - he pinches everything and makes unwanted advances from right to left. His character is offensive like hell, but it's not played seriously at all. The harassment had not been discovered yet, I suppose. Boyd works there too, even though we never see him doing anything. He is too busy being older, wiser and more drunker. Evans is abroad just so Diane Baker can suffer in style - it's a rich child who has caused her trouble so instead of marrying her, as promised, he takes her to surgery. <br /> <br /> Jourdan is a director who has an affair with Parker. They share an almost seamless fight scene, in a movie like this anyway, but the scene is eventually ruined by Parker's histronics. She almost ended up following him, and she really did not deserve such an ugly fate, despite her bad behavior. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford spits fire like Amanda Farrow, the resident "witch" who is automatically rude and fired from any of her legions of secretaries. Well, they're younger, are not they? Is not this reason enough to hate a person? Caroline does not think so, because she admirably holds Miss Farrow's chances. Crawford only lets go once, when she tells her married boyfriend "you can, your bunny-faced wife, can go to hell" and hangs up on the phone. We never see the poor soul who dares to cross it. <br /> <br /> The story of Martha Hyer is extremely weak at the moment and she is terribly overwhelmed as a single mother. Aside from wearing a huge "W" (for "whore") on her cardigan, she walks like a pathetic mess for most of her time on the screen. Worse still, she does not have the courtesy to tie everything up, one way or another, at the end. It will not matter much, but still .. <br /> <br /> It's painfully obvious that it all happened in a totally different world. People were generally kind to each other and work was not a drag, but something interesting, for a girl from outside New York anyway. <br /> <br /> Aside from an unconvincing drunk scene, Hope Lange is helping Caroline, who has at least more than one side of her character. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that women have an opinion, a chance and a choice. Not that it is not wrapped in a beautiful bow, but it argues for equality. In 1959, it was probably remarkable and perhaps controversial. 7/10.
