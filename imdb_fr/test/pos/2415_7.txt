Another story of "well overcoming evil", but with a difference. This includes learning self-discipline. When Julie goes with her teacher to a Zen monastery, she gets to know each other. She is also perfecting her karate skills. <br /> <br /> When Zen monks travel to the city, awkward and funny moments ensue. No noise, but entertaining anyway. <br /> <br /> Next Karate Kid has a lot to say about how to look inward and improve what is there - as well as using what you have.
