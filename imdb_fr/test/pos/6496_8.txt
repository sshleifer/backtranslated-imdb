All the comments I have read so far seem to have missed a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for accent and pronunciation as he did for northerners in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and deeply affects what is said and how it is taken. So, listen again and notice the difference. The game is well done and the rhythm of the words is much better than that provided by people using a well-received, polite and well-spoken English. I remember the days when a teacher at a school in Leicester, unknowingly, asked me, at the age of 14, to read an excerpt from Walter Scott written in the tone of The Border. I come from the border and when I read it as it should read, it made all the difference.
