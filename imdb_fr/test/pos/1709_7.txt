I've been a fan of Larry King's show for quite some time. I think he's doing a fantastic job overall and I do not think he's ever "flipped out", as many people seem to think. He's a subtle Scorpion, he gets excited when he needs it, as he did last night with Paris Hilton, during his first post-prison television interview. <br /> <br /> The thing about this whole thing It really surprised me that Hilton apparently still has no idea why Judge Sauer imposed too severe a sentence on him in her opinion (and in addition, she made it serve). During all her time in prison, supposedly only 23 hours a day in her cell, she never saw once in her head the events that had led to the punishment that Judge Sauer had seen fit to impose on her. She never realized that she might have triggered a major red flag when she (1) came to court late for the initial hearing and (2) informed him when he asked her if she did not know that her license had been suspended, she did not receive the papers in the mail, saying that "I have people who read this kind of things for me". <br /> <br /> Throughout her stay in her cell, she never realized that this action (appearing late) and this statement - and more importantly, her attitude - the total lack of respect for the system court and the law in general and her particular privileges that she exposed - this might have led to Sauer JA's exasperation. <br /> <br /> Last night, on King's show, after expressing with all her blood how she had been forever changed by her traumatic experience, how she had "learned" her lesson, she responded to her question: "Do you think you have a chord with a resounding yes?" and during the conversation (if you can call her that), she repeated more than once that she did not think that she deserved what had happened to her, and King asked, quietly, more than once, if she did not feel that she was creating the situations of her life in which she "found herself", in which she was looking at him pretty much She has basically the conscious conviction of having been a victim of violence in this situation, she does not understand how she herself provoked that day in court by her cavalier attitude with the judge. I feel it's very sad - tragic, or even considering of the huge "model" Hilton for some people, and that turns everything she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state into realms of total lack and hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> During the interview, Hilton mentioned that she spent a lot of time in her cell reading the Bible. At the end of the interview, King scored important points by asking him what his favorite Bible passage was. She groped her way through her pathetic notes (not superficial ideas, which she had read on the radio as if she were Nelson Mandella or something like that) and finally grumbled: "I do not have favorite passage. " <br /> <br /> In my book, Judge Sauer is a hero, and after Larry King after last night, it's the same for subtly exposing Hilton for who she really is.
