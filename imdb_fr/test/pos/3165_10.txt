I saw it in Europe-plex. Super movie !! <br /> <br /> This film is an exploration of the spirit and flesh of modern times. The protagonist Jim Kirk drives a cumbersome VR across America, stopping often to fill his gas tank. He is middle-aged and confused. He feeds his thick, diabetic body with coffee cups and radio conversations. He is Flesh: restless and sometimes spaced, quite oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as a pinch of discomfort. <br /> <br /> The spirit permeates the film of speech and other sounds, as well as what appears and passes in the visual field. The Spirit eventually collided with the Chair and Kirk collapsed, unable to understand what had happened to him. He denied how uncomfortable things have become because of his whimsical nature, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We are all in the same denial and so, like Kirk, we risk falling and being swept away by the sand of the desert, just like him.
