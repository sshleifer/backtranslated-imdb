The Closer She Gets ... is a clever documentary about the death of a person I knew. It gives an insight into the family's intimate moments in the most difficult moments of his life. Parents tend to support the work of their children, in this case the subject of the documentary went beyond. She was willing to share her experience of death as an act of love for her son. It is a touching work of art, weaving the serious, serene and lighter aspects of life for this family. The story is one that can make you laugh but also cry because it addresses issues that we all face. I highly recommend this documentary to those who are not afraid to cry and who are willing to treat the problem of mortality in the most humane way. This movie will touch you.
