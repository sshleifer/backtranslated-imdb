The movie was good. Really, the only reason I looked at it was Alan Rickman. He failed to accent the southern accent, but he did very well. It is true that Emma Thompson played really well, she perfectly managed to accentuate the southern accent. I like all the characters in my opinion, none of them did badly, another thing that I noticed. I read all these comments and no one commented Alan 5 0'clock shadow. Which made him even better and he had it all the way through the movie. I would give the film a 9 out of 10. Another of my opinions is that the film would have been better if there was no sex. It was still good. Adore the scene where he says "Aw sh * t" when he is sitting in his car and sees them in his rearview mirror.
