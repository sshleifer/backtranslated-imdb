Canthony is right to say that this short film is only an excuse to hear the very young Judy Garland (fourteen years old!) Singing with a Deanna Durbin, slightly older than a year. But I have to disagree with everything he said, including the duration - which is only about ten minutes, not twenty (only one player). <br /> <br /> The song is not his best, of course; but it's nice and certainly deserves the ten minutes to watch on Turner. The duet with Durbin is quite interesting: two conflicting styles harmonize well enough nevertheless. <br /> <br /> The short film is only a disposable, but it's not nearly as bad as the other critic has said. Honestly, I appreciated. <br /> <br /> Dafydd ab Hugh
