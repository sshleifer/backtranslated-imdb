Nearly 20 years before Frank Marshall crying to tears with his hypnotizing epic "Alive", the legendary director of Mexican farms Ren√© Cardona used the same drama as his scenario for his ambitious film "Supervivientes de los Andes". The fatal unforgettable flight of the Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentine Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people were finally saved thanks to their will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate traveling companions. Of course, you can not pretend that this inexpensive and grossly mounted film is better than the famous 90's version but I really appreciate and respect this film. After all, an exploitation film requires much more from the actors and the team, while Marshall's big-budget film, while intense, is more like a lucrative business. The sets and special effects naturally can not compete with "Alive", but "Supervivientes ..." offers an equally impressive feeling of desperation and creates a hell of even more nightmarish snow. Cardona's film is ambitious, surprisingly captivating and undoubtedly one of the most remarkable Mexican productions of all time. I am really surprised that Cardona does not take this story more exploitative and explicit. The scenes where deceased passengers are cut up and consumed are nonetheless difficult to digest, but they only serve to reinforce the credibility of the disaster and highlight the inhuman conditions of the survivors. Rather laudable for a vicious director who made himself known for his notoriously bad movies like "The Night of the Bloods" and the series Santo. Young unknown Mexican actors do a great job and the score is endearing. The story is known, of course, so the scenario offers no unexpected shock. Either by the story, or after seeing "Alive", you know what kind of tragedy these people have to endure before being saved and you can only wait for them. Still, it's a good movie that should not be criticized as it is too often the case.
