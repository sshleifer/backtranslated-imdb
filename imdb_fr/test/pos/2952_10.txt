For those who still prefer movies on human relations, 51 Birch Street is a must. <br /> <br /> By forming the spotlight on his own family, Block covers an inaccessible terrain for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often tacit family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is discreetly weak at first. <br /> <br /> In addition to taking a closer look at a family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I do not know if this was intentional, but inevitable because of the archival content. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
