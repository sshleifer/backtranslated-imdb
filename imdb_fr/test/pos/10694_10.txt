It's an action-packed movie that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time I see it. The film (short of its conclusion) shows that it is still possible to triumph in the face of extreme obstacles. <br /> <br /> This movie is very refreshing and may be banned at any time. Get a copy before the police of the mind burn all the copies they can find. They do not want you to have hope for the future, nor do you want to have a chance. On the other hand, if the politically correct does not remove it, it would be an excellent film to release. on DVD. Such a publication could include interviews with the writer and director, as well as related gifts. I'm sure he would sell copies and I would be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> - Mincka
