This movie is perhaps the best of all time if you like to watch movies, laugh and then submit your friends to watch them. If you look like me and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years at the jokes of this movie. One of the funniest things is that Gus asks money from a guy with kids, and that guy takes them to the forest, like Hansel and Gretel, and then he and his wife go home. The kitchen of the soup scene is full of comic buffoonery genius: "Inspection Agent - Here!" and the lines to follow will stay in my mind forever. When I showed this movie to my friends, they usually say "What was it?!?" So, if you're in the mood for any of these types of movies, Yippee! This movie is so OOP that it's no longer funny, so the easiest way to get it would probably be the online auction. The first time I saw this came from a rental.
