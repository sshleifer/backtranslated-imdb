I think it's great one of my favorite movies as a kid and who said his songs were memorable they were mint, I can still remember them now. WORD FOR WORD the movie remains a favorite with my family and my younger cousins ​​are now addicted they even know that the movie is great and enjoyable for kids. He has a lesson in morality so do not say it's not good, because it shows that lying does not leave you anywhere to leave with a comment: this movie is amazing love me xxx Ps I would like the soundtrack but I can not no and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops. This film will remain in the history of children's film and is in my opinion one of the last sure films to show to children.
