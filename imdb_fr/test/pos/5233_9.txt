This film is important for those of us interested in Western history because it uses authentic techniques in its production. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the wagon train are particularly authentic; as far as I know, it contains the only scenes ever filmed illustrating river crossing techniques. Horses and mules should be lowered at the river level and the carriages should be lowered with ropes and pulleys. The scene is such that I could watch it again and again just trying to understand what a crossing was ... and the first travelers repeated it while crossing the country. <br /> <br /> Melodrama aside, this image is as authentic in its outfit and style as it comes and deserves to be watched alone.
