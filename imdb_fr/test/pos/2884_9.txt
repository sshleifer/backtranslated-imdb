By dramatizing Wilde's novel, John Osborne condensed the events, eliminated a number of characters, and, generally, implied rather than shown the essential nastiness of Dorian. If you want a more explicit rendition, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived about the same time, but were certainly very different men and writers. This story really deals with a theme similar to Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, while RLS was taking the science route. The two protagonists are men in whom the good fight the evil, the evil prevailing in the end. <br /> <br /> The actors in this BBC film also take a different path from the 1945 film. John Gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical jokes as George Sanders, in his role of screening Wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. You think Sanders really believed what he was saying, but Gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes. Peter Firth, too, shows both sides of his character in moderation, but we will not see as many of his escapades as Hurd Hatfield had the opportunity to show. <br /> <br /> This is a very good production, with a staging reflecting the essence of the novel, if not all its ramifications.
