I loved this movie, what a pleasure. Rupert and Julie are very good together. Rupert is almost a poker face to the animation of Julie, which worked well. Laura did a good job as a domineering mother. Julie is of course wonderful, as usual. Although this film makes you laugh most of the time, it also has a poignant side because it reveals the secrets of the life of the main characters. Interestingly it's entitled Driving Lessons, it might lead you to think that it's the essence of the film, but it's not directly what might be perceived as a "Ben" eventually driving in his own life. Like most fun things in life, there is always the sad side and there are moving moments in this movie. Very nice film and deserves to be watched.
