Farscape is the best period of science fiction series, for a main reason, everything the show is trying to do is fine. From a technical point of view, the music is original and perfectly adapted to the show. The special effects are the abundance and superior quality of almost everything you will see on your TV. The acting is also great, too many series use nowadays only the American market of actors. Remember the first time you saw The Matrix and you said, wow, where does Agent Smith come from? It's the same feeling as watching Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey and especially Wayne Pygram. These Australians are great and it shows in this great show. <br /> <br /> The plot is incomparable. The next thing I can think of is Babylon 5 during the episodes of Shadow Wars, but it goes even further. It's a real treat to be able to watch all the episodes in a sequential way, the subtleties of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well scripted and interpreted. The entire plot is both original and entertaining. I'm always looking forward to the next show. <br /> <br /> The comic episodes are funny, the drama episodes are touching and the action sequences are strained. The start of the second season was rich in comic episodes that made me laugh out loud, which rarely happens when watching TV other than South Park, Sealab 2021 or Seinfeld. The drama is even harder, whether Crichton meets his mother or the characters face their mortality, everything is done with heart and intensity. Finally, it goes without saying that the action is at the top. It's science fiction. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of science fiction, if you like television, if you like serialized intrigues, you have to watch Farscape. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Ben Browder owns.
