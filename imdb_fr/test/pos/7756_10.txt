From the beginning, you will not be able to look away and you will not want to do it again. "The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu) is one of the most entertaining anime I have seen in a long time. If you can look away from crazy and sometimes perverse humor, it is easy to find a brilliantly constructed and masterfully executed work. <br /> <br /> Part of the brilliance comes from the fact that the episodes are not chronological. In order not to understand some of the things they talk about at first, but as the show progresses, you find yourself saying "ah, so that's what they meant!" While it may be confusing for some people, after watching the series, you will struggle to defend your argument against telling the story that way. <br /> <br /> After all, the focus is on the characters. The main character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of all anime. Her opening speech in front of her class, in which she declares that she is "not interested in normal humans" and looking for "espers, extraterrestrials and time travelers", is absolutely bizarre, but she is adorable like this. <br /> <br /> Then there is Kyon, the "normal" guy who is drawn into the madness surrounding Suzumiya-san. He is the narrator and his quick wit always makes the scene more entertaining. He is caught in the midst of various factions that are all trying to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three characters are representatives of these factions. Ironically, these are the very beings sought by Haruhi, but they can not reveal themselves to her. The first is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who happens to be the only member of the school. Literary Club, and also a representative of the integrated thinking entity; she is basically an extraterrestrial, although the best description of her is a computer program in a human body. Her purely emotional responses make her comical and always make you think that it's not just what you see. Then there is Mikuru Asahina, the time traveler, who is incredibly cute, a big saying and the subject of Suzumiya's plans to announce his club, the SOS Brigade, around the world. The end result is that Suzumiya does things that border on sexual harassment, making her dress up in fetish uniforms. The last character is Koizumi Itsuki, the timid and perpetually optimistic philosopher who happens to be Haruhi's "hope", although he can use his powers only under certain conditions. <br /> The end result of all these characters is a comedy like no other, both raw and deep, and always brilliant. Do not believe me? Watch the first episode, their "student movie". You will see what I mean.
