Here is one of the most enjoyable articles of Blaxploitation of the 70s; it's a low-rent pimp opus that looks like a more devious version of "The Mack". John Daniels, Mr. Jonathan, the hero of the barber, in the immortal "Black Shampoo", gives an excellent steel portrait of the Baron, a ruthless and knowledgeable man of the business world, always at the height of what makes him everything -powerful. Bitter and brutal Italian rivals reign supreme on the Sunset Strip. When he does not stick his elbows to his criminal buddies besides and does not do his best not to get smashed by local chief cops, Daniels leads an average casual existence as a typical suburban guy from his backyard. (with a caring wife and loving children!). ) in a small California city typically humdrum. <br /> <br /> The only absurd excuse is the promise of a high trash quality of a resolutely schlock category B variety (George Theakos deserves congratulations for his hilarious and ridiculous scenario). Matt Cimber's commendable, delicate and tasteless leadership delivers junky products like a sticky bucket, making this film an extremely enjoyable piece of celluloid grime. Among the sordid pleasures on offer here are plenty of free nudity, coarse dialogues, beautifully crispy Me Decade yarns (halter tops, felt hats, glittery Day-Glo jewels, powerful seersucker costumes), a score R & B Smoke extremely intense, some a hopelessly pathetic game (the little old lady who lives next to Daniels is incredibly sharp), a nasty and memorable tour of Patrick Wright as a sadistic fool, some pretty action pieces (the Dramatic Slow Motion Barroom Cooks Seriously), plus A dismal footage of the movie "Sunset Strip" on which you can wave a boa of feathers (this video would include "prostitutes and blades of the Sunset Strip in Hollywood"), a cinematography actually Ken Gibb's dark, some sex images of fetishist paintings, brutal and explicit violence (a prostitute has one of his cut breasts!), and amusing support performances from familiar schlock featuring perennials, Richard Kennedy and George "Buck" Flower as a pair of racist, corrupt, brutal police detectives. Of course, this film is not art, but it's pretty arty to call it a deliciously dirty piece of fun and sordid cinematographic samples.
