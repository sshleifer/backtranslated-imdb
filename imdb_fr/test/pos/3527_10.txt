This completely forgotten slasher movie is one of the best horror movies ever made. Very dark at times, it reminds me of a thriller as famous as "Deliverance". exciting and memorable.So if you are looking for something terrifying, try to find this little treasure.My personal note: 10 out of 10.PS This one is even scary than "Halloween".
