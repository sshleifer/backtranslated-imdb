S. Epatha Merkerson shines under the name of Nanny in this touching and vibrant look on the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin), as he grew up under Nanny's tutelage. The film gives a good study of the characters of Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture the ups and downs of life in a realistic way, unlike many memories transformed into film. The cast of support adds a lot of spark and many recognizable faces appear in more modest roles, including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo and Patricia Wettig. It loses steam and vivacity towards the end and the end sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling. But overall, it's a great movie with a truly outstanding performance from Merkerson.
