Last night, I saw PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Strangely, it was 137 minutes, a little longer than the time shown on IMDb. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, I lost interest in this film because the rather confusing shooting style really lost me. The context of what was happening was missing and I am happy to have persevered. In the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding, the war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. A few months later, his wife is very pregnant and is on board a refugee boat bound for India. In a refugee center, you see the lady about to give birth - after which the titles of the film are finally revealed. <br /> <br /> The film then focuses completely on a girl who is about to be 9 years old in Madras, India. You see her at home and she talks to her camera about her life and her family. None of this seems interesting or important and you wonder what's missing - what about the woman who was going to give birth? My wife and I debated this issue and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady of the first part of the film. Somehow she had been adopted and talked about her life with her parents, although she did not realize that these people were not her biological parents. <br /> <br /> Shortly after, the parents revealed to be completely idiots (one of the complaints I had about the movie), because they decided to tell the truth to his very young daughter AND to say it in a way that left the girl emotionally embarrassed and confused. In spite of a stupid decision and in the worst way, the parents compensated for this by agreeing to help him find his biological mother. Seeing the impact that all this had on the girl and the parents (especially the adoptive mother) was impressive to watch and certainly aroused my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been involved in a very, very long and brutal civil war with Tamil militants, intermittently, for three decades. The family's decision to find the mother in Sri Lanka was certainly noble, but also a little silly at times - because they took so many risks and were almost repeatedly killed by jumping blindly in the middle of a war! It was both exciting and captivating, but I also wondered about the mental health of adoptive parents. First, you tell her that she is NOT your biological child and now you are taking her to the middle of a war zone! Of course, the girl really wanted to meet her biological mother, but it was really stupid to see behind. If it were me, I might have tried to pay an unemployed actress to play the role and cheat the child - thus avoiding being in the middle of the war! <br /> <br /> Despite my complaints, the movie was enjoyable to watch and was very rewarding. Far from being perfect, it certainly hits an emotional home run. Moreover, even if I expected it because I saw several Indian films, many Westerners will be a little surprised by the brilliant songs that seem to come out of nowhere - this is the norm in most Indian films - there including those of Bollywood. (Bombay) and Tamilwood / Kollywood (Madras).
