In fact, the nature of the series is incredibly funny! But not always funny ... there are moments of extreme poignancy at the moment when the deepest aspects of human emotion are approached. <br /> <br /> Time and again, the series comments on the weaknesses of human nature and the struggle to overcome them throughout their lives, or in this eternal case. Monkey is both intelligent and stupid. His arrogance and confidence in his martial skills lead to problems in every episode or almost. Pigsy is just plain. Sandy has a philosophical turn of mind. He has many of the most spiritual lines. <br /> <br /> The English translation is a delight. "Ignorance can always be improved," says Sandy, casually, "but you can not do anything to help stupidity!" "Who are you?" the group of travelers is asked. "We, the three kings of the East, are," says Monkey. <br /> <br /> It's not fair for children, it's magical delirium for anyone who can suspend reality
