Niagara, Niagara is a breathtaking and heartbreaking story about the two strangers Seth and Marcy. Robin Tunney gives a fantastic performance while Marcy is suffering from Tourette's syndrome, getting sicker as the film progresses. This film is not very optimistic and it is very emotional, but at the same time very romantic. It's hard to explain, but see it and find out for yourself. It's really worth it.
