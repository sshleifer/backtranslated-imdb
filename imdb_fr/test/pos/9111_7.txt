When I heard for the first time that Jack Black and Kyle Gass were going to make a film about their band, I was panicking! I love their music and I was hoping this movie would be really funny! Now that I have looked at it, I can not really say that these hopes were not satisfied, but I think I was expecting more. The film is filled with the good music of Tenacious D and I really loved listening to it. There are many good jokes and I love the story, at least the first part. I do not like the way the movie ends. The end is very abrupt and in my opinion, they could have extended that a bit more. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's a good movie to watch! Everyone who loves rock should watch it! It'll make you laugh!
