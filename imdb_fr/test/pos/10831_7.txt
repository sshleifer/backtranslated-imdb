It's the drama of the war - the Second World War, with French, Jews and Germans, but this one is fun, sincerely. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau co-wrote the script for his film "Bon voyage" (2003). "Safe Conduct" by director Bertrand Tavernier, aka "Laissez-passer" (2002), "Gloomy Sunday" by Rolf Schubel (1999), or "Lucie Aubrac" by Claude Berri (1997), "Bon voyage" is as powerful as its title sounds - it's life (it does not matter) - and we thank the beautiful talented Isabelle Adjani. It is his delightful performance as a center of attraction (and attention), cause and effect of all this, that made the film as enjoyable as it is. Damn, what another derailment of his plan and his expectations - will worry about that another time. The backbone of the story revolves around two young enthusiasts: Grégori Derangère in the role of Frédéric and Virginie Ledoyen ("8 women" François Ozon) in the role of Camille. The incomparable Gerard Depardieu, Yvan Attal (from "My wife is an actress") and Peter Coyote (who juggles between French, English and German here) are among the most talented actors. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of characters coming and going in this film plot, and the way all this is juggled is a skillful talent that does not require any analysis - Rappeneau is simply a genius . The story builds on itself, episode after episode, or even with overlapping events, but never get confused - it's the pleasure of everything. All the details are displayed on the screen and we summarize all this as a French presented with taste. dessert, literally. There are thrills, trills, hesitating moments of hesitation and threatening escapes that unfold before our eyes. <br /> <br /> After reading the director's note on Sony Pictures Classics' official Bon Voyage website, Rappeneau said it was his most personal and successful work of all time . Describing Bordeaux 1940 from the memories of his childhood is particularly close to his heart and he "worked and reworked the screenplay for nearly 3 years". This film is a work of love at all levels, the cast and crew complementing the passion of the director and a great script written by collaborative authors, as well as the director and his son Julien - Gilles' adaptation efforts Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jérôme Tonnerre. <Br /> <br /> Gabriel Yared's music (his tone varied from his previous films such as "The English Patient" or "Talented Mr. Ripley"), which proposed a dignified theme that kept the rhythm of the intriguing, almost like a train without stopping, reflecting the vivacity of Adjani's Viviane (even when she is tired), guiding her through the meetings, walking with her head held high and still elegant, without looking back, not to mention from the time of regret. <br /> <br /> Ah, do not forget the cleverly translated and skillful subtitles of Ian Burley, who also directed the subtitles for Italian films: "Bread and Tulips" (2000), aka Pane e Tulipani, "The Last Kiss" (2001) aka The Ultimo Bacio, and "Heaven" by Tom Tykwer (2002). <br /> <br /> If you find it too light as a war report drama, try "Aimee and Jaguar" by Mäx Fäberböck (1999, in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances by Juliane Köhler as Aimée and Maria Schrader as Jaguar.
