I thought this movie would be totally nil based on the commercials I saw in the movie theaters. When my sister borrowed from a friend, I decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . Needless to say ten minutes in the movie and loved it. Amanda was a great actor in the movie, her timing was perfect. The guy who played Duke was hot, pure and simple. My favorite scene is undoubtedly the one where Amanda passes in front of the gardener and with another student who suspects her and who speaks to her mother of dresses - while pretending to be a guy! I saw this part again and again ... To make a long story, the film I thought was going to be bad - I own it now.
