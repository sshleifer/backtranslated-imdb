This is a "revised" presentation of Riverdance, presented at Radio City Music Hall in New York. Of the three Irish "dance" musicals I watched from the mid-to-late 90s (including the first "Riverdance" and "The Lord of the Dance"), I preferred this one. <br /> <br /> I think it was better than the original, which was held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are generally good, that it has a on stage more varied and colorful and it eliminates each for two of this original which was not good at first. This is just a very solid show with a few weak points. To be sure, some songs / dances are just "right" but none are poor, which is amazing considering the presence of 20 numbers in total. <br /> <br /> The casting is similar to the first Riverdance with main exception: Colin Dunne replaced Michael Flatley as a star dancer. Both are extremely talented. The major difference might be in their appearance with Dunne, a little guy with black hair and beard, while Flatley is the shaved blonde. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big that he sometimes becomes annoying. The actress, Jean Butler, fortunately, is still there and she is great to watch: what a beauty and graceful talent! Butler and the rest of these women have the best legs I've seen on dancers. I also loved the dance of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco performer, and two guys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. One number - with these two couples against Dunne and two other dancers - is called "Trading Taps" and is very entertaining to watch, perhaps the highlight of the entire series. I do not complain about violinist Eileen Ivers either. <br /> <br /> These are the songs "rapids" Irish that attracted me the most. I appreciated that the audience does not oppose the performance with screams and screams as do the women in the video "Lord Of The Dance".
