It was unusual: a modern film that was very cool. In fact, it was so good that it was too hard to believe in certain parts. Looking at this story based on real life, I thought, "No one is so kind, so tolerant." I was mainly referring to the role played by Ed Harris in "Coach Jones". I think they've been a little bit abusive of his character, but it's better than the opposite: to show him worse than he was in real life. Weird to see Harris play the role too, because he has long since embodied characters unholy and profane. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I never complain about a good film that feels good, and it's nice to see a group of well meaning and kind people. These people direct their friendship, love and compassion to "James Kennedy", better known as "Radio", a mentally slow student played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid-1970s in Carolina. South. Gooding also does a good job with the role. However, just like the role played by Sean Penn as a man with an intellectual disability in "I Am Sam", an hour and a half of characters like this is already enough. After that, the sound of these guys becomes tiring to hear. <br /> <br /> Note: it was interesting in one of the documentaries of this DVD to discover that, in real life, it took years for "Radio" to make its transformation, not months as shown on the movie.
