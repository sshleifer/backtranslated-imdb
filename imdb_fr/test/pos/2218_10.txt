We had the pleasure of watching a new independent film called "Half Empty". In general, I go to the movies with my husband and I feel like we are captive to the last Sequel, or Prequel, that Hollywood throws at us. It was different and surprisingly ?? SO MUCH more entertaining than anything, Hollywood spends millions on advertising When my husband and I go to the movies, are we going to entertain ourselves ?? and "Half Empty" did just that and the film did it in a smarter way that made me feel like my trip to the cinema was worth it. It's a funny, human, and sometimes surprising story that cleverly entertains in its simplicity. I particularly enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. It's almost like an operetta. This scene reminded me of a scene from "Phantom of the Opera" when performers were not satisfied, that is, they sang against each other in a friendly reply. I'm not a movie buff, but this movie was more enjoyable than any other great studio film I've seen lately. It's silly, funny, entertaining and fun. Completely enjoyable ?? That's what I expect from movies, but they rarely deliver as "Half Empty".
