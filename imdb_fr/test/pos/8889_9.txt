If you had a mother who described you like this, you might want to spill her yourself. That's what Danny DeVito thinks about Anne Ramsey, it's just how to make this project a reality. <br /> <br /> And his creative writing class taught by Professor Billy Crystal gives him the idea. That and a viewing of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers that gives DeVito the idea of ​​changing murder with Crystal, who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrew, who not only cheats on the book he wanted to write, but also with the famous Tony Ciccone. <br /> <br /> Launch of Momma From The Train takes place a bit like the Strangers one has been on since DeVito seems to have ended his murder plan. But Crystal has a problem putting Ramsey down even with Danny's help. This woman may need to be killed, but she will take a lot. <br /> <br /> The Academy's only recognition that Throw Momma From The Train has been was an Oscar nomination for Anne Ramsey in the Best Actress in a Supporting Role category. Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck, but the film proved to be his best time. Ramsey already had a throat cancer that would eventually kill her the next year, but look at the list of credits she managed to accumulate even after throwing Mom off the train, she worked to the end. <br /> <br /> I saw interviews with Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, two stars of Throw Momma From The Train, and both willingly conceded that Anne Ramsey's performance as an infernal mother had made this movie its success and stole it. under them. Their recognition of Ramsey's talent and performance is the best tribute possible. <br /> <br /> If Marion Lorne in Strangers on A Train looked like Anne Ramsey, Farley Granger would have gladly joined Robert Walker to give it to her. Throw Momma From A Train is one of the best black comedies on the market, not to be missed.
