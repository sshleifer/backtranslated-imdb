If you are looking for an action movie about kung fu, look elsewhere. While there are scenes of fighting, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist, who struggles to make its way through the Americanized township. Unlike most "kung-fu comedies," action scenes are used to reinforce comedy, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> Cheung Booi is a statement about the ridiculous nature of kung-fu movies, where stars always seem to find a reason to fight. Instead of a great drama about honor and respect, minor misunderstandings cause the characters to shout at each other and fight each other. <br /> <br /> My young aunt, as it is called in the West, is the story of Cheng Tai-nun, played by Kara Hui, a young woman who marries an old landowner so that her possessions do not fall not in the hands of his corrupt and greedy brother. After her death, she moved to Canton to live with her nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and her son Ah Tao, played by Hsiao Ho. <br /> <br /> The irony is that, Even though Cheng is the same age as Ah Tao, his manners are closer to being a great-aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely bad), plays the guitar and goes to costume parties, Cheng completely fails when she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in Canton: makeup, revelation of dresses, high heels and dance scenes. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie awesome is its realization. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the greatest directors of her generation in Hong Kong, if not Kara Hui, who won the "Best Actress" award at the first Hong Kong Film Awards in 1982. doubtful about Hsiao Ho's best performance. His chemistry with Hui is remarkable and, although he has pursued a busy career in kung-fu comedies, often working alongside Sammo Hung, he perfectly combines athleticism and comedy. . As the romantic tension and plot intensifies in the second half of the film, its whole face changes. He does not walk around easily without worrying about the world. He becomes the man of law and his cohorts the Kramer, Elaine and George. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that the comic aspects of the film suddenly disappear during the conclusion. The film goes from a pure joke to a dramatic plot with little change in fortuitous music. But there is a certain symmetry. The film begins by focusing on the plot, more on the character of Lau Kar Leung, and ends well. But the final scene returns to the film's comic roots, concluding both aspects of the film.
