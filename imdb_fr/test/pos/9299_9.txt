I know we are not supposed to comment on the comments of other users, but I will say that many of the negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew a lot about the Manhattan project and who were bothered by things left out . (According to his book "Smoking In Bed", it appears that the original screenwriter, Bruce Robinson, is another.) I knew very little before watching the movie, however, and I found it fascinating. Dwight Schultz is absolutely hypnotic as Oppenheimer - a truly magnetic and charismatic presence, an inspired casting piece that makes me wonder why he is not given better roles and more leading roles. John Cusack and Paul Newman are excellent as always. We could quibble with various choices of scenario or achievement, but as it is an extremely intense and sometimes horrible film, I give him overall four out of five stars.
