In the end, it is clear that the murderers dropped the murder weapon in Ms. Columbo's car and that it was at the police's ballistics laboratory. <br /> <br /> But where does the barrel under the bonnet come from, used in the protest? Would the murderers not have cleaned up the contents under the hood? They had a whole week? Or did the Columbo officers reproduce the camera / weapon under the hood used during the demonstration? How did they do that without breaking and entering the car? That may be why the murders seemed surprised at the end. But how could Columbo have replicated his camera / gun and calibrated it to his keychain? Columbo must have recovered the ballistic pistol and replanted it under the hood of the car. He was very lucky that the rest of the camera with a camera is still there and being transmitted. <br /> <br /> a show 10/10 until this blatant mistake of conspiracy in the end.
