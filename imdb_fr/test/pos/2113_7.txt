We all enjoyed the movie. It's a very charming family movie with many fun cameos. It was fun to see Austin musicians Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the film, as well as roles performed by famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is particularly cute in the movie but all the kids are good. The landscape of West Texas is superb, as is the soundtrack full of Texas artists. The last part seemed a little far-fetched, however, my son was interested throughout the film, which does not do it so often. Something in the script was captivating for the kids. Having shown calves as a child, I really loved the end. It does not really work that way unless you have heifers.
