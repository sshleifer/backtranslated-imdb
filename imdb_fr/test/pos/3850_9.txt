I'm not a big fan of Disney, but my 7-year-old is starting to get interested. So we made a whole collection and it's one of my favorites. We saw it for the first time a few weeks ago and we had to see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive plot, but there is more than one movie. <br /> <br /> Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind. The music is superb - my disabled son always insists that I pick him up and dance with him until "Everyone wants to be a cat", that says it all. And "Thomas O'Malley" is just as nice. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why some people have such a bad feeling about this movie, other than the dislike of cats! And yes, it takes some landmarks of "101 Dalmations", and maybe "The Lady and the Tramp" (I have not seen it for a long time, so I will not compare them), and although "101 Dalmations" is better in some ways, for me "The Aristocats" is much more enjoyable. Is not that what these films are? <br /> <br /> Aside from "Peter Pan" (it's now a 10/10 movie), it's my favorite Disney movie. My 7 year old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old daddy loves it, so you can not ask for more than a family movie. <br /> <br /> Superb!
