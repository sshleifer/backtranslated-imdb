Well, as you can see, I arrived at this party rather late, but I have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments. I found this site by accident while looking for other Marine Corps films. So, let me start by telling you that I played in Marine Boot in the movie, Pvt. Labarsky, and was stationed at MCRDep, San Diego at the time. Jack Webb and his team selected 15 permanent staff, some of whom had the floor, and 15 other Marines who had just finished their training camp. This was the platoon and the marines that described the various "IDs". To the best of my memories, the captain and the soldier. Owens (Don Dubbins) were not in the Marines. We spent about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), California, to shoot the part of the movie we were involved in, and then they finished the other shots after we left. <br /> <br /> If I let myself go, let me clarify some of the questions that have been asked in previous entries. "Cuff Daddy" commented on our squad's ability to shout "Yes sir" without moving, etc. We shouted for the Sound Guys and it was during the shooting of the stage. As you remember, when the ID or who had already started asking a question and before answering it, you had already taken your breath of air allowing you to scream the appropriate answer to the fullest. This is how things happened. <br /> <br /> "74Sooner" commented on crossing the same Paris Island building, however, as I already mentioned, all scenes were shot in Studio City, California. They were built from photographs taken on the island of Paris and field visits and maritime advisers from the island of Paris. Sorry, you were in the real buildings, not in the sets. <br /> <br /> "schappe1" raised many positive points, but about the incident with the peloton in Paris Island at the time, all that Jack Webb said to us was, "The movie was born because of the accident, and the Marine Corps did not want to produce anything that could affect the family members of the Marines who died that night.Although the Marine Corps provide Marines and necessary assistance for a film explaining to the public why a Marine DI is doing what it does. " <br /> <br /> As mentioned by some of you, I also became aware of my own thinking at the time. this dialogue has been cleaned up and this is obviously not happening in real life. In the 50s, that was how it happened. <br /> <br /> One of the stories I would like to tell is about the interaction that took place between us, the Marines and the film crew, and between the film crew and Jack Webb. From the beginning by custom, the Marines replied "Yes sir" to anyone who was moving. In the second week, it became more and more common to hear "Yes sir" from all directions. On stage, someone barked to ask that something be done with the lighting and, from nowhere, on a podium above the plateau, a response from "Yes Sir" would be issued. On all these occasions at one of our informal meetings, said Jack Webb. "If I had known that I would have so much respect from this team, I would have brought you here years ago." There was a lieutenant from San Diego playing the role of the ID of the other platoon and the one with whom Jack Webb is fighting, but during one of the firing sessions he was ready to take number 32, but Webb always tried to make it work. through how he wanted it done and showed no lack of patience with him. The next day, they called on the adviser of the island of Paris, a Sgt-DI. from Paris Island and he did well. <br /> <br /> At the time, I was a little fan of camera and I knew the Still Camera Man to get a pointer from him and it turned out that he would give me still shots and some of the 35mm movies from the daily shoot that were not going to be used. These film strips that I cut out and made of slides. After the release of the film on VHS tape (The DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.), My children and grandchildren have fun trying to see who can find me most often on the screen.
