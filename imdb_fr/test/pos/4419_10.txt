I loved the show today !!! It was a variety and not just the food (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, it always allows the viewer to peek around the corner to see what happens next. She is also down to earth and as friendly as you get, as one of us who made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are also friends, have also been pleasantly surprised. I loved the "first" theme and the audience was invited to play as well. I must admit that I was shocked to see her respect the time allotted for certain things, but she did it and, damn it, I'm going to write these recipes. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with the family. Those who have not yet listened, find out which channel and what time, I assure you that you will not be disappointed.
