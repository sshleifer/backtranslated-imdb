Alter Egos does not come any fancier than the creation of Ali G. of Sacha Baron Cohen. Entirely misled by his delirious and non-existent sense of the suburbs of central England that is part of his social milieu. He continues to live like a Gansta in Los Angeles. While living with his grandmother in Staines, in the suburbs of London, he keeps a close control over his Posse, the West Staines "Massiv". <br /> <br /> Spend her free time with Me Julie, her daughter, the Posse and teach the region's eight-year-old Scouts at the "Keep it Real (Advanced)" lessons at the John Nike Recreation Center, funded by the government. <br /> <br /> This is where the story takes flight. It is said that government funding has stopped, Ali G then embarks on a personal quest "In the fight for justice, I am ready to give myself life, as did Martin Luther Van Dross". This is his response to the local press team when he interviewed him on a hunger strike while chained to a fence. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance plays David Carlton, the sinister and devious Deputy Prime Minister, who is "Even more reckless than Skeletor". Using Ali G, without knowing it, lose the Prime Minister 18,000 votes, three weeks before the general election. Seeing Ali G as a stupid idiot, his plan turns against him. Ali G suddenly becomes a nocturnal sensation and a savior of the people, working directly with the prime minister. The story becomes more sinister and has hilarious consequences. <br /> <br /> Ali G Indahouse is a great British film that brings the extremely talented attributes of writing, alongside Dan Mazer, the executive production and role of Sacha Baron Cohen. Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, as PM Play their roles very seriously among the gags and hilarity of Ali G. <br /> <br /> Ironically, see the parodies playing their role in a really real world and continually preaching "Keep it Real" from their own little world of West Stains "Massiv" is a true comic paradox. <br /> <br /> Directed by Mark Mylod, his first full-length feature film since making television shows such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show and the scent of Reeves and Mortimer, to name a few. each. <br /> <br /> Very real and very fun.
