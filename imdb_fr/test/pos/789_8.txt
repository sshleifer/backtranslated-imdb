Seeing this for the first time on British television, with good musical accompaniment. The stage of the elevator is classy, ​​especially when it descends into the telephone booth and then fiddles with the floor indicator. The jump across the board is really impressive and there is so much more. In addition to all that has been mentioned before, there is the fight with the man who intimidated the woman with the dog - it's so simple. The only drawback is the plot - he mingles with Dead Eye Dan, who escapes but does not reappear, even if other gangsters are involved later. The scene where he seems to shoot the fat inspector is funny, but it would have been better if Dead Eye was the one who pulled the trigger.
