The best performance is best rewarded by a melodramatic scenario that truly elevates the human spirit. To all those henchmen who toil every day, take courage! your patience is virtuous. Your patience and decency will be the proof of a way you will never anticipate. This is your big story. I do not think you can look to the end without a trickle of moisture in that hardened eye. Or can you? For me, it would not be so ... the story is implacable! The idealist has denied his due. Will someone speak? Ah! but you will need to see the show yourself! observe the schoolmaster at a young age, without the notice and observation that the observer would certainly expect. And why does he continue like this? Yes! you have to watch O'Toole's performance by yourself! I can only wish that it is still "printed", then present it to my friends as proof of respect for their faithful life.
