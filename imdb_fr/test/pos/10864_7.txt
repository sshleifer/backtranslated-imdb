To qualify this film as a "lesbian love story" is about as accurate as calling Pride & Prejudice a "frank love affair". There is so much more than that. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main character is a lesbian, but her story is a classic bildungsroman, a journey from childhood to adulthood, from sexual innocence to maturity, from personal blindness self-discovery. There is a stylistic element of the camp in the direction of the film, but it is not an obstacle; it serves to emphasize the staged and dramatic parts of the main character's life. <br /> <br /> Those who know Anna Chancellor of the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice will surely be surprised here. Rachael Stirling is the star of the main character Nan and Keeley Hawes is a kindness with wide eyes like her lover Kitty Butler. The Chancellor could play the lead role, apart from Sally Hawkins who plays Zena Butler. This film is not for sensitive souls, but it is not a pro-gay advertisement either. It's a real story, with real comedy and drama, an engaging story with fascinating characters and worth watching.
