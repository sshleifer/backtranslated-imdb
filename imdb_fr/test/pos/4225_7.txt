This new installment of the Child's Play series does not present a scary scene, but tons of hilarious jokes, like that of a stoner who sees Chucky give him the finger and say "rough doll" and many references to the series: " you can kill me but I'll come back, I'll always come back. " The title of the movie was probably thought before the script and was written around this one. It's totally different from all the other movies in the series. He does not even have Andy, the central character of all the previous ones. Chucky seems to be interfering with the characters in another film, a soap opera where two teenagers leave to get married. There is an elaborate and fresh death scene where broken glass and water are spreading everywhere. The film is very gore, very funny and contains references to Martha Stewert's pop culture to Jerry Springer. DO NOT SEE THIS BEFORE YOU SEE THE THREE OTHERS. This will really spoil the effect because the first one is really scary. A lot of pleasure guilty of pleasure and foolishness. <br /> <br />
