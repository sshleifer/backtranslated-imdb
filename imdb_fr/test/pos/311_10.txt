This film changed the art of cinema by telling a complex story in a new and powerful way. The film mixes brutal realism and fantasy, interspersing a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolor smoke. The film uses music not as a score, but as a practical part of the scene with loudspeakers, radios, and so on. Coppola uses a piece of classic literature as inspiration, taking scenes and characters and placing them in a totally different environment. It is a difficult and courageous thing to do. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune and films him so that you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such a move requires are amazing and work wonders. This film belongs to the top ten.
