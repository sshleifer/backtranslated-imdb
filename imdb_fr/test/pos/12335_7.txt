I also saw it at the movies in the 80s and I never forgot it, even though I never saw it anywhere. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it would look old-fashioned if I saw it now, but I would remember the screenplay and compare it to some of the terrible modern movies I saw on Zone Horror would rise up very well . <br /> <br /> I still remember his sliding coffin opening and all the reviving corpses, as well as blue lightning. Having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this one, it must be fine.
