Since the last horrible film of Asterix and the fact that we only have the Swiss version in German cinemas, here I went to look at him with a little worry ... Without foundation, I was happy to discover ^ ____ ^ <br /> <br /> The film is funny and modern, it has good gags, a good animation, a fun character interaction, a good voice (Note: I can only speak for German Switzerland !), with the exception of the daughter of the Viking leader Abba (her name is great, despite the voice of an actress not very inspired) ... <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the character of Justforkix (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German, it is the young man who is supposed to be put in shape ...). It is a very amusing portrait of an urban teenager in soft agglomerations. but he is very friendly, despite the adolescent ways ... XD The interaction between Asterix & Obelix and their young leader is fantastic and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> This should not be compared to old movies, because one is quite different ... which, surprisingly, does not make it bad. On the contrary. When they tried to modernize the last movie (twelve years ago), they completely overturned it. This film, however, proved that it could be done very well ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I left the theater with a good mood ... Always good sign ^ _ ~
