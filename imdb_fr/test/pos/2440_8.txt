A lumberjack finds a young cougar in need. Too young to be alone, the cat soon joined the camp workers. Nicknamed "Good Time Charlie", his antics amused everyone at first. Its wild nature finally begins to cause problems and its reintroduction into its natural habitat becomes a problem. This film is one of those wonderful Disney nature movies that were commonplace in the 1950s and 1960s. Action, beautiful scenery and an endearing animal to charm you. These films are not long, but include a fascinating glimpse of wildlife and the effects of human contact. Unlike Disney's animated talking animals, the animals in these movies have remained true to their nature. make great travel movies to see western states.
