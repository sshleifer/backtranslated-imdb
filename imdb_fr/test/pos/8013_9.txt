After watching this movie, I felt a new sensation. I had watched a movie in which the main actor had presented a performance that almost rivaled legend Chevy Chase in 'Fletch'. This is not to say that the performance is comparable, but both give virtually flawless delivery of their lines. This actor is Marc Singer! Singer is Jack Ford, the "Droid Gunner" of the title, who earns his living by collecting the premium on androids. There are mutants, topless pleasure droids (!), A Scandinavian smuggler and maybe a shy attempt to make a statement about class or maybe even globalization or ......... well it does not matter. What counts in this film is the dry way in which Singer delivers his lines, which gives a humor that doubles! What's important about this film is that director Fred Olen Ray seems to realize that serious science fiction only works very rarely, and when your budget is limited, it's best not to take yourself seriously. Olen Ray said that everyone involved in this film had a great time and that it was transferred to the movie. I challenge you to criticize a film that describes the futuristic Earth as an eternally dark, neon-lit land and ends with a warehouse. Self parody is a very redemptive quality. To summarize, Fred Olen Ray is an ambassador of independent cinema and Marc Singer, the perfect director of film B. If only Olen Ray could write the equation in Tim Thomerson, we would have a film at hand.
