"Eagle's Wing" is a pleasant movie surprise and keeps the viewer interested. I did not know what the British had done before reading the comments of other viewers. I can understand why he won a prize for cinematography because it was brilliantly presented and must have been magnificent on a large theater screen. <br /> <br /> It seemed much more realistic than most Westerns, describing how the West was more truly conquered. And the complexity of the characters he presents. The character of Indian-Sam Waterson is particularly intriguing. He appears to be brutal in the wild environment to which he is subjected, but displays a remarkable respect for the weaknesses he witnesses in the white men and women he meets. He is not friendly or sensitive to these intruders on his lands, but he has a limit to his sense of revenge, even a compassion when he is in a position of strength and observes the withered white man who wants revenge, as well than the girl. he kidnaps after capturing a stagecoach. As such, his character seems complex but consistent with the hard lands in which he lived and which were threatened by these intruders with whom he is not without heart in his relations. <br /> <br /> The magnificent horse he rides is an essential link and it is interesting to note how this Indian manages it, compared to the character of Martin Sheen who has it in his possession and his power during a certain time. "Eagle's Wing" is an unusual western, a genre that does not appeal to me, but I really enjoyed this great offer, which I would call "A Man Called Horse".
