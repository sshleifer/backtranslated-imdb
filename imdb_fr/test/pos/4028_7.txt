This movie is a great remake of the original of the same title. The movie was cool, despite the fact, I hate the new ones! All the actors were great. He has a lot of casting and an amazing plot !! The main plot is that a man is poisoned and must solve his own murder, that's it! Dennis Quaid is the man who is "DOA" (in other words, Dead On Arrival). He finds help with his friends, now suspicious !! Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him. The film is fast enough and full of action. You can see two other great stars in Meg Ryan (City Of Angels, Courage Under Fire) and Daniel Stern (Alone At Home, Very Bad Things, Bushwhacked) in Supporting Roles in this awesome and cool remake of a movie classic !!
