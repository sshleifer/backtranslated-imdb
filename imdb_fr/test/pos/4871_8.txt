I think I'm a kind of Road Runner fan. I do not care about predictability, I laugh anyway. 'Beep, Beep' is predictable most of the time, although it's pretty ingenious at the same time. Of course, the Road Runner is chased by the Coyote and of course, the Coyote fails to catch it with every new attempt. The Coyote's plans are very funny. You see exactly where things go wrong and you will not be disappointed. Well, once you're a little disappointed, what you think is going to happen is not, but it makes the joke even more fun. <br /> <br /> If you like Road Runner shorts, you'll love this one. The predictable gags work and the animation is great and quite original at times.
