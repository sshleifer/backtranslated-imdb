It's a really amazing movie! The characters seemed so realistic that it was hard to believe they were not real people. Being from the South, I thought that Judith Ivey's character seemed particularly real and, as everyone has already mentioned, she plays an exceptional role as an actor. The characters are not beautiful and do not look like Hollywood stars: their bodies and imperfect personalities seem so much more natural and real. <br /> <br /> A reviewer mentioned that the main character, Alice, had no good reason to run away from home, which is true; she had no moral or irreproachable reason for fleeing, like a child fleeing abuse, & c. I thought she was fed up with dead-end jobs in the working class and wanted to flee to Florida where her friend led the attractive and privileged life of a student in Miami. The actress shows that Alice's confusion, uncertainty and questions turn into a decision and a desire to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. The film also shows how much Alice is trapped in seemingly impossible situations, which makes her panic, takes action and seeks help. <br /> <br /> At first, the gritty filming style was off the mark and made me think it was a low-budget or home-made film, but in reality, it's done very well. The quality of your movie makes you feel really among the characters, which are part of their RV trip around the country. It is certainly a film that deserves to be seen, even if I do not quite understand all its descriptions as a comforting story. It's rather vulgar and disturbing sometimes, even if it's not completely sad at the end.
