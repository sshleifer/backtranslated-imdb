It's really a love documentary about a fascinating character, his vision of life and his extended family. The filmmakers spent three years filming Sister Helen in her halfway house and managed to capture so many wonderful things that you can not help but feel that you know Sister Helen and her "boys". The house has 21 recovering addicts, each with a story almost as involved as Sister Helen's. The scenes that are coming to an end are particularly engaging and emotional. <br /> <br /> The story of Sister Helen's marriage, dependence and loss reveals a very complex character whose hard love is always funny, touching and endearing. <br /> <br /> The film is amazing in the way it tells its story in beautiful sequences of lives that become a story almost as clear as if each scene was scripted and performed by the best. The honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of "customers" is very engaging when you learn their fears and watch their attempts to grow. <br /> <br /> You will never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moe or poor Ashish (spelling?).
