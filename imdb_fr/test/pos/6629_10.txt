Being a big fan of Bergman, I had to literally look for years to find this film (at a price below $ 60, I mean) and I finally bought it a few weeks ago. The basic principle of Bergmans' films is the relationship between the characters and the way they handle difficult situations. This film is the same but different because the frame is very different from most of the Bergman films I've seen. <br /> <br /> It happens in time of war and the heroes are taken in the middle. <It's fascinating from start to finish and proves once again that Liv Ullman is one of the best actresses of the twentieth century. A must see.
