It was the Saturday before Halloween this year (today, at the time of writing) and it must be the best horror anthology ever. I'm not normally a fan of horror movies - largely because of the volume of shit that has been released recently. However, the director of Campfire Tales has the suspense gift Hitchcock-esquire. Unlike other contemporary movies, it does not miss every opportunity to scare you, but you can use prefigurations and "near misses" - the climax will occur in the previous moment, but will not prove not to be. <br /> <br /> I did not catch 'The Hook' or the first main segment, but from what I read here, these are the two that you could afford to miss. <br /> <br /> "People Can Lick Too" was full of suspense - this short film keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting for something to happen for the little girl who walks his yard and his house looking for his football and later his dog. She meets so many quirks that the suspense reaches breathtaking proportions before the climax of the short film, when the girl gives up and goes to bed, thinking that her dog is underneath. She reaches out to let him lick, and she feels the touch of a tongue on his hand ... before noticing that on his mirror, written in the blood, it is "People can also lick". My reader, I leave you the last seconds to know, because at this stage, the short film could have taken an incalculable number of turns. <br /> <br /> "The medallion" was nevertheless an undeniable masterpiece. of this film. It starts with a man on a motorcycle, driving simply ... to what he does not know, but he can feel closer. As he drives, a storm is unleashed and he is forced to find refuge in the home of a dumb girl. The two reconcile quickly, but before they can do anything other than kiss, the girl reveals through her writing that ghosts live in her house. They quickly start packing to leave, but they are caught in the middle of a reenactment of a scene: a father who returns to his daughter and his boyfriend are preparing to flee, murder them both before suicide. I'll have to leave you to discover the end here too - I could not hope to make the story right, and what I've said so far is just a brief summary of the story - I could not The hope of transmitting the nuances and sensory details that are added. <br /> <br /> "The Campfire", which connects all the stories, is a pretty interesting tale of the theme of the car accident and the girls. are very attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this movie are pretty. Anyway, despite the fact that it is fragmented, the story is made and the end is hard to predict if you are concerned about the other stories. However, if you pay enough attention to the segments of The Campfire that are spreading in the movie, it is certainly possible to predict the end, especially if you have seen movies based on the same principle. (Fans of MST3k, do you remember Soultaker? Same principle, but without the terrible writing of Vivian Schilling and the big movie. If you have seen the first 30 minutes, you should be able to predict the end.) best horror movie I've seen in a long time and the only horror anthology worthy of a purchase.
