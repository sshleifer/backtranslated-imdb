Based on Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time," this amazing film by Eroll Morris describes the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. He contributed more to science, despite his debilitating disease, ALS, that a good health scientist could only dream of. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an account of Hawking's childhood and how he was a poor student. recognizable brilliant. He dragged himself between college and university, where he was diagnosed with the disease that would take away the normal functions of his body, but would allow him to continue living and thinking perfectly. <br /> <br /> Morris explains how Stephen's brilliant spirit has developed from childhood to today, at some point his mother recounted how, when she was pregnant, she had prophetically bought an astronomical atlas to read while in hospital. Hawking himself tells the chronology of his discoveries, while Morris interviews close friends and colleagues who have had the chance to befriend this magnificent man. <br /> <br /> He tells how he was intrigued for the first time by the discovery that the Universe was developing in the same way as the extent of a star. We also know that the stars eventually die and become what are now called "black holes". If this is the case, will the universe not begin to contract too much, reversing itself until we reach the "big tightening"? as Hawking says. And when the universe begins to recede, will not time "reverse"? When I asked this question, I began to think that death might not be the end, maybe one day time would go by and our death would become our rebirth and our birth. death. The universe is a big cycle, like all the rest of life. <br /> <br /> That's what Hawking tells us, everything in the universe is recycled. This is quite logical and can make your mind think in a million directions. That's why I like this movie and why it is absolutely necessary !!! 11 out of 10 ... Morris never stops having fun!
