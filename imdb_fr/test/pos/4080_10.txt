If you want to know more about what kind of things are happening in modern civilization, you will find an excellent book called "The Sea Out of Law" or "The Forbidden Sea", which describes, story after story, how these things happen. occur. The anarchy of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. One of the many freighters in the world has a dubious record (nationality) and it is difficult to apply international laws when the shipowners do not have an office in a real country. Two, many lines of ships employ crews from third world countries poor in land. Crews are often (like illegal migrant workers) threatened and intimidated to comply with questionable or illegal practices. Thirdly, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. Team members are rewarded for their respect and silence. Fourth, once they have committed an illegal act, the ships are able to hide under an extra veil of paint. In any case, it's a fascinating read. <br /> <br /> Scary story, great movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to produce the best and most important movies? Hollywood has a hard time getting enough Oscar-winning films every year, so many of the top five candidates usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema. <br /> <br /> I loved the completely perverted show of Sean Pertwee. As usual, I also liked Omar Epps.
