It is unfortunate that the Gershwin family and Goldwyn Estate have pulled out this fantastic film from the film, preventing the audience from seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever in a single film. <br /> <br /> It is also true that the voices of Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge have been dubbed for this film, which partly explains why the Gershwin do not want this film to be released again. Despite film flaws and the creative differences between the Gershwins and the Goldwyns, this film presents some of the most remarkable performances ever on the screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey deserve special praise. <br /> <br /> This film was the song of the great independent producer Samuel Golwyn. Ironically, it was also Gershwin's biggest shame. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a loss for the wonderful black actors who participated. Because we can not see them at their best anymore.
