And I would have noted it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it had not had the very serious Irish accent of Barbara Hershey in the main role of Mother Madalyn. The accent came and went, unfortunately, which I found more than a little distracting. <br /> <br /> However, William L Petersen's performance as Joad has been remarkable. He brought warmth and depth to the character despite a periodic hokey dialogue. Captivating and authentic, I found it quite amazing in the way he captured the character. <br /> <br /> The principle of the film is quite simple: the construction of a forgotten staircase in a church. It is based, vaguely enough I believe, on a true story and I had heard of this staircase before seeing the movie. <br /> <br /> It was a phenomenal technical feat for his time: a floating double helix made without nails or screws. It still exists today, although it now belongs to private owners. <br /> <br /> ** Minor Spoiler ** Good secondary casting and Barbara dies so well in all her films. Here she does not disappoint. Many special moments. <br /> <br /> 7/10
