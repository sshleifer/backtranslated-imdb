But George and Gracie are not among them. The movie is fun and the pool scene with WC Fields must be some of the funniest I've ever seen, but Gracie and George are more irritating than comical in their roles, partly because of the lack of scripting and interpretation . I gave him a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, WC is a treasure of timing and comic energy in this one.
