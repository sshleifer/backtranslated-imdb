For those who love their movies full of explosions of planets and extreme violence, this is definitely not to be seen. In fact, there is very little conspiracy (or at least very little that can not be summed up in a few seconds): A meet B. Mr. A falls in love with Mrs. B and has an affair with her. A and B then fall in love and are surprised (at length) to know if they want to have an affair themselves). <br /> <br /> This is Cantonese Visconti. There is no story, but you get a succession of beautiful images and a poignant and trivial music that expresses the slow passage of the emotions of the main characters. There is also the chance to see one of the most beautiful women in the world in a succession of incredibly elegant outfits. For my money, it's worth seeing just for that. How could this woman have been a heroine of action? She seems to be coming out of Vogue's pages.
