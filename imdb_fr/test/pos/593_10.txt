Who does not remember the movie Muppet ??? <br /> <br /> Kermit the frog is now an icon of American culture. Which child does not use this character? <br /> <br /> As Muppet's first film, the film is simply called, Muppet's film went very well. Kermit follows the advice of a Hollywood agent and comes out of his swamp to respond to the announcement. Along the way, he meets a pig, a bear, chickens, a rock band and some other quality puppets. Watch for dozens of appearances like Madaline Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Pryor, Mel Brooks and many others. I grew up watching this movie and I loved it.
