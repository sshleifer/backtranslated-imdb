hi <br /> <br /> Blade is a sensational action movie. the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain have done justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> The action sequences of the movie are better than those of Matrix! <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes is one of the best action heroes of all time. <br /> <br /> If you like action / vampire movies, it's the ONE. <br /> <br /> the theme is pretty good considering that so many movies about vampires have already been filmed.But this is the best of them. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the Ride.
