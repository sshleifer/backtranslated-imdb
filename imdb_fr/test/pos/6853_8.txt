(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I heard reproaches about special effects. But that should hurt the movie. The film is a suspense movie. And it's very good at that. So from this point of view, this film flips. Franke rocks. Enjoy your plastic hearts content. So, nothing wrong with this movie. Unless you look at the English dub, which is a total joke. This creates the illusion that it is a movie B. <br /> <br /> A complaint I have to make is the music video on the DVD. He does not say who sings it. I would like to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Playable: 5/10
