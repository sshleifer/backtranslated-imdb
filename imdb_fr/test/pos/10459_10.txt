Simply one of the greatest movies ever made. Worthy of sitting next to European masterpieces such as THE RULES OF THE GAME, GRAND ILLUSION, NOSTALGHIA, ANDREI ROUBLEV, 8 1/2, WINGS OF DESIRE, VIRIDIANA, THE NIGHT OF THE STARS, THE STRADA, ORDET , THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, THE FOUR CENTS COUP AND MADAME DE ... A blessing ... and an almost perfect work of art.
