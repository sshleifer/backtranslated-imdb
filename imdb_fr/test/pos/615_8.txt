There is not a moment of boredom in Fran√ßois Ozon's "Robe d'Ete". It is surprising how much this film is packed. After lying naked on a deserted beach, a young homosexual is approached by a girl who seeks a light for her cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. Returning to the beach they discover that all his clothes have been stolen. She gives him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and asks him to return the next day. He returns to the holiday cabin on a bicycle dressed as a girl. His gay companion is sexually excited. Early the next morning, the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose vacation is over. She suggests that she keep the dress as a souvenir of their summer romance. It's a light film that captures the spirit of summer vacation at the seaside, but maybe not for those who are bothered by nudity or homosexual themes.
