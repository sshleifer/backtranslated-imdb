I thought it was very "different" from most of Shakespeare's modern interpretations and appreciated it thoroughly. This would not be helpful for those who study it at school, etc., because it does not show the traditional interpretations of Shakespeare's character (Miranda is portrayed pretty punk compared to your traditional Shakespeare lady), but for the understanding of the piece and the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and fantastic to watch. It also does not include the correct format, as in the arrangement of acts and scenes, while I currently play in Miranda in a production and most of its lines have been cut and some scenes have been split and mixed but it is very useful and I would definitely like. recommend it as a must even if just to say you've seen it! Shakespeare fans would love that!
