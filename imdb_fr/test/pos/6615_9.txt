it's one of the greatest documentaries I've ever seen with "Dark Days". I skated for perhaps an hour of my life and I still love this movie. Peralta and her excellent publisher have perfectly captured the feelings and atmosphere, partly helped by incredible archive footage. Tony Alva is one of the coolest people in the world. Love these striped sports socks at the knees, you rock Tony! <br /> <br /> Not only is this movie a visual feast, but the soundtrack must be one of the best in history, if you're a rock lover of the 70s. Buy the DVD, you will not regret it.
