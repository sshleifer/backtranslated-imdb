I absolutely fell in love with "Living in A Big Way" when I saw it for the first time! The reason # 1 is because I love, adore and am a huge fan of GENE KELLY. He was a wonderful dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention his extremely beautiful appearance and sensual personality. I love his role in this film. He was a gentleman. This film showed his wonderful talent for the theater. I also enjoyed Marie MacDonald. It was the first time I saw or knew anything about it, and this great movie made me a fan too. In fact, the whole cast of this movie was nice and awesome. The humor between the butler, "Everette Hanover Smythe", and the father, Mr. Morgan; The humor of Ms. Morgan's courtroom, and in particular her grandmother Morgan's immediate attachment to "LEO GOGARTY". And the GENE number "FIDO AND ME" is adorable. The opening number with GENE and MARIE is also very nice. I would recommend anyone to see this movie. It will remain really dear to your heart forever. Or at least it must be mine. And you will fall in love with GENE again. I awarded him GENE KELLY MOVIE's No. 2, his favorite film, and I saw and owned many of his films. They are part of my daily routine! So trust me when I tell you that you will love this movie! Watch it and enjoy!
