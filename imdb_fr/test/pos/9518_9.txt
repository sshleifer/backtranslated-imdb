It's still a jewel of Daniele Thompson's pen. In fact, the same year (1999), she wrote and directed La Buche, the first of three generic director / screenwriter to date. Beautiful Mother is above all "French", whatever that means, which, of course, differs according to people. The premise is simple: on the altar where he marries Mathilde Seigner, the groom, Vincent Lindon, sees for the first time his mother, Catherine Deneuve, and undergoes what the French call a thunderbolt that we know as a coup de lightning. . Theoretically, the story is either 1) complete, assuming he cancels the marriage, or 2) just at the beginning of his marriage and therefore lives a lie until it is resolved in a way or 'another. Thompson goes to second place, but not without a secondary intrigue, like, for example, Deneuve's cigar-smoking lesbian mother, Line Renaud (in real life, if anyone cares, Renaud maintains a long-term relationship with St√©phane Audran, who co-starred here) and throws a brilliant piece into a lavishly appointed men's room at the wedding reception, which takes the form of a hilarious song-dance. The accomplished writer that she is Thompson also casts comedy drama as the brilliant culminating scene where Vincent finally expresses his feelings for Deneuve at a family reunion while destroying the joint. It is to savor. Again and again.
