I think Shane Black is one of the greatest action writers of all time! He gave us the incredible Lethal Weapon (in his time), pulling Mel Gibson to fame. Then we watched Bruce Willis' second best film (The Last Boyscout). We fell a bit in The Last Action Hero, but we redeemed ourselves with this one, The Long Kiss Goodnight. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of action movies, everything is there for you ... Action, Comedy, Thrills, and then gain even more action, comedy and thrills. Geena Davies is great, Samual L Jackson is even bigger. Do not miss it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
