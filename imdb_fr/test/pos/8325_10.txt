This BBC series is excellent. I am not a paleontologist, but this series gives the best historical representation of the dinosaurs I have ever seen. The 3D animations and animatronics are very good and make you think that you have traveled in time. The BBC deserves a pat on the back for such a beautiful series as well as Tim Haines who had to spend a lot of time to spread.
