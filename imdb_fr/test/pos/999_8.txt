From the beginning of "The Edge Of Love", the viewer is transported into the fascinating world of World War II in London. We follow the lives of four people who could have been created solely for this film, an exploration of female friendship and the tensions caused by marriage and infidelity. Except that one of the characters is named Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but sometimes despicable. <br /> <br /> This film is based on Thomas's writings on love and romance. These were adapted with a specific scenario by Sharman MacDonald (Keira Knightley's mother). Director John Maybury says the other three main characters were real people. <br /> <br /> The four are very powerful. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley is cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first part of the film takes place in London during the Nazi air raids. Vera is pursued by Willaim, a soldier awaiting deployment. By chance, Dylan meets her first love, Vera. From there, Vera meets Caitlin, Dylan's wife. While the three drink, William successfully breaks Vera's custody. <br /> <br /> The film follows their lives while Vera and William are married and sent to war. Vera is pregnant and returns to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There, they face a difficult existence, Vera supporting Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war wages. Vera and Caitlin's friendship grew during those times. The same goes for Dylan's craze for Vera. She gives in. This creates the first test for both women. <br /> <br /> On his return from the war, William hardly recognizes his wife and has no connection with his son. The situation gets worse when Dylan stares indifferently at his friend struggling with fatigue on the battlefield (post-traumatic stress disorder). William realizes that something happened between Dylan and Vera and, in a drunken fury, invaded Dylan's house. <br /> <br /> "Edge Of Love" begins as an elegant romance in a war-torn city and ends in a dull and dreary maternity, unfaithfulness and attempted murder in Wales. The treatment of PTSD is well done and should speak to an American audience. One day (see end). <br /> <br /> Every star has a great moment. Miller when she pulls stitches in her head in response to the abortion of another man's child. Knightley and Murpy when he ends up making connections with his son. Oh shit, almost all their scenes are great. And Rhys when he purges himself at the bar so that Vera's husband is sent to prison. <br /> <br /> Yet the real star of the film is Jonathan Freeman's cinematography and John Maybury's direction. They seem to understand that regardless of the quality of the story or that of Thomas, it is a film dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they cherish their scenes with amazing shots. Although it is not the best of the pictures, it is a very good film (much more engaging than "The Dutchess"). His visual lyricism accentuates the use of Thomas's poetry. In addition, this is clearly Knightley's second best career performance, and perhaps Miller's best performance. <br /> <br /> I always had a thing for the struggling artist, be it the Mozart of Hulce or the Capote de Hoffman. But I am stunned by the lack of compassion I feel for Dylan Thomas. His struggles with alcohol are well known. But his antagonism of William and Caitlin to seize his first love, Vera makes him pass for ..... a nasty man. <br /> <br /> Is this academic title valid? Clearly no. At least not this year. It will be made public in March 2009, making it ineligible for academies. It's 9 months after its release in Britain. Between Atonement, Miss Pettigrew and Brideshead Revisited, the United States was satiated with pieces from the British period of the Second World War. Pity. This film is better than the others, except Atonement. But in this one, Knightley's soldier comes back, but like a shell of the man who left her.
