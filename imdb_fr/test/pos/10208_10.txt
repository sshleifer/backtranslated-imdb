Fritz Lang directed two great Westerns: "Western Union" and "The Return of Frank James". Frank James's film is equivalent to "Jesse James". "Western Union" is one of Randolph Scott's greatest westerns. I have never seen Robert Young in a western before; he is great as a telegraph employee. This is the only film I can think of that talks about the telegraph company opening in the West. It is a story at the forefront of the telegraph in the west, a story of triangular love and loyalty. <br /> <br /> The support cast is superb. Dean Jagger, who directed some westerns, plays the role of telegraph leader. Virginia Gilmore, who plays the role of Mr. Jagger's sister, is interested in the love of the film. Ms. Gilmore had a short career in the movies. She left the cinema in 1952 and became a theater coach. She is mainly known as the first Mrs. Yul Brynner. It's a pleasure to see Slim Summerville in a movie with Mr. Scott. They were in two other great movies: "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Jesse James".
