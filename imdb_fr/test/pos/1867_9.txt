In simple terms, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The film deals less with the raw science of Darwin's beliefs and emphasizes his relationship with his family, mainly with his wife Emma and his daughter Annie. <br /> <br /> Toby Jones gives a wonderful twist like Thomas Huxley, Darwin's big advocate of beliefs, and the rest of the cast is ready to share the time on screen with Bettany and Connelly. <br /> <br /> But these are the two who make the film. Their true chemistry is evident from beginning to end, but develops a transcendence as Darwin struggles with his demons. The scene where Darwin tells the end of Jenny's story, the orang-utan, to her dying daughter, Annie, is quite striking. The world premiere at TIFF was mesmerizing. Bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the best of the year in the short term. Connelly's work is just as beautiful. He plays the religious wife of a man who, in Huxley's words, "killed God." <br /> <br /> The film moves slowly through the whole spectrum of Darwin's sorrow, savoring every detail of Bettany's acting one. <br /> <br /> Brilliant.
