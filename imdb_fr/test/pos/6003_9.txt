I remember the broadcast of this NBC mini-series in high school. After reading the novel, I thought about checking some adaptations. I did not expect much from a TV mini-series, but now I should maybe check a little more. It's really excellent, and the best movie version possible. Writer Simon Moore, author of the original miniseries, Traffic, on which the film Soderberg is based, presented a brilliant narrative idea that helps the story unfold smoothly: he describes Gulliver's adventures as flashbacks, with the real story Gulliver goes home for the first time (everything that happened on a trip). Gulliver, played by Ted Danson of Cheers, is a little crazy when his wife, Mary Steenburgen, welcomes him back home. Unfortunately, the house now belongs to the local doctor, James Fox, who has projects on Steenburgen. Gulliver seems simply confused at first, but when he begins to tell stories of tiny people, that's all the evidence Fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum. Gulliver's four travels are recounted in this version, in the same order as the novel (the only time it was done on film). I like the way his current situation reflects his flashbacks. Gulliver's grandson, whom he has never met before, reminds him of Lilliputians. The doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine stand above him and remind him of the Brogdingnagians. His scientific research reminds him of the senseless scientific experiments and theories of Laputans and Academy professors. Finally, during his trial, he remembers the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos. The cast of this thing is amazing, and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beatty, Alfre Woodard, John Gielgud, Thomas Kristin Scott, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest flaw of the miniseries is that the acting is really uneven. You have all these great actors, but the lesser characters are often portrayed by actors who have probably behaved well in L.A. Law's episodes, but do not do well in a costume drama. Ted Danson is not particularly good, although he has some sequences where he excels. It's probably better than he did not try, but all the other characters in the movie speak with an English accent. Steenburgen is actually pretty good and pretty good overall. Another flaw in the series is that the adventures are going a little too fast. We can not believe that Gulliver spent eight years away from home, as it is claimed. But, in general, he captures Swift's tone and purpose very well, while adding a new emotional level to his structure.
