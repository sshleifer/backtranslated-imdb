I came out of "Rendition" with a list of defects one kilometer long, so how come my general impression is that it was a rather decent film? It's really a movie whose sum is better than its parts. <br /> <br /> These include a cast of famous stars, none of them giving a memorable performance (Omar Metwally, an unknown stranger, is the one I will remember); usable if undifferentiated direction; and a scenario that is both too complicated and too simplistic. Metwally is an American citizen born in Egypt who was kidnapped by the US government's rendition program, otherwise known as the process by which the United States tortures suspected terrorists to confess information, whether truthful or false. no. Reese Witherspoon plays his pregnant wife, who calls for an old college friend (Peter Saarsgard), who works for a senator (Alan Arkin) and helps find her husband. Meryl Streep plays the role of Chief of the Interpretation Program; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young interrogation officer whose conscience stands in the way. Meanwhile, a whole parallel story follows the daughter of a senior Egyptian official allied to the US rendition program and her boyfriend in training to become a suicide bomber. <br /> <br /> Ay-yi-yi is one I still had a lot to do in a two-hour film, and I was about to wash my hands, especially the Egyptian sub-plot Romeo and Juliet, which seemed only a distraction. But towards the end of the film, a chronological twist brings together all the elements of the plot, which makes you want to reevaluate everything you thought you knew about the motivations of different characters and makes "Rendition" a much more interesting movie. <br /> <br /> Witherspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard all look like high school students playing adults twenty years older than they actually are - Gyllenhaal in particular, usually a good actor, looks so bored that you wonder if he will gather the energy needed to deliver his lines. And the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as powerful as Meryl Streep and having given him nothing more than this one-dimensional dragon lady. Of course, the film seeks to be relevant, but instead of looking at the tangled network of arguments surrounding the issue of national security, there is a predictable charge in the middle of the debate. There are times when you think the film may be moving in an interesting direction - and if, for example, Witherspoon was beginning to doubt her husband's past? And if Metwally had been in contact with terrorists, as his interrogators accuse him? But no, the film takes the path of least resistance. <br /> <br /> But, as I said at the beginning, I recommend this movie. I know I did not do anything but list her faults, but her head is in the right place and she's entertaining, or at least as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogations. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
