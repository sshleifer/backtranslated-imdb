That's what I thought when I heard about the Inglorious Basterds cast. And I come from Germany and movies. <br /> <br /> This guy is over 50 and so far he has only been playing in poor television series - and even then he did not play the lead role. Obviously, no one has ever noticed what he was capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he had only one chance to change that - and, let's say it: it was a bingo! He is living proof of what is an excellent castrator, Tarrantino. <br /> <br /> By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the film in German - to be able to understand everything. And the German dialogue is written almost as well as English. <br /> <br /> Now, I could repeat what many others have already written here. I'll summarize it: QT is finally back.
