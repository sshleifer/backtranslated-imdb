Extremely entertaining, the western of the 50s contains 96 minutes of operation. Most viewers will be quickly drawn into this story and will find the experience very enjoyable. More than a B-Western but not really an epic, the budget was modest and affordable players despite several big names. Glenn Ford was the only box office draw at the time. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck had exceeded their limits and in search of a job, Stanwyck was 10 years of new popularity in "The Big Valley". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster had just started. <br /> <br /> Ford interprets John Parrish, a small rancher who decides to sell himself when the friendly sheriff is murdered by the shooter hired by the big owner. Parrish is a former Confederate officer who left the West only for health reasons. <br /> <br /> Robinson interprets Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and plans to buy the rest, keeping a promise to his wife Martha (Stanwyck). Lee was paralyzed in a land war he had waged 12 years earlier; his brother Cole (Keith) came from Texas to help him manage the huge gap. Lee has closed his eyes on obvious links between Stanwyck and Keith, but his sensitive daughter, Judith (Foster), is naturally upset by what is happening at home. <br /> <br /> John Parrish promised his fianc√©e Caroline (May Winn) to return to the east. Caroline, who is modeled on the character of "High Noon" Grace Kelly, breaks the engagement at the first signs of trouble and simply disappears from the film. This leaves the way for a novel John and Judith to develop. <br /> <br /> The violence begins early and continues throughout the film. Parrish is able to apply a military tactic against an enemy who underestimates his abilities and his determination. He has a very original confrontation with the main fighter halfway through the film. Ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest guy who disarms everyone in a self-deprecating way, who is slow to take offense but brutal when finally provoked (very similar to his role in "The Sheepman"). <br /> <br /> Robinson is also excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity even though he is physically only a shadow of himself. And he has enough lines and time on the screen to properly develop his character. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck has the toughest role and she is just not convincing as a classic two-faced woman, an apparently loyal woman who is considering replacing her husband with her brother. This is partly because it does not have enough time to do anything but superficially transmit either side of the character. That said, a talented actress could have done a much better job even with these limitations. <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. It should remind viewers a lot of Carroll Baker, both physically and in style. Although she is forced to play Judith in accordance with the 1950s convention (she is allowed to be tough but then to get into a hysterical state after every major showdown), Foster shows a good range. It expresses a growing attraction for Parrish but does so with so much subtlety that it is only retrospectively that the various indices are put in place. <br /> <br /> The real problem of "The Violent Men" is that it strives to be both a western game and a study of morality. Because many things must happen on the screen, the action is rushed and many characters undergo only a superficial treatment. This is neither a fatal flaw nor a reason to avoid the film, but it could have been much better with an extra 20 minutes of film or the absence of useless characters like Caroline. <br /> <br /> know? I am only a child.
