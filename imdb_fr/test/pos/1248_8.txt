Hello, are you looking for a movie for the family to watch on Friday night? Can not find what you are looking for? I thought it was an extremely enjoyable movie. Good for the whole family. I found that there was a remarkably rare combination of attracting adults and children. It was brilliant, to say the least. The role of Bruce Willis was excellent, there was a lot of humor and a great movie. In my opinion, it's a must-see movie. And I do not think a lot of movies, believe me when I say that it takes a lot for a movie to make me think that. It is clear that Bruce Willis and his team have worked hard to make this film. Excellent story, good acting and, again, a really nice movie.
