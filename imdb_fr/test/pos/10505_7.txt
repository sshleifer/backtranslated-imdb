A strange beam of light enters the room of Dr. Craig Burton (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) as they make love. About two hours are not counted to the extent that they seemingly clutch unharmed. Under hypnosis during a session with Dr. Susan Lamarche (Lindsay Crouse), psychiatrist, Craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by extraterrestrials. Sherry resists this idea as absurd and is happy enough to let her husband know that she is really pregnant. Ecstatic after trying for years to get pregnant, Sherry is frightened by the fact that Craig persists that the fetus is no longer his. This stems from a control of his low sperm count with a particularly high probability that he could not in any way fertilize his wife. Sherry to scary discoveries. His doctor, David Wetherly (Wilford Brimley), finds that ultrasound gives unusual results in the developing infant's appearance, but it's Craig who notices he looks like an alien! Sparks ignite cutting electrical equipment and even extinguishing the stimulator Wetherly! Thanks to hypnosis, Sherry reveals the experience of his abduction, but Lamarche thinks that his problem is psychological and not physiological. Without believing in his wife's theory of extraterrestrial impregnation, Craig addresses sociologist Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif), a sociologist whose work focuses on the study of extraterrestrial life and abduction. But Bert is reluctant to help Craig, who will go to the end of the earth to save his wife's life. Tragic results occur while Lamarche and others try to keep Craig in the goal of "cutting things" by believing he's crazy. Craig will continue his task by trying to train Bert in this way with him. <br /> <br /> A dreadful and absorbing tale that tells of a man's struggle to save his wife from the harm done by people no one else believes. Fortunately, the character of Dourif is not a quack fool, but a smart doctor who wants to know more, but his quest for the truth about extraterrestrials is not hostile. He hopes to learn from Sherry, but he is not incredibly demanding in this regard. goal. The story is told realistically ... it's easy to understand why others might think Craig a rocker. Vosloo does not push the character too far, but expresses the distress of his current situation. How can he save his wife from these hostiles and prove to others that he is not crazy? McWhirter deserves congratulations for the demands of scenes of difficult kidnapping where his unhappy character is naked on the table being probed and molested by these things. Crouse is doing well in her limited but important role of voice of reason in a situation where her clients seem out of control psychologically. The monster effects are disgusting and effective. I think the film works pretty well and the director Yuzna deserves the credit of having at least kept for this film. The last twenty minutes, as Craig tries to perform his "withdrawal operation" with a frightened Bert, watching the crazy situation degenerate is scathing. <br /> <br /> You know, fans of "Fire in the Sky" could dig up this leafing page.
