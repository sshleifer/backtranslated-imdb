What can I say about this band, I became addicted to 68, I was ten years old, I grew up on Blues although my dad then these Midlands guys came, a mix of Country Rock , Heavy Rock Blues, I wish I could see them in concert in the early years, I was lucky to be here in 79 (Knebworth) which was the best concert I've seen so far, 'hope a full version of this hot August night will be soon. This CD gave me the opportunity to see the boys again and again. The song remains the same thing, but this CD falls in the heart of the subject. <br /> <br /> Long live the Zepp.
