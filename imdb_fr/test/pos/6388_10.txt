Super original. Really great movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller go really well together on the screen. I hope it will come out soon. I saw this film for the first time during a screening. Because of my age and sex, I was asked to stay for a "conversation". We all had to comment on the film and many people did not seem to like it. I really loved it and I do not know why so many people did not think it was so good. Go see him when he goes out and decide for yourself! One thing you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to get into the movie without knowing anything about it. I did not know anything when I went to the projection except that it was called "Camile". It is definitely worth seeing.
