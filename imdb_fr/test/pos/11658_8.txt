I read the book before seeing the movie, and the movie is one of the best adaptations. Very true and faithful to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are extraordinary. Robbins is a talented filmmaker and I would like him to add even more to his repertoire. He made the movie very haunted and intentionally slow to add depth. A particularly brilliant film was a reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end.
