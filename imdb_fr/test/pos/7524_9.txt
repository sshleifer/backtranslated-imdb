This short film, a comic trainer starring Pepe Le Pew, is about a cat who thinks he's going to solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk. The problem is that it draws the most unfortunate attention from an honest and truly skunk (our hero, Pepe, who enters the left-hand stage), decidedly more attentive than Mr Cat would like. Each good plan has its disadvantages, but this one is corker! I wonder if Hays' office called Jack Warner on the fact that Pepe and the object of his worship were both male. After all, Betty Boop was partly responsible for the appearance of the production code. Later "conquests" were clearly and very clearly feminine. Very good cartoon, but Pepe is a character who works better as a central point than as a support. It's worth watching. Recommended.
