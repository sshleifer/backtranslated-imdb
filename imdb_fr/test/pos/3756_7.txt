I only saw this film once when it was broadcast on television, but I still remember it 15 years later, so I have to say something about it. I thought it was a smart look at schooling, friendship, intimidation, and the influence it can have on adult life. <br /> <br /> The title refers to how being good or bad at the sport can make you the least good If you are good, you will be tolerated by the cliques within the school and even later adulthood. This is happening in a private school in England, but it could be anywhere. <br /> <br /> The main character is bad at games, seeks revenge for the end of his life, which culminates in a culminating showdown on a cricket ground. I must admit that the end delighted me - it was powerful and sad.
