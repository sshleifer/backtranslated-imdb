Flowers! If this is something you will remember from this film, it will be the flowers. They occupy a place of choice and are used as tools of conspiracy. You will become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Daisy, based in Amsterdam, tells the frustrating story of the love triangle. between 1 girl and the 2 men of her life. One is a professional hitman who makes a living, the other an Interpol agent. With a pan-Asian cast (Korean, Hong Kong) and his team (director Andrew Lau from Hong Kong, a Korean writer and a Thai post-production team), I could imagine the headaches of coordination. <br /> <br /> Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit-man who found a soft spot for the painter Hye-young (played by the pretty Jeon Ji-hyun). It is love at first sight in the meadows of daisies, where his awkwardness caught his attention. However, shy and concerned about the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire it from a distance, do little (or perhaps great things) for her anonymously, but the one who takes the cake sends him daisies in pot. every day without fail at 4:15 pm He becomes his guardian angel from far away, protecting and protecting him from danger. <br /> <br /> Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She's constantly waiting for him to come, but I really wonder how difficult it can be given the almost punctual delivery of daisies. Nevertheless, she is terribly moved and touched by this single act. However, as the stars would like, the interpol detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) has a chance on Hye-young on a city square during one of his undercover missions, and he is also captivated by it. In the same way, because of his job, he doubts he will take the first step. <br /> <br /> This is where the public would find it frustrating. The lady would obviously fall for the wrong guy (again, he's the "good" guy), Park Yi being furious with Jeong Woo's pursuit, but still refuses to go out and identify himself, and Jeong Woo being the opportunistic free anonymous identity unintentionally. It's almost as if you want to give everyone a pat on the shoulders to wake them up. <br /> <br /> That said, it is precisely this tension that intrigues you. And it is terribly amusing to watch the two main male roles find it difficult to fall in love without jeopardizing their career or that of their loved one. But do not worry about action fans, there are enough cat and mouse revelations and unspoken camaraderie in the infernal affairs mold, as well as many fights, though I thought the end could have been tighter. <br /> <br /> What's great is the intelligent editing. Tell the story in a non-linear scenario (do not worry, it's not that bad, you'll still be able to follow the story) from the point of view of all the tracks, keeping you in suspense and ending up Screen divided into three parts presenting all their emotions in a single convergent event, which, in my opinion, was extremely well done. <br /> <br /> This is a magnificent film in terms of lush meadow landscapes and lively squares, with classical music to soothe the soul. As in the case of love movies, all the movies are fantastic: the girls will have a nice day with two handsome boys, while the boys will have to deal with a rather chubby face (argh! OK lah, from certain angles) Jeon Ji-hyun. <br /> <br /> If you like a romantic movie with equal balance in the action / tension department, choose Daisy. If you prefer a more conventional image, then the other Korean movie that debuts here at the same time, You are My Sunshine, would be your alternative. And yes, I completely dig the final scene, which, in my opinion, was reserved for Koreans? A little reminded me of JSA.
