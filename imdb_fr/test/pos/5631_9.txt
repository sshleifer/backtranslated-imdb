I rented this movie for two reasons. The first was all the good things I read about it. I was really impressed and I totally agree with all the reviews I read. The second reason is that I know these guys. I do not know Mark as well as Mike. It has not changed much since the years we met. I know him as the "reaper" of a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE). The way he is in this movie is really Mike at 100%. He once gave me a table he made. It was a small, about 15 "tall, that said Metallica, which is strange that she had only two legs, sometimes it's the thought that counts, and Mike always thought of others first.
