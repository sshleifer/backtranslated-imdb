It's typical of people who complain about something when they do not say anything about it ... So this is a gay man who falls in love with a heterosexual woman. First of all ... It's a true story, so you can not say it's not credible. Secondly, it was written by a gay man. The whole fact that this being is against gay is just stupid. Personally, I think it was the best love story I have ever seen. And I am very gay pro. I think this shows that true love is about the personality, not just the appearance and the sex. And that's nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi unlike so many other series. Maybe in Europe we care more, because most TVs here are a little deeper and make you think more than American TV ... Moreover, we are not afraid when it comes to show some things. <br /> <br /> If you want something fun with one of the best English (Lesley Sharp) and you want to see a decent and credible love story without too much sap it's for you. I know that I love him
