I thought this movie was good, I liked the plot, I liked the shooting scenes, apart from a few, they were not necessary and I also liked the character of Ma, she was a rider that I used to like. I must say that in this gangster film, the actors were well chosen, because sometimes, some actors simply do not fit the role. However, although I hate to say it, but I hated the end, I felt like it should have gone in a different direction. In addition, it would have been better with a little more detail, based on a true story but there were so many facts left out but other than that it was good. If you like gangster movies from the past, you'll love this movie.
