A very funny look at some current affairs and political news in Australia. Chaser's boys really seem to be having fun with this show, and what I like is that they all have their strengths. some are brilliant (Chas) to make themselves completely idiots, while Julian can pull everything "I question a famous politician and I'm about to suggest to him to disguise himself as a jar of jam" type of humor. They have great segments in the show that can hide all aspects of Australian culture, such as our current affairs, our ads and our TV shows Early Morning. Some documents are a little tired and predictable, but overall, it's a lot of fun to watch and you'll have a smile on your face.
