ccmovieman-1 must be, because the New York Times critic who preferred the Janis Joplin Big Brother album and the Holding Company to the newly released Beatles album "Blanc" was misnamed or alienated . National Velvet is an excellent film. The performance of Elizabeth Taylor is fantastic and I can not discern a trace of accent, much less. His performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly charming. The rest of the cast is superb, especially Rooney and Revere. <br /> <br /> As far as dialogue, hokey or sentimental, is concerned, I think that for too long has been eating an ironic diet and has lost the ability to discern real direct emotion and human interaction. There was a time when people thought and talked in this way. Not that this film does not hint at the magic that passes through it. This is the reason for telling the story. We could also criticize the Wizard of Oz, King Kong, the Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, The Black Stallion (the other great film about horses) or a thousand other films to have an action and a dialogue that seem more rich than real life. No my friend, National Velvet endures because of his firm belief in himself, with the tongue firmly not in the cheek. It's almost impossible to recreate something jaded filmmaker.
