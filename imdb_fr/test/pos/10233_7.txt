If you are looking for an original horror movie, this one might be right for you. It's strange and sometimes stupid, but it's a film as beautiful, original and superb sound, it never fails, except perhaps during the climax. "Nightbreed" is a must for horror fans or fans of monster movie makeup artists. <br /> <br /> Boone (Craig Sheffer) dreamed of a city called Midian full of mutant creatures. In therapy, his psychiatrist, Dr. Decker (horror director David Cronenberg), concluded that Boone was a murderer. He administered hallucinogenic pills and advised him to surrender. After being almost killed, Boone goes to the hospital, where he meets a patient with mental disorders, who also knows Midian and tells Boone where to go. Midian, located in a cemetery, is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that do not allow Boone to enter. After escaping with a nasty bite, Boone is shot by the police, which Dr. Decker led to his whereabouts. But Boone is not dead. The bite makes him live and he goes to Madian. Meanwhile, Boone's girlfriend, Lori (Anne Bobby), tries to find Boone and get to the bottom of things. When Dr. Decker also discovers this place, chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> The plot seems long and complicated, but it's really not hard to understand. The plot, among other things, makes this movie really interesting. The makeup effects are amazing. The creatures are unique and amazing and make this movie a very attractive movie. To add even more meaning, we have a lush and dynamic musical score of Danny Elfman, which goes like a glove to the movie. The plans in the movie are also set up beautifully. The cinematography is beautiful and the film creates an unalterable atmosphere. Even the acting is good, the biggest surprise being the director David Cronenberg who gives a beautiful threatening performance while the man, who for one reason or another, wants to see the death of Boone. It's weird for a horror movie to be done as well. <br /> <br /> The problems with the film ... well, there are some, but the positives outweigh the disadvantages. The script contains some lame jokes to add humor, but almost all of them fall flat. The mutant creatures look great and, for the most part, are well played, but sometimes you feel like you're putting on their gorgeous makeup for the camera. The worst part of the film should be the climax. It takes so much time and it's just constant chaos. This is the part of the film that goes from the individual characters to the pretty welded shots, the fiery outbursts of all directions and the violence of which are victims characters we do not know or do not care about anything. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is amazing to watch. It's a well done horror movie, but even with that said, there are sometimes misfits in the character's lines and a messy climax. Nevertheless, this is to be verified. <br /> <br /> My note: *** on ****. 101 minutes R for strong violence and language.
