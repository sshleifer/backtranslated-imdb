Tom Clancy uses "Alesandr Nevsky" in his book "Red Storm Rising". In the book, Nevksy was introduced in Russian theaters as a prelude to the invasion of West Germany by the Soviet Union. I felt that I needed to check. It was excellent! The cinematography was beautiful and the scenario incredible. I do not regret having watched this film and added to my collection.
