Finally!! Sandra Bullock is indeed a beautiful woman, but I finally found a film in which she becomes an actress! Forget about predictable Keanu forage from SPEED, forget the predictable Kleenex forage from While you slept - that puts it to the test! A techno-feminist role that works really well on the screen, on a subject very close to the bone. The problems raised do not seem exaggerated at all and the whole experience, helped by a nice distribution, allows to spend hours without being embarrassing. <br /> <br /> You can never go into discussion Once again, actually, I'm getting pretty nervous writing this comment ... well ... goodbye!
