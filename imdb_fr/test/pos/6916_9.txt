I really enjoyed this movie made for TV. I was surfing on a channel and I came across the beginning of the movie. Boy, I'm glad I stopped. This film has a real hot casting, as well as a semi-credible plot. There is drama, comedy, action, and best of all, it is the human nature aspect of this film that makes it great. I hope it will come out on video, because I'm going to buy a copy. Note ... 9 out of 10 stars
