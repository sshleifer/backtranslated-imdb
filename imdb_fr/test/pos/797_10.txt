Ok, I'm a big fan of Traci, so his role in the movie automatically gives him the rank of 8.5. But even beside her, I thought it was a good movie, especially because it was an HBO movie. But I'm afraid if you remove Traci from the movie, everything will be fine. But a person can not do that and she is a wonderful actress. It keeps getting better.
