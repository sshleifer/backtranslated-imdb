This is absolutely one of our favorites of 2007. <br /> <br /> The story of two boys who come from different worlds but who are as close as brothers is brilliantly told. <br /> <br /> scripted - from childhood to adulthood, it never falters. <br /> <br /> A brilliant glimpse of a lost culture and a great way to understand Farsi cultures and traditions. It is also an exceptional story in itself. It is both compassionate and moving, inspiring and filled with immense sorrow, joyful and depressing. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the excellent performance of the distribution and the great technical skills behind the camera, it's really the best film. > <br /> Highest Recommendation: a true slice of life that enhances and informs.
