Many people have tried to make a film identical to the story, Heart of Darkness. Some movies are based on Heart of Darkness, like Apocalypse Now. In 1993, Nicholas Roeg made a film that looked exactly like the book. Heart of Darkness the movie is almost exactly the same as the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. Heart of Darkness tells the story of a sailor named Marlow sailing along the Congo River to meet the very powerful ivory merchant, Mr. Kurz. <br /> <br /> The movie Heart of Darkness has exactly the same beginning and put in book. This is happening on a boat in the Thames, and Marlow tells the story to four other men on a boat called the Nellie. The whole film is a throwback from Marlow's trip to see Mr. Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlow works for the Belgian company, which negotiates ivory along the Congo River. He recounts his account in the office of the company and all the cards he saw in the office. <br /> <br /> Marlow embarks for a steamship to Africa. He arrives at the central station, where he receives the orders of the director general. The general manager speaks to Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and the ivory trade that Marlow would do. Marlow soon discovers that the general manager does not like Kurtz because he fears that Kurtz will replace him. Marlow waits at Central Station for months because his ship has been destroyed and is being repaired. Marlow sees harsh treatment and slavery in Africa at Central Station. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlow, another African character named Mfumu, and other crew members embarked on the Marlow liner for Mr. Kurtz. <br /> <br /> Along the Congo River, they are attacked by indigenous African wilderness. When Marlow's crew is attacked by African natives, they eventually shoot and kill Mfumu. When Marlow finally arrives at the Kurtz station, he meets a Russian who explains the power and fame of Kurtz. Marlow is then taken to the house of Kurtz Station. There, he sees a lot of cards and pictures that Kurtz painted. Finally, Kurtz enters the room and begins to tell Marlow everything he has done in Africa and talks about his mistress. Marlow soon discovers that Kurtz is crazy about power because Africans salute him as a god. Marlow is angry at the harshness and slavery he sees in Africa. After Marlow finally meets Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on his death bed, he called Marlow in his room. Kurtz's life begins to flash before his eyes and his last words were "The horror, the horror". When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fiance, Marlow tells him that Kurtz's last words were given to him to hide the darkness in Kurtz's life. <br /> <br /> Heart of darkness had been well realized and had been transformed into an adventurous movie. I recommend anyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and mystery. The film is slow sometimes, but overall, it's really interesting. Heart of Darkness will really expand your mind and will teach you a lot to interpret different scenes.
