Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danel with phrases such as: "Mr. Smith, you should not hold my wife like this." and "I told you not to keep the monkey at home!" The poster of this film is a strange green and Peter Lorre tells you that you will never want to go to his prison colony / island. This film is not available on DVD, although it is a classic and very rarely broadcast on television. What exactly is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why does the monkey annoy him so much? We will never know. The film must be colorized by someone and extracts must be transformed into Kinks video. The film was republished in the 1950s and only a few biographies of Peter Lorre devote any text to this film. Casablanca was just around the corner. Bogart could have been on this island but they surely did not have the budget for him
