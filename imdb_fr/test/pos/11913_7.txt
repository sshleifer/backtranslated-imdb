"Toy Soldiers" tells the story of five unsuitable boys (mainly Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton and Kieth Coogan) who were trying to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the US government jailed the leader's father. Lou Gosset Jr. plays the role of the headmaster of the school, a stubborn who tries to instill in his pupils a sense of discipline. <br /> <br /> "Toy Soldiers" is a fun and cool action, and certainly the best of the films taken hostage and in crisis at school. I think the call comes mostly from teenagers, but terrorists are not totally useless, while in some movies they never seem to be as intimidating as they should be. Trapped inside the boarding school and threatened to be killed if the army or police intervene, this is a daunting challenge for this group of guys who are planning to save the school. In fact, they are pretty smart. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that this is a very good movie. He keeps a steady pace and does not become ridiculously sentimental or anything like that. Astin and Gosset Jr. give good performances. <br /> <br /> Me too, I agree that it is an underrated action movie.
