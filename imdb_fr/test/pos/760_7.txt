I had never heard of this movie until I saw it, as I scoured the shelves of a local rental store. After watching the latest installment of Harry Potter, Rupert Grint intrigued me and I wanted to see more of his work. Reading the description on the back of "an overzealous evangelical Christian," and identifying me as an evangelical Christian, I thought, "Oooh? It should be interesting." And it was so. I found the story of Mr. Brock magnificent in words and pictures; and unfortunately, all too familiar. The contrast he has drawn between Ben's parents' interpretations of what it means to be a Christian was a poignant commentary on how Christians see themselves and the impact of this perception on their surroundings. On the one hand, Ben's mother said, "Whatever happens behind these walls, Ben, we are the ambassadors of God, we show the world a smiling face." Ben's father discusses the truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue, he says: "The more a person parades his Christianity for the sake of others, the less I am inclined to trust the claimed Christianity, God tells us that true faith is the freedom to choose the truth. Now, how do you express that, the way, the way, the means at your disposal, these things are of no consequence, be Christian or atheist, unless in your heart you are true. "If only our churches were full of Christians who attributed to this last definition of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, rather than the first. What a difference it would make! As a Christian and psychologist, I would like every day an imperfect but authentic faith, with a perfectly neat image. What a tragedy ?? to feel that I still need to play a role when, in reality, I just have to rest in the freedom to be completely what God has done to me. I think Mr. Brock gives a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom looks like in Christ. I recommend this film to anyone who wants a fresh look at faith.
