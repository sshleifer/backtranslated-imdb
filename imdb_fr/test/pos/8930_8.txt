Eighteen years as written and directed by Richard Bell may have too many stories to tell simultaneously for a 102-minute film to succeed completely, but the sense of commitment of all actors and the The film crew is such that the viewer ends up finding themselves wanting the film to work - and so it is. Yes, some aspects could have been improved if producers had more money to spend on final editing, but as a small independent Canadian film, this is a tender, slightly humorous and touching story about vulnerability , communication and commitment. It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> In a very choreographed first, we are voyeurs at a family dinner where it is obvious that something is wrong and that a father and his two sons take off in a car and have a accident in which one of the sons is killed. With an introduction like this, the desire to find his son Pip, 18 years old (Paul Anthony - who looks too old to have credibility as a teenager), is likely to abandon his family and to live in the street. He meets Clark (Clarence Sponagle), a prostitute who provides food and shelter to Pip, Jenny (the excellent Carly Pope), who saves him from a beating of his partner Derek (Ryan McDonell) and gets entangled lovingly with Pip, and Father Chris (Alan Cumming) in a very sympathetic and sympathetic priest role. This is Pip's 18th birthday and his father (Serge Houde) asks him to offer him a present from his deceased grandfather with instructions. The gift must be open for Pip's 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> Pip, but he drinks too much and anger, the tape machine token, but keeps the tape and starts listening to the words of his grandfather Jason (voice of Ian McKellen) who tells his own 18th birthday in World War II in France where he (very sensitive actor Brendan) Fletcher) has an experience with a wounded doctor named Macauley (Mark Hildreth, also superb) and is thinking about his overnight wedding with a cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill of the glory of 'Queer as Folk' and a beautiful singer and actress here), only for something to live during the war: Jason offers his help on his death, with a beautiful scene of redemption for his two men at the end. The parallels between Pip and his grandfather Jason interact each time Pip listens to the band and leads Pip to finally change his vision of life and love. The subplots include Clark's isolated existence as a crackpot being modified by Jeff (David Beazely - in a surprisingly successful first film) who just wants to be loved; by an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; by the trust that Father Chris instilled in Pip and Clark as a good shepherd: and by a backtracking on the car accident where Pip could have saved his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) from an abusive act committed by his father, just before the accident, but failed to do so, opening up his deep guilt and the resulting misplaced anger, like the experiences recorded by his grandfather. Each of these subplots is united at the end, creating a sense of closure for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of this film make it a big budget production: the musical score of Bramwell Tovey is performed by members of the Vancouver Symphony, the cinematography of Kevin Van Niekerk is judiciously atmospheric, and the overall quality of the game by this Canadian cast is very good. Although Paul Anthony manages his role well, giving a very young teenager the lead role would have greatly improved the work of the story and Richard Bell, with only another film on his CV, "Two Brothers", suggests a young talent watch. Despite its shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a film worthy of interest and deserves our full attention. Grady Harp
