Recap: Based on the true story of US Congressman Charlie Wilson, who (according to this film) played a leading role in the US secret war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Comments: A rather funny movie Things not so funny, especially since they were real. But focusing on the film, Hanks behaves very well as a mischievous, mischievous Congressman who becomes the champion of the secret war in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the whole movie, Philip Seymor Hoffman in particular, has a rather humorous tone. So much that adding comedy to the genre would be appropriate. But the story she tells, and maybe even the longest end, is really serious. <br /> <br /> A story of what happened with some questions about what could have been. So the movie works like a comedy if you want one, and much more serious if you want it. Something for everyone? 7/10
