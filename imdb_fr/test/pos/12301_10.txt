This is perhaps the most perfect film I've ever seen - as an actor, adaptation and staging. It is autonomous and of nature, so it is useless to say that it is better or worse than other great movies, but that it can be considered a perfect work of art. <br /> <br /> And it was fun to watch the confused horror fans get up and go out!
