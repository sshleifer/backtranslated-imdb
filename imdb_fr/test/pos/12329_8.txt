I have very good memories of this movie ... <br /> <br /> I was only 12 when he came out and it scared me. I really miss my bejesus ... <br /> <br /> Zombies, cemeteries, mausoleums, how can you go wrong? It's like Phantasm's delayed cousin. <br /> <br /> This film was released one year before the introduction of the PG-13 classification. <br /> <br /> I submit that One Dark Night is the most scary PG's most awesome movie, do you notice) that has ever been published. <br /> <br /> Can anyone suggest a more gorier choice? <br /> <br /> (For your information, I do not consider that Poltergeist is more gorier .. more economical, yes, but not more gorier ...)
