I really liked this one. (SPOILERS ??) There was a very good plot, the main wife of this movie is really kewl. <br /> <br /> Despite being the only one who stays alive and her lover is dead, it seemed like a lot like Ninja Scroll. Another ass movie. ;) <br /> <br /> Look at it in Japanese with subtitles. I do not know where are the idiots who have learned English, but for some reason, all the duplicates get an F in translation techniques. Subtitles are more correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Video: 9/10
