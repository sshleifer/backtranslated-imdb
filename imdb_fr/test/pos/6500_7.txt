... scratch it. Just as African has created his rhythms with the jaw of a donkey and Virgin Islanders have welded barrels of oil into steel bands pleasing to the ear, so the urban DJs have wanted to scratch in search of new methods of creative expression. "Scratch" is a senseless documentary that will take you to the heart of the hip-hop / rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl and the ultimate expression of contempo DJ / MC entertainment. The film reveals astonishingly intelligent and articulate "Scratchers", with surprisingly unique abilities in concert and competition, where rhythm meets the street. Good material for anyone interested in the base or movements of ghetto gutters in sound art. (B)
