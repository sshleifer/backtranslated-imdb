Transcendental, sophisticated, incisive, emotional, powerful ... I could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence, and I would nevertheless feel that they were insufficient. All I can really say is that this film fascinates me. Applause to Krzysztof Kieslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. May "Red" live forever.
