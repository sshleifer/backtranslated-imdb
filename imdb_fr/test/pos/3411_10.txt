A few weeks ago, I lost my dear companion and fourteen year old friend, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I came back from the animal hospital alone, after making one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter sat by my side. . .and we talked about this episode of Twilight Zone. I may be wrong, but I remember a replica of Arthur Hunnicutt, when Satan was trying to bring him to hell, but his dog could not accompany him. . and his dog, in his turn, groaned in defiance at the porter who was trying to deceive the old hunter into "taking a step inside." . that it would be "a hell of heaven if dogs were not allowed", and the old mountain man and his dog's mind decided to turn away from the door (from what they had thought was the paradise, to wander alone in eternity.) What moving moment when they meet a "good old peasant" on this eternal road, only to discover that he is an angel, sent to find them, and "of course, the dogs are admitted to heaven ". <br /> <br /> I will confess that I cried while talking about it with my daughter while we were crying the death of our beloved golden. Rod Serling was truly a genius, a voice who, in the early sixties, spoke out against racism, hatred, the "do not know anything" and was a deep inspiration for me to become a writer. This episode, which lasted forty-five years, brought a message of comfort to all those who lost a beloved friend. I urge you to get a copy the next time there is a Twilight Zone marathon or to buy it. There will be tears, but comfort too. As always, thank you Rod, for all that you have taught us. . .even now.
