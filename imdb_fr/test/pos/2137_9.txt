I feel like going around a museum. You can appreciate the great talent of the lead composer, Michael Cimino & this fabulous draftsman of light art ..Vilmos Zsigmond. As I said, it's like I'm in paradise discovering all the creation that this man can apply to one frame. Imagine when you can watch a moving image of this artist. I can say: this film is one of the best.
