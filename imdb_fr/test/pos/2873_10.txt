This horror movie is certainly one of the best I've seen in my life and there are many reasons for that. The scenario is really good, there is a lot of action and great horror footage. The actors are not very good but there is not so bad but Kane is certainly the best player in this area, but he has always been a good actor. The casting is very good. like Kane as Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal as Christine, Michael j. Pagan like Tye, Samantha Noble like Kira, etc. I must also warn you that the scenes of the killings are very disturbing, but they are very creative, but that's all the better and you can not have a horror movie without blood and bloody looking very realistic. So, I'm sure you will not be disappointed to see no harm, because it's a very good movie. So make sure you rent or buy do not see any harm because it is so fantastic. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ********** on ********** ****** ***** **** *
