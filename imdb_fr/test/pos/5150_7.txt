I appreciate the national anthem. I enjoy the national anthem, if not for nothing else, just before the Midnight News, I guess I play cymbals in the group. Not as easy as you might think! One two three four; One two three four; but then what? So I have sympathy for the bassist practicing the wonderful film of Roy Andersson, patiently waiting for him to listen to a cassette player of the 70s. <br /> <br /> The pattern of the 70s seems to continue, with some classic, without soul furniture. In addition, each scene has a delicate hint of jade that highlights the nuances of the most subtle actors. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to Jessika Lundberg's remarkable purple boots. Boots that would otherwise have inspired a Silk Cult advertising campaign. <br /> <br /> But the little difficult. Someone asked me what it was. Well, there is a scene where the opening line is "Brilliant, I do not have this length in green". Straight out of a Gary Larson box. <br /> <br /> I can not say what it is. Go see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Ron Plasma <br /> <br /> Hmm. Larson! Swedish sounds <br /> <br /> (accessed April 15, 2008)
