Screenwriter / director John Milius takes a little known incident in American history and extrapolates wildly in every way. The result is a great adventure story featuring two of his stars in memorable and larger-than-life roles: Sean Connery in the role of a clever Arab sheik with an unexplainable Scottish brogue and Brian Keith in President Theodore Roosevelt , impatient to be able to get this "big stick" wisely. <br /> <br /> Aided enormously by Billy Williams' glorious big-screen cinematography and a magnificent score of the always-trustworthy Jerry Goldsmith, this early effort seemed to herald an unparalleled talent for ranking among contemporaries Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg. Although Milius gave a glimpse of his abilities in the scenarios of JEREMIAH JOHNSON and APOCALYPSE NOW, his career seemed to take a negative turn shortly after he began to realize, he ended up drowning in the dreck as CONAN THE BARBARE and RED DAWN . <br /> <br /> Let's hope he gets his way again.
