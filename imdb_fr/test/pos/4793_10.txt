The subject of religion in Buñuel's films is a point that it is necessary to analyze with difficulty, as a film eater, as an art eater or as a person. You can see a satirical Buñuel in "The Milky Way", "An Andalusian Dog" or in "The Golden Age". Is very hard and effective in his criticism, but when you saw this and then you see a movie like "Nazarin", after seeing this work, you start to be questioned about its author. And many have wondered what seems to be a contradiction for Buñuel, but it is better not to call it that way, I think there is no contradiction in his work, but that the point of view Buñuel's religion is very diverse and unique in the movies. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film is based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdós, which tells the story of Father Nazario, who led a humble and simple life dedicated to God and helping everyone. He lived in a simple and poor region. Beatriz, an abused and abandoned woman, also lived there. She finds no sense of her life without her violent and macho man. She has a kind of repulsion towards him. On the other side is Andara, one of the prostitutes in the city. Father Nazario was stolen again, he blames Andara's cousin. Andara hears this and tries to fight without success with the priest, who does not believe in violence. That night, Andara discovers that her cousin is actually a thief, she stole her grooms. Andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences. With that, Andara seeks the mercy of the priest. Nazario decides to help him, knowing that it could be against his church, obviously, it will have consequences. From here, Nazario will be a pilgrim. Without anything, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to be with him, and be like him, serve God. <br /> <br /> If is the sweetest film of Buñuel I've seen so far, it's also the most spiritual. It is clear here that the contradiction is that, in this case, we do not see Buñuel against the power of the church, we see a Buñuel whose film talks about the church but not the typical satirical way. Anyway, I do not think that the right word is a contradiction, it's actually I find it nice and well done and despite containing such religious problems (as its "Milky Way"), I found it more like a spiritual film, but do not try to touch the Catholic religion as it may be, and laugh about it in another film. "Nazarino" is from Nazario's father and his perspective before God and the same religion, but all this is analyzed in the spiritual life of this man. <br /> <br /> The other two women are not contrast, but also very well two other perspectives of faith. We have Beatriz, the abused woman, who loses all confidence in life, first with her husband, then with a little girl who was part of her family. This little girl was very sick. Andara, the prostitute responsible for justice, was also at his side. In the family of the child, just nuns, there is great pain, but faith becomes with Father Nazario when he arrives without anything in this city. He blesses the child, a word later, she's fine. The priest wants to continue walking, but Beatriz and Andara have found faith in life and want to devote their lives to God with Father Nazario. After a few complaints, Father Nazario decides to be with them and discovers until the end what he thinks of faith, of God, of religion and of the person in need, of people who have to ask the charity to survive. This last problem must then be noted as a possible explanation of the end of the pineapple. This end, we listen to the drums (similar to the "Golden Age") and a father, Nazario, who asks questions about it, when he refuses the fruit at the first time and decides to receive it at the end. symbol of necessity or perhaps, as a response to his spiritual journey that begins to be a priest. Meanwhile, the two women must remove the father, Andara for her crime (Beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps Father Nazario in prison, then she curses the man who hit the priest in prison) and Beatriz because she prefers to be with her macho man, although he treats her badly, simply because she does not accept that she falls in love with the priest. Father Nazario - and this is perhaps the only place in the film to criticize the church, to contradict the church, the religion it serves. <br /> <br /> Father Nazario is then, it is a (sweet for many, but not for me) critic for something in religion (Father Nazario helps a woman guilty of a crime, of a sin) but especially of a single man of Buñuel on the analysis of the faith and the life, and it really understood it, with a magnificent film, tender, sweet and unforgettable, it is without any doubt one of his best. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there are any.
