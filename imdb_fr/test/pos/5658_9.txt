During the Second World War in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers starve, die, become weak and become more and more insane. A small group of soldiers, trying to stay alive, finally resorted to cannibalism. This film perfectly describes the madness that exceeds people in extreme conditions. There are some humorous passages in this film, but the majority is only a very slow and realistic film. He follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and then to death. A very interesting movie, showing the death and horror of what could have been the worst war the world has ever seen.
