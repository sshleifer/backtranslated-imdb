Family happiness crumbles when wealthy Father Ward (Michael Ontkean), rich from the beginning, becomes poor and can no longer provide for the family. Then, mother Faye (Jaclyn Smith) takes on the role of breadwinner in the family and starts working to provide for the family, while being alone periodically alone in managing family life. Not always so good, but as best as she can. Family life becomes little easier when the father learns that his son, Lionel (Joe Flanigan "Stargate Atlantis"), is gay and lives with his lover John (Joel Gretsch "The 4400"), also an old friend of the family. father tells Lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. Lionel is the one who most wanted to tell his sister Anne (Leslie Horan) during her breeding, because the family neglected her. Anne does not support the fact that their father cut the ropes with Lionel and so she runs away from home. As it was not enough, the son Greg (Brian Krause "Charmed") enlisted in the marines and was sent to war. The scenario of this film can sometimes seem a little thin, despite the realism that prevails, which makes it worthy of interest. Since this film illustrates many relationships and delicate situations, I think it is better appreciated by an adult audience, even if it does not hurt the teenagers to see it and linger before adulthood.
