River's Edge is an excellent movie, and it's a pity that it has not been better illustrated in the history of cinema. A number of difficult films based on schoolchildren were shot in the eighties, but among those I saw; it is certainly the most nihilistic and the most disturbing. The film is part of an intriguing plot and adds the theme of lazy teenagers and their indifferent attitude towards things, which propels history to another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and it is played by complex characters. The film begins with a murder. We then follow the murderer, nicknamed John, as he returns to school and tells all his friends what he did. Rather than giving the expected reaction, most of them hardly react and the strongest reaction the murderer gets comes from Layne; which makes it his number one priority to help John clean up the mess he is in and get him out of there. The other friends are thinking about the crime and one of them is coming to the police soon ... <br /> <br /> River's Edge presents a host of excellent performances from his young cast. Keanu Reeves has the reputation of being a wood actor and rightly so; but he fits very well in this first role and this performance is easily one of his best. Crispin Glover is the biggest star of Layne, slightly crazy. Glover still stands out in all the films he's filming and, although he does a little bit more, he's pretty good at being the main role in this movie. Reeves and Glover receive good support from a young and talented team including Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film presents a very grainy image that bodes well with its nihilistic tone. The main characters belong to the generation of "slackers / stoner" and the way they really do not seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and what the film tries to argue about modern society is both strong and well defined. The movie is also quite fun, because of some lines of the characters; but the humor is black as hair and this film was clearly not designed to be a comedy. All in all, this is an excellent and memorable movie that is definitely worth it!
