With Nurse Betty (2000), the famous independent filmmaker Neil LaBute (In the company of men, your friends and your neighbors) enters the big budget (Betty's $ 24 million compared to the modest $ 25,000). of society), and yet remains true to its roots. While his cast is now composed of renowned Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains as quirky and quirky as his first two feature films, proving he could be the next. big thing. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies to have been advertised to the general public for years. Given his moderate box office and critical success, moviegoers may not have been as stupid and brainwashed as we thought. The story follows (literally AND literally) a naughty waitress (Zellweger) who fell in love with a beautiful star from the show (Greg Kinnear of As Good As It Gets), but who is stuck in a marriage without love with a viscous car salesman (Aaron Eckhart, who debuted on the big screen in company). When her husband is horribly murdered by two murderers (Freeman and Rock), she is shocked and unconsciously leaves Hollywood to meet his object of affection, unaware that he is only an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she has brought contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they also take the road and cause a scandal. Fans of LaBute's previous work might find it hard to understand how it could be that same guy who led In the Company of Men - a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs playing a joke on a deaf colleague - but when you think about it, the connection is quite clear: in company, a vulnerable woman does not know that she is ruthlessly exploited. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife does not know that the man she is pursuing is convinced that her true adoration is nothing more than a joke. Some might start wondering if LaBute is really a kind of misogynist himself, considering that his recurring theme involves the fall of innocent women. But personally, I think he is defending the fair sex and treats the aggressors much harder on his pictures than the victims of abuse. One of the many charms of this film is that its absurdity is total: most directors, when manipulating a scenario like this, would leave the story to two murderers chasing a woman in pursuit of a dream. But LaBute knows it better and one of the hitmen (Freeman) also falls for Betty. It was an interesting role for Freeman, as it allowed him to play with his well-known character, "this is not the last time" (see Unforgiven, Se7en and the 1998 Hard Rain stinker); The support troupe also includes artists such as the notorious Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney and Kathleen Wilhoite of Mad About You. The screenplay, written by beginners John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is delusional and delusional (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy - or ANY film, by the way - in which a man is scalping his own dining room? ). We could say that the end is a little too perfect, but you really should not deny all that is great in the film for a simple complaint. If Nurse Betty is a sign of what LaBute has in store for you then you can bet I'll line up for what he decides to follow. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
