Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films that I have often heard about, but no copy has been obtained so far. I just watched this movie on DVD and thought it was a charming and charming movie, with wonderful animation, good storyline and great songs. If this film had been shot by Disney, it would be considered a classic. However, as it was made by a little-known and long-lost film studio, the film fell through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by Max Fleischer studios in their Miami, Florida studios and was released via Paramount Pictures. The premiere of the film was to take place on December 7, 1941, the date of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Although this probably detracted from the release of the film, it has been shown in some cinemas for a year, as evidenced by some research. The film has been described as a favorite of the family by most major American newspapers. The film continued to be re-released approximately every year, usually around holidays like Easter, at least in big cities. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, this film was reissued under a new name "Hoppity Goes to Town", named after the main character in the film. <br /> <br /> The film is a true piece of time. It captures a slice of Americana as it was at the end of the 30s and the 1940s. The animation is great and a lot of characters are very cute. The animation of the humans in the film is done through the process of the rotoscope, which means that the actors were filmed, then that the images were traced by animators, which gives to the movement a very real aspect. <br /> <br /> Fleishcher Studios were one. of several animation studios making cartoons in the 30s and 40s. While some Fleischer characters like Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman cartoons are better known, the studio's work is more or less forgotten. <br /> <br /> Almost all the work of Fleischer Studios is almost complete. are in the public domain. All Superman cartoons are in the public domain, with the exception of a series in the Color Classics series, the movie "Gulliver's Travels" is also in the public domain. This film never seems to have been released in the United States on VHS or DVD, but in Europe. However, some Internet users can very quickly produce you a copy. I recommend research.
