This film tells all there is to say about religion - I would like all bigots and future office workers to be watched. <br /> <br /> The story, set in a turn-of-the-century Danish village, is about two very religious sisters whose father was a rigid priest who discouraged all their dreams of love and love. exploration of the world and its beauty. They are now old and their life and beauty have been spent. Babette (portrayed by the charming St√©phane Audran who has so much honored the films of her husband, Claude Chabrol) is their new discreet help - they "learn" to cook. Life in the village is simple and the sad direction is a reflection of it. <br /> <br /> When Babette wins the lottery, she asks for the opportunity to prepare a feast - a real love job. The course of the holiday and its main guest reveal messages of love and spirituality and explain that there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This is a must for the devotion with which Babette prepares the party. and for the speech that the general gives at the end. Perhaps the best international film of the 1980s.
