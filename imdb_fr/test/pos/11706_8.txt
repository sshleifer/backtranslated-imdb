Crackerjack is a simple but reassuring film, where the good guys are very good and the villains very bad and where the central character is tempted by both sides. <br /> <br /> The combination of the central character played by Mick Malloy and the main executive being the local petanque clubs drew an unusually wide crowd, ranging from a large number of teenagers to a large number of seniors - and everyone laughed at the comedy. <br /> <br /> As one would expect from a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy, there was plenty of swearing, but it was not an exaggeration and the audience I sat with really enjoyed! <br /> <br /> Mick Malloy did a good job as a lazy guy who joined the petanque club (three times) just to get parking (one for himself and two for the leasing at third parties for an additional cost), but that has everything to crack when he must play or lose his membership. <br /> <br /> Judith Lucy does a good job as a local journalist / lover and there are some fabulous rewards from Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan, Lois Ramsey and many others. <br /> <br /> John Clarke plays the role of villain in the role of the villain, but is not one of his funniest but he gives a strong performance. <br /> <br /> The subtle touches of the pokies bring a serious note to this light comedy by the way. <br /> <br /> I'm sure those who liked The Castle and The Dish will also enjoy this movie. .
