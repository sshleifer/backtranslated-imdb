I remember it in the same way as the young people. When we came back from the pub, we were stumbling backwards, we spent weeks ironing each other. <br /> <br /> We called one of our friends "Zipmole Watkins" after the brilliant episode in which Daniel The Peacock has a little "makeover" on the nose of the abortionist Back Street. <br /> <br /> Many fantastic lines "Remember that at 5:30 in the morning, you can get white bread only from a brown man - it's easy man!" - Gandhi as a trader local. <br /> <br /> Tony Woodcock was definitely in the episode where they taught Ralph (Daniel Peacock) to be a bartender "It's not good, Amanda, I'll never do it as a bar man" Helen Lederer teaches him to interview people about the game "See the game last night? I thought Woodcock played well" After a series of unsuccessful conversations, the curly-haired star was sitting at the bar: "You see the game last night ? "" Yeah, I thought I played well. "<br /> <br /> We always make weird and stupid lines now -" Reg and Ralph ..... or ....... Ralph and Reg. Reg Reg Reg Reg Reg "<br /> <br /> Lots of surrealistic idiots and very surrealist Flatlets songs - The Back Street Abortionist, a personal favorite with the great end of the line -" And he will mark your 'Return To Sender' packets <br /> <br /> Good old Danny Peacock - You have added a lot to the evenings of some young drinkers , sir. <br /> <br /> ** Update - I found some episodes on tape - I'll download Gandhi's sketch on Youtube **
