Seven months after a revealing view of Faces, I finally found a commendable copy on DVD of Cassavetes' first feature film. Filmed on a set in Manhattan and in his acting studio on ad hoc sets, Shadows was the culmination of months of improvisation rehearsals, during which the actors (mainly amateurs) developed links between them, invented their characters and perfected their filmed performances are just enough of spontaneous familiarity. This intimate approach has resulted in incredibly daring work in Faces, that is, Seymour Cassel is tucking her hands into Lynn Carlin's throat to try to revive her from an overdose. Tony's post-coital evaluation of their relationship and Ben's revulsion against a black woman as a manifestation of his racial confusion and self-horror. Home-made production in the best sense of the word, unsynchronized copying and recording, granular cinematography and close-up camera installations create an immersive atmosphere that is perfectly suited to the nuanced view of Cassavetes' human relationships as a perpetual work. marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and nostalgic attempts at communication and understanding. The largely improvised jazz score of Charles Mingus is an ideal complement to the vision of the film of living of the present moment, a mantra according to which Cassavetes worked and apparently lived.
