I think it was in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the newspapers that one of the theaters was playing "Deviyan". We decided to go there just for fun without expecting anything big. But we had a good surprise. The film was shot in 1965, but even by today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and ahead of its time. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand, as a city farmer, looked and did his best. I still remember that exhilarating feeling when we came out of the movies after the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Who thought of this story about a man who falls for three very different girls at the same time? No, he does not have the time to imitate or deceive them, but he sincerely loves them for different reasons. One is simple, the other is an actress and the third is a girl from the "high society" who can also help Dev in his career as a poet. The question is which is the "One" for him. What aggravates the problem is that all three like it. When things go deadlocked, a hypnotist takes him home and, in his hypnotized state, dreams of his future with each of them and makes the right decision. <br /> <br /> This dream is the only color Playing in a film noir on white is the essence of the film, but surprisingly, it is published from most versions available to date . If you want to watch this movie, make sure this part is intact. If you watch this movie without this part and get lost, do not worry, you just watched an incomplete movie.
