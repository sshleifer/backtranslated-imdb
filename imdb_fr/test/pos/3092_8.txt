Fata Morgana is by far one of the strangest and most disconcerting art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to describe it as a documentary because, although it includes elements of documentation of its images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so vague, that I wonder if it is really useful to tell this story so that these images can exist. The film is essentially the story of the Earth and the creation of the Earth taken from the perspective of a stranger, foreign or other, indescribable and taking place in the Sahara desert. The title of the image refers to the illusion or reflection of images, real or hallucinated, that desert dwellers often see. These are also called mirages. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a plane landing followed by the plane landing, then again and again and again and again and again and again. At each landing plane, the actual architecture of the location where the landing lands and the plane itself begin to dissolve slowly and become less and less real and imaging increasingly reflective. The images in this film become more and more intense and unusual as the image progresses. The narrative of the film tells the creation of the universe as alarming sexual images of sand and landscapes pass before the camera. The plans go further and further into the desert and Herzog films everything he sees and finds. The strangest reflections of the world are visible in the distance, while Herzog meets some of the purest and most photogenic collections of viewers you can ever see. When Leonard Cohen's soundtrack enters the scene, you can be sure that you are in the world of a crazy man who is in love with the universe. <br /> <br /> I can not say much more about this film without losing anything, but I will say that it is a sobering experience and that there is really nothing like it. I like to see movies that are only classes apart. This film is certainly a good example of how Herzog likes to mix storytelling and documentary making in an interchangeable form. Unfortunately, Fata Morgana stays a bit too long, but as the end approaches, the images will probably be engraved in your mind forever. It is truly a must for those who are obsessed with nature and the origin of the universe.
