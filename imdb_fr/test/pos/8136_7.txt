No it's not an Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is the last silent film of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The end of an era! In the 1920s, Laurel & Hardy left a mark on silent movie genre with films that are still popular and are watched and broadcast regularly, today. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie is not among their best. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is good and good. The boys are teaming with a goat this time, which of course causes them trouble and hilarious situations to watch. However, it is extremely ridiculous and quite incredible to see the boys play comedy with a goat. Most movie jokes work well, but the movie is never really hilarious or memorable. Comedy and history really seem to be lacking at times and are mostly too simple and predictable. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's still fun and fun to watch for fans, but Laurel & Hardy's last silence is still slightly disappointing. 7/10
