It's the ten most energetic and entertaining movie I've seen in a long time. As a film student at NYU, where this short film has been featured several times, I salute Jim Cox for his keen sense of the style and rhythm of our generation. I'm sure I'll see her name later on the big screen. Let's hope this short film> will find a market on TV or elsewhere, so that this inspiring work can benefit from a wide distribution
