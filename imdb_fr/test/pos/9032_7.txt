A very powerful drama of the small town of Faulkner in the south of the country, which deals with the murder of an innocent black man. A striking cinematography and a good narration (via flashback) lead us through the difficult relations between the suspect and the son of his lawyer. A powerful story that precedes Sidney Poitier's racial prejudiced films. Porter Hall plays a big role as the father of the murdered man. Anecdote: The movie was shot in the hometown of Oxford, Faulkner State, with many residents used as extras.
