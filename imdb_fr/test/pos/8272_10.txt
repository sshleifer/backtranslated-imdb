I'm so happy to have recorded this on a VHS tape, while it was featured on Master Piece Theater. It's a movie that I can watch again and again. As living in the early 1800s in England is not hard enough, Prue was born with a "hare lip" and is banished from birth. The inhabitants of his village accept it somewhat, but always fear to be "the devil's forge" and do not hesitate to attack her. Especially when a lot of bad luck falls on his family. She is strong and brave, but she fears Kester Woodseaves, a traveling weaver who catches her eye. Partly because she fears rejection and also because she thinks he is so manly that he should have a woman as beautiful as a lily. Kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of time. He speaks with his mind and follows his heart. The film stays true to Mary Webb's original story and is fascinating from start to finish.
