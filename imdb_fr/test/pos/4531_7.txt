The 13th and last film of RKO Falcon begins with the mutual injunction of Tom Conway in the role of Tom Lawrence alias The Falcon and Ed Brophy in the role of Goldie of "No ladies!" as they prepare to go on vacation. While you're still wondering what they're going on vacation because they had no job since the beginning of the first movie in 1941 (Sanders in the role of Gay and Jenkins in the role of Goldie), they come across a woman and are dragged away <br /> <br /> They promise to help him in case of assassination of his uncle by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to replace the colleague by industrial diamonds by industrial diamonds . Suspect everyone here except the cops who are after Lawrence ?? and Goldie for the murder. To console herself, Goldie continues to paraphrase the travel brochures: "On the coldest days, you can always enjoy the warmth of a pleasant electric wheelchair". Some scenes of atmospheric languorous nightclubs rub shoulders with certain particularly bad behaviors of the wicked. Favorite Piece: Lawrence's imperturbable and suave game of hide-and-seek / hunt with the villains of the night train. Favorite song: the most embarrassing scene of the whole series in the alligator wrestling hut ?? definitely for the kids! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is not the best of the series but another fun outing, with a satisfying plot and many episodes, even in this one, that make me wish they would have could continue. for a few more years than Columbia with Boston Blackie, although the RKOs publish them more quickly. Absolutely no sex, not a lot of violence (in fact, not at all according to the current high standards), and no message makes this type of film anathema to the serious people who can not consider the cinema only as an art which must depend on these three pillars. <br /> <br /> Three Falcon diets were made later with John Calvert in the title role. It does not bother them, but I could never bring myself to count them in the main series, which Tom Conway had created on his side. time. Sad also that all this fell by the wayside after that for Conway, who went on television, doubled his voice and even played well at Norman Conquest in Park Plaza 605 in 1953. He also developed serious eye problems and related to alcohol? I do not know if they were related ?? eventually sinking into poverty and, after a hospital stay in 1967, was found dead in the bed of his girlfriend. For us, people who want at least, we still have his 10 entertaining Falcons, as well as several other worthy, even classic, RKO movies from 1942 to 1946, with which we remember him.
