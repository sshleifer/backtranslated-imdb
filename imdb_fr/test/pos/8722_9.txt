What an absolutely charming film. The cast is beautiful and the story is full of wit and fun. A nice movie experience all around. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, it does not make the story less enjoyable, in fact I did not want it to end. I've always been a fan of Ingrid Bergman, and I was interested to see her play a comic role. She did not let me down, Ingrid Bergman's performance as Mrs. Dickinson is fun to watch. I loved his interaction with Toni at the music store as well as his dance and his "dentist" practice. It only proves what I already knew, that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time. Goldie Hawn is also lovely to watch. Her fun, sweet and adorable Toni is the driving force of the film. You do not even wonder why she would be so worried about the wife of his wife Finacee, you just accept the fact that she's just that kind of person who would not be happy if she did not know that everyone was too. And Walter Matthau is great like Julian. His actions never create feelings of animosity for the viewer, they make him almost more enduring. There was not an unlikely character in the pack. This movie has definitely stood the test of time, I watched it last night and I think it's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you're looking for a fun and light romantic comedy, look no further.
