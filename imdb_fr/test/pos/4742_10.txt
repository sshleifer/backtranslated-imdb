Rules of Engagement is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It is well constructed, superbly assembled and provides excellent images to corroborate the claims made to it. The best quality of the film is that it does not rely on Dividing sympathy, but sheds light on the government's blatant mistakes and the lies surrounding the situation as a whole. I still have feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger about how the government handled and then concealed a tragedy of this magnitude. The cover-up is what really left me mad. It is one thing to err in one operation and to acknowledge one's guilt, but another to look at the American people in the eye and lie to them. I guess that should not surprise me with the history of our beloved country that has witnessed the JFK assassination, the Vietnam War and other important events that smell so bad that you have to hide to keep your nose every time you cross Washington DC Images of an aircraft with special heat detection technology and autopsies performed on some corpses clearly show that the FBI lies to the public. When I watch a documentary like this, I try to be aware of my point of view. In general, I only receive testimonials from a point of view. But again, this is without a doubt one of the brilliant successes of Rules of Engagement. He presents his evidence so conclusively that even if you were presented with FBI statements, how could you really believe them? I clearly remember the confrontation between the media and the Dividans, this crazy group of rebel worshipers with David Koresh, the so-called Jesus Christ born again, as their leader. None of this was really factual, but rather a story derived from pieces of facts. They simply defended the right to carry arms and practice their religion as US citizens. If you were the ATF and you wanted to search the complex, are you attacking the building with a unit of men armed with rifles and bulletproof as a means of doing it? If you are the FBI, why engage in psychological warfare and not offer a lot of negotiations to help resolve the situation? Why pour liters of harmful gas if you want to save children? Why open large holes in the compound structure when you know the possibility of lighting a fire? Why lie about not shooting with guns when it can be clearly shown on a video? Unless. Unless you want the situation to end that way. The scene at the end when the Dividian's Stars of David flag burst into the fire and the ATFs were raised soon after was an emotional climatic scene that made me shake my head with disgust and my stomach became turn uncontrollably. Filmmaker William Gazecki deserves all my congratulations. It takes a lot of courage to make a film like this and I am convinced that the government has also had a lot of impact on it. Thanks to people like him, we can show the public the real truth rather than the shit filtered by a media that presents information that is hardly considered authentic. When I think back to what I felt at the time about the Dividens because of David Koresh's portrayal in the media and how I felt after watching this film, it's really amazing. It reminds me of the Bible line of a man who was healed by Jesus and the elders asked how it had been "before I was blind, but now I can see," he repeated to them without stops. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You may have to search, but it's really something special.
