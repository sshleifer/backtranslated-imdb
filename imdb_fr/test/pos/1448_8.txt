Frank Sinatra took this role, chewed it with the rest of the landscape and spit it out in his own way. TMWTGA is scenic, the end is banal, some scenes need a little more retouching, but that's it. It's great entertainment from start to finish, and as you watch it, you realize that Sinatra, the long-dead MOR crooner, had junkies, gangster card games and all the stuff urban turmoil of the United States in the blood. acting coach. There are all kinds of directors' keys to have fun, and the (undated) soundtrack is fully cooked. The marathon card game beat Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc. forty years old! So it was not faithful to the book? Which movie is? And I can not imagine anyone remembering if Brando was dropped on it; the scenes of cold turkey would have been embarrassing, instead of being pissed off, convincing and moving with Sinatra. No one else mentioned the squalid, lazy and cynical cops - absolutely to die! And Eleanor Parker would have led me to hit.
