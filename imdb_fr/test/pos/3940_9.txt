Exclusively for Coop lovers, although Clint Eastwood is very strong but its discreet presence is a major asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him in his childhood, in his youth, in his family, with friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc.), as an old man, finally as a sick man and close to death. After the "end," I did not feel I knew the man better. But I had a great time reliving many of the best moments of his films; and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional has been increased tenfold. The film shows, in a very interesting way, how Cooper's career can be compared with the evolution of American society before and after the Second World War. Two of the highlights are when Cooper must respond to justice regarding communism in the world of cinema; and when James Stewart (a very big one too) received an award for Cooper a month before his death. I'm not a pan in tears, but ... it was a pan close! Look at it, if you can: it's well worth it. ... If you like Cooper, that's it. Or an older America ...
