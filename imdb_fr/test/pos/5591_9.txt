This story of the troubles caused by an overly possessive, overwhelming, domineering and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two grown sons and daughters is a powerful vehicle of Irene Dunn's (the new girl's) remarkable performance. law), Joel McCrea (son number one), Eric Linden (son number two) and Frances Dee (son's fianc√© number two). Here is the spectacle of the pure tyranny of jealousy and the possessiveness of the mother, which loses all meaning when four quality people find their lives damaged, their projects changed and their own identity at risk. Irene Dunn is remarkable in her role. Joel McCrea's performance is open and clear and Laura Hope Crews demonstrates mastery as a mother. <br /> <br /> Yet this review finds the best performance of Frances Dee. This is the first character in the story to show the strength of his inner feelings. His portrayal in his torn engagement scene is heartbreaking and even raw. Dee pulls the viewer around you and takes you in his pain without even showing his face! <br /> <br /> Frances Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has been neglected for too long and is now almost forgotten as a magnificent actress she was. No actress who started in the movies after the Second World War had anything to talk to Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see The Silver Cord, which has never been broadcast on TV, you will see this "old-fashioned living room drama" is a remarkable film that stands out very well 74 years after its release in 1933 because it is filled with superb performance.
