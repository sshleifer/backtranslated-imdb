Soul's Midnight is performed by Armande Assante (Simon) in "The Mambo Kings" and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Beside Lucila Sola (Iris), a sexy vampire, Simon drives Alicia and her husband Charles into the dark realm of Soul's Midnight. Assante incorporates her fangs into the screenplay written by writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you love watching him and Iris kill. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) try to stay alive while Gore satiates you with blood. <br /> <br /> (spoiler alert) In today's upset landscape, it is not surprising that a preacher stabbed in the back is bitten. Set seems cool ?? lots of details at Hotel Borgo and cool special effects at the end. I had a lot of fun watching this movie ?? he does not take himself too seriously and looks great.
