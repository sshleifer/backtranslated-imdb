I caught this little gem totally by accident in 1980 or 1981. I was in a renaissance theater to see two old idiot sci-fi movies. The room was packed and (without warning) they showed a bunch of short sci-fi parodies (to get us in the mood). Most of them were a little fun, but this started and in a few seconds the audience was in a state of nervous breakdown! The biggest laugh came when they showed "Princess Laia" with huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head. She looks at the camera, smiles sadly and nods. It made it even more fun! You must see "Chewabacca" played by what looks like a Muppet! It was extremely stupid and stupid ... but I could not help but laugh. Most of the dialogues were drowned because of laughter. Moreover, if you know "Star Wars", it's even more funny: they deliberately make fun of certain dialogues. It works REALLY with an audience! A certain 10!
