I really liked this movie ... but the commercials I saw suggested, and a magazine actually published, that this movie "has a light touch". This seems to me very misleading. <br /> <br /> The humor is indeed very rich: an eccentric humor, not very subtle, sometimes a bit crooked: the kind of humor that I generally very attractive. But most of the humor is one that appears conscious at all times of things very serious, deeply sensitive, even deeply painful. The film combines the themes of past and present, perception and truth, memory and activity, life and death. The entire film is steeped in the history of European anti-Semitism in general and the Holocaust in particular. <br /> <br /> How to combine humor and horror in the same movie? The review I saw suggests that humor is absurd. I do not think that's the case at all. at least not in common sense. Instead, I think this film is in the tradition of Jewish / Yiddish literature and theater. I do not claim to be an expert in this field; but from what I have seen, humor is used, in this cultural context, both as a tool of adaptation to the horribly tragic experiences of this people; and also humor is used as a means of "recovering the Divine" for men and women who choose a path of faith rather than a path of despair or absurdism. See "The Fiddler on the Roof" for humor used in both directions in this rich tradition. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Jonathon) Wood wears horn-rimmed glasses that make it really strange: Compare Sin City when wearing the same kind of chilling glasses. In this film, it's easy to see how glasses become a metaphor for both his research and his struggle between perception and truth. Eugene Hutz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Old Alex) are really wonderful. Jonathon and Young Alex belong to the same generation and seem very, very different. and then find that they are not so different after all. And the way in which the apparent narrative voice is gradually changing from Jonathon's voice to Young Alex's ... when a discovery trip planned for Jonathon becomes a discovery for young Alex and old Alex ... moves me so much. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful scenes and panoramas of Prague and its surroundings (I am told) replacing Ukraine with the narrative thread. Everything feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place; Although I have never been to Ukraine and can hardly bear witness to this personal experience. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you are looking for a light comedy, I would not recommend this movie at all. . On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, delicious and deeply moving movie, watch this wonderful movie.
