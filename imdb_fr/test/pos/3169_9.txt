For me, the Storm and its characters (I mean those who are admirable) look like old friends. Since I started experimenting with acting in theater classes (I played Ferdinand), I immediately found myself caught up in the fantasy world created by Shakespeare. I remember very well that a student had finally decided not to play Ferdinand. So I spoke and I had the honor to play against an excellent Miranda. <br /> <br /> One of the virtues of a great friend is the fact that you can never know them completely - there is always something to discover about their character. A film production of the Tempest of quality is therefore like a visit to an old friend, dear to his heart: each visit presents a new perspective on the memory of the work we had. With Prospero's Books, the emphasis has been on the ritual and elegance of the play, the exuberant celebration of art in art. Here we see a vision of esoteric mysticism, with interiors designed with love and filled with candles and chalk patterns on the floors, more Aleister Crowley than the noble of Naples. It also prompted me to reconsider my decision: why was Prospero expelled from Naples? His magical power is so palpable in this production that one wonders whether it is politics that has condemned Prospero to exile, but the fact that he is different from others. So, in the real world, he suffered. Was driven out, helpless to change the evil right. All the villains in this room, whether they realize it or not, act in accordance with the creation of a more painful and inflamed world - it is always in the interest of the oppressor to make life on Earth closer to hell. But Prospero succeeds in bringing these wicked villains to his island, the kingdom where he exercises (absolute) domination. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare brings his audience to the theater, the realm where Shakespeare dictates events, words, results. Shakespeare is of course Prospero - but the adaptation of this film that actually honors the text is intended to make Prospero as likable as the man of reason, even if he is surrounded by what society calls the irrational ( astrological texts, alchemical symbols, etc.). magic schemes, etc.). Is it more rational to be a man of cloth and murder, or to be a heretic and to work to redress wrongs? Prospero IS a heretic, because he gives up his magic, it's not because the books will lose their value in Naples, but because they are no longer needed - the world itself - has become the magic of books . <br /> <br /> In Hamlet, Hamlet presents a play to his peers. The play accuses his fellow conspirators against others for their own advancement. The reaction of the public varies: while Ophelia is perplexed, Claudius reacts in shock. It happens in the room, then Shakespeare plays this piece for the men of his time. Did Shakespeare watch their reactions? In the storm, Prospero saw the room he built and we live with him. How do we react? Do you react with a simple pleasure to the happy ending? Are you upset and shocked by the strangeness of this production, which is perfect considering the source material? Do you feel sad to see that this little life, the play, is surrounded by a sleep as transitory as eternal? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for the life of humanity on Earth, but man is weak and does not want to achieve it in favor of small power struggles. We have Claudiuses. <br /> <br /> Like a good friend, this movie is not without flaws. I do not agree with the choice to paint some scenes entirely in blue. The dancing of the sailors is rather tangential. But deep down, it's really the Storm, and one of its many faces.
