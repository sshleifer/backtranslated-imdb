Tim Burton, the man behind the original movie Batman and Beetlejuice, brings to the world the sequel to Batman, which outperforms the original in many ways. First, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are an excellent mix of Batman enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman turns heads in history and the penguin works the same way the jester worked in the original. The decorations are superb and impeccable. Gotham City has so many dark alleys that you can never know what's going on at one time or another. The only thing that gives him a bad reputation is his script, which sometimes seems to become outdated and not recover for a while. Tim Burtons stages superhero movies in a new realm. Beat all Superman movies and other Batman movies by mile. Although, in terms of achievement, the new Batman begins to look lacking, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.
