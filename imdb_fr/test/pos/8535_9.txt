Honestly, I did not think at the beginning that this movie would make me laugh in hell and admire the super gore effects, I was wrong! From beginning to end, the film showed stunning gory effects accompanied by parodies of other titles such as "Evil Dead" and "Gremlins". This film could be compared to Peter Jackson's works of art, although this film is not as bloody as "Braindead", but I'm waiting for these guys to make another splashing film.
