I loved this film! It is therefore worthwhile to run for a long time. I need help with the end though .... <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The last shot of Marie at the end - Is it to suggest that she's still looking for Renaud? or maybe it was she who wanted to reinvigorate the 13th? (She seemed to be the one who handed the initial letter to Colin in the first place) I do not quite understand, but I know that I really liked it. So, if anyone saw this and remembers it or just saw it, please specify the end. <br /> <br /> Thank you
