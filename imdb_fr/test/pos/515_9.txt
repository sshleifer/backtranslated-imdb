Now, here is a movie that does something that has not been done in a long time. It takes a dozen different elements that we already know (vampires, martial arts, techno rhythm, exceptional special effects, etc.) and transforms it into something new. In what could have been simply a combination of "Mortal Kombat" and "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer", Wesley Snipes (none of my favorites since and mostly because of "Passenger 57") gives a very good trick as half-human / half leech. He recognizes the internal conflict, but does not dwell on it more than necessary. He makes Blade a character as deep as Batman was created by Michael Keaton. <br /> <br /> I'll say that the only part of the film that made me a little angry was the ever-present horror movie clich√© of this person. The hero knows by chance who knows exactly how to stop the bad guy. On the other hand, you have to sort of have it in a film like this, so it's easy to excuse. <br /> <br /> Well, Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff, excited about the premieres, is a nasty villain for Snipes hero. He has class, presence and enough control in his little finger to teach Al Pacino how to mitigate it a little. Who would have ever thought that a cartoon movie would be a stepping stone for an actor? I sincerely hope that is the case. And whoa! Where the hell did Kris Kristofferson find his acting talent? Do not get me wrong, but the prolific actor has not done anything memorable since "Millennium" and how many of us have watched this just because of the cool video box? Well, here he is in a very Obi-Danish twist, as a mentor and father figure of Blade. And good job too. <br /> <br /> The quality of the game is doubled by the quality of the choreography and special effects. Accompanied by a thrilling techno beat, battle scenes quickly recall and banish the memories of Mortal Kombat. Hey! There was also a script! I wondered what had happened to all the good writers who were there. <br /> <br /> The two main signs that told me to have seen a quality movie were these; I had no feeling of remorse at the thought of paying the high price to enter, like any Schumacher "Batman", "The Avengers", "MK: Annihilation", "Godzilla" or "Armageddon". (wow, how many of these films have been released this year?) Ugh) Also, I look forward to the inevitable sequel of the film. Let's hope they do as good a job as with the first one. <br /> <br />
