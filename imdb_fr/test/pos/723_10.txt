Most of the time, in the alleys of Toronto, NG proposes a dark and mysterious journey that plunges the viewer into the mind of a young man and a young woman (Vern and Sarah) fascinated by riddles and by an incident disastrous in their past. Beautiful dialogues and a leading cast propel this discreet key into the search for meaning behind the word puzzles that continue to appear in his life. Helped by her, all but enthusiastic friends, they reach the end of their quest, but with a price to pay. The film never intends to answer all its mysteries, but does a great job in exposing many twists and turns.
