This first Warner Brothers talkie, "The Son of the Gods" (1930), deals with the racial intolerance manifested by Anglo-Saxon Americans towards the Chinese. Americans of Chinese origin are treated as second-class citizens, and whites despise them only by contempt. <br /> <br /> Prolific screenwriter Bradley King based his screenplay on the Rex Beach novel about an impressionable young Chinese, Sam Lee Barthelmess of "Only Angels Have Wings"), who experiences racial prejudices when the girls that his comrades bring him for a party reveal their racist feelings towards Sam once they discover his legacy. Sam goes to his father, Lee Ying (E. Alyn Warren from "Gone With The Wind"), a wealthy Chinese man with offices not only in New York but also in San Francisco. Sam feels deeply hurt by racial insults and he wants to leave New York and go where he can not be hurt by the Americans. His patient father warns him that racism is part of everyday life and that tolerance is the only solution. Sam has not learned this lesson yet. He refuses to take more money from his father and embarks to London to peel potatoes while he is on board. <br /> <br /> During his trip, he meets a British playwright, Bathurst (Claude King of "Arrowsmith"), who needs help writing a play about the Chinese. Sam and he become friends and Sam provides him with cultural information about Asians. While they are resting in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett of "Two-Faced Woman"), who falls head over heels in love with him. It seems that Allana and her wealthy father go on vacation to the same motel. Everyone at the motel knows that Sam is a Chinese, with the exception of Allana. Sensitive about her racial heritage, Sam holds Allana at arm's length until she is convinced that nothing could change her mind. They fall head over heels in love together. Allana's father drops the bomb on her when he reveals that Sam is a Chinese and that all the memories of San Francisco life and the management of coolies flood Allana's mind. She burst into the motel's dining room and shoots Sam with a whip in front of a room full of spectators. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. He thought Allana loved her but not her. Around the same time, Sam's father Lee Ying fell tragically ill. Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn of "Iron Man"), Ying's secretary, sends a telegram to Sam about Ying's illness. As expected, Sam returns home to New York to be with his father. Since his public humiliation, Sam has sworn to show no kindness to Anglo-Saxon Americans. Eileen is an Irish Catholic and probably one of her few white friends. Lee Ying dies and Sam assumes control of the business. He practices his anti-white racism until he learns that he is an Anglo-Saxon child that a San Francisco cop has given to Lee Ying and his wife to bring him. The cop forgot him until two types of white and busy social workers wanted to remove Sam from the Ying. Sam learns this revelation at about the same time that Allana arrives in New York and gets sick. During her illness, she pronounces her name several times during her sleep and her devoted father goes to see Sam and asks him to visit him to help him recover. Unbeknownst to Allana, Sam visits her and she gets better, but she has no memory of her visit, just a fuzzy notion. Finally, Allana learns the truth about Sam not being a Chinese and marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> This citizen socially aware of Warner Brothers / First National Pictures Release is frankly opposed to the racial issue for the first time. About an hour before the revelation that no Chinese blood runs through his veins, Sam surprises him as well as the public. The reconciliation between Allana and Sam stretches his credibility, despite his declared immortal love. However, in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negativity that preceded it, they find themselves in each other's arms. <br /> <br /> Capitulation on the racial problem with the revelation that Sam is not The Chinese damage some of the moral power of the film. Incredibly, "Son of the Gods" is a pre-code movie that seems almost prude; For example, Sam is an American, not a Chinese! Constance Bennett gives a wonderful performance as a petulant and she holds your attention when she whips Sam with his whip. Claude King is good like Bathurst and E. Alyn Warren is convincing like Lee Ying. Interestingly, Warren has portrayed Asian characters as a career. Richard Barthelmess is impeccable like Sam; it offers a very nuanced performance. Despite his age, "The Son of the Gods" is the son of a good movie!
