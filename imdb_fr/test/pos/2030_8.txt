Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolizes a rock star to the point of knowing all his songs, to imitate him to perfection and to dress like him. When given the opportunity to take over the role of his "idol" in the group, he jumps on the occasion. However, the role of a rock star may not be what he is supposed to be ... and relationships may change ... This film certainly struck me because the theme of what you are doing may not be what you think it is. once you get it. Overall, it is a very good movie with excellent performances by the actors, as well as the two main actors, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston. It hurt me, especially when Emily (Jennifer Aniston) met Chris in Seattle and saw the depths of what he had sunk. If anyone has ever dreamed of becoming a rock star or a groupie, he should watch this film to see that his way of life, although glamorous for a moment, is very lonely and that it is not ultimately about what you might want.
