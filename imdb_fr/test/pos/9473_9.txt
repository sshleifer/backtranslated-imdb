I just took my 11-year-old daughter and my 8-year-old son to this movie and I do not remember a movie where I laughed so much - literally aloud, big laughter because this movie is hilarious. While the scenario is predictable, but the ride is extremely enjoyable, no matter you know how it will end. The comical sense of timing of the actors was impeccable. The actors were perfectly molded. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the actresses who do not ruin their lives. She is so refreshing. My kids said it was now their favorite movie in 2006. Our money was well spent on this movie.
