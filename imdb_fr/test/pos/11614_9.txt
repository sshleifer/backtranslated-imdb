The art masterpiece / gore of Karim Hussain - this cat is really a talent to look for. Here we have several longer vignettes interspersed with shorter sequences. It is a very powerful film that relies on intense graphic imagery and symbolism and is not intended for all viewers. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a short film called OVARIAN EYEBALL. Very short segment in which a naked woman is posed naked on a table. An invisible hand of the woman covers the face of the woman lying down with a red rag and makes an incision in her abdomen from which an eyeball stem is extracted. I have nothing else to comment on this one because of its brevity. <br /> <br /> HUMAN LARVAE is one of the pioneers of the film and it is a flawless portrait of a perverse act committed by a troubled man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister. It's one of those things like "you have to be seen to be believed". I will say that this movie has some of the best effects I have seen in an independent horror movie, but the subject treated will make it an undeniably unpleasant experience for most (not me though - I live for that!). <Br /> <br /> REBIRTH could have been cut from this film all together. This is the weakest segment of the film and there is a group of naked people looking for bloody holes in a field and all the rest. Very short but that kind of breath blows the film. <br /> <br /> THE RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM is one of the most secular representations of religious imagery I have ever seen and kicks ass. Think "P iss Christ" or menstrual blood paintings of the Virgin Mary. Very hard sexual / sexually violent / bloody images are presented in this document and are certainly not for those who will feel offended by sacrilege. <br /> <br /> Subconscious Cruelty is one of the best movies I've seen so far. Extreme horror banner, this movie will divide many horror fans and movie audiences in general. Some will call it garbage, others will call it awesome. I do not see much common ground. I thought this movie was pretty original and I will recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it. 9/10.
