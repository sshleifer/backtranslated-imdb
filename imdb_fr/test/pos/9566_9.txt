This film is not a comedy, it's a presentation. I've always hated canine shows, given the ridiculous encounters people have with their dogs and the idiotic names they give them. Hence the reason for my uncontrolled heckling watching this movie. I enjoy something that is taken very seriously, even if the gains are minimal and insignificant. It's like miniature golf, jump rope championships or the need to set an obscure world record. The acting was much more refined in this film than Waiting for Guffman, and this is mainly due to the greater fluidity of the characters, who seem more comfortable than their partners in this film. Eugene Levy was great, as were Michael McKean and Fred Willard. However, it was the dogs that finally stole the show. But again, who wants to see a group of humans in a movie about dogs anyway.
