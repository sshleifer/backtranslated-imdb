You can not see the same movie if you have not grown up in France (or have spent at least 10 years, like me). I do not know if this will ever succeed outside French cultural borders (here I include Belgium and Luxembourg). You can not translate that kind of fun - every name is a joke (how many people outside of Paris would understand the word game in "Couloirdebus", the name of a Roman legionnaire?) However Monica Bel (l?) Ucci is so beautiful, I almost forgot to breathe when I saw it.
