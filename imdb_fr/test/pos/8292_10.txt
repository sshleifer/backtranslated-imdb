I have long enjoyed this film. I had not seen it in a while, so I checked again and found it even more enjoyable now. When I was young, I loved the cartoon Chipmunk. So, naturally, I loved the adventure of the chipmunks. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not see any better plot for this movie. It's not very creative, but I have always wanted to travel all over the world and I have so much fun watching it that my desire to travel is growing even more. The party with Elenore singing for the little penguin always makes me cry ... <br /> <br /> "The chipmunk adventure" will be my favorite forever, I'm sure. I guess it's because I saw it when I was so young. I do not think it would have a big impact on someone older who would see him for the first time. (Unless of course they have a young heart)
