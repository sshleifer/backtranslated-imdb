I recently rented this video after seeing "Final Ascent" by the same author. I was not prepared for the intensity of this film. I found it endearing from start to finish and encouraged teens to flee their crime attempt. The end was certainly troubling with some of the violence involved, but well done. I highly recommend this picture.
