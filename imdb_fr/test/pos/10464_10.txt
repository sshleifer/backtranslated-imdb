This film embodies the soul of the modern "food culture", even though he is 17 years old. The basic premise in the movie is: food is more than a nutrient. It is also a powerful symbol and a support for the culture itself. The main characters literally get drunk on the best wine and food, inspired by idealistic thoughts and culture, abandoning their puritanism and table manners that deny all passion. Karen Blixens' short story takes advantage of the difference between Northern and Southern Europe to emphasize their fundamentally different approaches to nutrition. As the strict and rather monotonous Scandinavians mingle with "Eros" from the south, the party begins. So what are you waiting for? Go look at it ..... again!
