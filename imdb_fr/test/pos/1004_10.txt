Can you capture the moment? When do we hear rain for the first time on a roof? Some things exceed the sum of their parts, expressing the poetry of life. The things that matter. <br /> <br /> The poet Dylan Thomas has captured the seemingly inexpressible "A good poem helps to ... expand the knowledge of each, of himself and the world around him." (Bob Dylan was named after him). So why did it take so long to make a movie of the great Dylan Thomas? A simple biopic could have missed the point. Writer Sharman Macdonald has taken a different and better approach. <br /> <br /> In The Edge of Love, she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill poems so we can swim. The life of four friends. Dylan, who covets and loves to the maximum. Caitlin (Sienna Miller), his energetic support. War hero William (Cillian Murphy), who saves him from a fight in the street. And then there is his childhood love. Vera. Dear Vera. A breathtaking Vera. She is Caitlin's closest friend. William's wife. And, like a muse, the "star" in the dark sky of Dylan. <br /> <br /> It all starts in the 1940 London Blitz, with bomb shelters in the subway. Enter Vera (an impressive Keira Knightley) under a spotlight. She meets Dylan for the first time in years, her heart is red. Their eyes shine in the smoke of the room. The purity of their old passion. Dylan (Matthew Rhys, Welsh speaker) is not a sanctified and sanitized poet. Master of his vices, he must live them all to the full. He introduces his beloved wife and then continues to woo Vera. <br /> <br /> The Edge of Love is a visual treat. The soundtrack lets you want more. The performances are perhaps the best of these actors in their career. As a lush love story, it's pretty good. To understand Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, not bad at all. And as a tribute to a great inspiring man. <br /> <br /> Production has focused on projecting the spirit of Dylan Thomas without compromising historical accuracy. Dramatic tension implies an attraction between artistic freedom and conventional morality. Audiences looking for an experience based on it can be disappointed. And it will play less well to an audience whose limits are those of Albert Square. <br /> <br /> Sharman Macdonald seemed to be aware of the stubborn nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer Rebekah Gilbertson (granddaughter of the real). William and Vera). "Think about all the things you do not want me to write about," she says, "because I have to have carte blanche." For Macdonald, the limits were if she were to offend Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, the limits are those that the wife and family could impose on them. A woman will not let great ideals interfere with practical problems of common sense and will even put the interests of her children ahead of her own (this sometimes happens on the other side, as when the genius genius Virginia Woolf refused to let Leonard love earth - at the hours). <br /> <br /> Despite the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women become close friends. This is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film tell a story in themselves. In England, Caitlin and Vera, a dull city in war, are the highlights of an ocean of gray. Shortly after meeting Vera's illuminated stage character, we meet Caitlin through her burning blue eyes, sparkling in a darkened railroad car. Her spectacular red coat crosses the streets with colorless homogeneity and triumphs in a beautiful staircase as she meets with Dylan. But the red luminosity of Vera's lipstick is less durable. For her, marriage is the best choice, even if she has a sincere love for her husband. <br /> <br /> An exceptional cinematography consists of using montage to juxtapose images, like juxtaposing unrelated words to create more meaning. The horrific scenes of war in Thessaly are interspersed with screams of Vera during pregnancy. Give birth or is it an abortion? We are not told right away. The pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to the present day. <br /> <br /> The constant echoes of Dylan's poetry throughout the film take us beyond earthly opposites. It reminds me of Marlon Brando reading TS Eliot in Apocalypse Now. A light beyond the horrors of the world. Another way of seeing things. "I'll take you back to a time when no bombs would have fallen from the sky and nobody would ever be dead," Dylan told Vera as they walked along the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin remembers her childhood with Vera: "We are still innocent in Dylan," she says. <br /> <br /> It's time to leave your panties at home or share a universal cigarette. (Not literally, maybe.) A time to be inspired. Enjoy what is probably the best British film of the year.
