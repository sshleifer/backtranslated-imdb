SPOILERS BELOW <br /> <br /> "The life of a dog" was particularly noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In his other 1918 film Charlie Chaplin's "Shoulder Arms," ​​the genius of the silent film focuses on a totally different brand of humor. His comedy of war is specialized in surrealist and exaggerated sets in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker is flooded, the water level reaches the ideal height for Chaplin to execute his gags with the greatest success. In a later scene, the soldier disguises himself as a tree, a disguise that disguises Chaplin's ingenuity and lack of meaning. Naturally, when the enemy discovers his trick, the soldier rushes straight to the forest. The ensuing chase is a visual marvel: not only does Chaplin hide the soldier from the Germans, but he uses the forest to hide the soldier from the audience, so that the camouflaged soldier remains clear in the middle of the frame, while remaining invisible. All the while we thought our little hero was shooting fast at the German army. for our greatest pleasure, the joke is on us too. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
