I saw this televised version of a mysterious Christie story when it was broadcast on Channel 5 in New York in 1980. At the time, I was surprised not to have seen it on Channel 13, the public television channel, which broadcast most of the Masterpiece Theater. programs but (aside from some Dorothy Sayers "Lord Peter Wimsey" and THE MOONSTONE stores), BBC productions seldom deal with crime novels. Another series, THE RIVALS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, which dealt with stories in the Victorian and Edwardian era, was seduced by the charm of this era for the broadcast of these stories on Channel 13. <br /> ASK In EVANS? A young couple fell on a dying man whose last words are the question of the title of the story (the novel was originally called "Why did not he ask EVANS?"), But he subsequently renamed "BOOMERANG INDEX"). The young couple begins to investigate the murder and links the crime to a group of people surrounding a questionable doctor (Eric Porter). Despite the warnings of the father of the hero (John Gielgud), the hero (James Warwick) and the heroine (Francesca Annis) continue their investigation, even if it becomes darker and more dangerous. The death of another suspect by suicide increases the apparent dangers as the killer begins to seek to silence the two amateur detectives. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie, although I agree that it was a little too long for one night entertainment (if it had been done as later episodes Miss Marple with Joan Hickson, or episodes of Hercule Poirot, in two parts, it would have been better). But he has his strengths. One concerns the proper use of Porter as the main suspect and a clever scene later in the film where he appears to spy on the young couple investigating the mystery. If you stick to the movie, you'll have a nice surprise later. <br /> <br /> But one is missing. When it comes to a Christie novel, the characters in the story must be in a rigid movement program so that the reader can understand the secret of the plot. I will only add that if you hear the dialogue at some point, and how a little boy was almost killed (but was not), then you will see all the parts of the story come to an end and what are the motivations of the villain. <br /> Except for this and the time the TV movie takes to tell its story, it's a very good movie, worthy of the best programs based on Christie's story at a time when their life was suddenly reborn in movies based on his novels.
