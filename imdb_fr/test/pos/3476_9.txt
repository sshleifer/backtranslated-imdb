Okay. You saw the movie and I saw the movie. True? Otherwise, the abstracts of the plot are numerous and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on my weak attempts to create another one. <br /> <br /> The most stunning aspect of the film is without question. the performances of the two young men and the young woman in mind. Their emotional honesty was as convincing, if not more, than all the performances I've seen in recent months. I found that I laughed, cried and huddled with them, and that says a lot because I am often called a jaded and cynical idiot. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, the story is full of clich√©s and I guess it's the Achilles heel of the photo. It's a story we've all seen many times before; we all know how it ends when they introduce Rory. Although you may not know the exact mechanics, you know there will be a transformative friendship, a bittersweet love story and a heartbreaking conclusion. Without casting and directing, this film would be nothing more than the soporific wave that accounts for eighty percent of Hallmark Channel programming.
