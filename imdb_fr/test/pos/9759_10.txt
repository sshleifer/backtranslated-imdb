Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan are all unlikely heroes and survivors. A small but strong John whose strength and determination helps save lives, walking for hundreds of miles and with self-discipline and persuasive powers, Joe Harman ("oh my word") who took risks for John and the other prisoners, only to suffer the worst pain imaginable, and NoÃ«l Strahan, who trusted Jean without worrying about the odds. Her good humor and robustness inspire everyone around her and those who have the courage to accompany her are rewarded. The beauty of the landscapes and the musical score add to the adventure. Despite the length, it never bored me. These ordinary people have done extraordinary things and this is based on a true story. Someone borrowed my VHS a few years ago and I have never seen it before. Learned my lesson, friends, and will buy another copy when it can be found. It's a shame that the miniseries is not on DVD.
