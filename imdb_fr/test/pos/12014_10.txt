The film Night Crossing tells the feelings felt by the vast majority of East Germans during the period 1961-1989. I lived in West Berlin for most of 1967 and crossed the wall to East Berlin every week. Why? Excitement, crossing a border into a country under Soviet rule, feeling the smells and feel of East Germany, that's why Night Crossing is excellent, it captures that feeling and it's exciting. I was stopped by the Vopos at Checkpoint Charlie and accosted by a man wearing his leather coat and dark glasses, which led me to believe that it was Stasi. When I watch the movie, I smell diesel and cooking oil cheap, I can see obsolete vehicles, dull clothes worn by the public and poor products in shop windows. It reminds me of the realization of my chance to live in a free country. In 1988, I visited the DDR from east to west, from north to south. East Germany has changed little since 1967. The Trabants, which kept breaking down, remained the main mode of motorized private transport, the shops still did not have much to tempt me, the uniforms were still commonplace, but people, ordinary people were open well once you gained their trust. Look at Night Crossing, it's as close to the truth as any film you'll see on divided Germany, even closer than two other favorites, The Spies Out of the Cold and the Berlin Funeral.
