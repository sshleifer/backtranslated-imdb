In my opinion, "The Patriot" is one of Steven Seagal's best films. <br /> <br /> I heard it was the worst movie of all time, it's not like SS, etc. I do not agree. As a highly spiritual person, a great Seagal master has established a good tradition in action movies. He always has a good track record, great action, great professionalism and a smart message. This film has everything. You have good shooting scenes, excellent aikido. Although there are not many, he shows us his peaceful side. This movie change only proves his spiritual growth (he does not kill Chisolm's friend at the end). <br /> <br /> "The Patriot" is certainly one of the best films from the point of view of the "filmmaker" of sight that I saw recently. You have great panoramic photos of Montana, we see a real American nature and a beautiful fauna (among others - horses and flowers). The soundtrack also deserves a few words. During the film, I had the opportunity to listen to American-cowboy-western (but not Country) classical music. Similar music was heard in "Back to the Future Prt.3". The acting of SS has greatly improved since his last films. His role is unfamiliar to him (unlike cops and commandos), but he does a good job playing with the retired government doctor. His game is convincing and his lines are good. <br /> <br /> I was really pleased with the casting. LQ Jones proves that life and death walk together on Earth. Whitney Yellow Dress embodies a brilliant and intelligent scientist. Camilla Belle makes a beautiful appearance as McClaren's daughter. <br /> <br /> Mr. Seagal discusses the "Real American" controversy Tradition and militia squads, which give their own point of view (the Constitution suits him perfectly, but men with chubby beards do not have nothing to do with it). Positive points are also raised regarding the Eastern-Western medicine system and nature. <br /> <br /> The best of Seagal. And opening new horizons in his film career. <br /> <br />
