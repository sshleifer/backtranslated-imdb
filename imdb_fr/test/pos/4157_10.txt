This film is an impressionistic and poetic interpretation of the immigration experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear that could be associated with emigration. These are aspects not taken into account in films on emigration to the United States in particular and to all countries in general. The film vividly and convincingly describes the nervousness and enthusiasm, if not ignorance, of poor immigrants and illiterate Sicilians in anticipation of their emigration to the country. United States. <br /> <br /> They have fantastic and unrealistic notions about the United States that are scattered throughout the trip. The first is that the rivers flow with milk, an image that is described in the film with a poetic and impressionistic effect. The film is devoid of sound and the silence seems to reflect the discomfort of local ignorance about life in America or, failing that, a vision tinged with superstition and fantasy. <br /> <br /> That said, the film describes with chaotic realism, the boat crossing to the United States and the process of admission that had to undergo the arrivals to Ellis Island. The boat ride is imagined as rather dull, which was surely a good part of the time. The neighborhoods in which the new residents sleep are described as extremely crowded with beds four to five inches apart and lacking much light, which was certainly the case under the bridge. <br /> <br /> Again, the film does not contain excessive music or excessive lighting, which has the effect of creating a fairly realistic image of what it really was for people who emigrate to United States. The villagers may not be worldly, but they are quite reasonable and the interaction with the emigrant elder, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) with the immigration officer who insists on particular results, is quite bitter insofar as they are neither diluted nor attenuated. the benefit of a syrupy conclusion and we are witnessing the fusion of Sicilian realism with the many regulations that guide life in the United States. <br /> <br /> Immigrants and their history are very interesting and the combination of the cold The realism in the eyes and the magical imagination of the imagination of the people give a convincing vision of the beliefs of the Sicilians, or any other people , with very little formal education moving to the United States. The role play is similarly barebones; it is not at all demonstrative or brilliant, but seems the most realistic for that. That said, all the main actors, especially Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), clear leader of the group, are excellent. Although never smiling, his character's actions speak louder and it is clear that (thankfully) the other members of the group, his two sons and the elder mentioned above, Fortunata, the boys' grandmother, have confidence and respect for their leadership abilities. direction. Amato permeates his character with great decency and candor. The fact that his character seems so capable and confident testifies to his abilities, while his character betrays very little emotion. <br /> <br /> A quirk of the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious Englishwoman (the excellent and perfectly mysterious Charlotte Gainsbourg) who speaks Italian and, throughout the film, one wonders why she goes to the United States. United. or what connection she has with the group of Sicilian emigrants otherwise unanimous. In the end, this is finally revealed and the revelation is made realistically and does not seem particularly melodramatic or clairvoyant. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese, who understands perfectly the realistic, sometimes superstitious worldview that his characters inhabit and presents it with competence and assurance. It's actually a fantastic trust considering the awkwardness realism could have associated realism and superstition in the film. It is an exam worthy of the immigrant experience.
