It's a really dark film. Black indeed. The main character is smallpox, taken to New York unconsciously by Evelyn Keyes. <br /> <br /> She takes part in a mission when she arrives and another after she tells him about her innocent sister. But she herself is not intentionally a killer. That does not mean she does not kill. This does not mean that its presence among some eight million people does not throw the city into turmoil. <br /> <br /> Keyes is excellent. The support cast is fine too. There are several little known people involved in this - the director included. Do not be put off. It's a movie you have to count on! (And what a pleasure to see a picture of Columbia, Columbia and Republic produced great comedies and blacks, but we hardly see them anymore.)
