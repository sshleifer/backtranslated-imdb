I did not read the book. I do not care either. the film was a beautiful romance, and I think women will enjoy it. No, it was not a "10" movie, but it was nice. women, if your man is bored like mine, then look at him yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophical doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue about "in love" and "love". <br /> <br /> too, if you like Nick Cage, he was great and funny. I enjoyed watching romance developing. <br /> <br /> too, if you like Christian Bale, do not see him in balance. it's a "10" sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> see this movie. ignore comments from the previous user. <br /> <br /> one - especially the ladies !!
