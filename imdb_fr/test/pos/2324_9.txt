I just discovered this movie and I love it. The right mix of an eventful story, fun characters, hilarious moments (without being overloaded with silly jokes) and fun performances by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Torn and many others . Buckman is particularly talented and I really enjoyed watching the guy who played at Stapanick. <br /> <br /> I also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, the Pampanito, for the race on the best stages and almost imitated it. for their sets. The decoration is really impressive if you make a digital tour of the Pampanito online and then compare it to scenes from the movie. They did a great job on this movie. <br /> <br /> What a fun and really enjoyable movie!
