Darr, although it's a copy of a Hollywood movie, is one of the best movies I've seen. It's not only beautifully depicted but also has great songs and beautiful landscapes. Shahrukh is his usual self. His expressions and his voice correspond to his character. I was pleasantly surprised by the representation of Sunny Deol in the film. He is a bit romantic and lovable in the film, unlike his other characters from his other films. Sometimes, one has the impression that justice has not been inflicted on his character. Sunny had to be described as the good guy in the movie but ended up looking like the villain at the end. Juhi Chawla is beautiful and bubbly. She is his usual. In short, a great love story with passion.
