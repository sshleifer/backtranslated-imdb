It's a simple epic ad, so distant after watching all the episodes of season 11 (except for the Imaginationland trilogy), it's the one that made you laugh the most, it's definitely my favorite until now from season 11. So, basically, Cartman sees at a toy store a child who has Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine that now, Cartman has Tourette Syndrome and that he's great, because Kyle, once he knew it, it's like "he's pretending". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the director, to anyone. On the other hand, we have Kyle, who is now the intolerant, mainly for saying that Cartman claimed to have been taken to meet children with Tourette's syndrome just to make him understand that Tourette's syndrome was real and that he was great, because Kyle was like "well maybe someone pretends to have Tourette to have fun", in short, Kyle could not explain that Cartman was pretending. My favorite scene in this episode is probably where Cartman is with Kyle's family, but just after that scene, another kid Cartman simulates, the kid with Tourette who was at the toy store, Cartman basically told this kid this: "isn 'Tourette is great". But to say what he wants and to be a brave boy for everyone is only the beginning of Cartman, his master plan: to go on national television to say whatever he wants ("the people 'will call a brilliant television, they will probably give me an Emmy' - fantastic, in this episode, the word 's ***' is used 26 times and that's certainly not all.South Park won an Emmy a month or two before the broadcast of this episode). But here, there is a difference: Cartman has in principle removed all the bricks from the wall. He now says everything without thinking. So we heard from Cartman that he had wet his bed last night. It's not fun for Cartman and he says to himself "I can not control what I say" and certainly the person who was with him is like "well of course you can not control what you say, you have Tourette "So Cartman is like" my Tourette got worse, before I just let cool stuff on the lame Jews and all that, but now it's getting really bad. " There are also things about Chris Hansen and To Catch a Predator. In fact, what happened to a pervert happens with a lot more perverts. Kyle and Thomas were behind this to stop Cartman, who ended up being the savior of Cartman! Fantastic! <br /> <br /> The Comedy Central cable television show will air an episode of the animated series "South" on October 3rd, October 3rd. <br /> <br /> Park "in which one of the young characters, Cartman," gets "Tourette's syndrome.In view of the nature of this program, we expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with TS and that they collect many calls and emails from our members and the TS community. <br /> <br /> We have already taken preventative measures, such as asking Comedy Central to broadcast our public service announcement (featuring comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the show, and once the episode is aired and we can see exactly how TS is described, we can respond and specific problems we have with the series to screenwriters. <br /> <br /> "We are really surprised that creators have taken so long to use TS as comedy comedy in this program, since no disability, disease or subject controversial does it ur is forbidden, "said Judit Ungar, president of TSA. <br /> <br /> "We always see the representations of TS (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and an event of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception to the rule and offers TSA a way to disseminate factual information about the disorder, "said Tracy Colletti. Flynn, Public Relations and Communications Manager, TSA. <br /> <br /> We will publish an official statement on this site presenting the reaction of TSA to the program after the broadcast of the show. <br /> <br /> TSA RESPONSE to the episode "South Park" <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as has been the case with far too many media representations Tourette Syndrome (TS), the The opening of the South Park season (Le Petit Tourette, 10-3-07) has further perpetuated the myth that most people affected by the TS have bursts of foul language. In fact, 85 to 90% of people with TS never present this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (called medically coprolalia). For viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, the misleading message to go could not have been clearer ?? unless you curse, you do not have TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our previous trepidation, we concede that this episode has been surprisingly well documented. Despite the exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia, for the attentive viewer, a surprising amount of accurate information has been transmitted. Written comments from parents, a neurologist, peers and therapy session with the "TS Children's Support Group" have all served as a clever way to communicate these facts to the public. "There is no doubt that this episode of South Park has raised the country's awareness of TS, but we are very concerned that schoolchildren with TS will be mocked and even intimidated by insensitive comrades who may have saw the program, "said Judit Ungar, president of TSA. "We realize that for more than a decade, satirical parodies of writers have spared no group, whether celebrities, people with disabilities or political figures." The fact that TS was the subject of a show popular television attests to the fact that the public is much more Clearly, this increased awareness for which we have worked too hard can sometimes prove to be a double-edged sword. "<br /> <br /> TSA contacted program officials before the broadcast and we will contact them again. Perhaps we will be able to turn this into an opportunity for positive awareness of TS.
