I was providing filming services on this film every Sunday, we were shooting at Berkeley Square in London. David Niven has always appreciated the role of the gentleman, unfortunately the last. We had a moment of panic when a trunk of fake Krugerrands (for the film) spilled a storm sewer. <br /> <br /> Imagine a frenetic crew opening all the drains to retrieve the last one. If you know and love London, you'll love this comic adventure - also begins Richard Jordan, who unfortunately died of a brain tumor. A good movie, a fantastic team, a superb cast. look for the current stars of the coronation street, then play scenes of crowd or extras. The batch of cars and the retail shops of Ivan were all shot down in West London, the parade of Chiswick and the batch of American used cars were dressed during the night, the lot of cars is still there as are the stores. A restaurant was suddenly transformed into a funeral home. If you see the movie on the list, make an effort to see it! Sally Harrison, the bank's receptionist, was married to production designer Tony Curtis. <br /> April 2007 I was just thinking of adding some extra comments on the places: <br /> Pub: right next to Berkeley Square Elke Sommers Cottage: at the end of the street along Twickenham Road Film Studios Lot of cars Ivans opportunity: along Chiswick High Street and all the shops near the roundabout. Workshops (conversion of armored vans) Factory located at the roundabout in front of Fullers Brewery Jail brewery (see workshops above) Telephone booth see Elke Sommers cottage (this was the wooden toolbox used in many movies , look for the lighting cable flush with the floor and the wooden hinges on the door! Honeywell Computer Room near Olympia Cemetery - Chiswick - Tomb just outside the bank-owned land, empty ceilings and a vault: Twickenham Studios <br /> <br /> And just to add David Niven, the gentleman, joked and mixed up with the crew, extras, etc. ...... Niven dined at the hotel Connaught but joined the crew for a coffee!
