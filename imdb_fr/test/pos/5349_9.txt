My only problem with The Curse of the Were-Bunny is that the movie does not take the time to correctly present Wallace and Gromit to those who do not know Park's shorts. Strangely, "A close shave" manages to do it with a lot less time to lose. I still liked to see the boys back in action and I loved all the new characters, human and others. I particularly liked the voice of Ralph Fiennes in the plot of Victor Quartermaine. It is also interesting to see the series on the big screen. The finish with the terracotta characters really stands out. It's fun, and great for the whole family! I buy very few DVDs but I have all Wallace and Gromit and I will gladly add this one.
