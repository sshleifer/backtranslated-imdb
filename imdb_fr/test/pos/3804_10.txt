the first time I saw this movie, I thought "what the heck?" a 10-year-old boy driving in odd places, meeting odd people, looking for a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I really enjoyed this film! <br /> <br /> Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a pity he stopped the act. He plays his character Gus very well in the film. <br /> <br /> Gus loses an eye, gets tattooed and goes to the strangest cities playing with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? <br /> <br /> OK, do not even try to understand the story, but why does this film need it? Open your mind and let Gus guide you in this adventure. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, you have won Motorama"
