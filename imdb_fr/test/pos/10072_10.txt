If you like Madonna or not, this movie is hilarious !! I'm a fan of Madonna and I saw it at the theater when it was released. However, over time, he has not lost his foolishness and pure pleasure. Of course, there are bad lines and nerdy scenes but the whole movie is just a ball comedy with Madonna bringing the whole movie with such intensity. She is cute, funny and is the only comic role of her movie career. In general, Madonna is content to play "herself" in roles, but looking at her like Nikki Finn in this movie, she really seems to be someone else for once. Of course, the film is directed by James Foley (who filmed the dramatic and mesmerizing "At Close Range" with Sean Penn & Christopher Walken) and co-starring Griffin dunn ("After Hours") who is also brilliantly portrayed and Amuse with the Material. The story is not that great and do not expect a climatic end, but if you have the mood to watch a fun, clean, 80s night or if you're a fan of Madonna, this is a MUST SEE. The soundtrack is also very remarkable and contains 4 songs of Madonna: the hit No. 1 "Who's That Girl", the No. 2 hit "Causing A Commotion" and the beautiful and one of his best ballads of all time "The Look of Love" 10 Hit UK) and "Can not Stop", a pop song remaining from the "True BLue" sessions of the previous year, available only on VHS but soon available on DVD.
