This is without a doubt one of my favorite episodes of Columbo. The acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the scenario is ingenious and the direction is fabulous. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, who plays brilliantly in all episodes of Columbo, plays particularly well in this episode. <br /> <br /> In addition, the excellent performances of Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp. <br /> <br /> The end is absolutely brilliant and I like the way Columbo describes it. <br /> <br /> This is a Columbo film that will NOT go wrong.
