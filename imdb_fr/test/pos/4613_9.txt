Good pain sethrp-1, you completely missed the point. The girl was seen only briefly, BECAUSE she was the one who was going to kill herself ... all the others were so absorbed in their own stories that they did not notice her, and neither did we. As one of the other students said at the end of the event - we are all so concerned about our own problems that we do not notice what is going on for someone else. <br /> <br /> The director himself said that if he killed one of the others, it would have suggested that their problems were worse than those of someone else. The purpose of killing Kelly was that she did not notice us. Get it now ??
