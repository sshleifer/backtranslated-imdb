Two Soldiers is a great example of film making. The director and producer told a heartwarming story and brought it to light with a very skilled and dedicated cast, excellent cinematography and a very creative artistic sense. <br /> <br /> The relaxed lifestyle of the brothers has been described. in great detail, and contrasted sharply with the militarist lifestyle in which they were immersed. The interaction between the brothers provoked bursts of laughter and tears, as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in remote North Carolina and an even harder life of war. <br /> <br /> the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), the older brother (played by Ben Allison) and the powerful performance of the colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was extremely well presented. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of Two Soldiers, and I highly recommend it to the public of any age.
