Frankie Darro was a wonderful child actor who excelled at playing pugnacious little boys with gigantic chips on his shoulders. He appeared in some of the best movies of the early 30s - "The Public Enemy" (1931), an innovative crime drama and "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933), a news film about the era of depression that tells the story of children. He was essentially a younger version of James Cagney. Although small, his willingness to do his own stunts kept him in a series of programmers while the larger studios did not use it anymore. <br /> <br /> "Crime School" was supposed to be a remake of "The Mayor of Hell", but with much more humor, featured The Dead End Kids and Humphrey Bogart as Assistant Commissioner very laid back. "The Mayor of Hell" is really a combination of "Hell's House" / "Crime School" / "Boy's Town". Although Cagney did not appear until around the 25th minute, his impact (as usual) was immediate. He plays the role of a hung gangster who is part of a political group led by the crowd. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and her gang (including "Farina" of "Our Gang") hold a car, but bite more than they can chew when they steal a general store and grow the owner through a window. They appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the public prison. It is painted in laudatory terms - a model school where boys have the chance to learn a trade. In reality, it is a hellish place run by a sadistic guardian, Mr. Thompson (played remarkably by Dudley Digges). The only compassionate person is Dorothy Griffith, the nursing assistant (played by Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> "Patsy" Gargan (James Cagney) won the position of new Assistant Commissioner, as a favor. . When he arrives at school, he witnesses an unsuccessful escape attempt and, after talking with Dorothy, realizes that the school needs radical reforms. He soon runs the school and sets up a system of "autonomous government", rather similar to that of "Boy's Town". Although Cagney does not have much to do, Darro's energy is at its peak. After "Patsy" is temporarily absent (he accidentally shoots a gangster and has to leave the state), Thompson returns and his brutal treatment, which results in the death of a boy ("Skinny"), tilts the rest boys in an angry crowd. They burn a barn and Thompson falls to his death - "Patsy" comes home just in time to calm the crowd with a sobering conversation. <br /> <br /> Of course, all the boys seemed to have a grated mind. their crimes but I do not agree with one of the critics - Thompson was more than a "bad guy". His sadistic treatment resulted in the death of a boy. There is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served with an inedible paste - Thompson orders ham and eggs and continues to stack the butter on his bread while talking to Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Allan Jenkins plays "Uncle" Mike and Sheila Terry, although he is billed as "a blonde" has one of the most memorable replicas when she vomits and says, "I thought that there would be young boys here, where are they? " <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
