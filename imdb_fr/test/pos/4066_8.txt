At one point, "Buddy Buddy" films dominated the box office. It seemed like every summer, crowds of candidates for the Beverly Hills police were coming down to the theaters of our country. Not anymore. Lately, the gusher has barely dried a net. The drought has eased somewhat recently with the release of Showtime, a truly fun and always fun movie of its kind. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston is a dedicated policeman. It's not at all a type of Dirty Harry. He is just an incredibly focused professional, totally intolerant of anything that might interfere with his performance of his duties - like, for example, a TV cameraman treating the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and falling into the hands of Chase Renzi, a producer looking for a deadly hook for her "TV reality". cop broadcast. She thinks that Mitch will give her the "pissed off" boost she needs to be successful, but thinks he may be too unfriendly to carry the whole series on his own. Enter Trey Sellars, a policeman-actor who has watched the stories of the police too much. Of course, Mitch and Trey mix together like oil and water and it ensues happy chaos. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Trey will certainly become best friends by the end of the film. That's how friends movies are supposed to work. In fact, it must be said that Showtime rarely deviates from time-honored clichés such as those written by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. McGuffin is a high-tech specialist who makes things happen (in this case, an automatic rifle capable of firing shells large enough to stop tanks.) There is a nasty foreign trap with undetermined accent. There are lawsuits, shootings and explosions. We all know what's going on and we have a pretty good idea of ​​how it's going to be. You know what? There is nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know that the used bases will be affected, but the pleasure is the journey, not the destination. Showtime does not try to be original. Instead, his energies are channeled to his characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime does a competent job with action sequences but really shines in his comedy. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is drily funny like Mitch. In the past, I thought De Niro was a cold, expressionless actor who was horribly involved in sexual assault when he was called on to do comedy. Lately, however, he has grown on me. He seems to inject more humanity into his roles. Eddie Murphy is hilarious like Trey. The best way to describe his performance is that Trey is what Murphy would be if Murphy was not as good and did not hit the big time. René Russo has a good time playing Chase Renzi, a show biz shark in his mouth. She scoured the film in search of Nielson's high ratings with impressive determination. In her zeal, she takes Mitch's life back to make it more user-friendly. She even asks T. J. Hooker, William Shatner, to show Mitch how to be a more "authentic" cop. Shatner is funny, playing himself exactly what we expect from him, strong, unconscious and slightly obnoxious. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I was really looking forward to Showtime and I was not disappointed. Ten years ago, this film would have been a guaranteed success. Today, he is doing moderate business at best. Too bad, because Showtime is very fun.
