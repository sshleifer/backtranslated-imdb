This film is excellent (I watched the French version). There are many sub-plots (which generally hampers the whole thing), but they work well and contribute to the main theme of "real self-discovery". In fact, the whole movie (in addition to its background) is the journey of self-discovery (or of someone else). Is the king really a "good monarch peacenik" who is trying to wage a "war to end all wars" or is he just a troubled thug and thirsty for blood? Is he a real king, after all? Is the Queen Mother's Accompanist simply a thorn-less, career-oriented sock puppet, or rather a bold individual with sharp reasoning? Will the lady / concubine realize who the king really is? What is between the king and the old chancellor? What is the secret that everyone knows but does not mean? What is the real reason the killer left his "job"? Subplots (something I do not like very much) are well managed and keep a close watch until the end. The scenes are well designed and CGI fits well, without going too far. The suspense is well maintained and the actors are up to the task. There are a lot of smiles damaged in the brain, but that's how we were supposed to behave at the king's court (as the lady / concubine complains). Realistic movie without moments of superheroes. This Chinese film is a shame for Hollywood's cardboard colossal (Gladiator, etc.).
