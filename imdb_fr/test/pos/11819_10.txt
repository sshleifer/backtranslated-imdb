In 1996, one of the airline pilots I was working for gave me a copy of this film. He told me it would make me cry. I never believed it and we even made bets. After seeing the movie ... I cried a bucket! Even after watching the movie, I found myself crying in the bathroom. It was actually the most touching film I have ever seen. I like the part where Dexter's mother confronted Eric's mother, the reply ran as follows: "The best friend of your sons has just died today ... and it will not be easy. .. if you put her hand again ... I'll kill you! " The last part where Dexter took Eric's shoe is a scene that never left my mind until today. Honestly, just thinking about it gives me tears in my eyes. A story of what true friendship is. My girlfriend loved it too ... She hated me for letting her see the movie. I cried a bucket, she cried a river.
