One of my favorite movies of all time. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or if I suffered from a momentary amnesia, I would like to enjoy this film as much as I did for the very first time. It's still nice the second and third time but I found myself enjoying the humor especially as shocks and thrills were not unexpected. If you want to see a movie you really can not predict the end, I highly recommend this movie. It's scary, shocking, suspenseful and there's a lot of humor to help you get through too. If you watch this movie and you do not like it, I doubt your sanity!
