Although it is no closer to Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan than, for example, Johnny Wiesmuller's films do not have a particular and amusing twist in history. It's a well made movie of Tarzan. Beautiful landscape, good photography, achievable continuity and a Tarzan scream that echoes the one described by Burroughs. The players all work well. The only negatives I found were, I think, related. It moves slowly in places. This slow movement? Makes this image too long. This could easily have been shortened by 15 to 20 minutes, which I think would have contributed to the natural fluidity of the plot and character development. But the rest of the film works well enough to carry it on these two difficult points and leave the viewer satisfied with the film. Short version of all the above ... This is a very good movie Tarzan.
