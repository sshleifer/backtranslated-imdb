Marigold is by far the best Bollywood outsider I've ever seen. (I did not grow up with Bollywood, but I've seen a few hundred now.) I would say it leaves Gurinder Chadha, Mira Nair, and even Merchant and Ivory (from Bombay Talkie) almost in the dust. Willard Carroll, the director, really loves Bollywood and he has the confidence to let us know it - there is humor, but no ark, an ironic distancing, no "of course, I do not want not really say that. " As Jerry Lee Lewis would say, he "understands", and he can leave it to us too - the joy of a cinematic experience in Bollywood, as well as touches provided by a Westerner playing the role of the storyteller. <Br/> <br /> This is the story of a beautiful American actress B (she only makes movies with numbers in their titles, like Fatal Attraction 3) that is in a different film of Bollywood. in India (Kama Sutra 3 folded her tents while she was on her way, apparently because her producers are now in prison). Salman Khan, in real life a mega-mega star of Bollywood, is the master dancer of the delicious film written on the fly in which she is now trained ("is it before or after I'm blind?"), And through the sweetness of her slightly gifted talented character, she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing ability. <br /> <br /> The solid start gives you both Bollywood - a super energetic troupe of dancers in front of the Taj Mahal (both funny and familiar to the Western audience, while providing the high-speed musical thrill that we love in a Hindi movie), and Salman on the screen right from the start - no Bollywood: 20 minutes waiting for the hero. He wears an Indian costume adorned with a Kit Carson style Western film fringe (all white style). <br /> <br /> Ali Larter's actress character pleases the Western viewer - she's blonde, which is "traditional" "White" person in a Bollywood movie, with a visually understandable cast - but she's a sturdy girl, not a kind of ethereal blondie that we're usually introduced to, and she's a total, more or less three-dimensional bitch, who continues to be profane and abusive cell phone conversations with a boyfriend and an agent in the USA. <br /> <br /> We also have scenes of women who have problems with each other going to a bar to treat them - the ability for people who do not get to talk and have emotional conversations is traditional in Hindi films, but we rarely see such a thing happen between women (other than the mother-daughter discussion about the girl's choice of groom), not to mention the "strangers" - unrelated people - not to mention bar-go So, the spirit is the same, the details are fresh, and I'm delighted. <br /> <br /> I only saw it once, during a preview screening, in the presence of the director, a good speaker and questions. responder - Salman and he became good friends "like a brother", he loves India, he intends to make a film The Wizard of Oz in India. I can not have too much detail about the songs when I saw them once, except to say that I loved them all. It goes from a cheery parody of the Bollywood number in the film - the ladies' costumes, the Livorno hats and the shell-sheathed bodices (it's a beach scene) on flowing dresses - are worth the price of a single ticket - a beautiful romantic song with many facets and reflection in a sadder and more serious part of the film. <br /> <br /> Mix Hindi and English in music, and it works. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan derives a lot of credit from me for his openness to unusual projects - this one and Jaan-e-Mann - and his good judgment on the projects to follow. Carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas along the way, and quite acceptable (ie not at all narcissistic at all), that Carroll accepts or rejects them - clearly a professional who likes to be involved and collaborate.
