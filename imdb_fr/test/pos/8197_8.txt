This Chinese epic of three hours, taking place in 220 BC. In the end, it might be the familiar theme of the Emperor's idealistic dream of peace, with unification turned into corrupt isolation, and the film is not intrinsically stimulating. intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told in vivid shots. Even for those who are not attracted to such historical shows for themselves, this is an amazing feast for the eyes: the scene illustrating the Marquis's coup attempt is one of the most breathtaking evocations of physical space and memorial grandeur, and battle scenes are memorable both in their range and their immediacy. The title sums up the use of convincing contrasts in the film - vast vistas of plain against intimate horrors; the most noble of the opposing motives; hope to become dust. If you've never seen a Chinese three-hour epic, it would not be a bad place to start.
