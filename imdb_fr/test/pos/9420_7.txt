This is one of the paradoxes of the anti-war, war-era, war-era, anti-Nazi war movies of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes (the voice of terror, SH in Washington, DC). Despite a weird, wind-swept hairstyle that is supposed to give him a younger look, he walks through every scene with so many bites and attacks that barely records the fragility of the intrigues. Here, too, he has an excellent acting relationship with Lionel Atwill, who makes a disgusting teacher, Professor Moriarty - a heavy-skinned cockroach with pretty sadism and depravity (it may not have been actors, children). At the climax, he became a lab coat to drain Rathbone's blood "drip". He is as sinister as Seinfeld Newman's sworn enemy. The film itself is an old children's morning, but it has the attention of director Roy William Neill for the staging and the atmosphere. The UCLA restore of the DVD also looks very clear. Do not even think of buying another edition, all those faded and jerky impressions of the public domain.
