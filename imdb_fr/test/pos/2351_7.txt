"Hollywood Cavalcade" is a relatively entertaining film from 1939 featuring two personalities from 20th Century Fox's band, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, and containing some jokes. <br /> <br /> Michael Connors (Ameche), who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye), makes her a great silent actress, who eventually wins in more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. Obsessed with his work, he is absolutely shocked when she and her main man (Alan Curtis) run away and get married. He is so shocked that he throws it away. She and her husband are leaving and continue to be more and more popular as Connors' studio begins to lose money at an alarming rate. Before you know it, it's over. Molly wants to help and asks Connors to direct his next movie. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of Keystone Kop sequences, which is pretty funny, and some fantastic Keaton Buster slapstick, which are wonderful. The film also has a scene from "The Jazz Singer" when the talkies take over. The joke of course concerns Rin Tin-Tin, for whom Zanuck wrote. In one scene, Rinny's coach makes him enter as a potential contract player for Connors Studio. Connors throws them both out of his office. A few scenes later, Rin-Tin-Tin appears as the # 1 box office. The role of the famous German Shepherd in this film is played by Rin Tin-Tin, Jr., dad deceased in the arms of Jean Harlow in 1932, one month before his 14th birthday. Luck smiles him even in the end. <br /> <br /> Alice Faye is very pretty and does a great job, as is Ameche, who performs an energetic performance. J. Edward Bromberg and Stuart Erwin provide very good support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is not quite sure what it is: story, comedy, novel or drama. However, "Hollywood Cavalcade" is still quite visible.
