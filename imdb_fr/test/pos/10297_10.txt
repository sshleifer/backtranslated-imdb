It's a fabulous movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a good movie, and it is told with imagination in a series of flashbacks and alternative views. What was deliberate and what is a coincidence? Who is in love with whom? <br /> <br /> You have the chance to take turns (sometimes literally) in the skin of each character, which allows to define each character to a satisfactory depth. <Br /> <br /> With a little effort, you can understand each of the characters. and the key events of the film are summarized from the point of view of different people. <br /> <br /> Take this opportunity if it concerns your arthouse cinema; it looks good on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Rather than guessing, the plot moves so much that you sit and watch what happens - I challenge anyone to predict! <br /> <br /> But more than likely, you'll need more than one viewing - I saw this three times when the original photo came out, and it improved every time. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good, with an excellent rendition of Romane Bohringer as Alice, torn in three directions by the other three characters in the set. <br /> <br /> A classic. The second best film of the 1990s.
