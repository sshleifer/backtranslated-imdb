SPOILERS Every major regime uses the country's media for its own purposes. Whether it is the Nazi ban on some leaflets or the televised Chinese version of Tianamen Square, governments have been trying to influence the population through various means since the dawn of time. In 1925, however, celebrating the failure of the 1905 mutiny, the Russian communist government supported the creation of this film, Battleship Potempkin. A major piece of cinematographic history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this day. <br /> <br /> Aboard the Potempkin battleship, the team is unhappy. In miserable living conditions and with food infested with flies, they are angry at their upper class suppressors. Now, however, after the rotten food, that's enough. Led by Grigori Vakulinuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew turns against their masters and fights for their freedom. <br /> <br /> As far as propaganda is concerned, "Battleship Potempkin" is perfect. Presenting a positive light on the first unsuccessful and communist mutiny, the film was a useful Soviet tool. Eighty years after the release of the films, the USSR has completely disappeared from the map. What is amazing in this movie is that, although the country to which his message was intended has disappeared, the film remains a powerful film worthy of the cinema. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. It is true that it is far from what we consider today as "entertainment", but the film is a beautiful work of art. <br /> <br /> Whether it's the scenes on the boat or the scenes we often talk about In the footsteps of Odessa, everything is perfectly realized in this film. The music is powerful and dramatic, the light is perfect, even the acting, though slightly exaggerated, is perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to criticize the final product of this movie. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to know how the Russian people received this film when it was released. Renting a country that has not existed for fifteen years, it is difficult for us to know the morale that the film inspires. As a work of art, it's beautiful. Beautiful from start to finish, the watch is far from easy to watch, but it is worth it.
