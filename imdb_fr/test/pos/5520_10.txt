Look, it's a low budget horror movie that suffers from all the problems that come with low budget movies. But you have to see this just to watch Lisa Erickson as Julie. She is SMOKIN 'hot and a great little actress to boot! These types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! Nothing makes me more happy than sitting in my studio with a Coca-Cola and putting this movie. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree. Lisa is not only brilliant, she is a hottie. The film itself often goes wrong and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in this respect. But as soon as Lisa appears on the screen, things get carried away. The others are clearly not in his league. This is not the exorcist but as I said, if you want to see a funny little movie with a little exciting actress, this is the one to see!
