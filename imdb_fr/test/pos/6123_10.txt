I grew up in Baltimore so I was exposed to John Waters' films because I was too young to watch them. And if your knowledge of John Waters is limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby, or other family-oriented movies, get ready for Pink Flamingos. <br /> <br /> Explicit sex acts, incest, old lady who only eats eggs and unhygienic acts with chickens are only part of the depravity of this film. The film ends with Divine, 300 lbs of Waters. Cross-dressing star eating dog feces. <br /> <br /> The principle is based on two families: a pair of garbage garbage inbreds, which includes Divine and Edith Massey in the role of the lady with eggs; and the other is a rich and dynamic couple. The two families are fighting for the title of "The dirtiest person alive". Enjoy John Waters' best film, but see it only if you're an open-minded, belly-bored individual, as some scenes in this movie will make you unhappy.
