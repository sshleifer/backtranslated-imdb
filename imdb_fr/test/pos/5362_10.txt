It was the kind of film they used to do, fun, comforting, disturbing, authentic, with compelling performances by people without a nose job, without a job, with eyes, ie real people . Shauna Macdonald plays the role of feminine love and she is so real that you want to at least hug her. Imagine that, a real girl in a movie, no matter what? Hollywood would hate it, because its freshness is a strong reprimand for every fake starlet of Tinseltown. This story has the same hilarious feel as Sandy Mackendrick's classic "Whiskey Galore", with the genomic humor of distant Scottish islets punctuating the claims of outside intruders and taking advantage of a little drama from time to time. the real interval between these epochs being often short). Director Stephen Whittaker has a rare ability to do this, and it's shocking to see that he died before the release of his movie, only 56 years old, which clearly represented a substantial loss for the screen . Ulrich Thomsen knows very well how to play the role of a German scientist who, in the late 1930s, went to Scarp, on the Isle of Harris, to build a small rocket to transport postal parcels between the islands. There, he falls in love with the attractive girl Macdonald, who returns the favor. Some wonderfully colorful local characters decorate the story and the film is pure delight. There is, of course, the threat of an impending war with Hitler, and we learn that Hitler has executed 1,000 rocket scientists who have refused to make weapons of war, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far away, but the lips must remain sealed in a balance sheet of what is happening at the end. This film is a wonderful example of the kind of movies the British should do. But are they well liberated? In a country whose tastes have been so corrupted by reality shows, where disgusting non-entities have become national heroes, is there even a market for a film like this? After all, there is no groaning sex, there are no close-ups of festering wounds or genitals, no drugs, no foolish celebrities who boast a desire to to be watched, and one wonders if there is anything. to interest an audience become so decadent and jaded that only the most extreme sensations can briefly relieve the boredom of their useless existence. Anyone looking for an antidote to the emptiness of contemporary Britain can take refuge in this refreshing and honest film.
