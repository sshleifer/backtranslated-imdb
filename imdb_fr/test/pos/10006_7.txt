I felt that this movie had a lot of good qualities. Cinematography was certainly different, exposing the scenic aspect of the set and the story. The original characters as actors were certainly a feat and I felt that most of the players had been played quite convincingly. Of course, they play themselves, but they are really unique. The cultural aspects may leave many disappointed, as a familiarity with Chinese and Eastern culture will answer many questions about parent / child relationships and the stigma that accompanies any drug use. I found the story of Jia Hongsheng interesting. On a darker note, the story is in Beijing and part of the stink of fashion and music of the early 90s, although it was done in 2001, so it's sometimes very corny (the Beatles shit, etc.). Anyway, not a top ten or twenty but if it's on TV, take a look.
