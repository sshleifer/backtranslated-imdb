I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I first got the trailer, and I'm so happy now. It's really a wonderful movie. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, everything was perfect. I love James McAvoy and I can not wait to see him in the movie "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" in December. Romola Garai is beautiful too. Make sure to watch it in "I Capture the Castle" or "Nicholas Nickleby", two of my favorite movies. Overall, I think I liked this movie because it did not fail. It is difficult to tell a story about a subject, as it is very likely that you would offend a lot of people or make a mistake and make it a love festival too sentimental-sweet-sweet. But they avoided doing it completely and instead made a real film, honest and touching, certainly, but never too much. Very well done. Amazingly well done. Go see it and you will know exactly what I mean.
