It's an incredible and powerful drama that hits you. I thought the movie was great and I started to understand the disabilities of the two main characters. This was represented by a superb performance by Michael and Rory. That the story is based on a true story, I feel that the story was trying to make the public understand that the general public should respect and feel the needs of people with disabilities and that they should be given the same opportunities as others. Human. Overall, this film penetrated my soul and I too, I felt touched by the actors and the director who sent his creativity. All in all, some actors take the piece beyond the character and only show part of the character that is credible to the audience, but I think those two have certainly been very helpful as a talented talent. to represent a dramatic masterpiece. Definitely one not to be missed!
