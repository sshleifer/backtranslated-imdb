Incredibly well-designed mini-series. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS. Was strongly promoted at the time. I think it may be one of the very first mini-series on PBS outside the Masterpiece Theater series. <br /> <br /> The complete production was broadcast once during its first broadcast. Was 6-8 hours total. This length was slightly reduced to 6 hours. Cut some interesting scenes, but slow. <br /> <br /> I really hope that the people holding their current rights will follow and restore a complete, unedited version on DVD. It is not worth creating a VHS version at this stage. <br /> <br /> would fit very well into the genre of miniseries or dramatic history.
