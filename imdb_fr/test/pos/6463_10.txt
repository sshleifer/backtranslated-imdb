I cry a lot of movies. Call me sentimental. Call me one of those viewers who always like to see a happy ending. This film, although its end is sad, was great! Among all the actors with whom I would like to have lunch, it would be Sidney Poitier. His role, with John Cassavetes and Jack Warden (from the glory of 12 Angry Men) is stellar. His character, who befriends a man on the run (Cassavetes) and help in every possible way is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is another of those blacks forgotten at the end of the black period. It is well done, the distribution is superb, the acting extremely talented and the great cinematography. It is a film that deserves to be watched again and again. I highly recommend this one! This is just another very good movie directed by Mr. Poitier and should be sold on DVD. Even though I cried, congratulations to such a great art!
