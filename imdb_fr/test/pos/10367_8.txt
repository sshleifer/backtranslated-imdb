Richard Abernethie, a very rich man, died and his family gathered for his funeral. Abernathie's younger sister, Cora Galaccio, is part of the funeral. Although no family member has seen Cora for at least 20 years, they all agree that Cora was always a little different. So, when Cora says something about Abemethie's murder, most of them laugh at it as one of Cora's eccentricities. But it is obvious that someone takes Cora seriously. The next day, Cora was found dead in bed after being beaten violently. Is there a connection between the two dead? It's up to Hercule Poirot to find a killer. <br /> <br /> After the funeral is one of the best-prepared episodes of the Poirot series. I have always been a fan of this book by Agatha Christie and, as far as I remember, the film is as faithful to Christie's source as any episode of Poirot. The mystery is first-rate and full of clues, suspects and red herrings. And as I already wrote, I still love a Christie story in which Hercule Poirot brings everyone together in a show for the final unveiling. It may be outdated, but that's how I like it. Going beyond the plot, technically and artistically, after the funeral is a winner. The sets, the editing, the production and the cinematography are as good as those you find in one of these films. The acting game is also impressive. I expect a nice performance from David Suchet as Poirot and he does not disappoint here. The rest of the cast is as strong, Monica Dolan giving a particularly remarkable performance. Other than a little argument with the way the characters are presented, I have nothing to complain about. It's a good show all around.
