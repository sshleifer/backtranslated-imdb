This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been on the water since the age of 13, so I have a lot of humor and a lot of close-up landscapes (the movie, although it's set in and around Virginia, was shot around the San Francisco Bay), including the fleet of mothballs just east of the Benicia Bridge, where Kelsey Grammar was first introduced at USS Stingray, and the San Francisco Jets at the same time. end of the film (including a boat I worked on). ). As others have said, the actors seemed to enjoy making this film and making it entertaining. The line "We are nearing the bottom, sir! I hear some lobsters moaning", at least for me, is priceless. <br /> <br /> I am one of the many people who are eagerly waiting for a DVD of the mailbox of Down Periscope will be presented.
