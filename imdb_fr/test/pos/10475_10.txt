Some have pointed out that subtitles are not a problem in this movie - please delay - the disadvantages of facial expressions and the subtle interactions between characters are such that you can not afford to leave the eyes even a split second . I tried to watch, on the DVD, in English to solve this problem (do not make this mistake, the result is a parody). The only way to get the full benefit is to watch the movie two or three times in a row to get to know it and ignore the subtitles. An acting master class - not in dialogue, but in body language. <br /> <br /> These are the little things - the postmaster / trader inflates his chest and fetches his cap before handing a letter from! La France ! The amused expression of the general, who delights in a bunch of perfect grapes, evokes a Biblical reference of a depth worthy of Being Being There. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is impressive and the dark minimalist village with its faded color just accentuates the sumptuousness of the feast when it comes. I have a friend who claims to come from the Borgias and whose family has the motto: "If it is worth doing, it is worth excesses" - Amen. <br /> <br /> I laugh loud and cry every time I watch this movie
