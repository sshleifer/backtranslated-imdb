"What is his name?" "Loudon." "Loudon what?" "Clear." <br /> <br /> This gag still holds me, twenty-one years after the release of the film. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie at the time and I love it today. I had to look at this a hundred times during the day and, when I recently bought the DVD, I still remembered the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman imprisoned for a crime she committed did not commit. When she goes out, she decides to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Griffin Dunne (no matter what happened to him?), Play the role of a lawyer for the father of his fiancée (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposed new public relations program. A seemingly easy task, but there are many complications, fun dialogues and certainly silly but fun scenes along the way. <br /> <br /> Madonna has a stupid voice in this movie. watching with subtitles has made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible to me (so only 8/10), but against I can not imagine doing it in his normal voice. <br /> <br /> This film shows the comical side of Madonna (which may be missing nowadays), and she is really funny in the role. Dunne makes an excellent foil, while Haviland Morris is perfect as a haughty fiancée. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but I think it's a great movie and he'll sit back and watch it 100 times more.
