It's hard to put words on the devastating beauty of Traffik, partly because I'm still figuring it out myself, hours after my second viewing. First, it must be said that Traffik contains some of the most incomparable and unforgettable scenes that haunt me in a film or television production. The staging is excellent, especially that of Bill Paterson as a British minister grappling with his heroin-dependent daughter and an aid agreement in Pakistan that is based on drug problems. Another plot describes these drug problems on the ground in Pakistan and concerns a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. The third main scenario concerns the prosecution of a drug importer in Hamburg, as well as the contradictory efforts of his wife and two German detectives during his trial. It is a profound realization that the interaction between these stories seems natural, transcending the intricate entanglement of intrigue that is often found in Hollywood movies. The fact that a work spread across three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and captivating, without having to simplify to the extreme, is an even greater accomplishment. It's devastating - dark and brutal but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is a rare film that deals with difficult topics with incomparable compassion and clarity.
