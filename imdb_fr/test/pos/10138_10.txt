The fact that the film is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience, while allowing the viewer to stay focused on the basic theme of the film. The story is filled with unexpected twists that prevent the viewer from determining the ending. In an instant, you think something is happening to Coach Jones or Radio. Well, yes, but certainly not what you would expect. <br /> <br /> The film does not become boring or sentimental and the acting performances of Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. are among the best of my opinion. The end makes you smile for a long time and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. Well, I guess that's what Michael Tollin and Mike Rich were trying to do. First class movie. <br /> <br /> Esbj√∏rn Nordby Birch. Denmark.
