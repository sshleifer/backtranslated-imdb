Latter Days was for me a very moving film. He showed how hard and disrespectful the gay community was. The film etherens the real passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters. The film expresses deep compassion for the gay community because it really speaks for the gay man / woman. Personally, I think it's high time that the homosexual community of all religions no longer hold their heads in shame, just to be beautiful there. The film really opened my eyes, because I could not believe how anti-homosexual this world was. Even at school, if a child does not like something, he calls it "gay". I really hope that more films like this one will be filmed and that they will not just be labeled as a "gay" movie but as a love story, because I think gay directors should defend themselves and tell their story. history through their eyes.
