I read on the web that this film is being turned into a theatrical feature film. Finally!!!!! It's time for Hollywood to pull itself together. The big studios are always afraid of edgy material, with Oscar written on it. Go understand !! <br /> <br /> JERICHO MILE was made ahead of its time. It's a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Michael Mann, a true visionary, has found a way to engage an audience without abuse. The Peter Strauss Emmy Award is probably the best character role I've seen in my movie viewing life. All actors who play this role will never be the same (unless an Oscar is already sitting on their coat). <br /> <br /> The multiethnic granular set, backdrop of THE JERICHO MILE, makes understand the delicate social dynamic of our world. It is a redemption without public validation and the power of the human spirit to overcome all barriers. Imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life, without the possibility of parole, without knowing that he is perhaps the fastest runner in the world. ... what would you do? <br /> <br /> This movie makes you forget not to have been cheated on any level. Totally exciting, engaging, emotional, and a soundtrack "Rolling Stones" that kills ass !!! <br /> <br /> I always thought that it would be made for the big screen ... Impatient of ...! !! In the meantime, I will have to keep looking at my altered VHS copy that I have had for many years.
