First, ignore the comment that South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing it now. Why should South Park blindly follow what other media do? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria. <br /> <br /> But all that aside, this episode is just funny. The portrait of Al Gore must be one of the best caricatures of a politician I have ever seen. It was original and based on people's opinions about the man. I do not want to give anything away, but he made me roll on the ground. <br /> <br /> There are also some of the best Cartman / Kyle moments of all time. <br /> <br /> All In all, I would say that this is one of the best episodes of the series, and I highly recommend it to anyone.
