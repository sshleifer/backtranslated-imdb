This film is a love story in the context of the war. Everything in the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD as soon as possible and watch it several times. The story ends at the beginning. I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She paid tribute to her father, her husband and her lover. The character had a lot of nuances. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have a happy ending. In addition to the angle of the love story, I reflected on how a beautiful, serene and peaceful island had been affected by the war and it made me aware of the real devastation that war can have on his people ... the government makes the decision while the people suffer. His father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she dreamed regularly. I loved the scene where she complained about not receiving dowry and I also loved the scene where both lived the earthquake. They were survivors.
