This is an unusual film of cassia / caper, which seems predictable at first, then surprises until the last scene. The protagonist is a scribbler who goes to work in a small carnival, where he is paid to kill the woman's belly dancer, Divana, who ends up falling for herself. She is seductive, delicate and deadly and she continues to disappear and resurface as a sort of magician's trick. Other film accessories include her husband / employer duplicous (played by the talented Armand Assante), some villainous mobsters Dominicans and the most important for the plot, a suitcase full of money. Just like the old "shell game", the one in which you have to guess which is the pea, you guess who has the money, and like the victims of the killers who organize such games, you will probably be wrong to guess. . Dagma Dominczyk, also a charming Divana, is a talented, eye-catching performer, dancing with the huge snake around her shoulders, or working her claw on all the unfortunate men in her orbit. Norman Reedus is well like the young crook who is baffled by the elusive beauty he has been paid to kill. Do not count it, however, because it turns out to be smarter than anyone else would credit it. This strange film is worth the detour.
