I am a passionate fan of ff7, for example, I have the game then I sell it (bad mistake) but I buy it again (good mistake ... erm) <br /> <br /> whatever Anyway, this movie is very good, the fights are very cool, the music is very good, and the CGI can not weaken. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed with the film I felt is the lack of involvement of the other characters, it's almost all super character, you can not beat a cid and a barret . <br /> <br /> but despite this, the film was excellent in my opinion, and must be seen absolutely. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie gives and will give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> squaresoft, make more movies like this and you will be revered more than you are already !!!!
