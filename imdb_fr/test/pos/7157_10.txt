Forgetting Franklins is the best movie I've seen in years. The acting was fantastic ... especially Mari Blackwell who was truly outstanding as Peggy Lester. She brought Peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my neighbor next door. I also enjoyed Robertson Dean in the role of father ... he is a true professional and has managed to achieve the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. The performances of all the actors were very good, excellent, but the role played by Peggy in Blackwell made the film. The cinematography has been beautifully done and impressive. The only criticism I can make is a slight weakness of the final scenes, too stretched, repetitive and a little too centered on the bad character. I wish it ended on a note of forgiveness ... but despite this slight flaw, it is really worth watching and the applause of all those who participated in its creation.
