I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005. I went with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank, it must be at least decent. Well, after a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite satisfied with the final product. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that English accentuated by Afrikaaner and Xhosa (?) Some actors was a bit difficult to understand but looked like "Waking Ned Devine", "Trainspotting" or any other movie with actors with strong accent, I adjusted after about 15 minutes and I was trying to understand why Hilary Swank was supposed to be South African and seemed to want to try to accent an accent but seemed very American ... as if she was trying faintly to do it, but later in the movie, more and more information about her character and about moving to the United States as a teenager, you begin to understand how she might have lost a part or most of his accent, so it seemed logical that only certain words have a sense of the Afrikaaner language. <br /> <br /> I know it's a bit weak to use the film as an education but one of the great benefits of this movie is that i It was interesting to see the dramatization of a trial of truth and reconciliation. After the fall of apartheid, I had heard about the T & R process in South Africa, but I did not really know how it worked. <br /> <br /> The final verdict is that even if some scenes felt a little bit This movie was overall very strong. The final sequence where the "truth" was revealed was the perfect finish expected by all films. A must for anyone who cares about what is happening outside their borders.
