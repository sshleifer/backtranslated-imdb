Treat Williams has achieved some celebrity with this movie and has really squandered it. Do not be fooled by his poor movie choices since. This film really stands out. "Hair" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably even more of the personality, of the famous peace movement of the 60s. There is a lot of spectacular music made in a spectacular way. Unlike video clips from the late 70's, 80's and 90's, video flashes coincide with the subject of music. In other words, video makes sense when it's associated with songs, so you know it could never have been shown on MTV. The subject is about drugs and hippie status, but it is mostly an anti-war film about the senseless tragedies of Viet Nam. One of the protagonists is a boy from Oklahoma who intends to change things, believing he is being spoon fed by a patriotic dribble. He comes across a gang in New York that is more or less glorified. their characters are very unique, and probably would not make sense today, but they get together by burning their drafts. What follows in spectacular landscapes and fascinating scenes involving not only the three protagonists, but also the other three members of the gang, as well as a newcomer with a small child, whose entry is easily one of the Ten greatest movie entries of all time, partly because she sings one of the greatest songs of this generation. Despite their faults, you come to love these people, a cinematic triumph with a thrilling heart and a grand finale.
