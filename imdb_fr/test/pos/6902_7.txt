This film was fun, if it was omnipresent. <br /> <br /> It basically follows the comic heckling of two 19th-century tomb robbers in England, who switched from conventional body-capture to the trafficking of vampires, zombies and extraterrestrial Roswell dead. (I do not know what the stranger Roswell was doing in there, and the producers either, I think.) <br /> <br /> But was it fun? You bet. Even Ron Perlman, who is often the kiss of Direct to DVD Death, was pretty good in this film as a priest who turns out to be the leader of a rival gang of body thieves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy watching this hilarious little movie, and a good example of what you can do when you do not have a larger-than-life ego on either side of the camera.
