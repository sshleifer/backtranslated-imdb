ROMEO AND JULIET had been interpreted in many ways, but very few versions reflected the essence of the play. The few that I can think of that really marked the spirit of romance were WEST SIDE STORY and, believe it or not, TROMEO AND JULIET by Troma Film. At first glance, this is another simple splashing party, and many would think it bastardized the Shakespearean classic. However, the film has an honest sense about it. Updated to appeal to today's ill-minded youth, of course, but not without merit. Yes, frequent mutilations, bodily piercing, car accidents, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest are in bad taste, but what harm is it to live a sweet love story? ? Even though most of the actors in this movie are (I mean, this is Troma, after all), the two main roles have a real chemistry, more than in the big budget monstrosities TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO. There is a lot of modernization, but much of the original text is intact, especially when Tromeo and Juliet are together. There is a great scene where Juliette pronounces the famous "Parting is so sweet", and Tromeo follows quickly, in the grunge fashion of the 90s, "Yeah, that sucks totally." I think it is really unfortunate that this film does not receive the recognition or the film of exit that it deserves. I hope that people who see this in music stores will not be put off by the rudeness of the film because they lack a subversive experience.
