The film is based on a book by Jules Verne that I read once, about ten years ago. I remember that I really liked the book and that the film tells the story well. The most important thing about this movie is not the story, however, but its very original visual aspect. <br /> <br /> The graphics are absolutely beautiful and they are apparently achieved through a clever combination of cartoons combined with live actors, a stop-motion animation and painted sets so that they look like a lot to an animated film. Combined with the unique versions of Jules Verne's aircraft and submarines and the good directors of Karel Zeman, he produces a very successful and convincing visual style that manages to retain his attention effectively until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> There are some problems too, one of the underwater scenes at the end takes perhaps unnecessarily a lot of time, for example, because the story of the first part of the film is covered rather quickly . None of this matters because the movie is always very nice. A jewel that also deserves to be better known to the public today. A movie recommended for the whole family.
