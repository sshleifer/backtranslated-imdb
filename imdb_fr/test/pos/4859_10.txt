This film has some punch. There are some from time to time that make me think deeply and bother me a lot. I saw myself in the same situation: passively allow things to happen around me, not to defend the right and the good, but simply to try to avoid trouble. How often do we avoid making waves or pinching our heads? How often does our inaction tolerate the bad deeds of others. We would never join them, we tell ourselves, we recognize that what they are doing is bad, but are we doing something about it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a discreet and nerdy office worker who paid for his house in Brooklyn, New York, on the eve of the Second World War. He rarely cares about what's going on around him, never gets married, rarely meets, goes to work and takes care of his invalid mother. Then a series of events in his small neighborhood very "white" pulls from his shell complacent in a whirlwind of events. It begins as he sees from the window of his room the rape of a Puerto Rican girl by the son of his neighbor. Shortly after, he has glasses because of poor vision. As he is now better able to see, he becomes less able to cope with the circumstances of his life. The only positive point is a new love in his life, and he gets married in the hope of continuing to live normally. Then virulent anti-Semitism in this street takes him, despite his references as a Presbyterian WASP. As the situation degenerates, he discovers that he must make an important decision: does he take a stand or simply disappear? <br /> <br /> I can not see how anyone can see this movie without being affected and having a lot of thought about themselves and what they really represent. Post-war anti-Semitism is the framework here, but there is an injustice at any time and in any place. It is up to the individual to decide where he is.
