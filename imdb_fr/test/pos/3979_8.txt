For my part, I was very eager to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Even though I knew it would be another type of Revenge of the Nerds movie, I was always impressed. <br /> <There is a lot of truth about this type of learning and we strongly believe that it should be allowed in a "new style of schooling". <br /> <br /> Conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know. <br /> <br /> This approach to teaching should be more sought after in real theoretical courses. <br /> <br /> Although there is still too much In the festive scenes, it was obviously necessary to cast a shadow - in the interest of Hollywood to make a comedy on the college ... even if we all know that life is not really like that, far from it. <br /> <br /> An incredible touch, always funny and with a deadly end. <br /> <br /> An impressive end. Crucial for the whole story and very surprising. <br /> <br /> Without the final scene, the film would have been half as good. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and it did not have to have too much swearing, nudity or coarse jokes for it to be good. <br /> <br /> The team and the cast are great, the story and even the generic cast of the mandatory members of "Hampton frat" have been very successful. /> <br /> American Pie 1, 2 3 and American Wedding or whatever clones that allow those who do not measure it at 1/3. humiliating and humiliating jokes to make someone vomit. <br /> <br /> I liked it, even if it was simple ... it was interesting and I even had a heart ... my only regret to watch this film is that it does not was over.
