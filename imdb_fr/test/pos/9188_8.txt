It was a movie that, in the end, I thought, "It's been a pleasant 2 hours!" I do not like to spend about 20 dollars (my baby and myself included) so that my husband and I have this feeling "everything was ok". <br /> <br /> I think I like Will Smith better as an action hero. He was well started in that. His character was very nice, as was Kevin James. <br /> <br /> There were several scenes of laughter. It's also a romantic film, so if you want to impress the lady of your life, bring her. Women will love as much as any chick movie, but I would not say that as one. There is a lot of humor for men. I think this is one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. He has romance and slapstick. Usually, I do not like the slapstick, but it's not exaggerated and I can not think of any of these scenes that do not move with laughter. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie. The first thing my husband told me after everything was finished was "I want to see him again!"
