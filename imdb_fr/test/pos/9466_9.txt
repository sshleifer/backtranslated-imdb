This film is full of charming situations and healthy young people, easy to watch, whether they are wearing clothes or not. The strong superstructure of his plot is confirmed by the art of Shakespeare. As Joseph Papp discovered in the 1950s in Central Park, Shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the mores and customs of the present. And so the classic stories of travesty and other evils found in comedies as light as Twelfth Night and Eve and a summer night and As You Like It are well used in this film. All the young actors and actresses do a good job to advance the plot with their blockage, their dialogue and their costumes. And the idea of ​​a football game to bring things to a climax reminds me of Bend It Like Beckham, another lovely mature movie.
