As stated and indicated in many previous reviews, this unique series presents many excellent elements and ingredients. Indeed, more than 20 years after its initial broadcast, it is still watched, watched again, and has a huge fan success, which should indicate that the manufacturers of this series have undeniably got something right. <br /> The source of the show's brilliance and remarkable appeal lies however in the fact that it relies on a wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters? who are all animated by wonderful actors. The characters are wonderful especially because of their complexity. Unlike many other adaptations of Robin Hood, and many other film and television productions in general, the good ones of this series often make mistakes and can be perceived as having apparent defects, while the bad guys, although presented as evil and ruthless, can often be understood and even sometimes seem very friendly. That's a lot of Robin Sherwood in a story about REAL people with multiple facets ?? rather than good and bad people ?? something that adds a lot to its unique character and remarkable appeal. In addition, although it is really a series full of activities with many amazing stunts (which is remarkable in itself, it was done well before the computer animation, green screens, etc.). ). So, behind each of those endless guys who fall castle walls, horses, and catch fire, there is actually a real person who has fallen from a castle wall or horse or fire), there always has an amazing dialogue between the different characters of each episode. In the final analysis, however, they are usually the villains of the series. Nickolas Grace as sheriff of Nottingham, Robert Addie as Sir Guy de Gisburne and Philip Jackson as Abbot Hugo de Rainault ?? who get the best lines and who often steal the show with their witty and empathic arguments. "It's a wedding, not a party!" is just one of their many timeless "pearls of wisdom" that seem to follow each other in life :-). <br /> <br /> 20 years after the fact, it is indeed hard to believe that Sherwood's Robin was originally something made for television ?? and apparently not with a lot of money ?? to provide fugitive entertainment on Saturday afternoons to small children in Britain. Filmed in beautiful places, with astute and surprising scripts, remarkable stunts and fantastic actors ?? many of them give the performance of their lives in this show? in many ways, it seems to be done in a more professional way and have more production value than many Hollywood movies.
