I just managed to find a copy of "Mission Cleopatra", which is not as easy as you might think for someone living in the United States. So far, I have only watched the first 10 minutes of the film and I can say without fear of laughter that I laughed more during these 10 minutes than when I watched the entirety of the * first * film in direct from Asterix. <br /> <I'm watching the dubbed version, and although the dubbing work is a little disconcerting, I found the film very funny and faithful to the book. I see that people here have said that the dubbed version was much lower than the subtitled version, that may be true, and after watching the subtitled version (also on my DVD), I may should come here and edit my review. As it stands now, I find it a very entertaining film, and that largely offsets the mess they caused from the first movie.
