Okay, I'm not sure it counts as a spoiler, so I just ticked the box to avoid the hassle. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the opinions on this film seemed to be a fair division. Personally, I loved it, although I must say that I think some cameos were there for the sake of having a cameo. (Peter Kay?) Personally, I'm just grateful that it was not the show of Edward, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou, and that they chose the top 3 characters in the series to caption the film, especially Sir Goeff Tipps, probably the funniest of the group. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's less a summary than a pretty obtuse blog, but damn it, the movie was great, and I guess that's all that matters.
