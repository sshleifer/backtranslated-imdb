*** SPOILERS *** For a strange reason, Oliver Stone's "Talk Radio", based on Stephen Singular's "Talked to Death" book and Eric Bogosian's movie star's play, on the murder of Host of the Denver television show, Alan Berg, in 1984 got the recognition that he deserved so well. The 1988 film was sufficiently prophetic to recognize the clandestine movement that was developing in the farm and hinterland of America. Some seven years later, a movement gave birth to an angry and angry Gulf War veteran, Timothy McVeigh, who hates the actions of the US government in Wacco, Texas, and his friend Terry Nichols, who made explode the US federal building in Oklahoma City. On April 19, 1995, 168 people were killed, the worst act of terrorism on American soil so far. <br /> <br /> The film is, as far as I know, the first time that a major branch of the entertainment media has mentioned and developed the novel of the rural militia "The Turner Diaries" of the late William L. Pierce, who has since become a scary underground classic. "The Turner Diaries" predicts a national and utterly disastrous terrorist attack, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, against a US federal facility, the FBI Building in Washington DC <br /> <br /> The station Dallas, KGAB radio station, Barry Eric Bogosian, of Champlain, is the most-rated show in the Dallas listening area and is about to become national. Barry is highly rated for his quick wit and abusive behavior while on the air. Stalking all comers and avoiding all the problems, as unpopular or taboo as they are, made Barry the most listened to and hated man on the radio. Barry being a showman at heart and not thinking that his speech can lead to violence maintains his aggression towards his call listeners while his note goes up to the celling. But there are those in the listening audience, mostly extreme right-wing types, who do not show themselves too kind with their face-to-face attitude. One of them decides to take things in hand at Barry's expense. <br /> <br /> The tragic spectacle of Eric Bogosian in the tragic role of Barry Champlain, who went from entertainment to harsh reality during his actions on the radio. Thinking that it is not so important to be wanted and murdered for his opinions on the radio whose enemies do not like, he discovered too late that there were some who were crazy enough to hurt him outside. Also in the movie "Talk Radio" is a very young Alic Baldwin in the role of Dan, the boss of Barry, who tries to soften him but ends up adopting his style of talk show since he kills the competition without realize that it's finally him. that he will end up being killed. <br /> <br /> Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are the two women of Barry's life: his ex-wife Ellen, and now Laura's talk-show lover and lover, whom Barry uses to his advantage and almost ends up lose them at the same time. The 1988 Talk Radio is so far ahead of its time that even if you look at it now in 2005, you still think it's too disturbing to be shown to an overly sensitive and sensitive American audience.
