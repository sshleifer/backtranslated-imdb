I watched this movie Saturday afternoon on the cable. Dude, that dragged on. I had the metaphors, the symbolism and all that. No, I did not care about the characters' sexuality. But the pace of the story and the scripts almost drove me to sleep. <br /> <br /> It's like that ... until Ruth Marshall is naked. If you are a man in the breast who is not homophobic, you can rent it. Ruth has a hot lesbian sex scene, then a straight sex scene that far exceeds the price of most movies. His jiggly cups were worth a look at the movie. <br /> <br /> --The Mighty Avatar
