Winters end of Sarah Plain and Tall was the best movie I have ever seen. The person in the story I preferred was Cassie, played by Emily Osment. Just because of her energy and the way she talks. For example, when Anna calls from the city, Cassie wants to answer and says, "Hello? Anna assumes what. Grandpa was lost but he is back now and he is not a good man! I loved all the movies Sarah Plain and Tall for my rankings. I think Sarah Plain and Tall was # 3. Skylark was # 2. The end of the winters was # 1! If I could live in a family of the past, it would have to be the Witting family. I think there are so many good roles in this movie that I can not name them all. I think they chose the best and the best actors to play all those characters in the movie, so if you want to watch a movie from the past, I would highly recommend Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters.
