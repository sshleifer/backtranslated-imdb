It's a cult movie for several reasons. First because of the phenomenal success of a musical on Broadway and London, then a musical film. The film is close to the play and part of the provocation of the play is no longer provocative twelve years later. The speech against the Vietnam War is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song showing how the youth of the late 1960s succeeded in destroying the political establishment. Milos Forman plays with certain situations in the late 1970s, such as narrow-minded justice, egocentric umbilical justice of the rich or the little ones who have only a higher power rank than those who are powerless. He also plays a lot with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he builds all the time. The film is nice and thoughtful. And of course, it is an extraordinary pleasure to remember those years when we had the privilege, and it was not a chance, to live them. On November 11, 1969, Nixon ordered the mass celebration for the 1918 Armistice, which became the order for teachers of all levels to take their students to celebration and march, thus supporting the invasion. Cambodia was in full swing. And some dare to give lessons of democracy to foreign countries. I also remember the long campaign for the dismissal of Nixon in 1973-74, which eventually led to his resignation and the swearing-in of Gerald Ford, first vice president and ultimately president of the United States, who had not was elected vice-president by the Senate after Spiro Agnew had to resign to face a trial, conviction and sentence for embezzlement. Of course, this reminds us that today, in 2000, a US president was not elected by the people but by the Supreme Court, or by a war that had been rejected by millions of people in the United States. the whole world from the beginning and even before the beginning. and was launched against the best judgment of the United Nations and three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on respect for others. The modern Western man seems to have trouble understanding that the world is changing and that he has already largely and wisely changed. Western modern man seems to be a bit out of sync and needs special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority of the world to be in the majority, and that the West is far from that majority, and that if the Soviet bloc had to understand that the market economy is not capitalism, but that the market economy can be socialist or capitalist, the Berlin Wall would have fallen, but in the opposite direction, and that China has learned wonderfully well this lesson and that it is at the foot of the wall that it has climbed to learn that their socialist market economy must lead to a political democracy, but they will, just like Vietnam was able to rebuild itself after thirty years aggression and damage caused by the war. In other words, the hair is an ideal subject of reflection. <br /> <br /> Doctor Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
