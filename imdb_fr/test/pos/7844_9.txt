It is a wonderful film that takes place during the romantic period of the Civil War. This film is a must for Eastwood fans and Eastwood says it's one of his favorite movies. I could not agree more. Be careful! This is a spoiler - Eastwood dies in the end. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightly argued that the end should be unexpected and unfortunate for several reasons. They wanted to stick to the book, for one. Second, there can not be a happy ending. Third, it was written during the Vietnam War - they wanted a negative statement to this terrible battle of war where people would die needlessly. I agree with all that. It's a wonderfully filmed film and I like most of the films about civil war. It's more a portrait of how misleading women can be - that they can be more dangerous than men, therefore, the title has a lot to do with the BEGUILED movie's statement - to be cheated. The song sung by Eastwood at the beginning and end of the film is another statement against not only the civil war but also the Vietnam War and perhaps indirectly the women he met during the film. Beautiful story of love and disappointment and many memorable scenes - NOTE: This film is rated R for no reason. There is almost no language, it's probably a question of sex - but there is not really any nudity. Excellent movie - 9/10.
