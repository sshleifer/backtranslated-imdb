With wine, friends and good mood, I had a great time watching this movie. I especially enjoyed the performance of Jilon Ghai (under the name of "Randy"), who was such a kick in the pants! Her scenes with Charity Rahmer ("Michelle") were extremely funny. I would not want him to come see me, but it was great to watch "Randy" try to score with "Michelle" and even better to see the results! Of course, the girls in the movie are very fun to watch too. AND, one of my friends showed me the PLAYBOY number that had Pilar Lastra as the playmate of the month. She is really a spectator. Overall, this film perfectly served its purpose, which was to entertain us lightly and without worry.
