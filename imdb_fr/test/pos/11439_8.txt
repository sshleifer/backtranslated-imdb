"The Gig" is a tight, funny and poignant little movie about a group of friends meeting regularly to play Dixieland. Unexpectedly, the group gets a real lucrative job, as the musician says a "concert". <br /> <br /> They travel to upstate New York for a two-week summer resort concert, minus one member, who is retiring due to cancer. At the last minute, they hire a professional to replace him. Things get stuck when a guy from Frankie Valli tries to get back to the hotel and uses the band as his band. <br /> <br /> The attitude that the professional bassist gave to the guys has always been true. By registering to play the two-week concert, they took bread out of the mouth of someone who needed it to feed his family. While the stars of pop, rock, rap, country and western, and R & B, make money with their albums. Jazz musicians have to travel abroad to earn a living. Almost no one gets rich. The guys who live their dreams also cost others a needed income. <br /> <br /> I think almost anyone who knows how to play a musical instrument dreams of playing a paid "concert" one time or another, Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two popular examples of this amateur crossover -professional. I particularly recommend this film to anyone who has already played music professionally. My mother, who was a musician, loved it.
