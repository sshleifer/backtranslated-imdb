Just watched this and it was amazing. I seriously doubted the DVD rental or not. So, if you are ... and enjoy watching action movies without brains ... do not hesitate. Do not let the matte cover put you off. The script is one of the best ever. Inteligent, funny, original, touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat throughout the film. I had already watched another movie just before this one and I was really tired, and I usually miss watching a second movie in one night, but this one really made me wake up and I don ' I did not have boring moments. It also led me to rethink many things in life and to give me a really positive feeling. <br /> <br /> The role of actor is also excellent (one of the best roles of Kevin Spacey). The visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen. If I have to find something negative to say about it ... well ... I can not really find anything ...... Enjoy! 10 of 10
