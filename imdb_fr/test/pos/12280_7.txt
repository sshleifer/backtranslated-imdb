The copy of this film that I saw is not very good. It is granular and has almost no color in some parts. He switches between English and French, often in the middle of a sentence and sometimes even in the middle of a word! To make matters worse, there are no English subtitles in the French language parts, which I think represents at least a quarter of the film. But, surprisingly, the film is still very understandable and enjoyable even in this state, and I think that says a lot about the quality of the making of this film. <br /> <br /> This is an upscale western with excellent spaghetti acting, an interesting storyline and an excellent score. There is also a cool protagonist, a beautiful girl with dark hair, strange characters and events and a general feeling of melancholy. "Euro" is written in this film. <br /> <br /> I hope there is a negative or a blank impression of this movie somewhere, because it deserves a quality DVD release, and when it comes out, be among the first to get it !
