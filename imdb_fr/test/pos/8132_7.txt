Although I saw this film dubbed in French, I'm sure he lost something in the translation, the lack of accents, etc., it was an excellent and fun film for a lonely night in a room of a hotel - a real mediocre one - that accurately and positively described the complexities of individual sexuality, the role of gender and the search for a place in the communities to which one is supposed to belong - men, gay, urban, 30 years, etc. television for portraying such an honest and positive portrait of the gay community. While the fact that the main gay character ends a little "directly" at the end is slightly disappointing, that's life, and it happens sometimes. It's a great movie, whether alone or with a date! A really nice experience.
