Let's eliminate the flaw right away - the film should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant and fascinating man who led a complex and difficult life. There was simply no way to do everything - or even touch everything - in a standard-length movie. Given this, the directors of this film did an admirable job (and I'm sure it's pretty painful) to put together a film that could not tell the whole story, while still creating a representative sample of the man and his music. Ray Charles's forces were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither amplified nor sugared. We could have wished for an extra hour on his life after 1980, but I imagine that it would have tended to turn the film into a tribute and allow to solve several problems left in suspense at the end, balance I guess it was better as presented. <br /> <br /> Let's move on to the big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? Our wife and I have seen countless movies in our years, but we immediately agreed that we had never seen a performance equal to Jamie Foxx's. The demarcation line between the actor and the character was not fuzzy, but disappeared completely. Before we saw the movie, we had heard a lot of hype, but it was strange. Foxx was Ray Charles. You did not watch the movie with the feeling that you watched Foxx do a remarkable job in describing Ray Charles - you watched him believe or understand that you were watching Ray Charles himself. I do not know how to say it differently. We were completely blown away. I admit we have not seen all the other performances for an Oscar this year, but it does not matter. Foxx has taken this problem to the limit, a level we had never seen before, and we doubt we could see it again. I can not think of any other film I have ever seen in which a person playing such a complete and convincing role has become the person represented. We salute you, Mr. Foxx. We understand that the awarding of an Oscar is much more than performance, but whether you win or not, we want you to know that you have done something that is in a category of its own and you should be extremely proud of your unprecedented achievement. <br /> <br /> PS The music was naturally great. I pointed out to the woman that if there was a moment in the history of music that I would have liked to witness, that would have been the genesis (in Kansas City, is not it?) From What'd I Say? The movie did a great job with her - I wish I could be there!
