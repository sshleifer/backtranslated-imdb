The Gershwin family surely realizes it's one of the biggest operas in the United States. You have thousands of fans of this opera waiting for its release on DVD. Please do not be so stubborn, give us a break. Think of the joy and wonder you can bring to a hungry audience for quality music by publishing this awesome GEM. Do not wait until the film is irreparable. The cast is top notch, the music is just great, we need some great music in today's world. It may never be shot with such a large cast. With today's home theater systems, exceptional sound systems and quality music, I beg the Gershwin family to reconsider and release this fantastic movie. thank you so much
