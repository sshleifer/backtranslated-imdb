I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was surfing on chains while on vacation. It's a great show, I just wish it was not so late at night. It is at 12:30. As a person who works, it's hard to watch all the time. <br /> <br /> I read some comments. I do not agree with the deceased about not growing up in the 60's and not believing it could happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60s. I am Hispanic and I had a boyfriend "white". Besides, we had black friends in high school. I believe that people get along because of their interests and personalities and that it has nothing to do with a certain race or color. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the show to go on DVD in order to buy it. In this way, I can see it from the beginning.
