A return to the "traditional" westerns of the 30s and 40s (like DODGE CITY), DALLAS has many assets a thrilling score of Max Steiner (KING KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY and others). In addition, there is a masquerade, a false identity, a false death and more traces of breath than a Republic soap opera. As always, Cooper defines what a man is under pressure. Forget the Western West of the 50's ... it's pure entertainment!
