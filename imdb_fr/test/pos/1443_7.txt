*** Spoiler in the fifth paragraph *** It was a surprisingly straightforward photo (uh-huh, uh-huh) for 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlyle Productions took a chance while doing it, the Motion Picture Association of America hesitated to certify a movie that openly shows a junky pricking a syringe filled with heroin in his arm. Frank Sinatra tried his luck by playing an addicted musician and falling flat in a role that required at least twice as much acting as ever. The film is a classic, but it is not perfect. <br /> <br /> Nelson Algren's novel may be fantastic, but he has too much to do in a two-hour film. "The Man with the Golden Arm" lasts 119 minutes and often seems much longer. However, in my opinion, it is not only Frankie Machine (Sinatra) who makes the film, but the other characters and their secondary intrigues, all involving Frankie. In the end, it's not just Frankie who has the addiction, everyone and everything seems to depend on him and he feels it deeply. When the pressure gets too strong, the drums begin to pound the soundtrack and Frankie crosses the street with his "friend" Louie well dressed. <br /> <br /> It's an exaggeration to say that Frank Sinatra's musical career was never in the doldrums, but in the early '50s he was in limbo between his tour days with big bands and the band. era of Las Vegas. "From Here to Eternity" established him as a serious actor and his singing career also rebounded, but "The Man with the Golden Arm" was still a daunting challenge, with the entire series sinking or swimming with his performance. He achieves this with such skill that for several minutes I had forgotten that I was watching Frank Sinatra, he had to know junky musicians and make the most of this knowledge. <br /> <br /> Next to Billy Wilder's masterpiece "The Lost Weekend" puts more emphasis on the sociological causes of addiction in "The Man with the Golden Arm" . While Don Birnem (Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend) seems to struggle mainly against himself, Frankie Machine is assaulted by outside forces and takes refuge in the needle. No approach is entirely right or wrong, mainly because the addiction is impossible to fully explain, but it seems that this film might have benefited from a little more insight into Frankie's internal struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of the problems I have with this movie is the cliche addiction of "leaving cold turkey". I realize that "The Man with the Golden Arm" was probably the sign of the trend rather than following it, but that does not make it any better. At the beginning of the movie, Frankie apparently took his habits with the help of a doctor and a treatment center. Naturally, the film's drama requires him to retreat, but I have found the American ideal that a man has to face alone his problems (or perhaps with the help of a good woman) irrelevant right here. Going into the shade and going up at sunset with Kim Novak seemed too unrealistic. The end of 'The Lost Weekend' was similar but, in my opinion, was a little less rosy.
