I will not lie. To say that this film is confusing is to say that the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen the previous films of cult director Richard Kelly, "Donnie Darko" and "Southland Tales", you know it has to mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. An hour after the beginning of the film, about half of the audience had already left. In the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what they had just seen. For my part, I can only understand about 40% of what I saw on the screen, and even then it can only be called an interpretation. So why did I give this movie seven generous stars? Because, on the one hand, we get spectacular performances (the best of Marsden and Langella returns as a familiar scary character), and especially two, because it's quite original and Richard Kelly, probably the one of the bravest directors in the world, uses story that dares to be different. Frankly, it's the ONLY way - it's only through Kelly's unique style that this story can be told as planned. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are not willing to think seriously about a smart movie (and even then it may not pay anything), stay away from it. But if you want to look at a deep, rich, complex and challenging article about the spirituality, existentialism and predictability of human nature, go see that. However, prepare for long discussions with your partner. <br /> <br /> * Note: If by any chance you have read this review, if I have followed my recommendation, if you have already seen the movie and do you believe that you have lost 2 hours of In your life, I would be happy to share my point of view on the meaning and the plot of the film. You see, that's why I liked it so much - it promotes discussion! As difficult as it may seem, I will try to summarize the situation by paraphrasing a rather depressing quote from Langella's character, who explains the importance of the simple box to an employee: "Your house is a box in which you live. When you return home, you sit in front of a box with moving images, you look until the mind and soul are decomposing and the box that is your body is degraded, when finally you are placed in the ultimate box ... to rest under the ground and the earth ".
