If people were really so stupid, I could be the SRW - supreme ruler of the world. In it, Knotts plays a small-sized bean counter for a small town in Jerk Water, led by a group of twisted simpletons that are barely brighter than him. When things seem a bit fragile for crooks, they'll take a picture of the Figg pigeon. Lots of laughs as Knotts performs his usual heckling act. I particularly enjoyed the stage of the extension; asininity at its highest level.
