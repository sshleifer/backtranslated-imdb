Of the Korean films I saw, only three had really stuck me. The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters. The second and third - and now fourth - are all Park Chan Wook movies, Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, and now Thirst. Park reminds me a little Quentin Tarantino for his irreverence towards conventions. All his films are shocking, but not in a free sense. It is rather as if he showed us what we did not think to see - situations that go radically against the mores of society, such as incest or a libidinous priest, bloodthirsty and devout. He is also quite artistic on the cinematographic level and his films are among the most beautiful I have seen. <br /> <br /> Thirst is all that - talking about the priest and the repressed woman and without conscience he falls for - and more. It's a horror, a drama and even a comedy, while Park disarms his audience of many inappropriate and humorous situations. As such, this is perhaps his best work to date, as the other two films I saw lacked the element of humor that would have made them more enjoyable for reruns.
