I really do not complain about this movie except for the disturbing scenes with the body. I fell on it by tilting around the TV one night. The acting was amazing, I did not expect it to be better than it looked! I thought that Keanu (who looks like SAME since 1986, which is a very good thing hehe) was really great to act and Crispin perfectly interpreted his character! This film is a hidden gem! This is a new awakening of the reality of the 80s, compared to other teen movies made by the pack (although I really like these films). In the end, I raise my thumbs!
