"Valley Girl" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80's version of "Romeo and Juliet". This is a specific example of a classic 80s teen. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have a brilliant performance in this film, but this one will never become better than "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" as the ultimate film for 80's teens, without the presence of "Fast Times "then the generation of 80 teen movies would be just a blow to the head. It's certain.
