But a big casting! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure that any description of the film and the plot will make you look at this one. Suffice it to say that he has something for almost everyone: death, singing, a glittering suit, cell phones, a little person (pretty woman, in fact), a drawbridge (modern, not medieval) ), a boombox and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic. And Barry Manilow. <br /> <br /> You will have to trust me when I tell you that 50% of you hate hate this movie because of the absence of the Absurd gene in your DNA constitution. It's not your fault; it's hereditary. The other 50% of you will probably want to change channels after 20 minutes, but you will have to keep watching. <br /> <br /> Even at that, at the end, you may wonder why you watched ... but keep going. in the spirit of this absurdity. He should push on you. It's a test.
