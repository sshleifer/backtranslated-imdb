My roommate and I received free tickets for pre-selection. I guess you could call him in Atlanta, Georgia, at Atlantic Station. Upon entering, I expected something controversial, provocative, overly exaggerated, and so on. But the film is much more than that. It's the story of two people helping each other. This is not excessive, and the film is done in a careful balance so as not to make you cringe or say it's useless. <br /> <br /> He is very well prepared and does not take himself too seriously. That's the beauty of it. If she tried to take herself seriously, she would have failed miserably, but she would rather be through humor (some unintentional) and some surprisingly good deeds of Ricci. Although Timberlake fails miserably in his role, the movie is good enough for you to put that aside. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film, if for no other reason than it is different. to discover.
