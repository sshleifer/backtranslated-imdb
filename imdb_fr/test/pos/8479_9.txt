A conference on the life of the tormented magician named Ray Charles. His impulses on the piano made fire music and his nostalgic voice created exciting and cool tunes. Every barrier Ray was confronted with never held him back and he found himself everywhere in the conflicts. A real lesson. A great team of producers is helping to recreate the times. Armed with costumes, hair and beautiful scenery, we will follow the story of Ray, convinced of his direct shooting! Icy music freezes and gives goose bumps to the audience with intelligent sound editing. But the most important part of the movie is Jamie Foxx. His game is really beautiful, the most brilliant ever. He lives his role. He is the ray of light.
