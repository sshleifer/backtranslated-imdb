It's an excellent documentary about a story I had never heard of. The first solo and nonstop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-1969 and involved a handful of runners. It's a really fascinating story about man versus nature and man against himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure of this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with footage filmed by sailors aboard their boats. The story is very moving and sad when we learn the details of Donald Crowhurst's story. This is one of the best documentaries of recent years. It contains a real human emotion as men face the almost impossible task of navigating the world non-stop.
