I was fortunate to attend the screening of this remarkable short film by Joshua Leonard before his first appearance at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. In twelve brief but exquisite minutes, Leonard takes us on a journey that changes a lifetime and explores one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society. The film embodies an elegant direction, moving performances and a heartbreaking story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate like the two lovers. And, in his first adventure in the dramatic narrative, Leonard turns out to be a director with a promising future. I think this short film should be extended to a feature film. It's hard to describe the talent, but as this first movie shows, you know it when you see it!
