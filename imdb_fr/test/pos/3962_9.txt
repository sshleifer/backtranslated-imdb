It is a funny and intelligent film that is well worth your time. In my opinion, it is much better than American Pie and other films of the same kind that seem to be knocked out all the time. I had not heard about this movie, so I guess it did not have a lot of press, which is a shame. It does not take too seriously but at the same time sends a serious message to people about the life and experiences of life and what is important ... Unlike a movie about a bunch of desperate guys trying to fucked for the first time and a guy sticking her d ** k in a pie, but in the end everyone gets fucked and whoop-of-do ... One thing that impressed me is that the soundtrack was pretty impressive and not the nerdy American pop-punk ... they actually had a real punk of the time, like the Ramones ... That made the movie better! To be honest, I did not expect much from this film and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of a comedy.
