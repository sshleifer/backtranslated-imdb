this particular title is very interesting. the whole movie was like watching an RPG ninja, which is really cool. three magic swords, three clans, a horrible demon, a political power, yotoden has everything to please. the animation is decent, but a little grainy, the story is top, and the fight scenes are really cool. One thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters. they are pretty weird. If you like the reign of blood and the scroll ninja, it's yotoden you have to see.
