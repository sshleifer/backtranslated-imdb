Isabel has just been released from prison. She is determined not to return, but life is difficult for the ex-convicts, especially if they are homeless, like Isabel. When she finds the one who was her boyfriend Rufo, she can see a glimmer of hope, but Rufo is now not only a drug addict but also an AIDS sufferer. That will not force Isabel to surrender, because if she wants it, she will be able to fight for her future, to have a normal life, with a house and a family. A very hard and touching film that most Spanish cinemas have ignored, the actors are great and the story is very touching. Perhaps a better treatment of the secondary characters would have improved the film, but it's really good. I highly recommend watching it, but know it's not a happy Disney movie, it's tough and dramatic.
