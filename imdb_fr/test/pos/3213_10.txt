When the Gilmore girls started in Germany, I did not want to watch them because it was something that was not unique to me. it was a series and I did not even know anyone. later, I realized that Edward Hermann was part of the cast of Overboard (a film I absolutely adore). I had to watch it once with a friend and have never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is normal to have sex before being married and that it is normal to be a drug addict and eat anything that is unhealthy. I do not do these things all the time, but when I do these things, I feel a little like a Gilmore girl. even my boyfriend started to look at them and that says something. from season to season, scripts and stories were getting better. they are open minded and different from all other shows, you want to be like them.
