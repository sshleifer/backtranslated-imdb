What is your problem? Do you have anything better to do than sit on your big butts and blog about how you find something bad? Here's an idea: get out. That's right: get out of your mother's basement where you've lived for 13 years and go out. "But I can not leave! Star Trek is launched in 30 minutes and I still have not married this avatar on World Of Warcraft!" Oh my God, in this case, stay inside! Okay, I might have sunk out I mean, Star Trek is fine but I do not really look at it anymore. Anyway, do you really have to write bullshit about Mind of Mencia. It's a good show. Maybe you are only releasing your anger because this girl has dumped you in World of Warcraft. Or you are constipated. Try to put fiber in your diet.
