Charlie's War, Wilson's War, shows with irreproachable veracity how futile wars can be, especially for those who spend countless hours and have the financial means to finance them. Virtuoso performances and remarkably memorable characters allied themselves to a raging sarcastic scenario that catapulted the film, under the impulse of Mike Nichols, always unpredictable, at the top of the best of the year. Politics has never been so fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a member of the Texas Congress who is credited with winning the Cold War almost alone. Trailing between many drugs, women and Scotch, he is also unexpectedly interested in the events in Afghanistan and the terror of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Engaging the help of Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a CIA secret mission expert and Joanne (Julia Roberts), a wealthy socialist, he raises funds to provide Afghanistan with the rocket launchers and anti-tank armament they need to cause serious damage to the Russian army. By the end of the 1980s, the cold war would come to an end and funds would be removed immediately, eliminating any aid that would allow the nascent country to rebuild and recover. <br /> <br /> The game of actors is exquisite, although it is to wait actors more than accomplished. Much of this however should be attributed to the script, which allows each character to be undeniably well-developed and memorable. And a warm contribution from this credit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilariously honest. Tom Hanks delivers another unparalleled performance as Charlie Wilson, the man who did so much and still remains relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, a character both striking in his physique and in his twisted cynicism; the inimitable Hoffman shows once again the superb range of the characters he represents. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the film, with its generic character of snobbery and not so subtle accent. And then there's Wilson's "jailbait" group of young secretaries running to make him happy. Led by Amy Adams, always charming, each supportive role has her moments of joy. <br /> <br /> Defeating the Soviet Union has not been an easy task, especially considering the many conflicting goals between the different political leaders. "Why does Congress say one thing and do nothing?" questions an unhappy politician. "Tradition mainly," says Wilson. Everyone seems to want the end of the cold war, but eyes are closed to the atrocities committed in Afghanistan. A trip to Pakistan's war-torn refugee camps is needed to motivate Wilson, as well as his primary source of funding, Doc Long (Ned Beatty). Wilson uses strategic links with committees to increase arms funding in Afghanistan from $ 5 million to $ 10 million with a single command, but the president of Pakistan does not care about winning a war for so little money. At the end of the Wilson campaign, $ 1 billion is sent to the Mujahideen to shoot down Russian helicopters - the first step towards victory, as predicted by Wilson. Beyond the scope of the film, the unresolved turmoil in Afghanistan has created new, less immeasurable problems that Wilson presumably predicted. <br /> <br /> During Charlie Wilson's war, the main characters travel from the United States to Pakistan to Afghanistan, from Jerusalem to Egypt, but wherever they go, sarcasm follows always. There is a surprising amount of comedy in the film, as political nuances are generally serious. Hoffman provides jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue, just like Hanks, with his naturally spiritual pursuit ideals. In the beginning, a scene featuring Gust is continually introduced into Wilson's office as he tries to solve a legal problem with his gang of pretty girls ("you can teach them to type, but you can not teach them to growing breasts ") makes me think of a burlesque routine of the Marx brothers. <br /> <br /> The press is focused on the drug charges against Wilson, instead of the important problems of the cold war and the contradictory desire of the budget makers. Thanks to their help, it is clear that At the end of the film, politicians still do not realize what is really needed. And because the screenplay is so vivid and clever, some audience members may not be able to follow all the events with intense dialogue. But, as ignorant politicians have demonstrated about the difference between Pakistan and Afghanistan, this is essentially another argument to support Charlie Wilson's point of view. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie
