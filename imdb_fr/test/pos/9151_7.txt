Most of the silent films I saw were serious in nature, so it was fun to see one with a comic touch. The decor and some scenes from "The Beloved Rogue" evoke "The Hunchback of Our Lady" of 1923 relating to Parisian street scenes and the celebration of "King of Fools". John Barrymore describes the greatest French poet, Fran√ßois Villon, in a description that goes from the virtual slapstick to the tender love; At first, the image "water in wine" was rather amusing. <br /> <br /> It seems like times never change and it's interesting to see the movie make a compelling observation almost a century ago - Paris has a foolish reign for one night, while everywhere else have one all the time. Which truth. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Conrad Veidt in the film was a little surprising for this viewer, I only saw him in the role of Major Strasser in "Casablanca", strangely one of his latest movies. As King Louis XI, he is a monarch obsessed with astrology, cunning but suspicious, and it was a little disturbing to see how much he resembled Brad Dourif's character of Wormtounge from the last chapter of the trilogy 'The Lord rings'. We must not expect the King of France to maintain his confidence. That is why the Duke of Burgundy's ancestry (Lawson Butt) seemed all the more plausible because Villon did not have the opportunity to pose as one of the two leaders. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that the use of title cards were extremely spared, used only when absolutely necessary to advance the story. Without them, however, we would have missed a curious nugget. It seems that Villon has done his Parisian exile at the inn of the same chip! <br /> <br /> The impression I saw was of exceptional quality. It was the first-ever film presented in a set of Mill Creek Entertainment's 100-plus action-packed movies DVD, which speaks volumes about an eighty-year-old film. It is good that the silent era movies are now more widely available in this type of commercial format, making them accessible to a whole new generation of movie lovers. <br /> <br /> A question to ask: did it look like Conrad Veidt's? Did King Louis choose his nose on purpose, or as an inadvertent gesture that simply stayed away from the cutting room?
