When I went to see this movie, I thought it would be just another classy film I should have with my sister. In addition, Amanda Baynes' latest film was not so hot, which makes me doubt the film because it is the main actress. However, within 5 minutes, I laughed so much that I had tears in my eyes, the jokes were not "there", it took more then a second to understand it but very funny. The script was not too complex and did not allow me to understand the love triangle, but was very faithful to Shakepeare's original piece. I loved every minute that I fired a guy to two of me in an access to laugh lol! very embarrassing! I would definitely advise people to watch this movie, especially girls, because the guys in this movie are very hot! (Lol) so much that I risk having it on DVD.
