I'm writing this review right after hearing about Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a big loss and I'm writing about 2001: A ODYSSEE OF SPACE, because I have the feeling that it's Kubrick's consummate film, the one for which we will remember the most. It's a unique image that not only revolutionizes science fiction but also changes the way movies are conceptualized. This is probably the first American "art film" and has inspired George Lucas and other writers and directors. <br /> <br /> Apart from its visual grandeur, the film provokes so much discussion and analysis because so many people have so many different interpretations. Kubrick and his co-author Arthur C. Clarke had a vision, but we never really found out what was going on in their heads. Of course, the message behind this message is that the technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives, unless we are cautious. The end of 2001 is one of hope, a version of our rebirth by the return flight of the star child on Earth. This makes no sense to many, but savvy moviegoers will understand. <br /> <br /> Although 2001 does not have the black and perverse humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contains strong and eccentric characters that have filled his earlier works such as PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still think he would have liked to be remembered the most for that. On the contrary, HAL will be his most memorable, dangerous, deadly and artificial character. It was half a decade back when Hollywood was still producing uninspiring musicals and waking up to the new wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a non-conformist filmmaker who had made great movies to his taste, in his day and for everyone to marvel. We will miss him.
