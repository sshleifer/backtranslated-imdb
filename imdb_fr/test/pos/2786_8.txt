Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film captures a little known reality: that of the student studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, because the story begins, of course, there are some lulls on the middle section, and the story sometimes moves away from the main character, but the viewer does not bother, the film is young, fresh and light. - Heart, even if I do not agree with the idea that when we do Erasmus and come back, we are no longer part of this universe. But it's just me. The film is deep and at the same time very light. Cool and recommendable.
