Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting movie, which his fans will undoubtedly locate and see. <br /> <br /> Before starting the review, I would start by saying that if you have the chance to see it, Certainly, because it's worth watching, and is not the easiest movie in the world to spot. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the principle - Luke Wilson is Private Joe Bauers, Army Librarian deemed to have absolutely no outstanding attributes or blatant flaws, which makes him totally average in every respect. This, coupled with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a remarkable candidate for an experimental cryogenics procedure. A prostitute named Rita, jelly with Joe, was also retained by Upgrayedd, his abusive souteneur. Unfortunately, a few days after their freeze, the top secret project is abandoned and we forget about them. <br /> <br /> They wake up in 2505 and find that with the fall of society following the trends of recent times, everyone on Earth is only slightly smarter than a chimpanzee. The way "everyone" talks about Joe Bauers is perceived to be "faggy", just like someone who talks like Shakespeare would mock now, and a former professional wrestler is the president of the United States (actually, the one It's probably not so outrageous ... really). The best show on TV is called "Ow! My Balls!", Which seems like a very good thing, and not only is everything misspelled, but the signs seem to have run out of space for wording, leaving them well grouped end. <br /> <br /> It's a fun premise for a movie, but that's the problem - Aside from the initial premise, few things in the movie are really funny. What I mean by this is that the ideas that come to mind after reading the premise of the film are probably as funny as the film itself. Obviously, it's not terrible, but it probably could have been funnier. <br /> <br /> There are winners in the scenario, such as Starbucks now offering "happy endings" and people who place their blind trust in the misunderstood world. "electrolytes", but they are too few and far between, so unless you laugh hysterically whenever one of the fools of the future hides a heavy, profane phrase with little or no logic or intelligence, laughter may so be fairly spaced. <br /> <br /> It's unfair that everyone compares it to Office Space, because it's a very different film, but as a film, whatever it's been before, Idiocracy is a funny concept that will probably make you laugh a lot more in the first 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 5 out of 10 because it's nice, but do not do enough to lift it over the middle of the road.
