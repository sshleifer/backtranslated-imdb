USA The Movie is like this: you take a nap on a hot and long Sunday afternoon. It feels good to close your eyes and let worries go astray. Soon you are lost in one of those intense lucid dreams where you know you are dreaming, but you still can not wake up - not what you want. You follow the flow and you soon find yourself in some sort of strange Alice in Wonderland story, with characters you never thought you could imagine. They tell you all kinds of crazy things about war and peace while making you travel in the past and even the future. <br /> <br /> The dream begins to get heavier and you have the impression of following a path that you can not control. Maybe you want to wake up to try to open your eyes but you can not. Now there is destruction, sadness, confusion and scary voices that tell you what might be the truth or that could be lies. You see images that twinkle and change, then clarify, but do you even want to see what your brain creates for you? <br /> <br /> Finally, you are lost in a mythical world and you realize that the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It's finish. What are you waking up to? What do you do after? <br /> <br /> You may be able to write this dream because you know that dreams do not happen too often, and when they do it better, pay attention. <br /> <br /> Or maybe you'll make a beer and forget about it. Bad idea. Do not forget.
