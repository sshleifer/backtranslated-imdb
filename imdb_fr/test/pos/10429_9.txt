I do not understand why more people have not spoken on this subject, aside from the fact that maybe not many have seen it. It is an amazing cast of characters, one after the other, all made by the creator of the game. If you do not like the filmed pieces, you may not like it (after all, the pieces do not do not look good on TV), but it's a one-man show that will make you pay close attention. Highly recommended.
