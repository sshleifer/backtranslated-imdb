Pat Conroy's autobiographical book "The water is wide" is a bit of a "mountain staircase" in the South. Yet, despite the professor's counter-luck formula, "Conrack" really upsets the audience with every little breakthrough. and creative flash. These students (uneducated black children on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown to be learning, and their collective innocence with wide-eyed eyes is remarkably sweet. The band's only actor (Tina Andrews, an astonishing performer) plays the "tough guy" that Conrack has to crack, and once she falls in love with her, it seems like a breeze. But the story is not ready for a happy ending and I was not prepared for the silent simplicity of the finale. It's beautifully done. From time to time, the scenario changes course, but the director Martin Ritt is very intelligent to always rely on the solid presence of Jon Voight. Scenes like the one in which he drives his van expressing his frustrations by loudspeaker do not give much to say, but the whole movie is filled with episodes that arouse emotions, and the real end is their reward. ** 1/2 on ****
