In a genre in itself, this film has a limited audience and a close call coupled with a subtle nuance that permeates all production. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable piece of film, as timeless as a rare work of art. Featuring a Quebec era rarely seen in the cinema, the strength of Mon Oncle Antoine lies in the depth of his characters and the richness of the sets. Duplessis' Quebec, denominational and feudal, is brilliantly chosen as the backdrop that could only be achieved by pure Quebec wool. <br /> <br /> It would be too easy to resort to stereotypes, clich√©s and short-sighted myopic statements in this story. Yet the director chose to ignore forced imagery and focus on the essence of life in rural Quebec time. This makes this film exceptional by its authenticity without being pretentious in its presentation. If only contemporary motion pictures were to do the same, the public might not be forced to choose between the overflowing Hollywood Pablum who passes for the "To See" view. <br /> <br /> My Uncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. This will leave a lasting impression on all those who have already lived or visited Quebec. A classic. ********************************************* <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> Following: May 10, 2008 <br /> <br /> After reviewing some of the comments, it should be noted that My Uncle Antoine is NOT - and that he was probably not LESS CENTERED TO SERVE AMERICAN Hollywood-American cinema sales. A story of adulthood, certainly, but much more than just teens memories of the 1940s in Quebec. Viewers looking for subtle entertainment at the expense of complex character development will be deeply disappointed. Go watch the action / adventure / romance / comedy for fun. Watch My Uncle Antoine plunge into a society rarely seen, but absolutely remarkable, which has been neglected and ignored for too long. <br /> <br /> The Grapes of Wrath is hardly a thriller at the edge of the seat Yet the story and characters make this American classic a film that lasts. My uncle Antoine is in the same genre.
