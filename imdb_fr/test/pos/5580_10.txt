This is perhaps the television series that has the greatest potential. Production values ​​are in a class of their own. The characters are rounded and interesting. It's entertainment at its best. Some of the extraterrestrials are quite grotesque, but there is an underlying humor that makes it unavoidable. I hope this series will last many years and will have many benefits. Science fiction has had its bad press, some justified, but it's really a flagship science fiction series and I thank Henson for it. The best grades.
