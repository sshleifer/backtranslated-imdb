I really enjoyed this movie. I have a real sense of justice and an eye for an eye, and this film tells it to perfection. Glenn Ford is offered a very low price for his ranch by the great breeder of the valley; then one of his hands is beaten and shot "to help him decide to sell". When the hand of the ranch dies and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford seems at first reluctant to do anything, warning his men not to take matters into their own hands. But, that's just what he's about to do. I knew this movie was about to catch fire when it entered the living room and faced the guy (Richard Jaeckel, one of my favorite villain character actors) who had killed his ranch hand; after an exchange of dialogue with him, Glenn Ford slaps him and kills him. A little more justice, he kills this guy with the weapon that belonged to his murdered cow man. In a short time, we treat Ford to leave his ranch burnt, so that his men are entitled to ambush the crew of the other ranch; then Ford and his men press all the horses and cattle of the ranch of the great villain; then they come and burn the outbuildings and the big luxury house. Talk about getting even bigger. A lot of action in this movie. The story is not just about that, but I just recommend you watch the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who repeatedly showed what can happen when someone is judged badly, and I really enjoyed seeing him get old-fashioned justice.
