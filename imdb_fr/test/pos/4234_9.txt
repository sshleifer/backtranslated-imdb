I already commented on this awesome Chucky, but I had to do it again to say a few words about the film, when I saw it for the first time on a big balcony of a big theater. The movie was very entertaining at the theater and my first film Chucky at the theater, and it was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS !!! And the blood was shocking! The scene where the kid gets caught by the truck was incredibly happy! It was a great gore scene !!!!! And the end was so weird and shocking that she was making my pants. The idea of ​​having Chucky's seed was very, very weird and shocking! When I left the theater, I loved it and I could not believe it was real. The odd and different qualities of this episode of Play's Child for some reason led me to call it Jason's Play series going to hell. There was just this extremely shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminded me of Jason Goes To Hell. A sure ***** on *****. Here's how I classify the series: 1,4,2,3. I liked it but not as much as Tom Holland's classic Child's Play. I can not wait to see Seed of Chucky! Bring it on!
