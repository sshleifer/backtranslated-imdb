Black film at its best. Located immediately after the Second World War (1946), "Crossfire" describes the good, the bad and the ugly of that time. Monty Montgomery kills Sam because Sam is a Jew and is therefore automatically perceived through Monty's narrow lens as a slacker who came out of the war. Monty does not like people like that. The truth is that Sam was also a soldier, but the truth disappears when you feel good about the ideologies of hate in which you have been immersed and that the world is full of dirty things you need. mark of "cleaning". <br /> <br /> Monty is a sadist trying to win soldier's clothes. The losers of the Second World War also had more than their share, but also leaders and soldiers filled with hatred and prejudices. Some of them were hanged for war crimes, such as launching a "war of aggression". <br /> <br /> This film was in trouble with its creator when this other sadistic cleaner from America, Joe McCarthy, began his hearings in the 50's. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire", just to see how much an actor was Robert Ryan. The real Robert Ryan was not a Monty. He was a great actor, even though he was underrated, underused. <br /> <br /> See "Crossfire" and taste the dark side of post-war America. See also for a glimpse of the good side of America in the late 1940s. Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play leading roles. Mitchim could have played the role of Ryan, in fact, when he played the psychopath in "Cape Fear".
