The power and fame of Preston Sturgis was not seen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years, until the late 1990s, when it resurfaced and even appeared on television. Meanwhile, he had gained notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that Herman Mankiewicz's scenario - Orson Welles for KANE was based on the Sturgis scenario. As mentioned at the beginning of this thread for the movie on the IMDb website, Kael has exaggerated his case. <br /> <br /> There are about six narrators who take turns to deal with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the news movie (representing Ralston - the clone of Henry Luce), the memoirs of Thatcher, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond the Butler. Everyone has their own perspective on Kane, reflecting their faith, disappointment or hatred of man. And of course, everyone reveals their own mistakes when he tells his version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent repetitive redrawings of the same incident. <br /> <br /> This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE, he is a legendary entrepreneur. Here, it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who went from the bottom of the hierarchy to the head of the most efficient rail network in the country. But there are only two narrators: they are Garner's henchman, Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This limits the almost three-dimensional view that we sometimes get from Kane in Garner. Henry, when he talks, talks about his boss and his friend, whom he has respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only Henry's flaws. <br /> <br /> Typical example: Although he has climbed the ladder, Tom becomes more and more anti-worker in his later years. Trade unions are troublemakers, and he does not care about their shenanigans. Henry describes the confrontation between Tom and the Syndicate during a great debacle and how she worried him at the expense of his family life. But Henry's wife reminds him that Tom resorted to strikebreakers and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing several people). So we have two visions of the man, one white and the other black. <br /> <br /> I do not really blame THE POWER AND GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few movies do, including all other Orson Welles films), but I aware that the story is sufficiently well presented for the public interest to be maintained. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore in the role of his wife Sally, the tragedy of the global success of both spouses is fully understood. <br /> <br /> When they get married, Tom will want to (partially) give his wife and their family the benefits he has never had. But in America, the success of a business comes at a cost. Tom is deeply involved in the management of the railroad empire (he is constantly expanding and improving it). But it keeps him away from home and he loses contact with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the young woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally discovers his unfaithful behavior, he destroys her. <br /> <br /> In the same way, Tom also receives a total shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom and introduces him to a son - but it turns out to be the son of Eve created by Tom's son, Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding forces Tom to kill himself. <br /> <br /> The film is not a total success - the action sometimes jumps unconvincingly. Still, this gives the company a real appearance (note the scene when Tom informs his board of his plan to buy a small rival train line and use the debentures to finance these plans). Sturgis came from a rich background, so he could bring this type of detail. So, overall, it's a first-rate movie. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but interesting for moviegoers as an attempt at commercial realism with social commentary in Depression America.
