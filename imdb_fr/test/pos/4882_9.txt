Finally!!! A good movie made about the craziest serial killer in history. For the less familiar with Ed Gein, he was essentially the fool who was known for stealing his graves and sloughing his victims (which most horror fans have stolen). Shot in a period style that perfectly reflects the dark plains of Wisconsin, this is without a doubt the most atmospheric horror film to date, which has not yet portrayed Gein and his horrific murders. Kane Hodder (Jason of Friday 13th series) and Michael Berryman (Hills have Eyes I & II) deliver scary performances in this serial killer opus that easily ignores the dull attempts of the old Gein. So far, I'd say it's one of the best horror movies released this year (Turistas = 0).
