Some time ago, I bought the Chinese Fist of the North Star box, which included all the Fist of the North Star films, Fist of the North Star 2, New Fist of the North Star and Fist of the North Star. Although there is an American version and some European versions, they end halfway to Fist of the North Star, which is about as far as the film. <br /> <br /> The series talks about the successor of a former martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken (North Star Fist) named Kenshiro, or Ken for short. There is only one successor per generation. This is happening in a post-apocalyptic future where martial arts are the most powerful weapon. The two most powerful arts are Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken, as my version calls it. Nanto, it's really several styles, but they are all identical because they allow a person to cut someone into pieces. There are six Nanto masters and each has its own star. The hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage / kill or heal someone by hitting a point on their body. Each art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Big Dipper, Nanto - Gemini. Kenshiro walks around rescuing the evil world from his two brothers and three of the Nanto masters and their armies. Each captain of the army has his own way of fighting, which makes each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody. In addition, Kenshiro is looking for his girlfriend Yuria who was stolen by master Nanto Shin. Throughout the journey, his brother Toki joins Kenshiro after rescuing him from his brother Rao, who calls himself Kenou or Boxing King. He is also joined by two Nanto masters, Rei, in search of his sister led by Ken's brother, Jagi, and Shu. Both Toki die along the way. The other characters who join Ken are two children, Rin and Batto, who do not do much. That's about all I can say for a story because it's so long and full of details. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this show exceptional is the fight. Ken normally runs into a group of people who think of themselves as tough guys and then get killed at once. Which is funny and badass, but allows fast fights. Another big part is comedy / nastiness. Ken hits someone and they think it's nothing. Ken says they are already dead. Then they die. Other parts are when he goes to hit them and tell them they have a few seconds to live. Then a counter will appear. Or when he tells them that they are not worthy of knowing his name. Then there is when he makes a quick kick or punch and goes da da da da da da da da da etc. Finally, you could end up doing it with him. A good time was when a villain thought about Hokuto. He approached Ken and hit him. Ken stood there, saying he was dead in seconds. The villain counted and died. It's not limited to Ken, everyone kills as fast. There has never been a character as great as Ken and probably never. <br /> <br /> There are however some problems. One is the repetitive nature. Some flashbacks, mostly one with Yuria taken, are over-read, and there are also too many episodes of recapitulation, especially in the fourth part of the series. In fact, the last episode is a complete recap. Another problem is the end. The final battle with Rao was not so impressive. Ken and Rao fought and talked, etc., until Rao realized and killed himself instead of killing him by Ken. But it's better than the American and European versions that just cut halfway. <br /> <br /> For whom would I recommend that? This is for older teens and adults who like action. Since the styles blow up people or are cut in pieces, the violence is very graphic and contains a lot, but they do not show much blood, because they usually make of death a silhouette that always looks like the person but less colorful . This was probably done to avoid censorship. If you do not like the action, rent the American version. If you like the action, then I advise you to do an import because you can see all the series, but they do not have the best English translation, because it is subtitled by Chinese. Note: my import comes with everything I said at the beginning, but some imported versions are not, but you still need to get an import to see all the series and Fist of the North Star 2. If you think you can not manage the subtitles for some reason will then look for the US version. Another note: in the version I do not have subtitles, there was the latest record of New Fist of the North Star; Although New Fist from North Star is not very good at first. <br /> <br /> I give the show 8/10 for its large amount of action, its good story and the geniality of Kenshiro. **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Toei Animation has published an English version with subtitles. You can download the episodes as well as Hokuto no Ken 2 on IGN Direct2Drive or watch them for free on the FUNimation website.
