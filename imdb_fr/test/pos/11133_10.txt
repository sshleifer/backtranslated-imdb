"Fame" (1980) is brilliant. It has all these qualities that made the movies of the late 70s so great. He is proud of his frankness and is not ashamed to be up to it. <br /> <br /> What really matters here is the trip, not the destination. The ignorant fools who have the soap opera mentality will never realize that "Fame" concerns the struggles, anxieties and triumphs of these young people, not their career. <br /> Ironically, none of the very talented actors of "Fame" arrived in Hollywood. Celebrity marked the end of an era. The end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of marketing and political correctness. This is the last statement of a generation that has its own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
