Five years after teaming up with James Cagney in "The Public Enemy," Mae Clarke makes another appearance, this time as his fiancée with the character of Cagney on the other side of the law. It looks like she's also mentioned other issues in their relationship, trying to make Johnny Cave a little more practical with his money and career. You had to imagine that they would get together again after she gave him the boot for defying his twisted boss; these things have a way of working in pictures. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time watching Cagney in this one. I usually do it, and here he seemed to have auditioned the characteristic shrug movement that he was wisely using in "Angels With Dirty Faces" describing Rocky Sullivan. It was just after throwing Cavanaugh (Robert Gleckler) out of his office during the first attempt at bribing the new boss of Weights and Measures. He turns to the camera and finds himself satisfied with his answer to the scammer - very cool. <br /> <br /> I understand that it was not a Cagney movie, but it could just as easily have been. Warner has often defended the cause of the common man, and the denunciation of crooked traders and the politicians who protected them would have been entirely appropriate. You also have these big street scenes of New York City representing cars and shops of the time, with homemade signs making flour prices at 18 cents a pound. Hey, how about the furniture store selling the living room set for ninety-nine dollars, you could get a single stick chair for that price today. <br /> <br /> The best part of the picture might be this meat counter scene when Cagney, James Burke (Aloysius) and butchers play catch with a chicken underweight. One of the clearest moments of the film, but you have an idea of ​​the tension that people can feel when they are caught cheating. Same for the truck driver who pressured Johnny to sign for a specific delivery; He was just not used to doing that. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is a beautiful diversion of the presence more typical of the gangsters of Cagney, even if it is not at the height of its films. It's pretty easy to get one of Cagney's rare public domain images, which are often found in relatively inexpensive compilations.
