It's a pretty obscure and stupid horror film set in the 1970s Everglades. It's really stupid and lame for the first half, and then it starts to be good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends, interspersed with shots of a church group singing, I do not know. It's fascinating. I was impressed by the nocturnal scenes, as it actually looked like the night, unlike most low-budget horror movies where it still looks like the day. I feel that the director was very talented but worked with a tiny budget and a busy schedule. There are some scenes towards the end, the one mentioned above and the end credits extremely cool. This film could have been a real classic if it had abandoned its Scooby Doo conventions and went straight to the throat. I was surprised by the quality of this film. I could not leave my eyes and I had to ask myself "why?"
