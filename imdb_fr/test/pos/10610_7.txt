Mention Bollywood to anyone with a slight knowledge of the genre, and the evocative images are generally tasteless on the biggest musical numbers populated with costumes that make Vegas a bastion of conservatism. The feeling of condescension that permeates most of the films that have approached Bollywood from an outside point of view does not facilitate this perception. Willard Carroll's romantic comedy, Marigold, takes a different approach. It's not a wink to those foolish people and their derogatory antics, but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality, lack of irony and self-awareness. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the director has a huge affection and respect for Bollywood, while being amused by his more kitsch aspects. And if you know Bollywood well, you can enjoy what it does here by creating a true hybrid of cinematic conventions between Bollywood and Hollywood. In one of the opening shots, a look back at Salman's character as a child by the sea, talking to his grandmother (played by Helen!) - how many of Salman's movies begin with the same principle?) To the backtracking sequence embedded in the movie that Marigold and Prem have been filming, anyone who has ever seen enough Bollywood films will recognize these references. The story itself incorporates proven Hollywood and Bollywood conventions. the fish out of the water meets the duty of his family, to the detriment of his personal development. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot of the more comic staging of the first half, allowing for a more dramatic resolution of the second. Yet, finally, the film's sensibility is that of Hollywood, with its sober and ironic humor and the story of a woman learning to believe in herself, to assert herself. <br /> <br /> movie inspired by Bollywood if there were no musical numbers and that film does not disappoint with seven of them. Unlike Bollywood, however, the songs do not come out of nowhere and transport their characters to a European venue or to a beach in Goa; they exist as musical numbers as part of the current film, recalling how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley's films as part of a stage show. Or are they coming out of a situation where the music already has a reason to be there? a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where musicians (including a cameo singer Shaan's cameo) play. All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at this stage of the film. Often, the music takes a conventional song of one kind and modifies it on the other. So, in one of the highlights of the film where Marigold speaks alone, the song is quite typical of its genre. the female star singing and dancing among a line of women ?? but in this case, it's Ali Larter, blond, who looks like an all-natural movie star in Bollywood. The lyrics are synonymous with the lyrics in Hindi, without subtitles. <br /> <br /> The sumptuous images are synonymous with sumptuous and Marigold perfectly fulfills this aspect. thanks to the best talents working in Bollywood today. The director of photography is Anil Mehta, who was also director of photography for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and the designer, Nitin Desai, both of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. You can really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam on this film ?? In fact, the illuminated floor of one of the numbers was originally from Dholi Taro Dhol, who, coincidentally, features an integrated Marigold pattern. <br /> <br /> In terms of distribution, Carroll obviously has a penchant for finding acting talent. playing by heart ?? one of the first films for Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this film, he hits again with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons the movie works is because of Larter. It makes a character attractive and unattractive, and his subsequent transformation is credible. She is smart, funny and sexy because she is smart and funny. Salman Khan and herself share excellent chemistry. This is one of the biggest strengths of the film. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming, filtered by his emblematic role of Prem. It's the old Prem school, though, so expect a quiet and discreet Salman - those who had used him to his usual striptease avatar could be disappointed. or relieved! It is a sincere and sensitive performance on his part, tainted only by a weak enunciation of his English lines. <br /> <br /> With a refreshing lack of cynicism and a flawless embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to the Bollywood and Hollywood films of yore.
