I went to the screening of "SISTER HELEN" at the Sundance Film Festival and I did not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the people in this documentary. Sister Helen is an incredible character !!! The filmmakers captured the essence of Sister Helen's amazing soul and took me to an unknown world. The trip completely satisfied me and I was completely surprised by the end of this film. <br /> <br /> This film speaks to those who want a second chance in life.
