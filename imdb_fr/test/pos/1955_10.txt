IMDb forces critics to type a certain number of lines, but all I really want to say is: "It's an incredible movie, and you can not consider yourself a moviegoer without seeing it." You should just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push to play. But I have to type something. So, let me point out the following: <br /> <br /> (1) River's Edge contains what could still be classified as the funniest and best performance of Crispin Glover in a movie, and if you have followed Crispin Glover at least, you know that this alone justifies giving him a 10. Fun lines galore. <br /> <br /> (2) River's Edge contains the second most memorable performance of Dennis Hopper's career (other than Blue Velvet), and it's really excellent. Dennis Hopper is really fun. <br /> <br /> (3) River's Edge contains the best performance of Keanu Reeves' career, and is excellent. It was the role for which he was born. He has lots of good lines, but one in particular is really funny. Listen carefully when his character and his father-in-law talk to each other. <br /> <br /> Always the best stoner movie is more than that. This tends to appear in the dramatic sections of movie rental stores, but if it's a drama, it's the funniest drama of all time.
