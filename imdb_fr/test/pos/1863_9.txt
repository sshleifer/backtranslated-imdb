It's really a touching film, and a great expression of Charles Darwin's personal struggle. The film does not only talk about his struggle for the publication of his book "The Origin of the Species", but also about his relationship with his eldest daughter. Her daughter was at first the only person in her family to approve her views, which she also had to pay for. More than him sometimes. <br /> <br /> Now it's not a propaganda film about evolution, but I think it has managed to stay very neutral. A difficult thing to do in my opinion. Of course, this does not tolerate the way the characters were treated by the church, quite the contrary. If you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film; the deists and atheists will appreciate it but move away from theism. The film is about evolution, and that's all. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany in the role of Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course, we can all think of Darwin as this fun-haired old man, but this film focuses on the man in his late twenties, early thirties. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great, as always, but the actor who impressed me was Martha West as Annie Darwin, daughter of Darwins. Certainly one of the best children actors of the decade. The story tells the story of Darwin and his daughter, and the game is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Except for some jumps in time that have been momentarily confusing, the production of this film is rather impeccable. Some scenes where Darwin observes that nature is wonderful and almost looks like a national documentary of great production. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I'm not quite sure why they chose "Creation" as the title. I doubt that this is an irony, the film is too respectful for that. Well, I'm sure it makes sense too, do not let that scare you. <br /> <br /> I give this film a 9/10. It's really a great tribute to Charles Darwin, and give him a chance.
