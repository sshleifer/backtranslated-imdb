I do not usually comment on movies or TV shows, but I have to post a comment about Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Of course, here in the UK, we are about 2/3 of the 3rd season and I managed to watch the last series of season 3 (by other means) I'm always stuck every Friday at 9pm. <br /> <br /> Since the first episode of season 1, I'm a big fan of this show and I have the 3 seasons DVD, yes, I can not wait for season 4 to start in October. So why do I like this show so much, and I agree with the last poster .... James Caan, I know a person can not make a team but Big Ed Deline was made for Caan or maybe it was the other way around, I read that the producers were considering Martin Sheen for Ed Deline ... It's impossible !! ! I also agree that the character of Caan gets very sweet, I also preferred the difficult catch * Big Bad Eddy D that we saw in seasons 1 and 2, he seems to have softened. <br /> <br /> Like Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSure / Mike, Vanessa Marcil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda, all members of the cast contribute well, even outside of the cast members. such as Cheryl Ladd, Jillian Deline, Harry Groener, Gunther, Dean Caine, Casey, Mitchell Longley and Mitch, who appear six or seven times in the same season, fit as well as if they had been in each episode since the first day. . <br /> <br /> This show has it all, drama, action, suspense, bursts of laughter, romance, pomp, glamor and big time celebrities who often play themselves. <br /> <br /> Many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital TV and I hope it will continue long after Season 4.
