Following the 1941 coup, Max and Dave, the Fleischer brothers, were removed from their studio by Paramount Pictures Corporation. Former employees such as Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber were responsible for the new operation, now renamed Famous Studios by Paramount. Early on, Famous's finished product was indistinguishable from that of Fleischer's recent production. The existing series (Popeye, Superman) continues as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> Subject of today, JAPOTEURS is one of the previous SUPERMAN Shorts of the famous studio. <br /> <br /> AS had been the custom, the cartoons of SUPERMAN was an excellent combination of refined and well-crafted music in the score. This goes for the theme (opening) as well as for all multi-ambient background music (accessory). It was if each short film had its own background music, as everyone kept a new one by apparently recording it again with each image. <br /> <br /> Regarding JAPOTEURS, we must remember that it was shot during the first year. US involvement and characterization of the enemy was extremely perverse, stereotyped and unthinking. The dialogue and personality of the naughty Japanese saboteurs were strictly related to the traditional characters of the old Pulp magazine, their words being uttered with a sarcastic politeness and totally devoid of sincerity, the characters displaying their coolness while they held the most demonic possible. threats and scandalous acts towards the Western world. <br /> <br /> JAPOTEURS is visually brilliant and edifying, it is surprisingly arranged and uses multi-plane or table animations to give a real depth to its flight sequences. Making good use of the links between the cartoons, the SUPERMAN Radio Show was then broadcast via the mutual broadcast network; the drawing is very similar to the comics page and uses the same voice talents, Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander, of the radio show. <br /> <br /> We note it with a star *** Â½. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
