Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie. I guess we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real, that you can not explain them in any way, they are just actors and not real people. <br /> <br /> 'Nurse Betty' is not a nurse at all. In real life, she is an ordinary housewife working in a restaurant. To escape her horrid husband and the problems of her miserable life, she became a fan of the soap opera. After witnessing the murder of her husband, she was shocked and lost all control over reality. She thinks she loves one of the soap opera characters, a doctor, and decides to visit him and start a family with him. The killers however think that she knows too much and go after her to kill her. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the subject is quite recognizable (if you leave the professional killers and the murder apart) and the movie was funny. The story was well done and the actors did a good job. There was everything I always wanted to see while watching a comedy. I give him a 7.5 / 10.
