Several critics comment on the cast of this film. Suffice it to say that Alex Cord is playing a strong lead against Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. My concern is that many of you may not be familiar with at least the two existing versions of this film. In the American version, Clay McCord obtains the amnesty from Governor Lem Carter, then leaves the city bought. I agree that the end is less than satisfactory. However, in the original Italian version, Clay McCord moves away from the city (unarmed, as he handed his guns to the governor) and is trapped by bounty hunters who have slowly depopulated the city of Escondido, a city bandit. The Bounty Killers are excited to share the $ 10,000 reward, but are disappointed to find McCord's amnesty agreement in the corpses pocket. As they leave, we hear a comment: "If this amnesty continues, I will begin to hunt buffalo!" . That alone takes a minute to pray ... A second to die and place it on the same playground with movies like Keoma and The Big Gundown. As the final credits say, in the Italian version, "FINE".
