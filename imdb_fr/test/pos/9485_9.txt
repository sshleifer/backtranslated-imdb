I am a professional musician who was inspired almost 20 years ago to start playing the guitar after hearing Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II. Although I do not play in the same genre or style, the impact of this man has been enormous. Now, almost 20 years later, I finally could see something more than the not so good The Song Remains the Same. Once again, I have seen so many bands play, some small, so many current "masters". No group, no way, no way has NEVER been able to get the magic you can actually taste by watching this DVD. <br /> <br /> Robert Plant is sometimes a little heavy, and you can almost feel Page's annoyance for him forgetting the lyrics, but that did not matter, I suppose - especially for the time. The genius of Bonham shines more on this DVD than on all the albums of Zeppelin, Band of Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is pretty ordinary - but the magic of this DVD is how well they behave all four. The world liked to imagine that they were passionate about black magic (k), etc. - it only interested Page. The magic (note that I often say it), is that this DVD captures a rare look at the crudity of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly, no matter how much they really play. It did not matter. <br /> <br /> A quick breakdown. The first of two DVDs is where the real magic is. You should be able to feel the power and brutality that Zep had in their infancy. At the end of the second DVD, Page wrestles with his sanity during Knebworth's songs. (It's no secret that at that time he was very addicted to heroin). So I would recommend the first record to ALL music lovers, and the second to the only real fan of Zeppelin. <br /> <br /> I may be going too far here for some guitarists, but I would say that after watching this, Page is certainly more creative and inventive than Hendrix. Yes, I said it. And if you do not agree, watch the DVD.
