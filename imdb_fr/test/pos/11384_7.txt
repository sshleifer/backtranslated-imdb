The three names that matter most for this movie are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore. These three offer the best performance, but the entire distribution does a great job. Although the film is about the porn industry, you should not lose control of your own sexual principles. On the other hand, many scenes involved drug use and, although it is important to understand the lifestyle of the characters, I think there has been an overload of work in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson did not do much, but he may have been chosen for this film based on his 1988 work "The Dirk Diggler Story". One thing that has been brilliantly described is the family atmosphere that reigns between the characters who work, live and party together. Although not a typical family, they certainly seem to care for each other. The wonderful soundtrack really helps to give you an idea of ​​the era at a time when disco was in fashion. It contains many disco titles and other wonderful songs. <br /> <br /> The story is about a talented young man, Eddie Adams (Wahlberg), who invites himself into the porn industry. He changes his name and is now called Dirk Diggler. He becomes an adult movie star almost overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director who takes his films very seriously, believing that his work is more than pornography, but that it is a true art. However, Dirk becomes overly addicted to the drug and quickly heads for a dangerous road where he risks losing everything. Although the focus is more on the Dirk character, there are secondary intrigues for the other characters and their hardships in life. You will find yourself wishing and hoping that their situation will improve. Overall, a movie done well.
