Yes, you can think of Babette's Day as a kind of slap against Puritan Christianity, but it's much more than that. The superficial story of how a talented Parisian cook flees Paris after one of the middle-class revolutions and threw himself to the ground in Jutland, in northern Denmark, is simply the fat that allows the tale deeper to develop. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist, one of the small armies of people who are pushed over the centuries by stupid, vane, greedy and arrogant politicians, who kill beauty for profit, what politics does always, paces the National Endowment for the arts, which simply institutionalize creativity for propaganda purposes. <br /> <br /> Babette is about to fall asleep in the small village where two virgin sisters reside who see their flock of faithful dwindling, devoting themselves to the deceased father. They live on salted cod and oatmeal. <br /> <br /> Babette shows these simple pious people that God is in pleasure and sensuality as well as in behavioral and mental purity. It also shows them how this mental purity can lead to the control of fantasies, which we all know nowadays to the neo-authoritarian government that would limit our personal freedoms because they were somehow a crime against the state, or as they would say. we, humanity. <br /> <br /> Babette concocts a dinner in French to celebrate the centenary of our late Reverend. The girls and their flock think it's the devil who comes among them and swear not to notice food or drinks. <br /> <br /> It is at this point, in the preparation of the meal, paid by the gains of Babette in the French lottery, that I begin to tear. It is a poignant sensibility compared to the everyday vulgarity and lies that flood our consciousness from morning to night through the media and ferocious power we miss to win us all in the dark. <br /> <br /> The simple sophistication of Babette's art spits over all the pretensions presented in our modern society, and it is painful to see them play so deliciously in this magnificent film. <br /> It's also, with Fanny and Alexander (Bergman), my favorite movie of all time, but I can only watch it from time to time because, like a bottle of rare wine served with blinis and fresh oysters, do not overdo it. <br /> <br /> A very good film that should appear in the library of all moviegoers.
