I just saw this movie, in Australia on satellite. As I have been avoiding more than usual information in the last week from the United States about gunmen, well, to be quite frank, this film is a precious jewel. Congratulations to everyone involved. I had only a small idea of ​​what the film involved, as is the case most often to get a good effect, which certainly came with cinematographic products. the staging is effective in the true sense of the word, with all the furry subjects in the world today facing a faltering family, even in the suburbs. The first forty minutes established a professional theater of this kind, I was not ready for bursts of laughter upon their arrival. Although the cathartic moment was built through comedy and character as the family and neighbors met in extraordinary ways. <br /> <br /> In short, we anticipate who we are and who we are. A very significant film and must see. <br /> <br /> Please note the date of this exam.
