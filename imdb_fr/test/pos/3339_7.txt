I want to start my review by thanking the authors of this documentary. This is obviously a charity work and I think they have been very successful at putting together a nice documentary about a person who has so little information about him. It's really a good thing. <br /> <br /> I had heard about Bruce Haack, but I did not know much about it, and I found the beginning of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was too far away. I wanted to see this guy from Bruce Haack !! I felt that the producers thought that I already knew him, as well as these musicians on the screen, which I did not know, so I felt a little in the dark. <br /> <br /> When Bruce was finally shown in action it was great and it gave me a taste of Bruce Haack, but it was just a taste. We had more musicians and I had the impression to be told: "Look, all these nice musicians interest him, so he must be cool!" The musician's comments on Bruce did not really interest me. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Bruce as a person. You know, the important things - more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. Learn more about her life, and yes, her drug use and other problems. I would have liked to know more about his project "Hackula". I wanted to enter his mind. Even though they did it via "god voice" comments and pictures, the animations were good. <br /> <br /> The animations were good, but again, I felt they were used for filling, but not really. something other than allowing me to hear his music and seeing images based on Dimension 5 discs. I thought it was smart and creative, but again ... I wanted to know more about Bruce! <br /> <br /> Maybe Bruce Haack was elusive in real life? <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the end, I enjoyed this documentary and felt a sort of sadness that pioneers and geniuses as incredible as Mr. Haack is forgotten as and when as time passes. I'm glad this movie aims to educate people about Bruce Haack, even with his faults.
