First of all, it's an art film and a good movie. I liked the presentation and how it was shot. Very nice. Some scenes are part of the more graphic horror sequences I've ever seen. This film scared me, not because of suspense or shock, but because I had the deadly fear of seeing something REALLY dreadful. This happened in a few places, but especially in the beginning. This film also dragged and the 74 minutes seemed long. However, if you like cinema, you have to see it. To date, I have not seen anything like it. 8/10
