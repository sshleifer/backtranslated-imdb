Count on me as happy not to see Hastings in this episode. Dr. Watson, the poor man, does not do anything for me, because he simply slides every scene in which he is. Japp is often necessary to the story as a representative of the bureaucracy, and a little Miss Lemon is fine for seasoning, but Hastings painfully moves away from weak to overly mannered in different episodes. If I have to go through another void "Oh, I say there!" I will take the gas pipe. <br /> <br /> In general, the more you have Poirot in a story of Poirot, the better. Each line for Hastings is a line taken from Poirot. And since I have never read books, I do not care about fidelity to Christie's characters. Many viewers / critics seem to have trouble separating movies from books. If you want the book as is, read it. I do not see the point of watching the TV version if you know what will follow at each stage. Theater is not prose - do not expect a transcript.
