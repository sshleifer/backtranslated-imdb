This film is apparently intended for a young evangelical Christian audience as an educational tool. For that, I give it a vote of 7 out of 10. This is a decent film to show to a group of young people, but I do not think it will be very well received beyond. For all other audiences, I would have much worse. <br /> <br /> The critics who saw "It's a wonderful life" are absolutely right, even though I did not think about it until they talked about it. I was thinking more of a "Chick Tract", these little Gospel comics of 3 "on 5". If Jack Chick had already shot one of his films, it would look a lot like "Second Glance". There is a strong Christian message about the power of prayer and the influence of each of us on the earth, but it is somewhat embarrassed by Christian stereotypes. Christians are all very kind, somewhat passive and perfectly clean, while all non-Christians seem to be bad people. <br /> <br /> Muriel the angel plays a major role, and it's the most horny and cute character in the movie. He is the most unpleasant angel I have ever seen in a movie, and the biggest negative. I do not know if the directors wanted his personality to disappear so badly or if he hit me like that. (I confess that he reminded me of someone I know.) Dan's love for a very mundane girl who is not at all his genre is behind the plot in this movie . Why he never fell in love with her in the first place is the only question I would have liked to have answered. <br /> <br /> But the film displays positive Christian values ​​and your group of young people will be entertained when they see something healthy. with a good lesson.
