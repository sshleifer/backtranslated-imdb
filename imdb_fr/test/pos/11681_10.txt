The series on the decline is amazing and the PS director can not get enough credit for making these films. I'm a little surprised to see that not many people have seen this one, or the other two, but that they are worth discovering if you want an image of the punk of the years of transformation, between the end of the years seventy and early eighties. The film begins with a breathtaking collection of music videos played over Group X music. Numerous interviews with bands and punks provide insight into what it was like to survive on the final stretch of traditional rock. . No internet, lousy jobs and total hostility do not meet in this genre. For new kids who have not heard of these bands or just created one themselves, this movie is a real rock lesson. All the performances of the group (and there are many) are impressive, especially FEAR which continues to surprise me. This and the second installment are amazing time capsules offering those who care a rare glimpse of the life of these crazy people. It's a real punk, as in the interview of Darby Crash's girlfriend when they remember a painter who died mysteriously / suddenly outside their home and it took them about a week to figure it out, they take pictures next to the guy and all EMT had a chuckle on this one, and in truth, the interviewer asks the girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy was dead when painting their house, the answer "no, I hate painters". How about Black Flag renting his apartment / rehearsal space at $ 16 a month! My jaw nearly fell at that moment, knowing that I rented a ten-by-ten closet to train at 400. Between watching this and Deadwood, I feel like I was born at the wrong time, just at side of cowboy days and nights. the old way. The people and groups associated with the film paved the way for harder music today, and they did it in their own way. Shiny film, ten stars, see part 2 as well as part 3, just as great, I do not know what to say.
