I was able to see "Anywhere But Here" last night in a free preview. I absolutely loved the movie! I was attracted to the realistic portrayal of a mother / daughter relationship ... there was definitely a connection between Adele and Ann. I think that says a lot about the outstanding performances of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was the right actress to represent Adele and after leaving the theater, I could not think of another actress in the role. Portman was also excellent as Ann. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that no other teenage actress could do. I think that the Academy of Arts and Film Science should give the credit and nominate Sarandon and Portman for prizes in the categories "Actress" and "Secondary". It would be a shame if they were neglected.
