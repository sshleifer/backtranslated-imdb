I was surprised to read the comments of the person who does not like this movie. It's really very funny. There are certainly some lines of laughter that my boyfriend and I quote. Some situations may be disturbing (bisexuality, drugs, sexual vision of a particularly strange child) but credible at the same time. It's about communication and poor communication between men and women.
