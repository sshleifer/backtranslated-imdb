Closet Land is not at the happy cinema. Nor is it linked to any social realism. It may be his strength. Distance to time and to specific nations reinforces the message, makes it more powerful, and removes the burden of nationalism and propaganda that you often feel in movies criticizing nations opposed to its own (I am, of course, talking mostly about American propaganda in commercial film). <br /> <br /> Closet Earth is more than just a message. It is a film of pure and surreal beauty, filled with the same clean and clinical form found in works such as 1984 and its equals. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Alan Rickman, the man with the golden sarcasm (and, could I add, the incomparable sex appeal ;-)). The match between him and Madeleine Stowe is brilliant. Every time I see him, he seems to play a character even more mean than the last one ... <br /> <br /> But enough melody. The film lacks action. I do not want any car crashing, but I want something to happen, if only words. After an hour, I was really tired of the interrogation room, predictable actions and more than anything, I wanted a more complex vision of everything, the world, the previous life of the characters and all the rest of the missing frame . For some people, a nice touch. For me, something less positive. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Closet Land is a worthwhile film if you are ready to take a trip to the abyss of human nature. <br /> <br /> And of course for us who really love the always bad Alan Rickman.
