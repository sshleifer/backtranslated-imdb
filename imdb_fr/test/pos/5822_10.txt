Oz is one of the most breathtaking and addictive television experiences of all time. <br /> <br /> After taking a few scenes of this on SBS, I was skeptical at first. However, having finished the fourth season, I know that this brilliant series is coming to an end (6 seasons), and yet I still can not get tired of OZ. <br /> <br /> You want something that pushes your senses and your stomach to the max ... Oz fits the bill, hands down. <br /> <br /> It's not a kids affair, people, its violent, brutal and not pretty. Why, it's an experimental unit inside a maximum security prison. <br /> <br /> Tom Fontana's Oz is brilliant in all relevant departments: actors, writing and directing. <br /> <br /> Oz's HBO website is also highly recommended, for newcomers, for information on this series. This is the first hour-long program produced by HBO, and it proves how much it is a true work of art and that others would follow. <br /> <br /> Thank you HBO
