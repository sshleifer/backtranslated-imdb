There is no denying it. Science fiction on television is difficult. There are so many problems that the genre brings with it. Like the need for a good budget, a solid writing, a decent acting game. Maybe the budget and scenario writing are the departments where, in my opinion, most attempts have failed. So, "Surface" succeeds? Not completely, but more than many others. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, a good science fiction show does not really need a lot of CGI to work, nor a ton of money. What he needs is the ability to create a feeling bigger than life. The feeling that there is more than what we see, something that makes me curious and eager to try to understand how it will end. Adding the pieces of the puzzle and sometimes saying "Aha!" is what makes or breaks a show like this. <br /> <br /> "Surface" had some flaws. First, its basic principle is not as exciting as it could have been, nor the story as exciting (or daring) as I had hoped at the beginning. In addition, the television feeling is very present most of the time. Everything goes from the CGI shit (which goes from decent to awful) to the rather changing quality of the acting department. In addition, you sometimes feel a little too family oriented in that it sometimes takes over and becomes almost cute. But aside from these flaws, it's a nice show. Maybe not as spectacular as some of the other science fiction shows out there. But it allows me to stay interested all season and also offers some nice cliffhangers between shows. The end for me is not so attractive. I do not like programs that end without end, so to speak, leaving the story unresolved. This is particularly unfortunate in this case since the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it is still undecided). <br /> <br /> HBO is for me the reference in terms of quality television. Their series have the best actors, the best production values ​​and especially the strongest writing. It's not HBO quality, but it's good for what it is. Good enough to want another season without a doubt.
