This is a black and white film from France, <br /> <br /> A simple plot, a gangster on the run who is looking for help, etc. We have seen this type of film many times over the years. What makes this film different are mainly his acting and his style. All actors play quietly, no one shouts and almost no one gets upset. There are a lot of deaths, some surprising. There are also beautiful women, but no sex scenes. No car is chasing either. <br /> <br /> JUST SPEAKING / It's so refreshing to listen to people talking, and here we also have to read the subtitles. <br /> <br /> The action is almost perfect for everyone. Lino Ventura & in a role BUT less important, but essential, of Jean Paul Belmondo. These 2 actors were among the best. <br /> <br /> I said above that the film is defective, there are some flaws of script in some spots, they are minor, acting is the thing in this movie. Production is also first rate. <br /> <br /> Notes: *** (of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
