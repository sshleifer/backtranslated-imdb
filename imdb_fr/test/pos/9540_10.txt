The Railway Children is perhaps my favorite movie of all time, simply for the brilliant interpretation of the cast, the warm and human interactions of the 3 children and the people they meet living near the railroad in the beautiful English countryside. Jenny Augutter is particularly credible in her role as "Bobbie", the older brother of her sister Phyllis and her brother Peter.The adventures they have discovered and the connections made in their new home and surrounding area are real and fascinating. The scenery is charming, the trains a part of the vast history of Britain and the soundtrack is very moving. This comforting movie never fails to bring tears to my eyes, every time and gives me homesickness. I often wonder if I should have been born at that time because I think I would have done well when people treated each other. with so much chivalry and decency. <br /> <br /> In short, I consider this film to be a masterpiece and a must for anyone who sees themselves as a "sensitive or caring guy". Edith Nesbit wrote this story early in the 1900s and what a wonderful story it is. More and more children need to read this or watch the movie instead of playing violent video games. If we had more films of this nature, the world would become a better place.
