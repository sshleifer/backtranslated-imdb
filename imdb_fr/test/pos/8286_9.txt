"The Chipmunk Adventure" is one of the greatest animated films of the 1980s. Alvin and the Chipmunks have always attracted my interest because they are the ones who really propelled me into rock and roll. Neither of the Chipmunks has bad traits. Alvin is really the star and has all the cool looks. Theodore is the sensitive lovable. Then there is Simon (my favorite), the clever guy who often parties. I also like a lot of chipettes. There is Brittany, which, like Alvin, is still trying to be so popular. Then there is Eleanor, who, like Theodore, is sweet, sensitive and loves food. Janette is the only Chipette who does not look much like her counterpart. she is very naive and very clumsy. <br /> <br /> In the very first feature film of the Chipmunks, David Seville goes on a business trip to Europe and leaves the boys to Miss Miller during his absence. While playing an arcade game, Alvin loses against Brittany and then says that if he had the money, he would race around the world to Brittany. Unbeknownst to the children, a man named Klaus Furschtien and his sister Claudia, who were trying to find a sneaky way to distribute diamonds around the world in exchange for money, surprised the conversation by telling them that they would have let them run. around the world for $ 100,000. Alvin and Brittany accept it and leave for the race. <br /> <br /> This adventurous movie contains a lot of great songs. "Off to See the World" is an appropriate theme song for the film. Then there's "Getting Lucky", one of my favorite songs in the movie. "My mother" is most likely the most dreaded song in the movie, but it always makes me cry. "Wooly Bully" is the only cover song used in the movie (the rest was completely original). Then, of course, there is "The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll", which, in my opinion, must be one of the greatest musical numbers in the film's history. <br /> <br /> I watched this film very often, until the death of my recorded tape. I still watch the movie, though. It's actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on vacation to a foreign country for the first time. This will give you an idea of ​​the kind of things you expect from a trip to the world. Certainly one of my childhood movies, and one that I would recommend to fans of the 80s and fans of Alvin & the Chipmunks.
