ATTENTION: Potential Spoilers to come! <br /> <br /> "Steven Spielberg presents Tiny Toon Adventures" has always been one of my favorite cartoons growing up (damn it still is). And this film perfectly captures everything I like in the show and puts it in shape. <br /> <br /> He is beautifully animated by Tokyo Movie Shinsa studio (WB has outsourced all projects "Tiny Toons"). best studio to handle the show), the movie begins at the end of the school year at Acme Looniversity, the famous cartoon college where Buster and Babs Bunny (no relation) and their teenage toon peers learn from the masters hands animated madness, the Looney Airs. After the final bell, the film splits into five different tracks. Buster hires Babs in a water pistol fight that leads to a dazzling barrage and a tidal wave, sending Buster, Babs and Elmyra Byron's dog down on a spilled picnic table looking for adventure in the depths of the south. Plucky Duck asks Hamton Pig and his family to let him come with them to HappyWorldLand, "The Happiest Place in the Western Hemisphere", but he has to endure a horrible car ride and the threat of a hitchhiker brandishing a chainsaw. Furball, Elmyra's cat, finally runs away, but she is not discouraged ... not when there are many aminals with whom to play at Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume spends her summer hunting her idol, movie star Johnny Pew, hoping to get an autograph. Of course, the hotel where he stays is almost impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon sets up a divination stand on Acme Acres Drive ... and leaves her alone in her free time when Fowlmouth takes her to see the horror movie "Skunkophobia". <br /> <br /> All this story lines are completely hilarious, and some overlap even in the end. The only complaint I can make about this film is that it does not fully use the list of Tiny Toons - Dizzy Devil and Mary Melodie have only one scene, Gogo Dodo appearing only at the beginning and at the beginning. end of the film, and Montana Max, Sweetie, Calamity Coyote and Little Beeper were not found. Yet, these are excusable defects in an otherwise perfect movie. This film is quite rare today, since it is over 12 years old and has never been released on DVD to my knowledge, but I strongly suggest you find it - all the fans of the animation of Warner Bros., classic or contemporary, see this movie.
