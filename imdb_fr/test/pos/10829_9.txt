The director and author Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old in the spring of 1940, while the Third French Republic disintegrated in a few weeks. It was a time, he says, where "all adults were a little crazy". He and the production team recreated this world with love and meticulousness in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period because several lines of the plot intersect and intersect to form a logical and satisfying conclusion. Frederic plays the main role in this plot. It is performed by the brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who is quite ready to play against Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The true strength of the film lies in its secondary performance. Mr. Rappeneau shot the film very well with actors who proposed ideas for action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with only two short dialogue sentences. Although not yet as influential as Renoir's "Rules of the Game", "Bon Voyage" deserves to be a complement to this classic. Although it takes a lot of public attention, it gives a lot in return. One of his requirements is tolerance for a certain shyness and bad direction as to the exact genre we are watching: a crime melodrama, no, a spy thriller, ah, a romantic comedy. Recommend it to your cinemaphile friends. Just be sure to let them discover for themselves that this is a romantic comedy.
