I love the absurdity and scathing humor of Buñuel's surrealist films (such as "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" and "The Exterminating Angel," to name but two). Other earlier work (such as "The Forgotten Ones" on juvenile delinquents in a marginal neighborhood in Mexico) is more serious and provides a strong social message. <br /> <br /> However, I think it's "Nazarin" that is most successful for the viewer's heart. While it is full of irony, it nevertheless reveals an aspect of Buñuel that seems intriguing by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual quest. Here, while the director throws innumerable blows against the Catholic Church, he also seems to show, surprisingly, a feeling of admiration for authentic Christian thought and his practice of selfless love. <br /> "" Luis Buñuel shamelessly praising a figure similar to that of Jesus ?? "I have always considered him a completely cynical artist, without any trace of faith in human virtue ... until I look at "Nazarino." My appreciation is that it exposes with satire the difficulty of following the example of Christ in a society infested with wickedness, ignorance, and sin, but it also presents the hero, Father Nazario, as a lighthouse of light in the middle of a sea of ​​darkness Without a doubt, at the end of the film, I adored him and not of him! <br /> <br /> Some would say that the doubts of Father Nazario concerning his faith suggests the loss of his holy values. (Alas, if he can not do good in this world, who can?) But I would say that this "defect", his frustration, makes his character as much more heroic as it shows how human he is and how difficult his struggle is inside And who said that the priest could not get out of this "dark night" and regain his trust? We may have presented only a difficult part of his spiritual journey. The elegant and open ending (in which he desperately accepts the fruit offered by a foreigner) allows us to imagine the final result of the story. <br /> <br /> I recognize in Buñuel the aggressive and self-proclaimed atheist endowed with a brilliant mind and a social conscience; but after seeing "Nazarin", I also feel at home a certain warmth, depth and maturity that are not so obvious in his other work. <br /> <br /> For the sake of contrast, I strongly recommend you watch then short film "Simon of the Desert" (also made in Mexico, several years later). He approaches a similar subject - the abandonment of the ego in the face of temptation - but only in a hysterically funny and totally irreverent style.
