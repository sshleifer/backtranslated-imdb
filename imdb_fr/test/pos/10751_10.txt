I really enjoyed this old black and white talkie. At first, I did not recognize Harold Lloyd as Mr. Cobb, a missionary in China who was returning home to find a woman. Mr. Cobb's attempts to clean the city hall were numerous. His methods of adapting punishment to crime would probably be illegal, but it's not a film based on reality. It would be a perfect movie for kids except that there is a woman close to nudity (just Grace Bradley pies)! Old phones are enchanting. The only fault is a typical problem of the day - Caucasians are used to representing Chinese men. This is offset by the positive way in which the Chinese are represented. These are wise, good and friendly guys. Anecdote - a Bekins truck appears in the movie when the police run out of Black Marias.
