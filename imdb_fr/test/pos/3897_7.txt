Just like in "Columbo", we see the inevitability occur from the beginning. What follows is a growing network of lies, sex, blackmail and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even a bit of a smoker, a bit like "Columbo". It is William H. Macy, as a critic of film, who makes the film. Constantly turning, the plot sends Macy deeper into the quicksand of his "perfect crime". Fans of William H. Macy will love "A Slight Case Of Murder", as well as those who love police capers offering all kinds of delicious possibilities. Add a comedy at the right time, and it looks a lot like a nice episode of "Columbo". Highly recommended. - MERK
