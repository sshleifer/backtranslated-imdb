It is not often that a television series catches me from the start; a recent random download of Surface's driver stuck me to my seat for the duration of the episode, after which I immediately embarked on a fiery quest to find out everything about this wonderful series. To my dismay, I learned that it had been canceled after only 15 episodes, despite its high ratings and extremely favorable reviews. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Since then, I have acquired the remaining episodes and found that the top five or six were some of the best TVs I have ever watched. Simply fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, I loved the way they finished each episode with a huge finish. I imagine watching him every week that I would have screamed with tension and that I would be captivated, desperately waiting for the next episode to be released. Growing up, I always heard that this was how the first series movies were used, ending with a huge cliffhanger to bring the crowd back to the theater for the next episode. <br /> <br /> Well, it seems that for some reason or another, the costumes have decided to kill that, and apparently the people behind the show have surely seen the writing on the wall because after episode 6, things have definitely deteriorated. I would not say that the episodes actually become BORING, but many elements of the plot become a little more clich√©, and I must say that the last episode really left me feeling cheated. I just wish the creators of the series had a fair chance. The other * ONLY * show that left me feeling was the first season of Stargate SG-1, which had just resonated a lot, feeling very "real", full of soul and heart-inspired. Surface was an excellent series, and maybe one day, a well-heeled television lover will see all the excitement about canceling the show and bring it back. We can hope, at least. :)
