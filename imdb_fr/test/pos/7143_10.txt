This is without a doubt one of my favorite TV movies, beautiful and sad at the same time, comforting and stimulating, it is a superb staging of a few years in the life of CS Lewis and his relationship with Joy Davidman. I found it very absorbing with dialogues and excellent and "realistic" situations. Everything seemed very "real", but there were also "magical" moments that left you almost out of breath. Ackland and Bloom as central characters were excellent, as were the main actors. This is one of those dramas that I find difficult to criticize, simply because, for me, there is NOTHING to criticize, it works so well on so many levels. <br /> <br /> Very strongly recommended.
