I thought this movie was incredible and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the fragments I missed leaning over to hold my stomach! The reviewer who commented on this movie for this site challenged anyone with an IQ on their size to find this funny movie, so my IQ is around: 135 ... I challenge him to question me and eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the reviewer above was not such a boring fool, he could smile for once in his life and take things lightly, as they are supposed to be !!! <br /> <br /> The musical numbers were so imaginative! When you watch a film about this period, everyone will notice the men in tights and realize how different it is from today's dress code and how fun we would be to find today's male population. if she wore tights every day! The idea of ​​dedicating a butch song to men who danced in pantyhose was so fresh, how can we NOT laugh !!! (Also, seeing hip-hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical, and as a dancer too, I've done ballet and hip-hop and danced with men who had to do both. .. it always makes me crack!) <br /> <br /> I like this movie, if anyone has not seen it yet, do not listen to the review above ... look -It and decide it yourself !!!
