Listen ... I was expecting this level of actor William Macy ... the guy continues to give excellent performance ... but MEAT LOAF? Just when did his bread decide to leave Jim Steinman behind and shed his much lower weight in Stanislavsky's wonderful world? Well, what can I say? I am duly impressed. To paraphrase an old adage: "It's not meat, it's emotion" ... and Pain quietly takes up his acting skills. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern wears the look of the 40s perfectly here ... great work by the departments of costumes and hair ... David Paymer is typecast but just on the money. Solid camera throughout the movie. The plot recalls the "Gentleman's Agreement" (anti-Semitism post-war). That's well worth your time ... especially for Bill Macy's growing legions of acolytes. <br /> <br />
