Otto Preminger's Man with the Golden Arm refers to heroin addiction - something that must have been rather risky to shoot in 1955, fifty years ago (censors still have a problem with content in the movies!). <The lead role was originally offered to Marlon Brando, then removed by Frank Sinatra before Brando could respond. Sinatra convincingly portrays a pro card dealer and an ex-heroin addict who returns home to the city to struggle with demons of temptation. <br /> <br /> Preminger is one of my favorite directors (his "Anatomy of a Murder" starring James Stewart is a brilliant and groundbreaking drama in the courtroom). Preminger did much to change the face of cinema in the 1950s - "Anatomy of a Murder" was extremely controversial when it came out because of its intrigue and content (references to rape, "female panties", seduction, etc.). and "The man with the golden arm" deals with an equally volatile subject. <br /> <br /> However, Preminger gets away without becoming an exploiter. This looks like a precursor to "The Panic in Needle Park" (1971) and has more than a few similarities in terms of general motives compared to Billy Wilder's classic movie "Lost Weekend", starring Ray Milland. These three films in particular are probably the best films on alcoholism prior to the 1980s and still remain relevant.
