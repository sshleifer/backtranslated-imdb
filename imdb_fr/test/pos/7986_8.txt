The best Batman movie of the 90's is not in doubt. This film takes place in a city full of insecurity and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Although the villains are a little tacky, they are perfectly suited to the tone of the film, both colorful and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> The performances are really excellent and the comical tone that underlies them really meets the expectations. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by cheese outfits, it's a movie in Burton's style. This can not be described; Burton is a sui generis director who brought the Batman franchise to an even more obscure level, not to mention his comic background. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of action movies and especially if they are super heroes.
