This film surprised me. The box is misleading, the slogan is misleading and the costumes and tone of the movie are misleading. The film is pretty bloody, well played and beautifully shot. The special effects are first rate and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize that this film was released in 1979, not in 1963 as its tone suggests. It's a unique version of Dr. Moreau's story and one of the best filmed versions. The first fifteen minutes are the culmination and the most shocking, but the film never really falls apart. This is definitely worth it if you are a fan of dramatic classics of costume / horror and gore-fests.
