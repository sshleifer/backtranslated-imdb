In the mid-1970s, a group of young, vivid, Californian and naughty teenagers from the city, dubbed the Z-Boys, upset the hitherto frozen world of professional skateboarding with its fierce punk attitude and radically unconventional conduct. style, and unbridled spirit of pure aggression, revolutionizing sport en route and paving the way for the many extreme variations of sport that have emerged in their wake. Director Stacy Peralta, who is herself one of the legendary Z-Boys, tells the incredible exploits of this incredible team of ragpickers in a fierce and visceral way, both informative and extremely entertaining: the fast and fast editing, the Constant and fast pace, rock photography delivers a sense of kinetic hell, projecting a sense of pure joy and boundless energy that provides a total pleasure to contemplate. Better still, this documentary does not insure or break its subjects: these tough guys were so competitive and so ferocious that they separated when the lure of fame and fortune was manifested in their lives. The ultimate fate of some guys is poignant and heartbreaking, with the talented and spontaneous rat of super-skilled skateboarding, Jay Adams, as the saddest and most tragic: he missed his chance at the big time and ended up spending time in prison. The other guys are very colorful and nice too; The provocative and provocative charismatic fireball, Tony Alva in particular, appears as an arrogant but impressive piece of work furiously asserted. Wonderfully recounted with Sean Penn's delightfully easyn'breezy nasal nonchalance. The breathtaking rock soundtrack also smokes. But what really makes this documentary such a winner is its complete lack of pretense: it is just as dynamic, exuberant and more extraordinary than the gloriously scandalous Z-Boys themselves.
