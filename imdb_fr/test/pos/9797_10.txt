I am a 20 year old guy from England. I do not cry in the cinema. But this one moved me. I cried like a girl! It's absolutely the most moving film I've ever seen, even though the story was debatable. The little face of Joseph Mazello when he dreams of crying made me cry every time. How could someone hurt a child so beautiful? I'm going to cry now just thinking about it! Remarkable.
