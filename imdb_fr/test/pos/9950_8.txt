It's a darling movie of my childhood !! I can still hum the theme down a hat !! I remember being late watching this movie with my dad, usually two or three times a year. We have always called it a "giant robot". Although the effects in this film are crude compared to current standards, they were perfect for the genre of this film. I'm also a GREAT fan of the Japanese "Monster" movies, so this film fell right with the others. I have not seen this movie for years and would love to have a copy to share with my 8 year old daughter.
