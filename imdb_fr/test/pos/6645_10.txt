First of all, the story is not as simple as many previous critics point out, it is actually a very complex story, unlike other Bergman films, more oriented to the study of the character. In Skammen, we have two main characters, but as we are launched from the beginning in the middle of the war, we do not know who is fighting and why, everything is open for any resolution. This creates enormous tension and gives each event a meaning. As the story unfolds, we meet many characters who become symbols of humanity, both dark and bright. We have the example of innocent bystanders trying to escape during an absurd war, of the cynical doctor who mocks his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the whole film, perverse opportunists who try to make the most of of an atrocious man. event (Bjornstrand character), innocent dead children, unnamed characters are almost transformed into animals of the boat, etc. All are sort of seen through the eyes of Jan (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann), their characters are more sober in other films of Begrman (In Passion) and it is precisely because the important, c is history: the way in which external events have the capacity to radically change human nature. <br /> <br /> Bergman made this film two years after Persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word uttered by the character of Liv Ulmann is INGENTING, nothing. That's it: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter being a game that includes all games. But what about the war? And especially the annihilantes of the twentieth century. In Persona, Ulmann's character only felt real emotion when she saw a victim of the Vietnam War turn into a human torch. In Skammen, this idea extends to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. In an unnamed region of an unnamed country (we only assume it is Sweden), two factions speaking the same language engage in an absurd war. Jan and Eva are two dreamers taken in the middle, but their dreams are woven in a sort of counterpoint. Jan is at first idealistic, unable to react properly to the world and subject to the will of his wife. Towards the end, he transforms himself into a radically different personality, capable of murder without motivation, voluntary, without pity (watch carefully the suicidal ones on the boat ... the simplicity of the act is painful). For her part, Eva gradually loses contact with reality and ends up sinking into a dream that has not been realized. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the whole film conveys its message very effectively. Bergman places the viewer next to the character, placing the camera in the car with the actors, or very close behind the actor. Nykvist achieves extraordinary control of the camera. There are some effects of "portable" master, very effective so that everything seems "real". The shots when the characters are captured by the army are remarkably documentary. The scenario is minimalist but the story is quite complex in this respect. In reality, the whole film is paradoxical, the subject is of an intensity that contrasts sharply with the coldness and the lack of emotional involvement with which it is realized and filmed. Here, nothing is melodramatic, there is no compassion, no hope and no apparent redemption. But, as in Liv Ulmann's dream at the end, he is so beautiful that one can not help but be amazed ... It was not so horrible as he was handsome!
