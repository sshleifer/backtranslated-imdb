I really like this production of "The Mikado". The producers have added a few touches throughout the film to make it more fun for the modern audience - for example, "As Some Day It May Happen" (the song of "Little List") is completely updated and some lines are added over the pages. to play. Freedoms were also taken with the setting. The costumes are not Japanese, but rather English 1920s (although some "tittipudliennes" girls wear kimonos inspired by the 1920s). This production is well choreographed with dance styles from the 1920s, and there are some extra housekeepers and dancers to keep your eyes (as well as your ears) entertained during the songs. If you're a Gilbert & Sullivan purist, these changes may bother you, but I think they're fine - and I love the costumes! <br /> <br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely hilarious; all her scenes make me laugh with laughter (one of my favorite additions is when she makes her first entry - the dancing grooms bother her with their antics, so she yells loudly, "STOP IT !!!"). All the other main characters also do a great job. I especially like Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush (that toupee!) And Lesley Garrett as Yum-Miam. <br /> <br /> Remember that this is a theatrical production filmed and set your expectations accordingly. There is no change in scenery, although filmmakers used some of the filmmaking techniques of the 1930s to add interest. If there is a disadvantage to this production is that the makeup scene was not changed for close-ups with a camera. The lines of foundations are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner, lipstick and blush everywhere. I've seen that kind of thing happen with theatrical films, and it's a little chaotic at first. However, I hope you get used to it and enjoy "The Mikado" at its true value - a very nice interpretation of a classic!
