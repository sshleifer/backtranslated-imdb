When I heard about "Greek" for the first time, I thought I would look at it because it sounded ridiculous. Another bad, almost almost good show from ABC Family. But in agreeing with a college friend, we both enjoyed the pilot episode much more than we thought. <br /> <br /> As a member of a Greek society, I can say that a lot of stereotypes Here are mentioned those who come back almost every time someone starts talking about sororities and fraternities on a campus . And are also very fun to play with just on are clean, let alone watch on a TV screen. The opening scene evoked a slightly dramatized version of preparation for a formal race in some sororities, and then continued from there. <br /> <br /> This is not a show reserved for the sensitive Greeks. If you even offend joking about things that do not please you much in Greek life, you will spend the entire first episode and probably many other dreadful and screaming ones. But everyone should have a lot of fun watching it. This is not new, but as far as the university is concerned, nothing is ever new.
