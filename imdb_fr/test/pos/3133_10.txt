Two horse dealers arrive in a town and meet the leader of a group of Mormons who are heading to a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the city where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond presents the idea (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) driving the train in this valley, are among the best in the region . film, like Johnson, a real cowboy, cuts a piece of wood while he jokes with Bond. Once on the track, they come across Joanne Dru, who perhaps John Ford saw at Red River, and offered him a much better role in this film. In the Morman train, there are a number of remarkable characters. The Mormans form a peaceful group that is challenged by a group of truly modest outlaws. In their case (the outlaws), in the case of people in the train, then in a group of Navajos they meet, and in the well-written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the film escapes completely stereotypes, while the film The Camera seems to spend so much time giving the viewer the great image of Monument Valley that frames the train as it goes, crossing some waterways en route, in black and white, then go back to what is happening in this community of rotation. to accompany the beautiful vocalizations of the Pioneer Sons.
