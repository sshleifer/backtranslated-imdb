Uzumaki (Japanese for "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd films I have ever seen. A city becomes obsessed and then completely consumed by the vortex pattern in a very grotesque way. The fingers are cut, people commit suicide in washing machines ... a crazy and insane Japanese horror. Perhaps as psychologically damaging as "The Ring". Generally not as scary as "The Eye", but the pictures are more disgusting than most things in "The Eye". And not as bloody as "The Untold Story" ... but that does not mean there is not a lot of blood and dismemberment. Seriously, if you like horror movies and especially Asian horrors, you have to add this movie to your list. Some parts are a bit odd with the sound effects (the story is adapted from a comic manga and it shows), but it really suits. Unlike some movies that try too much to capture the original source ("House of the Dead"), this one does it perfectly. The most original movie you'll see ... not just this year, but probably never. Recommended!
