I will begin with a disclaimer: This movie is NOT recommended for people who lack interest or who have never played FF7 the game before watching. The film relies on the public knowledge of each character in the game to convey the elements of the plot. And it does it very subtly. Do your homework before watching this wonderful CG movie and I promise you everything will be a lot better. <br /> <br /> That's why this movie contains some of the most spectacular CG sequences I've ever seen. This whole experience was like an extra-long sequence of the game's JVM on steroids. Yeah. The attention to detail in each scene, especially in the action-oriented heavy scenes, is so impeccable that I felt a sense of wonder. <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack is simplified to help the audience focus more on the quality of animation than music. Again, for those who know the history and background of FF7, the music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and placement of each original soundtrack accompanies every scene and mood to the point that music improves just the animation). Once again, having played only once at FF7, I really enjoyed this Square Enix artwork. And that's what happens in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like a dance. <br /> <br /> In short, if you liked the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this movie will let you down. If you are in the unfortunate majority that has not experienced the quality known as FF7 on Playstation or PC, doing it before watching the movie will allow an exponentially better experience. <br /> <br /> Finally, I simply wish to note the quality of the animation of this film. The characters move fluidly. Each backdrop comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the leanness and dependence of the script, I urge you to re-examine the animation. Facial reactions, subtle clues that bring a level of entertainment superior to the typical narrative method used to tell stories. <br /> <br /> Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura have set the bar high for quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children ushered in a new era for CG animations, allowing the subtleties of each character to speak volumes about itself. <br /> <br /> Thank you Square Enix. The wait was well worth it.
