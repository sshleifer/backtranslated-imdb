It's a VERY underrated movie for the least. As has been pointed out in previous posts, this film has a somewhat lax and highly unlikely scenario, but you find yourself saying, "Who cares?" while you pull milk (or insert a drink of your choice here) through the nose. It was indeed due to a rare mix of synchronized actors. Although Kelsey Grammar is obviously a talented actor (reference "Frasier", this film), the actors of support / actress play pretty well their roles. I found it interesting to see how they wrote the game on Duane Martin who shot the ball in the "big game" of the Navy basketball team; If you're a basketball fan, remember Martin in "White Men Can not Jump" and "Over the Rim" and you'll know Martin made a short stint in the NBA with the Knicks. Well how did they add credible character attributes like this. The anal-retentive character of Rob Schneider was in perfect harmony with Grammar's calm. Lauren Holly has played brave enough with a brain to make you want to succeed. It's a movie that will make you laugh even if you have seen it many times before ... the comic extracts of this movie last forever. I always find myself laughing 12 years later. <br /> <br /> "Is this one of my hens?" "Uh ... no, it's a parrot ... Caribbean." "Well, do not let him fly ... it's supper." "Arrrrr ..... arr."
