HOUSE CALLS was a fun comedy from 1978 about a widowed doctor (Walter Matthau) who now wants to play on the field but can not help but be attracted by one of his patients (Glenda Jackson) who refuses to be another notch on his bed. Matthau loves the woman but does not really want to make the commitment that she insists on, so he agrees to attend it exclusively for two weeks, then decide whether or not to join. However, other complications make it difficult for Matthau to decide when the two weeks are up, even if he is clearly in love with the woman. Matthau and Jackson have a surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and enjoy the strong support of Richard Benjamin, Candice Azzara, Dick O'Neill and more specifically Art Carney as inept and senile chief of staff of the hospital where Matthau is employed. Matthau even has a brief scene with his real son, Charlie, who appears as Jackson's son. This engaging comedy still resists well after all these years. If you've never seen it, it's worth it to rent.
