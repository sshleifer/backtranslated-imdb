This is probably the greatest war movie and certainly one of the greatest movies. There is no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this dark glimpse of what we can only call hell. It is this silent rigor and lack of manipulation that gives the film its incredible power. Nor is there any attempt to turn the hero into Ichikawa's protagonist into a hero. He is just a poor, doomed sap who tries to stay alive in a world of horror that hopes, but is not sure, that he can cling to his humanity in the process. Ichikawa's cruel lack and illusion make Fires on the Plain an isolated event. Ichikawa passed away in February 2008.
