You do not have to be a Notre Dame football fan to enjoy it, because I'm not ... but, as a football fan in general, it was fun to watch. It almost makes me a devout Irish fighter. If you can not get carried away in the emotion of this film, network fan or not, check your pulse because it is an emotional film with very touching scenes. <br /> <br /> As a sports fan, I loved watching the classic images of the first college games. They had some pretty wild games at the time with a lot of side parts. Pat O'Brien, head coach Knute Rockne, and some of the players, such as George Gipp (Ronald Reagan), have been interspersed with this sequence. <br /> <br /> Reagan is a very good bill in this movie, but it's not really that big. O'Brien is the only player to play an important role here. The rest - all playing pretty characters - includes Gale Page in Rockne's wife "Bonnie;" Donald Crisp, as "Father John Callahan" of Notre Dame; Albert Bassermann as a chemistry professor "Father Nieuwland" and Reagan, as Gipp, perhaps the most talented and most famous player of Notre Dame. <br /> <br /> What this film does nicely, is a balance between personal history and football. Neither angle is exaggerated. The characters here all the people you can search for because there are no bad guys. During my last look, it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield - the son of Tarzan - playing Rockne at the age of seven and to see George Reeves, the Superman TV movie, among the actors. <br /> <br /> There have been very few movies about football in Hollywood, for whatever reason, and a few good ones. This is one of them.
