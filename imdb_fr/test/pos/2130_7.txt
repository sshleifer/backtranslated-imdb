I missed the full four-hour version when it was released in theaters because it played a week. I had to content myself with seeing the shorter version of about two and a half hours a year later and was stunned by what I saw. I left the theater thinking I had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering how was the full version. <br /> <br /> The full version is generally good, but it contains sequences so incredibly boring that the entire film is shot down and almost dipping under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem lies entirely in editing, which must be labeled as the last word on excesses. There are times when things go on and on and nothing happens. Shots of people in a city who spend far too much time without any purpose in the story. We get beautiful panoramas and visions of such beauty that they make you cry, but they are too often used as place substitutes instead of punctuation or placement. Most of the long version seems to be displayed just because it looks good. <br /> <br /> I tried to sit down and look at Heavens Gate without using the Fast Forward button, but somewhere along the way I find that I can not stand it anymore. <br /> <br /> I hope that MGM will take pity on us and publish the abridged version on DVD as well as the gigantic dinosaur. Maybe as a pack of two so we can see what is the best version, and if Cimino was crazy or not. <br /> <br /> And while they were there, why not include the once-rumored edition of Johnson County War, which took place 90 minutes. Supposedly United Artists is tinkering with a new discount in hopes of getting some of their money back. Whether it was done or still exists is outstanding, but it would be interesting to see.
