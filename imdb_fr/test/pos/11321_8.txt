"Dirty War" by Daniel Percival, a BBC television production, was recently broadcast by cable. The film has a documentary style in the way it pursues the people who caused the near-holocaust in one of the world's great metropolises, London. In fact, this film, produced in 2004, is almost an edifying account of the events of the following year, during which terrorists placed explosive devices on public transport that killed innocent people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. <Br/> <br /> The film impresses with the rhythm of the director and the production team. There are no boring moments in the film as we watch the preparation of terrorists and people who follow their dirty work. Although the inevitable happens, it is amazing to think what would be the consequences if a real "dirty bomb" was planted in such a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The last images of the film have a chilling effect. Crowd scenes and the way the whole area is contaminated create chills of fear, thinking that this could happen anywhere.
