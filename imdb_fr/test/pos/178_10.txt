For the first time, I saw this fantastic film and Alyssa, my star *, playing Frances Ella Fitz, was really great in this movie! It was so real and her cute little dog! I saw it the first time when I was about 11 years old and it was the best movie I have ever seen, and you know what? I still think it! 10/10 ********** = bigger than ever!
