An excellent animated film that really goes up to the old level like "The Lion King". <br /> <br /> I went to see this with one of my best Belgian friends who also watched the show on TV. I was lucky because I did not know that the Belgians knew "Wallace and Gromit". <br /> <br /> When that started and that good old theme started, he started to remember me from watching him when I was 5 years old. <br /> <br /> The humor itself was very entertaining. Some sitcom style scenes, word games or jokes. The animation is not as impressive if you know the show, but it's always fun to watch if you realize how it's done. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: Not only can this keep my pleasure and my fun, but some of the humor can easily please the elderly, so I tell them can.
