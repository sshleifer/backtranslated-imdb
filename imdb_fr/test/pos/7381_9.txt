... this piece of black filming suffers from a murky sound (at least, as shown by the inadequate equipment of the Seattle and Maine Film Festivals) and a darker plot, while Rickman suffers from an American accent, old tennis shoes and ample sweats. Nevertheless, it has moments of stellar scenery, and the film offers a sinister ambiguity of Norman Reedus, the pretty Polly Walker, and a surprise ending (telescoped to frequent spectators), while offering a nice overview of the physiography of Maine and from Rickman. Expected release in March (after the broadcast of a cable). Not to be missed by Rickman fans. Ignore the amanita hooey.
