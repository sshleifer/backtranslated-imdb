The film begins with promises because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the movie progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas gives a very good performance in his first scenes. When left on the boat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man to ask for help and is rejected several times, the viewer really begins to wonder whether it is a comedy or not. Watching a child's birthday party through a fence is another moving moment. As mentioned by another speaker, I was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones! Once Spanky and Buckwheat are at Marshall Valiant, Spanky tends to interact primarily with adults and children's chemistry is essentially lost. <br /> <br /> The Old South / Huck Finn setting does not do much to the plot, except that kids spend a lot of time outdoors. Ralph Morgan is the most attractive adult, but the other roles do not have much substance. Louise Beavers manages fun moments with a Yankee soldier towards the end. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are not bad enough and the lovers are not strong enough. Still, I think it's worth watching if you're passionate about Our Gang, if not for nothing but the strange curiosity of the whole. I give it seven stars because, although it is not a good film, it kept me engaged all the time and curious to know what would happen next.
