I had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival. Herzog introduced the film and then an hour of questions and answers. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliantly made "documentary"; Herzog later explained that he did not view his films as a documentary because the facts sometimes hide the truth. Instead, he writes scenes and ad-libs to introduce a new element that might have been forgotten if he had followed the original story plan. <br /> <br /> Little Dieter, unlike Timothy Treadwell, is a real person who disgusts you. in love with; you encourage him, you feel the anguish he feels. You admire the sense of humor and joie de vivre he exhibited here 30 years after his capture by the Viet Cong. You are disappointed to learn that Dieter died not so long ago. <br /> <br /> As in most of Herzog's films, the images are breathtakingly beautiful with a wonderful choice of background music. Especially a battle scene extracted from the archives of the Vietnam War but which corresponds to Dieter's story. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the film, Dieter returns to the infernal jungle where he was a prisoner of war. Decree his trip with locals. Horror to look at, I can not imagine how he felt when he was bound. <br /> <br /> One of the best films to portray and discuss the nightmare of the Vietnam War. This should serve as a lesson.
