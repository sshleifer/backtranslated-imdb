Everyone loves this memorable film, dressed to the nines. Alain Delon provides the anti-hero, Melville provides the cool and a handful of other great talents (Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte and Andr√© Bourvil, for the most part) arrive to add an engaging movie ... <br /> < br /> ... with very little dialogue. This is great, because a particular aspect of the genre is often the dialogue between the quick wits and their various parts. This movie, however, could be watched with the sound completely off and would not be missed too much. Not to say that the sound is bad, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the net audio capturing the small movements make the slow and patient deliberation of the patients very convincing. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect of this film is also that the color cinematography is quite fantastic. Usually, when I talk about cinematography, black-and-white films come to mind, but this film contains very strong and beautiful images that make the film a pure visual pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
