I still can not describe how I feel when I received this from the Fnac website. A film so rare, so little spoken and known, is hard to find, even for fans, but the contrast between the past and the present is devastating: I now have a DVD of the film, with the best quality possible. As in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought on the Internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights on my DVD and TV turned off, and I was amazed by this experience. I did not know what to expect. Wickedly, I always looked for some kind of disappointment when I saw a Luc Besson movie I had never seen before. But that never came. This film was no exception. From the beginning, I understood that the person who makes a film like this one as a first feature film is destined to be great in the future. And it happened. This has won several awards (including the highest in a film festival in my country, which I'm proud of) and it shows that this film is preparing much bigger things. This is perhaps the most original post-war film I have ever seen, defeating Mad Max with its originality and artistic sense. This film poses no problem: its cinematography is great, as well as the performances of the actors. I am also proud to say that I have finally seen all the films of my favorite director and that I have almost all of them (Joan of Arc still waiting for me to buy the DVD). This film is primarily a work of style and dedication, which is why Luc Besson is a director of my choice: good taste, beautiful framing, excellent use of music (I was also amazed by the first feature film of 'Eric Serra) and the promise of great achievements. Gaumont did well to bet in his genius, the man who would later change the face of relations between France and Europe between the cinema and their audience. Let's hope Besson starts working on a new management project. I will be the first to cheer. Until then, I recommend this movie to anyone who needs to learn how to make a good movie with little money. I loved the atmosphere of the film which, with its black and white cinematography, suggests an even more depressed worldview after the Holocaust. This film uses the magic of movies: show in pictures what we can not explain in words. And I am with all those who wrote comments on this film and who liked it: good choice! A big hug to anyone who sees this and feels that a little bit of their life has changed.
