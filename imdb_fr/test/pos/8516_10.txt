Never Say Never Again and Thunderball have many similarities, not only about Sean Connery, but also about story and plot. With the exception of the actors, all the others are identical to a diversion of atomic bombs, a ransom demand, a nuclear weapons traffic in a ship, etc. And in the thunder, NATO / RAF itself charges nuclear weapons in an airplane and in Never Say Never Again, it is modified by a "red arm of the ax". Nearly 99% is the same thing. If anyone wants to challenge that, he is welcome.
