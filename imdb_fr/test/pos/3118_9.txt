I first saw this film on television in 1959, at the age of eight. At the time, I did not know anything about westerns, but I recognized Ben Johnson from the movie "Mighty Joe Young". What attracted me to "Wagon Master" are the great songs performed by the "Sons of Pioneers". Merian C. Cooper, who produced the film, was the first to order original music to fit the mood of a given scene and thus created the film's soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the ambiance of his classic King Kong creation. Steiner will later win an Oscar for the theme "Gone With the Wind". Cooper was also the producer of "Mighty Joe Young". If you remember, the music was important to the great ape, which would only respond to the sound of Stephan Foster's "Beautiful Dreamer". In 1947, Cooper joined John Ford, who directed "Master of the wagon." Among all the famous westerns of Ford, this one is my favorite, which shows his brother Francis and a sullen Janes Arness.
