Certainly, there are blunders, for the one who wants to find them. However, they are not important. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this film is to watch experienced experienced actors do their job. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays the role of a strong but hurt woman. Same thing for Harrison Ford, who, for the ladies, is as good as Kristin is beautiful for us guys. <br /> <br /> Their wound at the hands of their adulterous wives brings them together clumsily, but in which they support each other. The way they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity on the screen is why these artists are so sought after. The viewer can not help feeling what he feels, not wanting to encourage them when they are together. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are several action scenes featuring corrupt police officers angry, but they only spice them up. A little, and are not an important part of the movie. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, Dave Grusin provides a superb jazz-based background featuring trumpet player Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought-after music consultants in the film industry. Blanchard shows why he is one of the best trumpeters on the scene. <br /> <br /> This is not a film for lovers of guts, blood and gore. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, look at a beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes who can play, like Harrison Ford, an endless, soothing accompaniment offered by Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard it's a move to watch with someone you love. Preferably in bed. <br /> <br /> I thought it deserved at least one 8.
