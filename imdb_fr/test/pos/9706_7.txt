I just got out of a preview session and this movie was hilarious. Maybe better than the first, but at least his equal. If you do not like the idiot or the really useless amounts of male nudity (much more than in the first), stay far, far away. But if you dig all about Jackass, then this movie will not disappoint you. Toro Totter is the greatest invention of all time. OKAY. my criticism was therefore not long enough ... All I have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really fuck her mouth. So, if you like masochistic humor, prolific male nudity, and by far the most disgusting female nudity of all time (John Waters is involved, should I say more?), Then this movie will take you into the arms for the whole. I never stopped laughing and went out sweaty.
