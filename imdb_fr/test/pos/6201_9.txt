I do not understand why this show did not last. There could have been different ways to continue on the line of Darwin and Farik after season 2, obviously, Darwin could not have been the infiltrating agent of UC cells and sabotaging them from there to inside, but they should still have given this show at least another season. <br /> <br /> The show is well planted, credible and considers the Islamic religion from the normal point of view and the extremist one. It discusses controversial topics in detail and has a dramatic meaning that can be said of very few shows nowadays. In fact, I am sad that I did not hear about this show before the end of 2007.
