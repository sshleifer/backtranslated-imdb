It's ten times better than "Who wants to be a super model" on Bravo, I think it's more true for the company. Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and can make the most of each model in the making. The photos look for depth in each model, personality and beauty, attributes of strength and wisdom, and the ability to support and work for what they want. I like to see the personal experience of Tyra being taken into account during the photo sessions and on the podiums. I do not always agree with the comments of the judges or Tyra and at least one of the winners, I do not think they deserved to win. But this is just a show and every girl in this city is very lucky to have this chance.
