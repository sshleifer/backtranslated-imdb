Over the years, I enjoyed both Van Dykes and was happy to watch them again. <br /> <br /> Just as cute and funny, easy to watch and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dick was good when he was younger, but I liked him more as he got older. <br /> <br /> His Berry was an excellent player to follow in his father's footsteps. <br /> <br /> Together they form a great team and work well together. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed not to have found another 101 murder listed anywhere. <br /> <br /> I saw both of those that were presented. I hope more, because it's really a nice duo to watch. <br /> <br /> You can certainly tell Berry to follow in his father's footsteps, they talk to each other and have the same manners. <br /> <br /> Would appreciate everything they do separately. <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch everything they do alone and together.
