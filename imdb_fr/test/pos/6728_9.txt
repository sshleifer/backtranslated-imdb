This movie haunts me since I saw it when I was about 8 years old. I did not know what his name was, so I'm glad I found him. I remember being very scared, because I had just visited a tin mine in Cornwall when I looked at it. Fortunately, I did not see any ghosts of dead children, but I found this film very disturbing and scary when I was much younger. I certainly never forgot it, even though I could not find it anywhere. I think I remember that Children's Film Foundation films are generally good, but they do not show them at all. I also remember programs like The Children Of Green Knowe from the same era on BBC - just as disturbing in its own way.
