I did not read Anne Rice's novel on which this movie was based, but who knows, reading the book may be cheaper than praising the queen of the damned and is probably better for you. This film is not necessarily bad for health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercise more the active part of your brain than this movie. You can count the number of pages of Anne Rice I read with one hand, but after watching this movie and Interview with a vampire, I feel that she writes very good novels. The intrigues of these two films foreshadow a rich and deep history of vampires. <br /> <br /> Still, Stuart Townsend's voice-over narration becomes far more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative, you can say that the limited production resources of the Queen of the Damned are barely enough flesh to Anne Rice's script. While Interview has decided to go along with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low-budget special effects that really strive to be taken seriously. It can be seen that the original novel had potential as a film and that the production team focused its attention on the wrong places. The costumes and the rock & roll scene could have been replaced by more blood and a more terrifying soundtrack. <br /> <br /> However, I will give credit to where the credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had let me down with the sickness that disgusted me as Butthead. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very cool zoom & splice montage, but after about ten minutes, the staging degenerates. quickly. It's as if the film was so long that the director realized that there was not enough time and money to do justice to Anne Rice's novel. The result is mediocre vampire scenes and many nerdy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED does not do justice to the genre, just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is the pale blue makeup? Scene after scene, I shook my head to remember the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night where tight budgets were well calculated. <br /> <br /> There are redemptive qualities that allow this film not to be dirty. Accessories to Aaliyah and his soul rest in peace forever. She could have become a famous actress if her life had not been taken away so early, because she had given this film a decent performance with lots of beautiful belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It was not too long. Anne Rice's novel could easily have lasted three hours if an ambitious filmmaker like Francis Ford Coppola had got her hands on it. There are some twists here and there in the plot. But overall, it was a legitimate addition to the panoply of second-rate vampire movies. The director of this film then directed a new mini series of Battlestar Galactica, if that tells you anything. <br /> <br /> JY <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com
