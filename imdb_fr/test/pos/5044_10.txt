I found this film to be one of those comforting jewels. The plot is closely linked and the development of the character is fantastic! Anyway, I'm a big fan of non-American movies and I find it good: "Happenstance", "The Closet" and even "King of Hearts". Vlastimil Brodsky as Fanda, is fantastic. It is a love story in the true sense of the love life and the meanders it takes to get the viewer to understand / appreciate Fanda's perspective on life (which costs him almost more than that he is willing to give) are wonderful. His co-star Stelle Zazvorkova is unforgettable because his wife is fed up. I highly recommend this movie to the whole family - my kids loved it.
