Anyone who wants to know more about skateboarding development should find the right research material for Dogtown and Z-Boys. This should not be confused with Lords of Dogtown, this unfortunate Hollywood attempt to capitalize on the success of Dogtown's original revival. <br /> <br /> Directed by former Z-Boys member Stacey Peralta as well as professional skater and brain behind the 80's Bones Brigade, and co-written with skateboard photojournalist Craig Stecyk, this documentary describes how a Surf group Southern California street kids (Dogtown) who formed the Z-Boys skateboarding team (in fact, there was a girl - Peggy Oki) revolutionized skateboarding. The film contains interviews with almost all Z-Boys (we do not know where Chris Cahill is), the most notable being Tony Alva and the youngest, Jay Adams, whose talents (with Perlata) seemed to transcend the rest of the world. teams. . There are interviews with the founders of the team (and the Dogtown store), surfboard designer Jeff Ho, Skip Engbloom and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews with people like Tony Hawk (of course), Ian McKaye (Fugazi) and Henry Rollins, who were young children in the '70s when Dogtown exerted his influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was a very different previous years documentary explains). <br /> <br /> This really shows you not only who the Dogtown team was and how it was formed, but also why its style changed not only in skateboarding (the pool skating became immensley, and so green), has also facilitated the sport (although it is not the extreme commercialism it has today), because it was not that the ephemeral fashion he had known earlier, because these young surfers in the surf broke early in the morning needed ways to spend their time and started skateboarding. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand were over, but the Dogtowns, at least through the advertising of their skate team, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. Because Dogtown attracted all the attention, they were able to advance skating to the next stage. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent documentary, although Stacey Peralta has always done so, even when producing the Bones Brigade's mini-movies / skate shows such as "Ban This" and "Search for Animal" Chin ". Told by Sean Penn, the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains many fantastic archive footage and many interviews to give you a clear idea of ​​the Z-Boy's personality and how they have marked skateboarding.
