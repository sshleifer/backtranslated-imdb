LAST DAYS <br /> <br /> Format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Problems fly away when a Los Angeles party animal ( Wes Ramsey) falls in love with a handsome Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). <br /> <br /> A resounding success on the festival circuit and its limited theatrical release, this friendly film is the first feature film by writer C. Jay Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) - is an exercise in 'opposites attract ', in which the superficial character of Ramsey is forever changed after being hard-pressed by the vulnerable beauty Sandvoss, who is constrained by the diktat of his religious beliefs. Here, the path to true love is paved with hardships, including the reaction of Sandvoss Mormon comrades to her new sexuality, which translates into her excommunication from the church and the anger of her indignant parents (Mary Kay Place came up small but devastating as an outraged mother of the boy). But Cox's storyline focuses on Ramsey's path to redemption, as his influence on the hedonistic lifestyle is disrupted by Sandvoss's influence and resulting responsibilities as a result of his growing maturity. live at home, which creates an unexpected friendship with Erik Palladino (ex-TV party-goer), a former TV fan, whose illness gives Ramsey a much-needed awakening. <br /> <br /> Cox's script is juicy one-liners and various pearls of wisdom (on Mormonism: "Your church does not like alcohol or homosexuals? Well, I certainly will not participate - I can not imagine paradise without both! "), and the characters are surprisingly complex and well drawn. Ramsey has the most spectacular and sexy role (he was first seen doing something rude to a volunteer participant!), But it's Sandvoss who has become a kind of gay icon, with his sensitive portrait of innocent with a sweet character that leads from darkness to light to a surprising revelation of his place in the world around him. He and Ramsey agree well, and their inevitable sexual scene (brief but memorable) is followed by a fascinating sequence in which Ramsey describes a trauma from his childhood that has defined his life to this day. <br /> <br /> Filmed on hi -def video and transferred to a 35 mm format for a theatrical exhibition, the film's meager budget imposes limits on the scale and magnitude of Cox's ambitions, although the characters and situations are powerful enough to survive this minor inconvenience. Jacqueline Bisset shines like a social restorer at the restaurant where Ramsey is waiting to make a living, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("The Third Stone of the Sun") steals everyone's thunder as a Sandvoss Mormon fellow, opposed to the relationship of his friend with Ramsey on the religious principle ... but only on the principle. Although slightly elevated in places, the film suffers from romantic nostalgia and deserves praise for its honesty and compassion. Best seen with a crowd of like-minded viewers, preferably with a loved one by your side.
