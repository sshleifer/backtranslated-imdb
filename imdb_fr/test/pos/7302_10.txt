This film is excellent in its description of the reality of sexual abuse. The girls perfectly express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal. The landscape on site is captivatingly authentic and the soundtrack is discreet but moving. This film is a postgraduate course in a reality too little recognized in American society. Personally, I'm freaked out by the names of the characters - Lange's character is Ginny Cook Smith - my name is Connie Cook Smith and my mother is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, who's called my sister, and the father is Larry Cook, my cousin's name. But sexual abuse was not in our immediate family.
