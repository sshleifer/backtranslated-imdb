I saw what I believe to be the best Australian film of the year so far, Acolytes of Jon Hewitt. <br /> <br /> Acolytes is a stylish thriller whose idea is to kill. Get this? Two intimidated and molested teenagers discover a local serial killer in their suburbs and then start to blackmail him to kill the tyrant who molested them. Hewitt chose a top-notch cast, including top newcomers Sebastian Gregory, Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence, to embody the teenager. Add to that three, yes, that's three super psychopath! Conducted by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding performance of the serial killer of the day, Belinda McClory, his disturbed wife, and Michael Dorman, the teenager raping the abuser, with swastika tattoos. Once you add these menacing teenagers and adults, all hell breaks loose ?? Hewitt has created a serial thriller that is original and accomplished. You can see the influence of Twin Peaks by Larry Clark and David Lynch, but Hewitt appropriates everything in a remote suburb of Qld, still ringing with the drones of emptiness. The screenplay by Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight. <br /> <br /> If it is marketed properly, this film could be a real success for teenagers. The next Wolf Creek? It could be. He does all the right things. The teenagers are real ala Larry Clark. They are not null and have a PC agenda attached, they are non-communicative, beautiful and trendy. The killers are dark and threatened. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes with the Tear Bundy, a man of the city with gentle manners, who wears a butterfly on his reserve disk 4-wheel drive as John Fowles, the collector. The rapist at Dorman's head looks into the threat that hangs over Suburban Mayhem and provides a scary thug that you can not wait to buy the farm. <br /> <br /> The film is fast, hard and brutal. In addition, he displays a confidence and control of the direction of Hewitt that will surely allow him to win a nomination to IF or AFI, if not a price! Its nuanced and poetic staging, brilliant sound, excellent cinematography and tight structure clearly position it as one of the best Oz scenes I've seen so far this year. <br /> <br /> thinking and unstable. This is a very nice edition of the return to the genre in progress in Australian cinema. This will surely attract Hollywood interest. Oh, and did I already mention that it happened in Toronto? What other Oz movies can say the same? The world should be preparing for a new author, Jon Hewitt.
