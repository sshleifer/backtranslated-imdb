Being a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to see the movie. I enjoyed every minute. This is very sincere. Throughout the film, it seemed like Natalie was the mother and Susan the mother. Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept burning because of that. <br /> <br /> I heard there must be a love scene between Natalie and a guy (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed . And I think it's great. I think a love scene would ruin the tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> Natalie must have the gift of choosing good movies because I have not seen her in a bad movie yet. So any film featuring Natalie Portman will probably be seen by me. <br /> <br /> A good movie. 7/10
