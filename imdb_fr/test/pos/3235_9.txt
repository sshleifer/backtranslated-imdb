Do not watch this film while waiting for Jane Austen's wit, a clear dialogue or a clever social comment. This time, the premises of Northanger Abbey have been updated in a very sensual way! <br /> <br /> In this version, Catherine's erotic reveries are not just idiotic fantasies, but a link to the world of adult sexuality, that she takes a look at in her adventures of the day. By day she is very wise and primitive, and her insignia Henry treats her with the greatest courtesy. But as her own sexual nature wakes up, her daydreams change subtly from sweet to scorching! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, Catherine's visions of sex are entirely based on the Gothic novels she devours in bed. It's both comforting, sexy and provocative to watch how his dreamy photo of the handsome Henry "dissolves" in a terrifying dream of being carried away and thrilled by romantic villains! At the same time, it is ironic and moving to go back to bed in the morning. Catherine asleep peacefully looks so innocent that you will never guess what is really happening in this pretty little head! <br /> <br /> Later, after being invited to Henry's castle, Catherine hears a family dispute and fully understands its meaning. Jumping into bed, she covers herself with the sheets and stays awake listening with fear, her striking blue eyes are the only visible sign that she is alert. Little by little, however, these pretty blue eyes veil and close again as she lets herself go to another dream heated by innocent desire. This time, Catherine dreams that she is in the Elizabethan era, waiting with horror in front of the castle the approach of "banditi!" It is clear that she is more excited than terrified at being taken away by bandits. She shivers with excitement and anticipation! But then, after a picture of her running desperately to escape, we are back in the world in the light of day, where the maid reprimands her for ruining her room before falling asleep. It should be noted that Catherine's ringing eyes in the morning light are in themselves a rather sensual symbol of the passion of her dreams! <br /> <br /> In the end, of course, Henry, Henry's harsh and unimaginative love, guesses the nature of his fantasies and gives him a stern lecture. It is interesting to note that the immediate collapse of Catherine in tears symbolizes not a retreat, but a breakthrough in adult relationships. In the next scene, she burst into tears her Gothic novel and throws herself ashamed and sobbing on the bed. Significantly, this turning point is also marked by the fact that Catherine falls into a deep sleep - except that this time, there is no dream to believe passion. Presumably, Catherine has matured enough to be ready to face reality. <br /> <br /> Although Katherine Schlesinger has beautiful blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performance is charming, it must be said that dream sequences this film adaptation is extremely dull. I give it 9 stars only because true romantics can fully enjoy it at the level of daydreaming. <br /> <br /> If you want to read a book about a young heroine with sincere will, who overcomes true darkness and danger in a real gothic setting, I highly recommend Elizabeth Marie Pope's THE PERILOUS GARD.
