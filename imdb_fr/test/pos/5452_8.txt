TV movies do not usually get as much recognition and credit as big movies - and that's usually for a reason, but HBO's 1996 film, The Late Shift, is easily one of the best TV movies in the world. all the time. Based on Bill Carter's revealing book, The Late Shift discusses how NBC treated late-night talk show hosts David Letterman and Jay Leno to fill the vacant Johnny Tonight Show Carson. We see what happens on camera: author Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were turned off. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we can never really know for sure what really happened. When Johnny Carson is replaced by Letterman or Leno, The Late Shift offers us an interesting and possible reality. Although just a very well done movie, The Late Shift also does a great job in describing all sides equally - although you wonder if the movie makes Letterman and Leno a too kind person with guys; especially Leno, who seems a bit too holy. <br /> <br /> The performances are also very good. In a very deserving Golden Globe performance, Kathy Bates plays Helen Kushnick, Leno's extremely aggressive manager, who, according to Carter and the book / movie, was very problematic for the studio and Leno (the real Kushnick suited Bill Carter for Slander Against!) John Michael Higgins stands out from his usual gigs of getting original little comedy pieces and gives an excellent performance as David Letterman - giving an excellent Letterman print but also creating a dimensional character and able to to be told. Daniel Roebuck gives a good performance as Leno but does not quite fit the other talents of the film - Roebuck probably did what everyone could have done better. He looks completely hammered when someone tries to make an impression or a performance of Leno. . Bob Balaban (Warren Littlefield), Treat Williams (a Michael Ovitz-style magician) and Ed Begley Jr. (a pompous Rod Perth) also offer unforgettable performances. <br /> <br /> The Late Shift is certainly one of the best movies for television I have ever seen. I guess if we did not watch David Letterman or Jay Leno, The Late Shift may not be right for them, but it's an interesting movie for those embarking on late night politics - a phenomenon that has recently made its head again with the 2009 movie -10 Debacle Conan / Leno / NBC.
