Many American brains who adore and support the political half-truths of thugs like Michael Moore would do well to watch this film more than once and see how hypnotic manipulators can scare, intimidate and lie to an under-informed and scared public or repugnance killed, shot, and mutilated. In this beautiful epic, Robespierre eliminates opposition at a distance, all in an access of devotion to his principles. We have the impression that Robes felt that it was perfectly legitimate to cut off the head of his opponent, even as he sent his henchmen to prepare false and deceptive accusations against the state. Today, the captains of our decaying media institutions are much more sensitive to the fact that Robes ... they simply murder your character with insinuations and false accusations without foundation or source. Witness the attempts to assassinate W's character on the eve of the 2004 elections by Dan Rather, or the incessant drum beat of the 2000 election theft, although constitutional scholars continue to mock this irresponsible behavior.
