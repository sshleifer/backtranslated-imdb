I have nothing but praise for this film. From start to finish, he captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I am not a big fan of musicals, most of them are very exaggerated. However, he has changed his mind. I am an actor myself and I have already played Sweeney and I know how difficult this role is. George Hearn gave an astonishing, masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards we could award him (he won an Emmy and that's something.) Everything he does is turned into gold. It's so good that you'll understand why it's not one of the Oscar-winning films. Lansbury is also very good and very funny. Sara Woods is scary and wonderful as a beggar woman. Overall, a great video. Pick it up if you can.
