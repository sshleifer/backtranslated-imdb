The Kid - At age 39, Russel Duritz has a life that most men would like to have. He has a great job, he is respected (and feared), he has a beautiful house and earns a lot of money. But everything has a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and the fear of spending the rest of his life. He just needs someone to show him the way. <br /> <br /> While I was watching the movie, I wondered why Disney had not passed it on to Miramax - not because it was particularly daring or edgy, but because it's clearly an adult film . This is exacerbated by the marketing campaign that clearly targets children - it is bundled with trailers for "Rugrats the Movie" and "Pokemon 2000" (have not they gone yet?). But I quibble. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the delicate treatment of the subject treated - rather than by the typical midlife crisis that involves a pathetic sap that buys a convertible and behaves like a moron, the character Willis undertakes a serious introspection and takes stock of his life. His guide in this self-discovery journey is himself at the age of 8 (they never explain how Rusty comes in and, frankly, I did not care). The innocence and unbridled optimism of Young Rusty gives him an undeniable advantage in revealing the truth. He summarizes Russell's work as an image consultant: "You teach people to lie and pretend to be something they are not." For a good story to succeed, you need actors to make it happen. No problem here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis ignored WC three times Fields' warnings about playing with children or animals make him once again lucky, he's also comical with Breslin that dramatically with Osment. Willis manages to balance Russell's pitiless traits with vulnerability and confusion, without becoming ridiculous. Meanwhile, Breslin recounts the death of a child from everyone's childhood - one who has always resisted for some reason and who has been trapped. We also get two extra performances: Lily Tomlin is great as an assistant at the head of Russell and Jean Smart is perfect as a charming and insightful presenter (I loved him in "Guinevere"). <br /> <br /> The Kid is charming, heavy, and real. And it will appeal to adults of all ages.
