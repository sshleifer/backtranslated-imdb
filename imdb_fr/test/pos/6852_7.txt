OK, Anatomy is not a reinvention of the Horrormovie genre, but it's still well done. Good actors (Potente and FÃ¼hrmann at first) and some good ideas made me happy. I might have been less optimistic if it was not a German film, but it does not matter. It's good to see familiar faces in a good, exciting story, with gore and good jokes. You all complain about dubbing: I have not seen a dubbed version (of course), but I think it's not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. We (Germans) are used to watching movies like that, so that's not a big problem. But try to look in German with subtitles. The actors are really good!
