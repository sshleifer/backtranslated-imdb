This one man show is perhaps the most fantastic show I have ever seen. Calling it simply a stand-up act amounts to doing a great injustice, there is a definite reason for it to be a Broadway show. John Leguizamo knows how to enable people from all cultures to feel at home by listening to his story of growing up and facing his family and his life in general. I would recommend this show to everyone, as long as they speak the language.
