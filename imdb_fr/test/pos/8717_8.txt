Vadim changed the image and way of life of Brigitte from that of the young beauty of the society he had married to that of a rebellious and demanding 1950s teenager ?? <br /> <br /> "A Parisienne" has managed to launch its beautiful silhouette in the features of the adolescent goddess, occasional sexuality, provocative cheerfulness against men ?? <br /> <br /> Charles Boyer ?? as Prince Charles ?? was the perfect choice, ideal of those magically romantic moments ?? His deep and vibrant voice announced new love affairs ?? His deep and wonderful eyes evoke a knowledge of the world not tarnished by cynicism ?? He had the boudoir grace of Valentino without the hysteria or the effeminate sometimes of the great lover ?? Under the direction of Michel Boisrond, Boyer was an old romantic style without the big way ??
