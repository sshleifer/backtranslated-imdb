From the point of view of the hectic and contemporary world in which we live, the so-called "good old days" always seem much more serene and innocent; an idyllic past where we have only memories and shadows that remain on the big screen, as in "Christmas In Connecticut", a warm and endearing film directed by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck plays the role of Elizabeth Lane, a popular Martha Stewart-type columnist who writes about life at her beloved Connecticut farm, always with the latest recipe in the center of the story. One of his biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine for which she writes. Yardley never visited his farm and, in response to an idea that was expressed to him in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to spend an old-fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and his child and, as special guest, a Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor who has just recovered from a fortnight spent at sea on a raft after torpedoing her ship. Of course, Elizabeth can not refuse her boss, but there are problems; the least of these is the fact that she does not have a farm and writes her column in the comfort of a skyscraper in the city. This creates a precarious situation for her and her publisher, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), because the only thing Mr. Yardley requires of his employees is complete honesty. The following is a charming and deliciously romantic comedy that transports the audience to a seemingly simpler place and place to share a Christmas past of warmth, good food and kindness. <br /> Barbara Stanwyck, absolutely. Shines like Elizabeth, with a smile and a warmer presence than anything the biggest home can offer, and totally convincing as a city-dweller completely out of her element on the farm. Morgan also does well for the somewhat naive sailor, whose confidence in his neighbor is admirable. Even with the disappointments around him, he's the kind of guy who will land one way or another, and in the end, it's Elizabeth that you really love. Sidney Greenstreet is one of the great pleasures of this movie. His Yardley has a rough exterior, but underneath, you know without a shadow of a doubt that he's a man with a heart as big as Texas. It's a simple and honest portrait, and it's a pleasure to watch it work. the most memorable scenes of the film belong to him. <br /> <br /> The secondary cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), formidable Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers). `Christmas In Connecticut 'is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously, that raises perfectly and that will leave you feeling well-being during the Christmas season (although it can work any time of the year) . A warm place in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be. It's a real classic not to be missed. I note this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
