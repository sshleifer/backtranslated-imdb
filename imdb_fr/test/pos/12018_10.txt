It's one of those movies that, for some reason, just clicked with me. Everything is correct. Laconic Eric Roberts, a good investigator, his narration, the plot scenario, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb are entrusted with good roles, sets, paintings of the scenes of the artist's studio, the sequence of the end credits and the mesmerizing theme music that perfectly envelops the atmosphere of the entire movie. If I have reservations, it's Beverly D'Angelo as a femme fatale, but she plays her last scenes wonderfully well. I think the director Matthew Chapman was trying to create a kind of "Chinatown" as a whole. It did not work. But as a mystery murder it is a jewel.
