As a lesbian, I'm tired of being portrayed in movies and on television as a sad person, swinging forever between suicide and homicide, but never destined to find happiness? <br /> <br /> If, like me, you're fed up with Hollywood's anti-lesbian propaganda, you'll breathe a sigh of relief at this delightful BBC offer. Nan Astley is the daughter of an Oyster-house restaurateur who "wonders why she can not feel what she should feel about Freddy" (one of the guys in the area who has her eyes on her) . She falls ?? and falls hard ?? for Kitty Butler, a male imitator with a visiting theater troupe. Nan accompanies Kitty to London as a convenient ?? <br /> <br /> Everything that happens to Nan is not pleasant in this story, and some of the things she does are not flawless either - but she will win your heart and her triumphant love story will leave you. with a nice ball in the throat at the end. <br /> <br /> If you're a hateful macho, a homophobic homemaker, or some kind of religious fundamentist who believes that homosexuals should die and go to hell, this series is not for you. But if you have a heart and believe in love, you will cry in the end as much as me!
