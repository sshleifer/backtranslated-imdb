These are not your daily Tom and Jerry for many reasons. First, there's a Jerry voiceover narration, which is odd, because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Two, both are friends, which was also rare and rarely works as the more contradictory shorts do. Third, and more importantly, humorous drawing is rarely humorous (by design) and the jokes here are dry and dull laughs with a little cough and a bloody bubble at the end. Think of a Tom and Jerry cartoon directed by Tim Burton. Not quite successful, but it works largely. The most scary end for a MGM short film that I can remember. Not for everyone and proof that these shorts have never been intended for children as a target audience. It's worth watching. Recommended with the warnings above.
