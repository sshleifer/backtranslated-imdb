Spoilers: This movie has its problems, but in the end it gets the message across. I liked that because it ends like this. The nice boy tries and tries, his heart is broken several times, but in the end, there is no typical Hollywood ending. It ends as always, or at least always in my personal experiences. Anyone who thinks that the end is not the reality, as the first comment seemed, believing that the girl was coming, realizes she is dating a jerk who treats her badly because he does not care at all is either naive or lives in a world more perfect than me. I give him 7/10, extra points just because he's not afraid to finish on a serious note, gives no real resolution, just the main character left broken, confused and alone like so many generations of men countless have been before.
