Extraordinary Rendition is a frighteningly authorized practice, surprisingly, under Clinton, which allows the US government to seize and detain anyone suspected, for whatever reason, of being a terrorist against the United States. This is a sensitive issue, especially after 9/11, as supporters of the practice still blame the opposition for denying the United States the vital power they need to fight terrorism effectively. Fanatic supporters will call the opposition terrorists in themselves. <br /> <br /> But like a recent film lending a level of humanity similar to the death penalty, The Life of David Gale, Rendition tells us a story of the abuse of extraordinary rendition, or at least of the ease with which it can be exploited and falsely applied. The story involves Anwar El-Abrahimi, an Egyptian-born chemical engineer who is seized on his way back to America after giving a lecture in Egypt. The reason is that he telephoned a known terrorist. No proof is ever given (or necessary) that it was Anwar who made the calls, that his phone was never stolen or lost. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Isabella, Anwar's extremely pregnant woman, is back in the United States looking for her husband, who flew to Chicago but did not apparently never stalled. The weak explanation that he had never been there evaporates when she discovers that he made an in-flight purchase with his credit card. <br /> <br /> Lately, I have studied modern Chinese history, especially that of the surprisingly selfish and brutal dictatorship set up by Mao Tse-tung, and it is more than frightening to see the similarities between some of Mao's alarmist tactics, including his public executions (which people were forced to watch), and the widespread use of torture specifically used to extort "confessions". <br /> <br /> It is quite disturbing to see that Mao specifically acted to create a climate of fear in order to obey the Chinese people. To say that the Bush administration has not created a climate of fear and continues to feed it with all its worth, would be naive to the extreme, and although an extraordinary rendition was not created under Bush it is clear that she is doing more harm than good. <br /> <br /> Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works behind a CIA desk and has little field experience, adds to the thick film until his boss is murdered and that he suddenly finds himself supervising the torture. of a man whom he doubts quickly has nothing to reveal. The daughter of Fatima (the boss of Freeman) also plays a key role, as well as a senatorial assistant played by Peter Sarsgaard, who could play the most satisfying role in the film. Meryl Streep is also cold and clinical as a cold senator with dogmatic support for the need and practice of restitution. <br /> <br /> As a political thriller, the film is remarkably well designed and punctuated. But the scariest thing is that all this is real. The purpose of the film is to get people to really think about things made under the American name, especially when they claim to have been made to prevent these same things. Conducting terror in the name of the prevention of terror will win us no sympathy, any more than the extract of confessions by brutal torture, which is the most basic form of criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we are gradually moving in this direction, to do these things more rather than less. The frightening question is, what is the event that will happen at some point in the future to convince us to stop and head to the other side, to civilization and peace, or are we simply going to continue to lead us to a military dictatorship There?
