Well, I'm concerned that my review of this special show does not take into account an observation very different from the others before me, but I literally observed it - in a PBS membership campaign - and frankly I'm too excited to say nothing. To really appreciate the enigma of Barbra Streisand, you have to look back before the cinema. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid-60s. When television was still a young media, there was a form of entertainment very present on the air that is now a memory today: the musical variety. Some music shows were weekly series, but others were unique specials, showcasing the particular talent of the performer. This is where we have the raw, unrestrained looks on Streisand. She had previously appeared in other variety shows, including Garry Moore and Ed Sullivan, and had scored a major blow in a unique appearance in tandem with the woman who would pass on the extraordinary belter torch to her: Judy Garland. In 1966, COLOR ME BARBRA introduced Barbra Streisand in color (hence the title), but copied the format of his first special show a year earlier, almost to the letter. In 3 separate acts, we get an abstract Streisand (in an art museum after hours that looks and sometimes become works of art), a comic Streisand who works in an audience already adoring in a circus workshop (populated many fur and fur animals) And best of all, a Streisand singing in mini-concert format ... Well, frankly, I do it. <br /> <br /> It surprises me that she still has the beginning of the upcoming FUNNY GIRL movie, as well as the roles of songwriter, director and political activist. Here, she is barely 24 years old and doing extraordinary things because, as she says in her own introduction to the camera, "we did not know we could not, so we did it". The art museum sequence is shot in Philadelphia for a weekend, immediately after the museum closed to the public Saturday night, and apparently with a single color camera. However, there are cuts, dissolutions and gunshots, culminating in a spectacular climax: the "Gotta Move", with a slightly modern beatnik flavor. After getting lost among the modern abstract, the bongos of the jazz club begin. Streisand appears in a psychedelic dress and sparkling eye makeup, creating a catchy staccato melody with an almost androgynous sex appeal. Believe it or not, act 3 does not correspond to an act or an advantage: in the sequence of the concert, Streisand recites the torch in the sequence of the concert: "tearing in the final notes and revealing one of those climatic belts that You're screaming like a little girl, even if you're 44 ... and a guy, just the old-fashioned TV.
