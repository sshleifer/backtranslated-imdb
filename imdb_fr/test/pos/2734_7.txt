15 Park Avenue, although the mystifying name at the beginning is a New York address and a film taking place in Kolkata. However, as the story unfolds, one realizes the thin line that the director is trying to navigate between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of schizophrenia. I would say that Aparna Sen is a director who has a lot more to say and therefore has less time at her disposal. Without a doubt, she managed to make a good movie. In a way, it makes us realize that each of us is probably looking for his own "15 Park Avenue". It's an endless search in all of us ... <br /> <br /> The performance of Shabana Azmi is a treat to watch. His presence on the screen brings a lot of life to the scene. Indeed, it was surprising to see it in such a powerful act after a long time, because I was expecting it to be all the ground of Konkona Sen's field. Shabana makes you feel deeply like an older sister who runs the entire show for a rather unhappy family and during that time, she almost forgets about living her own life. She weighs all her ambitions and desires with her younger sister, who is 18 years old (who looks more like a girl to her) and with her aging mother, played by veteran Waheeda Rehman. Regarding the main actress Guide (this is how I can recall it instantly), there is almost nothing to say except for a few lines and drops of water here and there. Always faithful, Rahul Bose plays another central role in the film: it shows the emotions of a middle-aged man almost repenting to perfection. This man really surprises me by the variety of his work. From a musician to Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim at Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and so many others. He wants to be versatile, I really wish, if he also had some extra photos in the first part of the film. The cameo in the movie is from Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She looks really beautiful and describes the role of a mother of 2 with real ease. It gives you a glimpse of today's Indian woman who has a modern but conventional approach to her husband's past relationships. <br /> <br /> The center of the camera was Meethi, described by Konkona. She and her schizophrenic world are the core of 15 Park Avenue. She really worked hard for the character, but sometimes she can not communicate with the audience. The fatal accident of his life tries to arouse sympathy and he has only partially succeeded. <br /> <br /> The film tries to solve several problems at once, from the unique world of the disabled person to the unequal status of a woman, even in today's modern India, through the relationships twisted from a torn family. And I believe that Aparna has succeeded to a certain extent. Meethi's helplessness while working as a journalist in a rural eastern eastern state really gives us a naked image of the country of which we are so proud. <br /> <br /> After finishing 15 Park Avenue, I felt an unquenchable thirst. I wanted more of this film to soak me emotionally. The director made a commendable effort, except for a few failures. Must look for all who like to see a different cinema, something with a strong purpose.
