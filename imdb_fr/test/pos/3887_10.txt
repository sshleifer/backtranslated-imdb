Garlin is undoubtedly a comedian and an actor who wants to have a good time. His first film, entirely composed of his own creation and production, tells the story of a troubled actor, James Aaron, whom Jeff obviously identifies with. He juxtaposes wonderfully James to Paddy Chayefsky's "Marty" and Jackie Gleason's Poor Soul when he exposes James' dilemmas to many actors who, in real life, are Jeff's friends, many of whom are former colleagues from Second City. <br /> <br /> He uses Sarah Silverman's diametrical kindness and withering absurd humor to illustrate the fact that, despite common sense and talent, the contentment of life can all too often deny inflexible frustration . Bonnie Hunt gives an endearing performance as a romantic interest. <br /> <br /> Do not let a simple story mislead you, characters and conflicts are well thought out and sound right. Those who follow Garlin's career and understand that his humor is based on telling the reality with humor, not necessarily creating a fiction too easily imaginable, will appreciate his story based on dialogue. <br /> <br /> We will certainly see a lot more working Garlin as a director and writer with other talented talented intelligent actors who take up the big challenge of making life funny.
