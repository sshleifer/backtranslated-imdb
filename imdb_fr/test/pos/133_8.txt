SPOIL ALERT! Do not keep reading unless you are ready for spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this movie had a lot of things under its shell. In addition to the apparent links with "Oldboy" (and other Park-wook movies), an incestuous relationship in this one really disturbed me, as well as the subtle erotic theme that haunted all vampiric physical action. <br /> <br /> The lead actor, Kang-ho Song, is terrific in the role of priest Sang-hyeon - by chance, "singing" means "blood" in some languages ​​- who really liked Tae-ju, played by OK-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in "Badlands", where the girl looks psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around his finger. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is one thing, but the mother of the girl is completely different. In movement, she is stiff, one-dimensional and tense, but paralyzed, she said without moving or through a wink. <br /> <br /> Park-wook has really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick; There are many beautiful shots scattered throughout the film, some for simple effects and others that require multiple looks and probably repeated views to capture. <br /> <br /> The music is rather stored, mainly using ropes to accompany the main thespian monoreaction; it is a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is. While he does very little and loses that, he seems to be a person who thinks a lot. While her love-interest says and does a lot, her actions display very little thought behind her. In my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disturbing film that is not made for action, which does not even have the same dimension as most things that deal with vampires nowadays; it's beautiful and repellent at the same time.
