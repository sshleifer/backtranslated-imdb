This trash version of 'Romeo and Juliet' is currently in Manhattan. Romeo (Will Keenan) is a violent ** member of the Que family and Juliet (Jane Jensen) is a sexy (with beautiful breasts and a breast) and bisexual Capulet family. The scatological situations that this romantic couple will face are very funny. Although it is a cult film (included in the Rio de Janeiro Festival), it is not recommended for all audiences. If the viewer is a fan of Peter Jackson's old movies ("Braindead", "Bad Taste"), "Toxic Avenger", "Body Melt" and other trashy movies, he will certainly love this movie. Otherwise, he will hate it. Since I'm in the first group, my vote is eight. <br /> <br />
