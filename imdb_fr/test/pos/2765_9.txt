I'll be brief: I normally hate movies like this one in a venomous way ... but there's something about it that attracts me and does not let me go. Certainly, it has some major flaws (some actors play at best and dialogs are sometimes so mediocre that it's funny), but there are enough editing features to make it visible to the end. <br /> <br /> But what are they? Well, he has a nice little plot - he's certainly not original, but he's better presented than other movies of the same kind. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) performed quite decent performances that largely offset the lack of quality of the secondary cast (the big cop and Coach Quinn really bothered me), and the script is sweet and spiritual. (although he is poor in places). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie is so cute: I smiled a lot and it fits into my video collection just because it could cheer anyone up who. You really have to be bored to not like it (I dare someone to pay attention without smiling !!!). <br /> <br /> I recommend this one if you want a simple and fun game, and - especially - a nice watch. You will not regret it! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
