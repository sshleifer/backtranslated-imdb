Too bad someone did not have the intelligence to release this film in theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on the cable. After the first shock, realizing that it did not look like any other movie you've seen since Bringing Up Baby, you have to let it take you away and follow it. Only when you are done will you realize that it covers not only subtle but important issues. Alienation, denial, fulfillment of wishes, to begin. Cathy Bates is the owner of this film, she has never been better. The whole cast has the impression of a conspiracy and knows what it's doing without any free jealousy, except where it's requested, such as Julie Andrews briefs or videos of Jonathan Pryce's camp. If you are not open minded, you will not get it. (See Mark Adnum's bizarre critique of Stephanie Beacham's adoration, career, and obedience to his brother for introducing vegetable oil or something like that to islanders .) It would be nice for me to spend time praising Amo Gulinello's stellar cameo. as a trainee in a television channel or in Jack Noseworthy's shower. So, put aside all the previous concepts of the movie comedy and have a good time. I liked it.
