It's one of the best lesbian movies I've ever seen! This series brought the joy and sadness of true love. Being in the 1800s was an amazing look at the lives and desires of lesbians. The cast was beyond expectations! Rachael Stirling is an extraordinary actress. I never saw her, but her interpretation of Nan allowed me to communicate with her. The only thing that seems to me the most important is the connection with the characters in everything I look at. If anyone has doubts when seeing this movie ... Think carefully! It is a series to see absolutely. Congratulations to the BBC! We need more lesbian movies that portray true love and hurt, like this one. Living in Canada, I imported this DVD and I'm glad I bought it.
