I love these young people trapped in a horror house movie. Not only because I'm a big fan of Linnea Quigley-Jill Terashita, but also because it's so much fun and sometimes scary. <br /> <br /> The special effects are impressive, especially the scene of Linnea with the late when almost everyone is dead and possessed. <br /> <br /> A lot of nudity provided by Linnea and Jill, a lot of humor, a cool soundtrack, a high number of people, etc ... By the way, if you've ever seen this one, try to buy / watch the Unrated version that has more gore and some scenes of the rated version is missing.
