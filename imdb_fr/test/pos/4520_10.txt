I recently had the chance to see "The Kite Runner" in a small theater, surrounded by seasoned moviegoers who savor a masterpiece of such sophistication. With all the controversy surrounding the central scene of this film these days, I was expecting a film that was both brutal and violent. But the way Mr. Forster treated the delicate subject was touching and deeply moving. Even though the film's credits indicated that China was the main location of the filming, I could have sworn I was seeing Kabul throughout the scenes supposedly taking place in Afghanistan. The game of actors, both professional and professional, is excellent and the cast is beautiful. It is a film that I would see again and again, because although its subject is undeniably sad, the masterful way it was designed raises new hope in modern cinema.
