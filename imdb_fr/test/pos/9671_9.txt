Seth McFarlane is a true genius. He designed a spiritual, culturally energetic and downright hilarious series. <br /> <br /> For those who think that his "offensive" remarks on social or cultural topics make no significant comment, show this quote: <br /> <br /> Peter (coming out of the stem cell laboratory ): How long did I stay there? // Guard: Five minutes. // Peter: Why do not we finance this?!? <br /> <br /> Why, indeed. <br /> <br /> Thank you, family member, for being the funniest show on TV (with futurama), but also for being smart enough.
