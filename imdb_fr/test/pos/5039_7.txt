Angels are a bit of an American obsession, but they are often rather boring. They are the messengers of God, and the angels of the bow are great warriors (Lucifer is the hardest and the most beautiful until he is cast out of heaven). <br /> <br /> What happens if you do not believe in anything, let alone the angels and you are sent to investigate a story of angels, only to meet one with wings and a less than unnatural attitude. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's what America needs, being a Puritan is different from being good. Michael is a rude, obnoxious and seductive sky messenger who will fulfill your wishes and allow you to worry enough about the world to touch you. <br /> <br /> Funny, but not too much, touching but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being smart ... it's just a good little simple comedy. Watch a lazy Sunday afternoon.
