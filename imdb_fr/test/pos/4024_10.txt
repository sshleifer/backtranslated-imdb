Valeria's portrayal of Barbora Bobulova in this story was both captivating and heartbreaking. It's been a long time since I've seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by an actor just using his facial features and his eyes and mouth as Barbora does with this character. She was quite credible as Valeria and I was carried away by her description of this role. The film was both a reality and a fantasy, the intelligent use of this limited dialogue left me bewitched. I had to read between the lines and each of the key players used the art of body language and the emotional intent to convey a strong story. Barbora in particular was visually stimulating almost asexually and at the same time sexy. This comment can easily relate to each of the many emotions aroused by his performance. Underestimated in terms of dialogue but powerful in terms of presence. I was captured by the performance of this actress and will look much more of her work.
