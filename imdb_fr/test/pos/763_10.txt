This film is a good movie. The film shows so many themes in an incredible movie. Driving Lessons is centered on Ben (Rupert Grint), a shy 17-year-old who is coming of age. The film says that Ben is fed up with his dominant mother and just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, with whom he makes a very special connection. Both go on a journey and in the process, Ben finds himself and what relationship he and Evie share. It's the movie you watch alone or with someone else. Anyway, you'll all feel what Ben is going through in the movie. This is a very comforting movie that makes you think that your driving lessons have been as emotional or as difficult as Ben's Lessons.
