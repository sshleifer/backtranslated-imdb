I did not expect much from the story of a kid whose text was stolen and turned into a movie script. Frankie Muniz, from "Malcom in the Middle", is a star and he's pretty good, and Amanda Bynes is a very good friend. Yes, the movie works as an advertisement for Universal Studios theme park and is really a silly movie for kids .. but I enjoyed it anyway. CATEGORY B-
