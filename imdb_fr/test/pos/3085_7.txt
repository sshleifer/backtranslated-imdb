It's definitely one of Mel Brooks' best movies, with Spaceballs (though I'll openly admit I have not seen many more, at least for the moment). It's very silly and very funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes during the two hours of play, where you do not have fun. Almost all gags have a great comic effect, few fall flat. I saw this movie just after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and compared these two parodic movies, and I realize exactly how high quality this movie is. It's funny from start to finish, none of the comedy is exaggerated or boring. The music is wonderful, as is the choreography of dance and combat. The acting is about what you normally expect from this type of movie ... Elwes is an excellent actor and makes a good Robin. The plot is typical of Robin Hood, more or less all of the legend is adapted to this film (and mostly falsified). If you love Mel Brooks, or if you're just a silly fan of humor, or if you're dying to watch a good parody of Robin Hood's legend, this is definitely the movie for you. The special HBO First Look movie on the film is also worth watching, and you may want to keep watching it throughout the credits. I would recommend it to all Mel Brooks movie fans and those who love ridiculous humor. 7/10
