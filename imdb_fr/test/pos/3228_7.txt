The Gilmore Girls talk about a mother who had a daughter at the age of 16. She is now 16 (in season 1) and lives as sisters. Share everything, trust each other. <br /> <br /> I like Gilmore Girls but I do not know why. The mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the girl, Rory (played by Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and charming. There are some fun support characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson). Like Lorelai and he, they may have loved each other, but none of them really acts. They have their little moments. There are some other secondary characters, most of them very funny, and with their moving moments won. <br /> <br /> What I like most, in my opinion, is to see the relationship between the young mother and the girl becoming an adult. The dialogue between them is fast, lively, fun and sometimes touching. The group they have is beautiful. The Gilmore Girls make you feel good so try it.
