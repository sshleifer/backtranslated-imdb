Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines, Iowa. Nine members of the group dressed in custom boiler suits and homemade custom masks (eg Clown Mask # 6, # 0 Gas Mask, Dummy Mask with Rips + Torn Drum with dreadlocks). The music itself seems to be between healthy and other things, but it is interpreted with brilliance and psychosis. <br /> <br /> "Welcome to our neighborhood" sounds more like a generic title, but the film itself is something else. Interviews with the band, excerpts from the last album of their last album, 2 live performances and a video banished by MTV (a brilliant tribute to Kubrick's classic film "The Shining"), the film does not even announce halfway. an hour, but worth it. It is perfect to introduce any metal / hardcore fan to Slipknot.
