Many comments seem to consider this movie as a baseball film, but I think it's only secondary. It's really about living in Japan and succeeding. <br /> <br /> I spent a few years in Japan and I guess the reason this movie did not do very well is that you have to experiment Japan to get it. I was watching this with a very traveler friend who has never been to Japan and he noted that many events in the movie were so ridiculous that they wiped out the suspension of disbelief. My answer was that these events were the absolute and flawless truth about life in Japan! <br /> <br /> I think this movie really deserves to be watched, especially if you have lived in Japan or are interested.
