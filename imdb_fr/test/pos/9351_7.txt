** SPOILERS ** Currently based on the novel "The Brick Foxhole" about a homosexual man murdered by a GI on leave because of his sexual orientation. The film "Crossfire" speaks of a violently anti-Semitic GI who, because of his own failures and frustrations of life, attacks those of Jewish persuasion. He obviously feels threatened by. <br /> <br /> To be sourced at a coffee grinder in Washington DC A US serviceman, Montgomrey, Robert Ryan, Joseph Samuel landmark, Sam Leven, and starts to be a little excessive, but sarcastic, sympathetic with him. It would seem that Montgomery is a little excited about Samuels because he is talking to his best friend and friend IM, Arthur Mitchell, George Cooper. Samuel also succeeds, which the Neanderthal Montgomery can not, to the young GI sensitive to the arts, he is an artist and an painter of the outside, on the war, the Second world war, the war that has just ended. In addition to the fragile peace, if that's what the dawn of the atomic bomb is, that's what's happening now in this very dangerous and unstable world. What really outrages Montgomery more than anything else about Samuels is that he is obviously Jewish. Montgomery, a racist, would like Samuels to be made. <br /> <br /> Samules invites Mitchell to join him, as well as his girlfriend, Miss Lewis, Marlow Dwyer, in his apartment for a drink. two drinks and continue the very deep and stimulating conversation they started at the bar. What seems to be very jealous and feel hurt and dismissed Montgomery's drunk but somewhat distraught Montgomery's plans for Samuels, his friend and fellow GI Floyd Bowers, Steve Brodie, will not be invited later in the evening by Samuels. ' in law. <br /> <br /> The party is already over, Mitchell and Miss Lewis are gone, the two very drunk GI collapse unceremoniously. The fact that Samuels, in the sick and anti-Semitic spirit of Montgomery, stole Mitchell from him, pushes him to indulge in a hot, white frenzy. Montgomery and Bowers burst into Samuel's home by sneaking into the liquor cupboard, Montgomery taking a few chestnuts, despite Samuels 'strong objections to Samuels' expansive and refined wines and spirits, unlike any other. nothing to the decrepit and cheap drink that the brutal Montgomery is accustomed to buzzing. All of this quickly led to a violent and brutal attack on Samuels by Montgomery, psychotic and angry drunk, while Bowers was on the couch, ravaged by all the drink he had consumed and who beat the poor and innocent to death. <br /> <br /> The film "Crossfire" then enters a long and tedious task, as it is obvious from the beginning who Samuels' killer is, an investigation into why Samuels, a veteran of the Second World war wounded and decorated, had purple heart in the battle of Okinawa. murdered with Montgomery acting as if he was really interested, yes, to find Samuels's killer, who is in reality himself. This so-called voluntary action on the part of Montgomery is intended to dispel the suspicion that he may be the man who killed him. <br /> <br /> Montgomery is so ridiculous and even, for someone who considers himself very intelligent, stupid by constantly opening his big jap and spitting racist and anti-Semitic epitaphs on the murder of Samuels! This only throws suspicion on himself and no one else. I guess that guy just could not help but do it. <br /> <br /> It is not enough that Montgomery murdered Samuels who, in his sick mind, was one of them, he even murdered his friend, scared him to death, involving. in the murder of Samuels, Bowers! Who, in Montgomery's racist thought, is one of "us"! Just because he feared Bowers would talk to the police in order to save his own neck and thus shine the spotlight on Montgomey in the death of Samuels. <br /> <br /> The detective in charge of the case, Captain Finlay, Robert Young, was quick to see obvious lies and deceptions through Montgomerys, then had another "friend GI's son Leroy (William Phipps), who was the subject of all his silly and racist jokes, gave rise to an arrogant rise to power. Montgomery returns to the scene of his crime, where he murdered Bowers, where a trap was set up for him. That's all Captain Finlay needed to make Montgomery panic, who realized that the template was up, and rushed straight into the crossfire of a police ambush. <br /> <br /> Dated a bit now but hitting very hard in 1947 when it was released. "Crossfire" tackled the horrors of anti-Semitism when it was concealed and concealed in almost every post-World War II Hollywood film about the evils of racism in the United States and Europe. Even after the Second World War and what happened to the Jews. When it should have been given the exhibitor very complete and honest, the film become public, that he deserved it so well.
