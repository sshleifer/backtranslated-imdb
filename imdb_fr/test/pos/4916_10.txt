L'Homme Blesse is not intended for an impatient and adventurous public. There are no explosions and the drama is not simple. Like Lynne Ramsey's films, the director works more deeply on the mood than on the narrative in an effective and incredibly moving way. Because it does not rely on gratuitous nudity, nor on the superficial pop cult. history, it's frankly one of the best gay foreign movies I've seen (see also Fran√ßois Ozon, Pedro Almodovar). Nicolas Roeg's "Do not Look Now" gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror movie. This film, like The Man, is more than what the box could make you believe. If you want to sit down and be absorbed by the subtle and transformed powers of cinema, you will love this movie.
