This is another nice and entertaining film from Hitchcock. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this movie. Bernard Herrmann himself appears near the climax. <br /> <br /> The landscape and places are perfect, except for the scene where the background was obviously wrong, which makes no sense to me since the scenes before and after were in the same frame and they were real locating shots. I heard Hitchcock did it on purpose. <br /> <br /> Critics of this film seem mixed. I think it's a better than average Hitchcock movie. Very entertaining and there is a great comic light scene at the end. <br /> <br /> I rated this film 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
