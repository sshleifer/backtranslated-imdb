When the film started, I thought it was cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow start and some antics of the soap opera, I started to like. The plot was different from anything I had ever seen. Now, was it a horror? Not really. It should not have been considered a horror or the producers should have put more money into the film to make it scary. As things stood, the creatures were only a short time away. I can only assume that it was for financial reasons. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, the movie was a lot of fun. This caught my interest (after the beginning) and made me wonder about creatures from another dimension. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that it was a film for the first time for the director, but there were some highlights. In the end, I was hooked. Too bad Hollywood did not put more money behind all that.
