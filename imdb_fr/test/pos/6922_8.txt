Look at being Anglo-Irish, I assure you that this commentator is anything but a bias. But I assure you that it is indeed an Irish film - not English as suggested by the last comment. This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor McPherson and directed by Conor McPherson also - both Irish. The cast is almost entirely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember joking about it in an interview about this movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Cane has obviously been asked to boost box office revenue abroad. </ B> I loved the movie, I just wanted to correct a totally misinformed comment! <br /> <br /> Turning now to criticism - I loved Dylan Moran, I've always been a fan of him, and Michael Cane has formed a surprisingly good double act. It was great to see Morans evolve as an actor as he played several different characters during the movie. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in comedy, as it represents an innovative, original and inventive turning point in Irish long laughs. I laughed a lot. What more could you ask for?
