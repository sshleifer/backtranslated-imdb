As a big fan of Dostoyevsky, I have always been disappointed by Hollywood's unenthusiastic attempts to engage in Russian romantic aesthetics, as Yul Brynner testifies in the role of Dmitry Karamazov. I thought the whole thing was a bad casting decision, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and I changed my mind. When he was given a clever scenario, he suddenly became alive and was as noble, sexy and confrontational as you might wish to get a neurotic Russian officer! He was therefore a better Dmitri as Commander Surov than as Dmitri. But this is because the writer Tabori actually gave Yul, as a Russian officer in conflict, the kind of lines of a Russian officer in conflict that are worthy of a true literature and that make sense real and pathetic. For example, about folk music, he says sadly, "You hear a man crying in the dark, and if you listen carefully enough, you know why he's crying." You look surprised, Lady Ashmore. you may have heard, tractors and Marxism are not the only things Russia deals with, there is always time for music. "<br /> <br /> Brilliant !!
