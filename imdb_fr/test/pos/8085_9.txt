Yes, I'm sentimental and yes, I like movies where kids are the best humans. It is true that Klatret√∏sen has logical deficiencies, and even errors in layout. These are more than offset by the quality of play of children (the first role of Julias!) And the charm of a film Dogma (I loved this kind of cinematic art long before the Dogma, since Herz 'Herz Glas de Herzog). Well, I cried for the last fifteen minutes, which is a higher tear factor than Bambi's or Fly away home for me.
