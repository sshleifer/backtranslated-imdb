A difficult life becomes more difficult when the three children of a single mother must be sent to separate homes after her untimely death. <br /> <br /> To stay together, the boy of advanced age plans a bold and risky escape to find a distant uncle lost, their only remaining parent. <br /> <br /> Their trek takes the three runaway runaways in pursuit of the desert in a classic scarab, penniless, hungry, desperate, terrorized by young offenders to drive, hunted by the always threatening civil authorities. <br /> <br /> What the film lacks realism and realism in the plot, it compensates for the honest human need to be part of a family full and complete - even if this family is paved with pieces of spare lives broken. <br /> <br /> Of course, the end is forced and too dramatic for the critical viewer, but every heart beats the same cry for solidarity and family solidarity. membership. <br /> <br /> Despite all its weaknesses, I still recommend this film.
