The Violent Men is a good western. The story may not be original - the owner of a large ranch is bound to chase small competitors from a valley he needs for his growing cattle - but the film contains many ingredients that enhance its level and worth it to be seen. <br /> Distribution is a highlight. There is the faithful Glenn Ford (John Parrish), a former army officer and now one of the small breeders, who tries to avoid trouble until he is pushed to the bottom. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is as good as ever as a crippled man and Barbara Stanwyck (Martha) plays her treacherous wife in one of her usual female roles that she treats easily (the others were in "Double Indemnity" "and" Blowing Wild Brian Keith (Cole) does it perfectly like the brother of Robinson's gunman, an ambitious man who tries to take over his brother's big ranch, no matter the circumstances. "Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinson's daughter who does not approve of how her father, mother and uncle handle things with their neighbors. <br /> <br /> Rudolph Mate brings a standard but acceptable directive, perhaps aided by beautiful and wide open landscape as well as a fine and appropriate score can also help you. <br /> <br /> The inevitable final confrontation between Ford and Keith is one of the best Western movies.Each man, in his style duel (rem Shoot the one of Ford shooting with his arms tra and aiming at his target in a military way) to settle their differences then and once and for all. <br /> <br /> This is for sure one of Glenn Ford's best Western appearances, second behind the classic "10 in Yuma" he did two years later. It's probably the cast that puts the film in the category "A" and, for me, it enters the list of the top 10 of its kind.
