People have often been uncomfortable with "The Venice Merchant" because of its antisemitic content. Fortunately, this film avoids this, instead choosing to show how antisemitism reigned supreme in 16th century Europe. Of course, Antonio (Jeremy Irons) needs money to help Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) to ask for the marriage of Portia (Lynn Collins). He receives money from the Jewish loan shark Shylock (Al Pacino), who claims a pound of flesh from Antonio if he does not repay the loan. When Antonio can not repay the loan, Shylock is determined to get what is due. <br /> <br /> We expect the actors to do a good job and they do not disappoint. This is another testimony of what is a great actor Al Pacino.
