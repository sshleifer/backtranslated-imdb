In the late 1940s, there was a series of short films entitled "Flicker Flashbacks" in which excerpts from silent dramas featuring characters such as Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet were presented for laughter. Scratched clips of old, obsolete movies have been rearranged, projected too fast, and have a superposition of jangly music and lame jokes. The attitude expressed through this brutal treatment pretty much sums up the vision that Hollywood had of its beginnings in the middle of the century: the silent cinema was considered hokey, flowery, a little embarrassing, and only laughed. During the 1950s, this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons. James Agee's famous essay on silent clowns published in 1949 for Life Magazine was an important factor, but television played a major role in the rediscovery of viewers with silent films. Admittedly, television channels sometimes manipulated the film as roughly as people in "Flicker Flashbacks", but more tonic series such as "Silents, Please" treated the films with respect. Another highlight was Robert Youngson's THE GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY compilation, which proved to be a surprising success when it was released in theaters at the end of 1957. <br /> <br /> I do not know not if Charles Chaplin knew about it. Youngson's film or his box office success, but it was around that time that he decided to launch a theatrical reissue of three of his best comedies, A DOG'S LIFE, SHOULDER ARMS (both made in 1918) , and THE THE PILGRIM (manufactured in 1922 and released the following year). These three films have worked well as a trio because they contrast well in the plot, theme and settings. In addition, the three characters feature faces familiar to Chaplin's stock company, some of whom play multiple roles in each short film. At the time of the reissue, the films were not shown in public for more than thirty years. Chaplin may have wanted to preserve his reputation with a new generation of moviegoers, especially since his best work was rarely shown on television. the beginnings of the new media. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Chaplin apparently concluded that movies were spinning too fast at the old silent projection speed. So it was decided to "stretch" them, which means the frame was printed twice. Maybe he wanted to avoid the 'Flicker Flashbacks' look, but that was not the best way to go about it. Aesthetically speaking, the results are terrible and virtually destroy the action of the movies. Nevertheless, this is how THE CHAPLIN REVUE was released in 1959 and this version was transferred to video and marketed by Playhouse Video in the 1980s. I had bought a VHS copy of the film at the time and I was terribly disappointed with the rhythmic jerky rhythm of the movies. <br /> <br /> It is a particular pleasure to see that David Shepard has restored Chaplin's compilation (originally produced for the laser disc format) represents a significant improvement over the Playhouse Video version. For the most part, the projection speed has been corrected. The "stretch-print" disappeared anyway, although the action sometimes seems to slip a little. For example: in Edna & Charlie's awkward life at the Green Lantern Cafe, Edna's bare arms seem visibly scrambled; at another point, during the trench scene in SHOULDER ARMS, when Charlie is relieved of his sentry duties, the action seems strangely slowed for a few moments, but this may result from a maneuver of the film's restorers to cover a little decomposition. . Overall, the quality of the images is fantastic considering the age of the movies themselves. <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: the REVIEW begins with rare sequences of backgrounds taken at the Chaplin studio. This includes shots of a fun rehearsal session of course starring Chaplin strangling the tiny actor Loyal Underwood, as well as scenes of Charlie at her dressing table making up and cutting off the famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by Chaplin's narration, presented quickly. Chaplin also composed a new score for the compilation and, in my opinion, his themes for the REVIEW ranking with his best compositions, especially the pieces used during the A DOG'S LIFE coffee sequence. The only exception is the song written for THE PILGRIM, a pseudo-Singin 'Cowboy titled "Bound for Texas" sung to the "Fifties" by Matt Monro (who sounds more like Gene Autry), which is distracting, anachronistic and misplaced. Otherwise, in the rest of the REVUE, the music is perfectly suited to the action and the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It looks like the release of THE CHAPLIN REVUE in Image is sort of postponed to a later date. debut, presenting these classic comedies as they were meant to be seen from the beginning. In this form, REVUE ranks among Chaplin's most enduring and enjoyable works.
