I saw this film for the first time accidentally when they showed it on TV and I was getting up way too late ... I was really lucky there. It's really unbelievable. of the place (as isolated as it is possible to be on this planet, it gave the "abyss" a look of ET in the municipal pool), thanks to the interesting characters (Keith David is particularly gifted for the reactionary Childs - "And if you are wrong?" - "Then we are wrong.") And effects (more disgusting than Alien). <br /> <br /> In addition, the tension and fear that reigns in the film have nothing to do with the effects. These are the people you start to be afraid of; knowing that one of them may be - or not be - "all that they seem to be". It certainly feels like "who's going?" <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent; it really plays on isolation, fear and the gravity of the situation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the scene of the epilogue really cuts. Even more than the "But again who does?" Bladerunner strike line. Enough said.
