I have to admit that I'm a fan of 80s cheesy cartoons, but it's one of the best. Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer is one of the most watchable and entertaining Rainbow Brite cartoons, and is far better than the TV series. I particularly like the relationship between Rainbow and Darian and find it very funny. My favorite character, however, is Starlite, who is certainly the most "magnificent horse of the universe"! <br /> <br /> I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of the birth of Rainbowland. Have a rainbow day!
