Dude, I really liked that, if only for Fred Willard's commentary on the dog magazine. There are dead spots and gags that do not work, but overall, the film works very well. When I was younger, my parents raised dogs and the people I met at these shows were not much less bizarre than the monsters in this exhibition, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this film for its artistic sense. and for his comment on how we take frivolous things far too seriously ... I loved playing for his accuracy (most accents were flawless) and his subtlety (I loved how each person walk his dog) ... <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you have an idea of ​​the strangeness of human existence.
