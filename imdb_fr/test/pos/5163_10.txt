A brief criticism ensued. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My first reaction is that of wonder and happiness. I'm so happy that films like this one are being made in our blockbuster era. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson's new film "You, The Living" is nothing short of a complete masterpiece. You, The Living is composed of some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. I will not reveal the content of the scenes here, because I hate when people ruin the smallest details. But, yes, most scenes have made the 1000 spectators of the Claude Debussy theater absolutely disconcerted and amazed. Once the film was finished, we applauded for several minutes. We had no other choice. <br /> <br /> So what is the score of "You, The Living"? Hm, Andersson is not afraid to answer the heavy questions; History, guilt, enthusiasm The Holocaust during World War II is an important subject (and these themes work very well together). <br /> <br /> The created images are brilliant, the depth sometimes exceeds "Songs of the second floor". <br /> <br /> Well, sorry for this laudable and commendable review. Look at the beginning of the Flying House! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars - A masterpiece (I never throw this note to the sea).
