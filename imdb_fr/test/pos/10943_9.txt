I think there was too much action in the end? You do not think that too? There was a romance, an adventure that, as I had been told, put 9 in this movie, but the action was too long. I liked Reeve a bit. I did not understand why he had to die? I thought one of the girls was going to die too, but my luck! No one else I loved is dead! And you? What did you like? I saw the film twice in fact. And after that, I bought that too. It was worth it! Who did you prefer (nobody)? The book was really, really, really cool. And actresses and actors too. Everything was perfect ... What was the name of the song at the end? Will someone answer my questions too ... PLEASE, please?
