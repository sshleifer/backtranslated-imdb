"In the Mood for Love", a teasing allegory of loneliness and nostalgia. Here is a film without sex or even kissing - and this is without a doubt one of the sexiest and most psychopathic and stimulating novels I know. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of two people who coincide, live in the same apartment and are a gateway to each other. The film, like and unlike "Random Hearts", tells how two people meet in the affair of their two lovers. Once they have received this news, they take the time to think about the consequences of a case and the feelings of each other about the breakup - and the question of whether the two people are willing enough to to fall in love. <BR/> <br /> What's great about this film is the way director Wong Kar-Wai portrays how each character deals with loneliness. With the character of Maggie Cheung, he will show it in a repeated montage: leave work, go home, watch his neighbors play, go to the noodle shop, leave the noodle shop and fall on his attractive equality of age, played by Tony Leung. It is an intelligent technique, if not subtle and learned, to present loneliness. Because it's when you're alone, when you find yourself falling into a loop. This movie worked for me because I can relate to that feeling.
