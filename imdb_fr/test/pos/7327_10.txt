Yes, it's "Flipper". Writer and director Alan Shapiro has come up with a gem of a version. The spectacular underwater and underwater photographs of veteran "Jaws" Bill Butler and the captivating music of Joel McNeely and Crosby, Stills & Nash make this family entertainment memorable. Shapiro, whose last film was improbably "The Crush", is again an extremely talented and versatile filmmaker. To rent!
