To understand "Intensive Course" in the right context, you have to understand the 80s on TV. Most TV shows had no points. The sitcom exceeded the drama by at least 3 to 1. They were still figuring out where the lines were so they could cross them. (TV shows like "Hail to the Chief" were quite daring!) This "Crash Course" TV movie featured a star cast featuring members of all the 80s classics: "227", "Family Ties" "," Who is the boss? ", Et al. The filmmakers then had to have some penchant for these star movies. Nevertheless, this film offered very light dishes and a simplistic vision of heroism and maturity. And it's not bad sometimes. Viva Soleil Moon Frye.
