Connected to the imdb to say what a lovely Love Love movie is and am totally confused. It seems to me that someone has mixed his titles. "Baby demon plastic" what? It was not the love life. A little luvy dovey for my taste but a great movie, funny and original. Especially loved the end that does not fall into the normal chasm of clich√© that all romantic Hollywood movies crush and burn. Nine out of ten.
