The short film that put Gaspar No√© on the film's map, showed us his horrible but quite interesting character, The Butcher, played brilliantly by Phillipe Nahon. Noe's direction here has all the characteristics of his later films, showing that he carved his own voice and his own style from the beginning. His sudden cuts, noisy loud sounds, flashbacks and many other techniques are used to discourage the viewer. And it certainly works. In addition, he is not afraid to show violence, as Irreversible TV viewers know. Here, the violence is also powerful and, in the wake of Alone Against All, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the death of a horse. They shoot him in the head and watch him twist on the ground, his pool of blood flowing. We see then a human birth in all its bloody glory, the daughter of The Butcher. He was an orphan during the Second World War and grew up hating the world and everyone. He serves his clients, but his inner monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts: he wants them all dead. His daughter Blandine Lenoir, who will also take over his role six years later, is the only thing that matters to him and we watch them grow together. She is, however, mute and intimidated and gambling. The Boucher's relationship with her is almost incestuous, bathing her when she is old enough to do it herself, etc., but this is explored further in the next film. When attacked by a man, the butcher explodes with rage, stabbing an innocent man in the mouth. He goes to prison, taken from the only thing he wants, his shop and his daughter. In 40 minutes, we see all this and more, his time in prison and his release into his world. Because of the condition of her daughter, autistic too, I think, she is bland, only looks, and is under the complete control of her father. The film continues in the Only Against All exceptionally dark. If you can, watch these two movies, this one first. He has a very good acting, but he is very difficult to watch because of the implacable tone. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
