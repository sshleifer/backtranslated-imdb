"The English Patient" can rightly be compared to David Lean's films, whose epics like "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Bridge on the River Kwai" have no doubt inspired director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed and, like "Lawrence", takes place in North Africa, but during the Second World War. The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an insightful and often difficult archaeologist portrayed by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashback by Count Laszlo of Almasy de Fiennes - the main character. The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what's going on. He was seriously burned in a plane crash, at the time of the opening of the film, and is treated in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the vast geographical and temporal extent and the development of characters beyond that of the two unhappy lovers. The film clearly shows that true love and passion, even with dreadful consequences, can make life worth living or dying. If you are romantic at heart and can enjoy a movie without the classic purposes and simple moral codes, you may find that 'The English Patient' speaks to you directly. <br /> <br />
