I've seen this movie about 50 times and it does not seem like I'll ever get bored. I always look at it with my best friend and it has become a kind of tradition for us now to watch it almost every month. every time we see this film, we are both very moved. We laughed and cried in front of the television and sang all the songs aloud. In the end, we always dance. Today, we know almost all the heart dialogue and watching the film gives the impression of seeing our old friends on TV. <br /> <br /> this movie is perfect! Although I have to admit that the story itself is a little old-fashioned, but the characters, the dance, the music, and even the place where everything takes place make you forget all that and you start to believe that such things happen. actually produce and that the song "all you need is love" actually has some kind of meaning. <br /> <br /> I'm really a normal person and not too serious about this comment but I can not wait until next time we can see Dirty Dancing.
