WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> "Rock Star" is one of the rock movies I have ever seen. The original idea of ​​the screenplay is centered on a young singer of the 80s, directing the tribute band to one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He not only plays their music on the note, but also lives the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute group expel him, looking for some originality, fate plays a good role and is hired to replace the main singer of the idol group. A dream has come true? Well almost. While beginning to live the life of the famous, including the drug and sex excesses of the 80s rock scene, he will also face the problems of relationship with his girlfriend, and will eventually have to answer questions about the creativity and have a saying in the band's music. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, one of the reasons being that this is one of the first times that the life and music of hard rock bands are presented in a realistic way . Fans of the genre of music will be satisfied by the soundtrack. The general idea is original and questions about how an artist lives his life and creates his art are presented in a reasonable and balanced way. Playing is good enough, with Mark Wahlberg better than in most other action movies I've seen recently, and Jennifer Aniston agrees with the role of nice girl who knows a lot about life. More problematic is the end, which is fairly conventional, and can disappoint. It seems that the main character, after leaving the big and famous band, found his own creative path. However, in an ironic twist, the music he plays in the club at the end is the worst of all the film! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale. To see, but expect a high dose of metal. If you do not like this kind of music, you can choose to avoid this movie.
