The concept of conjugal fidelity described in the film seems outdated today, but it is precisely the adhesion of the main characters to this notion that makes the whole story so touching. It is this notion that ennobles them and allows them to stand out and "not look like them", as they refer to their respective wives. <br /> <br /> As Tony Leung said in the movie, love happens. It is not necessary to explain rationally how this happens, it is simply the case. Although they do not want to lower themselves to the level of their respective spouses, it has happened. Fidelity, social mores and timing all conspired to make this relationship a reality. To be in love is far from enough. <br /> <br /> I was unlucky enough to be sitting next to a young couple (still in college thanks to the excerpts they kindly shared with me throughout the movie and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities). Their blatant inability to digest the subtlety and deeper emotions evoked made me understand how much a film like this, as well as other works by Wong Kar Wei, is wasted on the local audience.
