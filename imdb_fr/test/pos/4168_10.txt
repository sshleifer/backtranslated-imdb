The title of my summary covers my criticism pretty well. <br /> <br /> It's for me what Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has been for someone 5 years older. While I missed this small wave of pop culture, I embraced the range of toys and the TV. series that was Mighty Max with both arms. <br /> <br /> You want to know how in what I was? I went as Mighty Max for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Thank God for the Internet. Thanks to Demonoid last week, I was able to watch this great spectacle of my childhood for the first time in more than ten years. <br /> <br /> I'm looking at this right now, after being amazed by Paulson's recognition of Animaniacs, and I also like celebrity humor in "Tar Wars". After 4 minutes, and they have already mentioned, by NAME: Clint Eastwood, Governor Arnold, Dustin Hoffman, John Wayne and Ace Ventura. Hells yeah. <br /> <br /> Heck, it's only by writing this that I realize there is no way to hell, I can give this series something other than a perfect score. All imperfections have been lost in the fog of time. <br /> <br /> This is my childhood. It's Awesomeness. It's the powerful.
