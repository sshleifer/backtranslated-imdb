If you're looking for the Twins effect looking for a pure cinematic experience in Hong Kong, you'll be disappointed. That's not to say it's bad, but it's NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie, which is in the same vein as Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. It's silly and juvenile, so if you want some serious action in Hong Kong, watch a film by John Woo or Yuen Woo Ping. This film has a lot of criticism for its stupidity and I thought that the first thing to do would be to explain in what you engage, because it disappointed a lot of purists. <br /> <br /> For non-purists and those with more tolerant tastes, Twins Effect is a deliciously stupid comedy of kung-fu. I loved her a lot for a variety of reasons, including the wonderful women getting into a very entertaining comedy. I think this is the first movie of this type in which they are, but they are hopping, flying and flying like seasoned pros. <br /> <br /> The obviously ridiculous plot is treated with great care and attention. , and the film is written knowingly, making the film laugh a lot. Comedy is really the most important thing here, and it's a sweet and subtle comedy, based on words like inanimate objects flying at Stephen Chow. It must be said that the slapstick is a huge pleasure too. The sequence with vampires dancing in disco is a total classic. <br /> <br /> The action is a mixture of two kinds. It's somewhere between the "drama of the period" and the sword fights (which come closer to the end) and the comedy style of Jackie Chan, with a mix that is sometimes always exciting to watch. From time to time, we organize truly innovative meetings. <br /> <br /> All this is great and the movie is a real pleasure. Despite this, he has some points of friction. For example, Twins Effect is, in many ways, much more Westernized than kung fu fans, the inevitable comparison with the Blade series is without a doubt a good example, even though Twins Effect is frankly much better than Blade n ' has never succeeded, especially for combat action. Personally, it was also a shame to see the excellent Anthony Wong (the hidden villain of John Woo's classic Hard Boiled) if underused, but it is unlikely that the young audience targeted by this action will notice the existence of Hard Boiled or his other films, so it is really only a personal reproach. <br /> <br /> If you look at this with an open mind, you'll probably benefit a lot like me, but you have to be very aware that it's a COMEDY, not a kung-fu wall movie. Keep this in mind and everything will be fine.
