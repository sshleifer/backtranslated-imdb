Rififi rightly deserves to be mentioned in the famous film scene, and this scene deserves all the credit it deserves. It's a masterpiece of suspense, character interaction and photography. But Rififi is not only this scene: all the scenes of the film are staged so masterfully. Overall, the film is not only taught with suspense, intrigue and character, but also a narrated moral narrative that has paved the way for film noir for years to come. <br /> <br /> Cinematically and technically, the flight sequence is perhaps the most impressive scene in the film, but for me, it's the final scene that holds the most power - Tony's hallucinogen the Stephanois lead to redemption.
