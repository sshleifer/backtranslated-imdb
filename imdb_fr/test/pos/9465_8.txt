I must be honest, I really had a good time watching She's the Man. Although this is a typical teen comedy or, if you prefer, the movie that changes sex, there were some pretty decent laughs that everyone could have. Both adults and teenagers would like to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is your typical rebellious teenager who dresses and behaves like a guy. When she is refused to try decides to assume the appearance of her brother to prove that she is worthy to be part of the boy's football team. Of course, love manifests itself when she meets another guy who thinks he is his brother. She also has a daughter who runs after her. Well, the slogan says it all. <br /> <br /> This is a little fun drama for teenagers that will be remembered for a long time. Amanda Bynes has proven something in the movie, it's really hard to behave like a guy. : D Well, that's right! <br /> <br /> 8/10
