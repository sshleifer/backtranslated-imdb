Bob Cummings is excellent in this area, as this technically brilliant Hitchcock film does not have the fame of some of his other films, but he is very watchable even today. Priscilla Lane proves in this one that she can stand up to other blondes who worked with Hitchcock later. After that, she just made a handful of movies that make her almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> It contains sequences that will remind the viewer of the installation of subsequent films by the director. The acting is so well done and the story so well done that this movie is always very entertaining. Each cast member behaves well. The black and white film contains several exceptional backgrounds. <br /> <br /> This was Universal's first film for Hitchcock. Between the feature films he made at Universal and the television series, Hitchcock would make as many recipes for the studios as for all those who work there. This fact is lost in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Norman Lloyd is well chosen to be the real villain of this film. The story goes very well, including the only Western footage filmed by Hitchcock. This film is very good with a lot of great work from everyone.
