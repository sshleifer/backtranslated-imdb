Rather good for a French film. I have not seen any of Catherine Breillat's previous films and therefore have no opinion on this subject in relation to her previous work. French cinema generally sticks to the most artistic films and leaves filming and starring vehicles in Hollywood. This is probably a good business strategy because the film industry in any other country will probably not have the resources to compete in these types of projects. Films on film making are often boring because they have little resonance for non-professionals. But this one caught my interest much more than I thought. Despite the title, (strangely in English), it's not really a comedy, despite some zany moments. Anne Parillaud has watched only a few of the films, but she is showing a generous amount of talent and talent ranging from the action / psychological drama of "The Nikita Woman" to the twisted comedy of "Innocent Blood". This film also extends its scope because it plays a more or less ordinary woman, while remaining convincing on the screen. Congratulations also to Roxane Mesquida, with whom I was unfamiliar. She plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film, whose talent is stretched at the end. If you do not have to have car chases and explosions to keep you entertained, check out this one.
