Completely to check. I saw it at MLK's birthday in 2006 and it struck me a lot. Sometimes we feel trapped and doomed to repeat the past, no matter how much we try to change. All we can do is continue and talk. Just keep going. Do not want to be depressing, because that's not the issue, but we may have to go back down before we see how much we have to work on ourselves. What happens when the best specialists, like MLK, continue to tell us what must happen to get us out of our "dead end" without us listening? I know that some of us are listening, but how can the rest of the world see things as they really are? Continue, I guess. This movie made me think more about it all, so I guess he did what he intended to do. That's what I consider to be a good movie, a good play, a book, a poem, a speech or anything: something that makes you think and pushes you to move in an active direction instead of sitting, stuck, bored and hopeless.
