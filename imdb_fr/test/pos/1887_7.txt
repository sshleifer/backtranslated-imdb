Well, I like stupid movies. If you like silly sci-fi movies, the most popular movies or if you're a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, I'd go see this movie. This film is everything I wanted it to be. As a fan of the most popular movies, this is perfect. Whenever I thought to myself "this movie would be the stupidest, the best movie of all time if * virgin * happened ..." then exactly as I thought, * virgin * would happen. It's a stupid and wonderful b'-movie. If you're a fan of Campbell, I'd say, "see him," bring your friends, laugh. It's funny. It's not classic, or anything, but if it's on TV one night, look at it. It became for me a film that I would classify under "indulgent films". Films that may not be good, but after a hard day's work, I could go home and watch (this list also includes "harold and kumar go to the white castle", "the army of darkness" and "intolerable cruelty") If you get the impression that you are facing an excessively bad and slightly bad movie, look at it. otherwise, go rent "Bubba Ho-tep"
