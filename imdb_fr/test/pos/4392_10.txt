I thought this movie was great! I saw that when he went out to theaters, so I do not remember all the details. I remember it was based on Homer's account of Ulysses. The names of places and events are changed, but you can still see the resemblance to the story. <br /> <br /> I thought it was funny how they would get into trouble and get away with it. I really enjoyed this version of old modernized tales better than Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. <br /> <br /> I agree that in some parts of the story, the story sometimes becomes a little ridiculous, but overall. all this is a great adventure with actors of big names.
