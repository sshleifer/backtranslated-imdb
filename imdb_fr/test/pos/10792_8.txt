I have never been a big fan of Oliver Stone, often because I found his films forced, preached and generally flawed. The two Stone movies I really like are JFK and Talk Radio. Still, Talk Radio takes the cake to be Stone's finest achievement. Stone is a director, whether you're a fan or not, it's safe to say that before watching Talk Radio, I did not like this guy and I'm considered one of the most overrated directors in the film industry , although after watching Talk Radio. some of my perceptions have changed. Talk Radio is a confusing and fun attack on what is now known as "reality TV". <br /> <br /> Talk Radio follows a self-indulgent, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, scandalous and perplexed radio host named Barry Champlain. who hosts a controversial late-night radio show in Dallas. Becoming quickly known for its bold and offbeat air presence, it becomes a late-night sensation in which depraved junkies, delinquents, racists, sociopaths, sickos, perverts and morons scream for ridicule in the air . The film shows the advance and fall of the man's career, carefully describing freedom of expression. Originally adapted from a play, the film is part of the theatrical theme around which it was built, transmitting wonderfully the fierce nature of the film. <br /> <br /> With its fierce energy and non-stereotyped air, Talk Radio brings all the hilarity behind "crass media". It's even more poignant today than it was at the end of the 80s. The film goes deep in studying arrogance, self-obsession, offensive behavior, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. The film shows in a controlled way how good it is to have a personal opinion and a freedom of speech, but it is something that should be used with wisdom rather than shamefully brutal. Stone tries to show how crucial freedom of speech is in life, but we must be wary of it. The film asks the question "Is our main protagonist identical to the sad people who call the series?" <br /> <br /> Stone fabulously creates the centerpiece of the film (the radio station) with an ambition and a cold atmosphere. He then succeeds in capturing the isolation, the fear, the ambiguity and the dangerous emotions that develop on the radio. Eric Bogosian is perfectly interpreted by the genius Barry Champlain, an isolated, absorbed and complex genius. He perfectly matches the role that emerges from his lines with such enthusiasm, urgency, perplexity, abruptness and finally the daring hilarity of his offending character. The performance is brimming with spark, which has obviously been deprived of an Oscar nomination. His voice suits the character, being a key element of a radio host and his power to play with tragedy and comedy works perfectly. <br /> <br /> There is a strong use of editing in Stone's films and Talk Radio's pride in some of its cleanest and most rhythmic frames. He uses admirably controlled camera techniques that range from calm to sudden turbulence. There is a vibrant energy behind the film, with its raw and wonderfully charming script serving as a centerpiece throughout the film. The striking and virtuous cinematography stands out in the moments inside and outside the studio, impressively capturing the city at night. Do not forget that the climate "spiral of decline" that haunts you and is both heartbreaking and very funny is finally a remarkable cinema. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is an essential modern masterpiece. I'm sure you'll be amazed at how awesome it is. . I highly recommend Talk Radio to anyone interested in the media or film. Talk Radio is a good example of first-rate, intellectual and insightful entertainment that still has a well-deserved wake-up call. Finally, without Eric Bogosian, the film would not be the fun, charming and enduring masterpiece it is today.
