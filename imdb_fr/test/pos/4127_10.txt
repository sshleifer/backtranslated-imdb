It's one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance at home. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The film has sad parts but the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly continued despite the fact that his pastor, his parents and the record producer in Nashville told him no. Buddy Holly did not give up what he loved. I did not know much about Buddy Holly before watching this movie. I went to the Surf Ballroom where he played for the last time, but I did not pay attention to it until I watched this movie. It's an amazing movie with a lot of fun so get up and watch this movie.
