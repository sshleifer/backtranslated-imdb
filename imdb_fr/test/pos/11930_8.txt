Imagine this. Someone is doing a film about the Columbine or Virginia Tech massacre, but the film is made by the guy who came home alone (I know it's not nothing but with me) and stars Sean Astin in Goonies !! imagine the terrorists submerged by buckets of water above doors and open marbles and that's why you have to see the movie. unfortunately, the skateboard is lying on the ground so the evil Mexicans can stumble, but its road is halfway, you have to give it over 7 for that, but not a 9 because it's not become crazy enough. . Pity, it seemed like it would be a comic cheesiness, well worth a cult status
