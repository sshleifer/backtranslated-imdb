Because of its predictable and second-rate title (at least the one under which it was distributed in Italy), I did not expect much from this film. I thought it would be another cheap movie on a haunted house ("LA CASA MALEDETTA" means "The cursed house"). Well, I had to change my mind right after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the scary atmospheres reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of his decent Italian scams, but it was going to be something completely different ... It looks more like Hitchcock meets the Italian thriller! Very well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot ... OK, I tried not to spoil the viewing of "7 Hyden Park" for you, which I highly recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> P.S. Am I wrong or when Joanna is crawling or trying to stand up (she is paralyzed from the waist up) her feet and legs move a little too much? (... and I'm not talking about the "bad dream" sequence.)
