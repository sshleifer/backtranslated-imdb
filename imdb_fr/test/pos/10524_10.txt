Since this film was released 8 years before I was born, I do not feel so bad about having neglected it for so long. In January 98, I attended the second annual Quentin Tarantino Film Festival, held in Austin, Texas. The particular theme of the movies that night was "Movies for crimes of the 70s with negligence" and she was right. "The sauce train (or the Dion brothers, as it appeared this imprint)" was a real gem. Great performances, weird characters, clever plot, hilarious comedy and just a good time. You rarely see a detective film that is as entertaining and fresh. Margot Kidder, in one of her first appearances in the film, is also extremely sexy. I hope a cable network gets hold of this film and allows a lot more to see it. In the meantime, go to an independent video store and hope they have it.
