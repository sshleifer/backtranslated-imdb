Not having seen the movie in its commercial debut, we caught it via DVD. Expecting the worst, "Hitch" turned out to be a pleasant experience because of its three principles. Thanks to the direction of Andy Tenant, the film has an easy rhythm and, although predictable, the comedy has some winning moments. <br /> <br /> Hitch is a kind of "rendezvous coordinator" for losers like Albert, who is not exactly what we would consider a piece. Yet Albert is a genuine guy who, without the help of a professional, would not go unnoticed by the same women he would like to face. Enter Hitch, to prepare him to overcome the obstacles he can not overcome, and even if Albert remains overweight and never manages to master the social graces, he defeats us because he is a real, in stark contrast to all the phonies that go around Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The fundamental mistake that most production designers make when preparing venues for Hollywood films is their lack of contact with reality. The apartments in which they locate these characters are so rare to discover that it is only through the magic of cinema that these people can live in places that look like them. It's obvious that most movie-goers are dealing with fantasy since most city-dwellers would kill for spaces as fabulous as those they show in the movies, not to mention those that these same people represented in the film could not to permit. <br /> <br /> Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way to charm without doing much. The surprise of the film, however, is Kevin James, who, as overweight Albert, convinces us not only, but he proves that he can stand firm in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is well as Hitch's main interest. In minor roles, we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport and Phillip Bosco, among others. <br /> <br /> "Hitch" is a fun movie to watch thanks to Andy Tenant's inspired direction.
