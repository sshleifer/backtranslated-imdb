Over the years, there are movies that slip and almost no one is watching. <br /> <br /> Choose Conner is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> This gem has been featured in some festivals and was presented for two weeks in a small theater in West Hollywood. 5500. <br /> <br /> It's now on DVD that I hope many others will see this now. <br /> <br /> It is a strange drama of a young and smart politician, who exerts a very brilliant influence Boy of 15 years.This politico also has a beautiful nephew (about 17 years) who binds of friendship with the 15 year old boy. <br /> <br /> The paragraph above is slightly vague as to what is going on, SO is the movie, and that's what I appreciated, we do not get all the facts, it stays a lot to our own thinking. You will hear a dialogue that makes this logic logical. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is slightly vague, this is another point on which the public must think <br /> <br /> Alex D. Linz is our boy 15 years old. He was about 17 when they made this film, but can easily be considered younger. He has been in movies and television since his youngest age. He is a very good actor and he is quite convincing. <br /> <br /> Escher Holloway is the oldest teenager. This role is his first major part and he too. is excellent. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm keeping the best for the end, the screenwriter / director, <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For a first effort, a big congratulations. I hope he and our two guys have a long career. <br /> <br /> Notes: *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
