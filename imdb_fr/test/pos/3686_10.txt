I wonder why I have never heard of this movie before. It's really a wonderful comedy (I would say joke, but it's too well played and I hate to denigrate its quality). A humorous study of the difficulties of mid-life crises, the inequity of gays who can not get their long-standing unions recognized, and the general differences of people who do not integrate well into society, who pair Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should make another film together. Maudie (Meredith Eaton), her anxious, scandalous and scandalous daughter-in-law, is a truly magnificent character. If you liked Tales of the City movies, you'd love this original charmer.
