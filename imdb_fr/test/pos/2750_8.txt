Very good "Precoder" with Dick Barthelmess, who kind of reminded me of Hawks' "Only Angels Have Wings" (1939), in which Barthelmess also played. This film was directed by the talented William Wellman, responsible for the famous aviation photo, Silent "Wings". <br /> <br /> Barthelmess plays the role of a devilish plane pilot, responsible for plane crash. Then he meets and falls in love with the pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an act at a traveling circus; but when Barthelmess's brother appears on the scene, a triangular relationship ensues. <br /> <br /> "The Central Airport" is full of thrilling moments and moving and touching scenes, thanks to the great chemistry that develops between Barthelmess and Eilers (which, in my opinion, in this film is very similar to actress Dorothy Mackaill). Tom Brown is good as Barthelmess's brother, fresh out of his success in Wyler's "Tom Brown of Culver". <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flying stunts, fast-paced movie; All in all, very entertaining. Do not miss it when TCM releases it again.
