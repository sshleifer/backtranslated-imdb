Most of the reviews for "Attack of Show" come from people who unfairly compare it to an old TV show called "The Screen Savers". People are upset that G4 has decided to cancel the "screen savers" and replace them with "Attack of the Show" based on pop culture. Comparing both shows is like comparing apples to oranges! <br /> <br /> "The Attack of the Show" is a one-hour program that covers the current Generation X / Y culture. It features segments on movies / TV, round tables, games video, new versions of DVDs, sex tips, new gadgets (MP3 players, mobile phones, etc.), comics / graphic novels, magazines and Internet gear. <br /> <br /> This is a fun show that is really worth checking if you are between 20 and 30 years old. I give it a 8 out of 10.
