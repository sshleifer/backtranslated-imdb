Wow! It's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode. Ice is certainly one of the best episodes of the first season. It's my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in an isolated claustrophobic structure in the middle of the Arctic with an unknown organism that causes deadly aggression, the drama can not be better than this one. Paranoia reigns while even Mulder and Scully have doubts about everyone's mental health. I've heard people complain about the similarities between this episode and the movie 'The Thing'. I did not see it, so I would not know. Ice is more than worth watching just to see Mulder and Scully truly test their mutual trust. This episode is intense and full of suspense until the end. You will not be disappointed!
