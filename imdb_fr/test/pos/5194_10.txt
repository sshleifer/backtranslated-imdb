Describing Stalingrad as a war movie may be a bit inaccurate. Of course, it is the longest and bloodiest battle in world history, in the largest theater of the most expensive war in human life, money and equipment. Yes, it contains action scenes illustrating fierce battles and terrible destruction. Visceral narration and harsh images, however, make it something more than a war movie, even more than an anti-war film. Stalingrad is rather a movie about hell absolute and undeniable. <br /> <br /> The film contains a host of visual descriptions of the worst kind of war, that of an intensely personal and close war, where days have passed to take a block, only to have taken it again in a surprise assault. The first form of modern urban war that the Germans have succeeded in calling Rattenkrieg (Rat Warfare) is described in a brutal and uncompromising way. The characters make war in sewer tunnels, marshalling yards and apartment buildings in the disfigured landscape of ruined Stalingrad bombs, before being defeated by the ruthless winter of Russia. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the problem Nazism and defamation of the Germans at that time, like many other German and foreign films. His characters are a group of soldiers drawn by the winds of war who are simply trying to get by with themselves and with most of their comrades alive. The characters do not fight the Soviets by ideological hatred between national socialism and Soviet communism, nor by a great dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They fight only because if they do not, the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy does not, their own officers will certainly do so for refusing to fight. This portrait adds an extra layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped desperation that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> A kind of Das Boot's ground companion, Stalingrad describes the epic struggle of the Second World War in a personal way and the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a kind of hero made tragic by the circumstances and a brutal government that would pervert its sacrifice.
