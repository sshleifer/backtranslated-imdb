Blade is a dark, lugubrious but important vampire movie, and one of the best. A little gore, but nothing so serious. Wesley Snipes played an important role in eliminating vampires. It's not really like Buffy, because it's too tame, but Blade provides a decent plot and it's the kind of movie you'd probably like to watch on a dark, stormy night .... better than we look! <br /> <br /> 87%
