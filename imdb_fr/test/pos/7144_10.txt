It was a very faithful presentation of Lewis's life in the mid-fifties. The dialogue on theology and jokes with fellow followers has been exceptionally good. Michael White's book, "C.S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia", deals with this period in a very parallel way. The acting of Joss Ackland was superb to capture the Lewis without emotion. The film took a lot of trouble to be presented in a specific English setting. The development of a strong bond between "Jack" (his favorite name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, Joy's son of his previous marriage, was nice to watch. The film avoided the unpleasant element of the alcohol problem of "Warnie" Lewis (Jack's older brother), but that would not have moved the story, so it's best to leave it out.
