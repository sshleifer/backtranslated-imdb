Crimson started with cool jazzy music, so I liked it immediately, but as the movie progressed, I wondered if the music was not the best part. We have thieves pulling a jewel on the fly and when something is done wrong, the alarm goes off and the cops chase after them and when the car goes around a roadblock one of the thieves (Paul Nash, Jacinto Molina, whoever he is here) shot. Now it seems he could die, but with the help of a drunken doctor and his mad scientist friend (and his wife), he is saved, with a part of the brain of a nightclub owner called "The Sadist". The sadist is unhappy in that the gentlemen who kidnapped him lost their knife to be able to remove it to the head, so to add insults (or, in this case, death), they took off his head using a train, leaving the body to the authorities. find, oops. Once the brain transplant is complete, Naschy wants to ravage any woman who approaches him, because he now has the state of mind of his donor. Of course, all this is rather unlikely and includes medical equipment that seems to have been purchased from Radio Shack, and overall, it's rather tacky and shady. But, it looks good in the early '70s and the music is cool. It's not really a horror movie, but rather a thriller with a lot of thugs fighting for turf, girls and other rogue stuff, but it's strangely entertaining in a way that I can not begin to describe. 7 out of 10
