As long as you do not mind paying a bit more attention than you normally would for other movies, this is one of the best "thrillers" you'll ever see. The film describes an incident likely to occur in real life. In fact, nothing seems to be a fiction. It also describes how people might react in real life. <br /> <br /> In fact, he describes it so much that it looks like real life. Combine that with the lack of soundtracks and you'll get almost the best news movie you've ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are particularly talented for this masterpiece of the late seventies, evoking the anxiety on his side and a real tragic pity on his side. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves thrillers.
