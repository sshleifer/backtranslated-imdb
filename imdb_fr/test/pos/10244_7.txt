I suppose that those who have had a unilateral relationship before will be able to identify with the main character Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50 year old woman who is still in the pink of good health, as her daily life shows, getting up very early in the morning to prepare her milk delivery work, where she has to lug Megmilk bottles in a clock backpack around her town, to exchange empty bottles for full ones, and to collect payment and issue receipt. And there is always a stop of delivery which is at the very top, requiring to climb a long staircase to reach the satisfaction of the customer. <br /> <br /> And curiously, this stop was a stop to give to a man with whom she has been in love almost all her life, from her adolescence to adulthood, and not enjoying the product, she threw in the sink. Having attended the same school, we find that they do not talk to each other and, in their daily life, always seem so close physically, yet so far away. There is no eye contact, except for quick looks by chance, and little recognition of the existence of the other. We learn that they share a past that has probably destroyed all notions of union, where the previous generation clearly prevented them from developing. <br /> <br /> While I thought that Minako was an interesting woman in itself, who kept her feelings suppressed for so long, one can only wonder what kind of damage that would cause. If I read that the original Japanese title means "At times the days when you read books" and that's right, I feel that the film had a wonderful finale with this picture of its well-stocked library , probably referring to the fact that she is not alone after all, and had probably fallen on her crutch to face the pain of being alone and returning to a lifestyle she had been used to for 50 years. In addition to plunging into two jobs, she has these books that serve as an escape and she occasionally think of radio shows of songs. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka did a lot of emotional work. a strong woman resigned to her destiny and her decision to love no one else, her object of affection, Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) was a more interesting character who had more facets. True to his wedding vows, he spends a lot of time on the screen looking after his sickly bedridden wife (played by Akiko Nishina), while juggling with his welfare work at the Children's Affairs Department of City Hall. As a childless couple, I had the impression that this job allowed him to take care not of his own, but of other people's children, children in difficulty who are neglected and who have to fend for themselves. In a rare moment of rage, one can see how angry he was with those distracted parents who did not like and spoiled the lives of their children. <br /> <br /> Kenji Aoki's story provides small quirks to make his characters attractive and have successfully tried to give them much more insight and dimension, such as the fact that Takanashi is a poet haiku hopeless though he is a member of the Haiku club and supportive characters such as the elderly Minagawa couple, to whom Masao (Koichi Ueda) lent some comical but sad moments as he slowly became senile, while the woman Toshiko (Misako Watanabe) tells us and tells us this story of love of a single woman of 50 years. Even the show of Akiko Nishina as a woman bedridden was quite surprising. An enlightened state of knowing her husband's past and making unselfish and painful decisions in her sickly state. <br /> <br /> That's what you can expect from a typical Japanese romantic film, without a young, nubile like star-cros Sed lovers, but with all the other elements in place such as romantic arrangements , love songs and those lazy but affectionate behaviors par excellence. I thought that the story might come off the beaten track when unrequited love would be consumed, but director Akira Ogata managed to stay away from the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, although the story called for obviously a conspiracy evident in the final act. that you can predict, especially if you've already passed your Romance Movie 101. <br /> <br /> Not being your average lovey-dovey story, I thought The Milkwoman had told a strong story with like central theme unrequited love And frankly, a recommended romantic film (although told at a measured pace) if you are in the mood to love, to remember, to remember and to live without regret.
