The film was excellent, except for some scenes with Esposito. I appreciated the way he gathered all the detectives in the series and buckled intrigues never resolved during the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was great to see Pembleton and Bayliss together in their most human and elemental characters. Braugher and Secor have done a great job, but as usual, they will be neglected. It hurt to see that it was the end of the homicide. Memories, tapes and reruns on CourtTV are not the same as watching them every Friday. But the film did its job and did it very well, presenting a great description of life after Al's retirement and the family relationships that existed between the unit. I liked that a lot.
