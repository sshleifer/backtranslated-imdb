I read the last comment made on this movie and totally disagree with it. <br /> <br /> You see, I'm of Portuguese nationality and even if this film does not say much to someone coming from Boston, it surely says something to both the Portuguese and the Brazilians as well as immigrants from all over the world. <br /> <br /> And why are you wondering? First, this film deals with two sister countries: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil gained independence in the early 19th century (in the hands of the heir to the Portuguese throne) and since then relations have greatly improved. <br /> <br /> However, significant as it may be, there is still a lot of prejudices. Due to the economic climate prevailing in Brazil in the 1990s, immigration to Portugal has increased considerably. You see, Portugal is not only a country sharing a language, a culture and similar beliefs in Brazil, it is also a gateway to the rest of Europe. Some people have been forced to make the decision to cross the Atlantic and look for a better life. Portugal was therefore the first logical place to try to immigrate. <br /> <br /> As is still the case with many immigrants, they have been paid on average below the minimum wage and have been treated as "filthy" - only in this case, because the language is similar they were constantly informed about their immigration status. <br /> <br /> Another curious thing about this film is the idea of ​​how a man who knows the history of his country has always tried to earn money by exporting money quickly. coveted national resources. It is precisely people like this who keep Brazil in a state of development, because the country is endowed with natural resources and could easily climb the economic ladder if it were given a fair chance. <br /> <br /> a sense, this shows that colonialism still exists - Pablo representing the exploited people, Igor the man whose status as "noble" (or at least rich or "wealthy") is ensured by the foreign colonial power which is in turn represented by Kraft. <br /> <br /> If you have seen other films from Salles, you will recognize that this is a recurring subject - the fight against oppressive power. I do not want to lecture or condescend to teach anyone the story, but I thought this movie was symbolically very powerful. I'm not saying there was no room for improvement (as there is always), but I think the last written comment was not only narrow-minded, but hands down, ignorant. <br /> <br /> One last thing to say on this point, I must assume that you watched this movie with the eyes of an "American observer". This remark does not hurt, but I mean that "foreign" films can not all relate to "beautiful landscapes" - Art deals with the problems of its time. You would not expect, for example, to paint all the beautiful places of Bayern and the Black Forest by Otto Dix ... Why should you expect a director to focus exclusively on landscapes while he believes that there are more relevant problems to solve? In summary, do not judge movies lightly and wear only two or three criteria. This film is very interesting, its photography is quite good and even the idea that gives the black and white color goes with what it deals. I think the image is deliberately grainy ... like reality, no? :) <br /> <br /> Look at it and draw your own conclusions ...
