This series is greatly underestimated. Like many others, I came across Farscape after the cancellation of the series. Bought Season 1 and was surprised to find a well-written drama infused with a balanced mix of suspense, romance, wit and, of course, science fiction. From the start, he got a 10 to be the first series or a first film to satisfy us, how our hero - and all the extraterrestrials with whom he comes into contact - speaks English! Okay, a few others have gone around the problem, but Farscape has done its best. The fact is that screenwriters pay close attention to details to make the show as believable as possible. <br /> <br /> With so much bad programming, it's a pity that series as balanced and entertaining as Farscape do not do it. have enough visibility and recognition to stay in production. While we enjoy the four seasons and, fortunately, the four hour miniseries, we may be able to make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show.
