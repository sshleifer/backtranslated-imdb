Although I liked this western, I must say that it is not one of my favorite John Ford westerns. For me, it's just missing something that most of his other movies (the ones I've seen anyway) have) I do not know what it is. It is not something tangible. In any case, the story is about a Mormon train of wagons that is used by a group of outlaws as a haunt for a pursuing posse. There are interesting characters, beautiful landscapes, a little action and excitement.It is an experience to look at.It is certainly not boring.Not quite up to the standard John Ford usual.For me, Wagon Master is a 7/10
