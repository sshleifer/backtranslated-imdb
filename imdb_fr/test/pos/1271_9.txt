British director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America and a reputation for making films both popular and critically acclaimed. but this little film was where he started. And that certainly enhanced his talent, with his impressive black-and-white cinematography and his achronological narrative that prefigures his later "Momento", albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanically, the plot made me think of David Mamet's "House of games", but the film always seems fresh and clear, until the last turn of the end, whose flavor was expected, but whose precision is surprisingly delicious. On the other hand, the acting is not quite in the same class - the film has a stylized quality, and perhaps even more than the director intended. But it's still a good start, both claustrophobic and seductive.
