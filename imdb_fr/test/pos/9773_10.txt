Changi has a deliciously fresh script, beautifully interpreted by both young and old actors. John Doyle did a great job bringing humor to a tragic true story, keeping a sometimes sad story fun and captivating, especially for those of us who are unfamiliar with the Asian events of Southeast during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> John Doyle's parallel story successfully bridges the gap between the past and the present, allowing the public to understand the long-term effects of war on prisoners and the lives of their families, as well as lay the foundation for an excellent narrative that perfectly complements the stories, individual and collective. Doyle deserves praise for this effort. In the past, we were delighted with his witty and lucid humor, as evidenced by his long collaboration with Greg Pickhaver under the pseudonym 'Roy & HG' <br /> <br /> As the series approaches to mid-term, we are looking to convey how the story develops with anticipation.
