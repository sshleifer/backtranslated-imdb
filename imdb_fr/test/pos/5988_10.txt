It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! The director did a remarkable job showing the contrasts between social classes, a very relevant situation in France today. All the characters are adorable, especially Juliette and her family. The development of romance is, although not entirely realistic, at least plausible, and does a wonderful job in showing how much people will change for love. I found the heart-warming story of Cinderella, but in which Cinderella is a powerful woman in itself. I laughed during the whole movie and I loved it. I recommend Romuald and Juliet to anyone who loves unique characters, comedy and non-traditional romance.
