At this time when almost everything goes on DVD (I expect to see the My Mother the Car collection from one day to the next), this film has been unjustly neglected. There are countless stupid comedies from the '60s as well as many other eras that have at least received a superficial DVD treatment. To my knowledge, this one was not even published on VHS, despite the talents at play (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (including co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut ). It is obviously a product of the sixties but it is the same for all the rest of this time. All films reflect the tastes and customs of the time in which they are made. This film was released the same year as The President's Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. This film is finally released on DVD and has developed a cult. This movie has a lot of weird, crazy and wacky memorable moments. Of course, he is painted in broad strokes and his music is silly, but that's part of his charm. He creates his own absurd world. If the one who is in charge of DVD production for Columbia Pictures editions (I think Columbia has published it) takes the polls for the new editions, that gets my vote.
