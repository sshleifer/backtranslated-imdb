It would be something to try to tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply. Or maybe it's not the case: Herzog travels to the Sahara Desert and neighboring villages to film various landscapes and locals. But this is just the widest shot. It is a feat to which you abandon yourself or do not give up. He enters entirely into the shape of the world around him, without history, linked to certain aspects of written poetry, while his camera (filming on a film supposedly abandoned) wanders as in a pure travelogue. One might even come to this easy conclusion, drawing up these immense landscapes, then moving on to a rougher civilized culture (but not the "normal" culture itself), and at a level too abstract to be properly presented right here. . Sometimes, it takes a while to get along, close to purity through the "creation" section, but with a purity in the way the pieces are handled, whether by nature or by broken machines. Soon, the narration, the readings of Popol Vuh (who, moreover, makes music for most of his films), with the gradual parade of really stylized shots adds a whole new level. It's a hybrid movie, and it's not easy, but the rewards are closest to Herzog's idea of ​​"ecstatic truth", images that he has published throughout his career. <br /> <br /> One wonders if the images come to an end. up, at the moment when the second section, Paradise, leads with the spoken words, or if it's the opposite. Your eyes move with still images and panoramas, and the wording is close to religious writing, but there are also musical choices, how strangely spared singing and unobtrusive classical music go hand in hand with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith . I think each party ends up complimenting the other, and it's something that * seems * still as if it should not work. It may be the draw, the chances of crossing uncultivated and desolate land and the smallest sections of any civilized life (in this case the desert huts) that make it so fascinating . If only for cinematographic sense, it's a marvel, too difficult to describe for casual photographers because of the technique used and the strangest images of all Herzog films. There are pots and pans, there are close-ups, there is a hand-held telephone while driving near the cities, there is a bus that is tens of kilometers away which, by mirage, does not seem to be a couple. about his radar (real classic gonzo comedy), there are people who still hold false poses, and a man and a woman who play silly music. But above all, it ends up seeming, at least for me, natural for the personal nature of the process. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that only Herzog would know for sure why he made this film, as opposed to the simple "how"; he was already filming Even Dwarfs Started Small, and he ended up going through many perils to finish it. Yet this is what makes Fata Morgana such an incredible feat: it will please everyone, depending on what you bring. It is certainly confusing, but the temptation is great to want to see it again soon, just to experience all the ideas and realities transformed into abstract strange vibrations (yes, the word "vibrations" applies here) ). This is one of the truly spectacular "art films" ever made.
