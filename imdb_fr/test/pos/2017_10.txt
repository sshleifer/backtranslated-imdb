After reading the previews of this movie, I thought it would be disappointing. However, after receiving a DVD from my area (the DVD was available before the movie was released in the UK), I was pleasantly surprised. very nice movie. The fact that the script is quite weak means that you do not get lost in a story and that, therefore, the repeated playback factor is more important. I recommend this movie to everyone <br /> <br />
