But not too trendy. And not too much wisecracking. "Judas Kiss" perfectly describes the new black thing. A good rhythm and a nuanced score complete a sinuous story full of sex, betrayal and assured turnovers. Inspire the work all around. Congratulations especially to HalHolbrook (his best work of all time), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-what?) And Carla Gugino (the best famous fatal of all time ... intelligent, funny and ultra HOT) ... I gives it a 9 (out of 10) and that's because 10 should be reserved for movies like Humphrey Bogart and Coen Bros.
