Watching this movie recently, I had to constantly remind myself that it was made in 1957 .......... and in the USSR! This makes it all the more remarkable. Many cinematographic effects of the film seem clich√©s in 2002, but they were quite original in 1957. I saw this movie for the first time in 1963, at its first release in the United States, and I was struck by its originality . Barely 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind.
