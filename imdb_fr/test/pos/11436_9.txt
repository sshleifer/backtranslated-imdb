It's a great new film that continues to film in my country's cinemas. Its director, the Calabrian Gianni Amelio, is, in my humble opinion, perhaps the only contemporary Italian director, along with Nanni Moretti, to deserve to be described as great (that is, apart from the old ones masters still present and sometimes producing films)). This is one of my biggest regrets that contemporary Italian cinema has suffered since the mid-1970s, mainly due to a glaring lack of funding and recruitment of new talent, which can be transferred in most fields and makes Italy one of the most static. industrialized countries of our time in terms of production (both in the industrial and cultural sense) ... unlike China, for example. And this, among other things, is precisely the subject of Amelio's latest film. Few filmmakers can tell me about Amelio's current situation in my country and in the world, but his images also have a timelessness and universality. And for those who are already afraid of being slow, heavy and dignified - rest assured: those I have seen have certainly not been, at least not if you are used to quality European cinema. <br /> <The basic scheme: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is a technician in an obsolete steel plant somewhere in Italy, probably in the north of the country. It is performed by Sergio Castellitto, one of the most versatile and talented actors in contemporary Italy. When a large Chinese steel industry buys part of the industrial machinery of the Italian steel company, Vincenzo, who has trouble making himself understood with the non-Italian speaking Chinese director, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and that its converter must be replaced by an element he works on the construction of the custom itself. He warns them that not doing so could have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, a young Chinese woman named Liu Hua plays the role of interpreter between the two men, but seems to have trouble finding the translations that correspond to the technical jargon of Vincenzo. The Italian ends up losing patience, pushing her away practically aside and asking him to hand over the Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can translate himself. <br /> <br /> Despite Vincenzo's warnings, he discovers the next morning that the Chinese factory manager and his employees have returned home ignoring his advice on the proper use of the industrial machine. Thus, Vincenzo, endowed with his great integrity, goes to China. And here begins an immensely fascinating road-movie across China, a very current 21st-century odyssey across the Asian giant. The quest for secrets of this mysterious nation by Marco Polo? Not enough. As with all of Amelio's films, the journey itself becomes much more important than whether or not its ultimate "mission" is accomplished. In fact, the way in which the point is literally brought home, not without a hint of humor, is a charming and poignant paradox and irony, which made my eyes lift up while smiling. The viewer discovers the secret that Vincenzo's trip was ultimately totally useless, but he himself does not know it and returns home as a satisfied, innocently deceived man. At least, you can imagine, he is happy. Somehow. <br /> <br /> The travels that the characters of Amelio totally commit to uproot to strip them of their nakedness, the human essence. They are momentarily nameless, status or someone to put in a word for them. These themes, which resemble those of Theo Angelopoulos, are also explored in Lamerica, in fact my favorite film of Amelio, followed closely by La stella che not c'è in order of preference. In the 1994 film Lamerica, two Italian racketeers go to Albania to "do business". Like Vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they have to do and go home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally ends an almost Homeric journey through this devastated country, just after the fall of communism. <br /> <br /> But back to La stella che non c'è: Once Vincenzo In China, he discovers predictably that the seemingly "simple" task of putting the converter back to his new owner is anything but simple . The new location of the machine is seemingly almost impossible to determine unless it embarks on an arduous journey across China. When he meets Liu Hua, the young interpreter whom he abused and who is now working as a librarian, he tries to talk to her but she reacts in a hostile way by informing her that, because of him, she had lost her job as a librarian. interpreter in Italy. Played by relative newcomer Ling Tai, Liu Hua soon becomes a Virgil for Vincenzo's Dante when she reluctantly thinks she could do worse than act as a guide and performer for the Italian on her journey (obviously for a substantial sum of money). This young Chinese actress may not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang, nor the glamor of movie star Gong Gong, but her charming, expressive and pretty face exudes a combination of provocative strength, intelligence, dignity and dignity. twisted humor that will make his features difficult. forget once you've seen the movie. In addition, she and Castellitto have a wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars. <br /> <br /> Amelio weaves serious, poetic, mythic, post-neo-realistic and humorous dramas, while maintaining a comforting capacity to explore the fleeting essence of humanity under ordinary circumstances and mundane. A documentary-like nature hides what is in reality a meticulously designed tapestry of faces and places, a vision that also manages to incorporate cinematography of breathtaking beauty. The photography here is both functional and beautiful, as it is suitable for a film about displaced people in an industrial and emotional wasteland. <br /> <br /> The attentive eye of Amelio is an adult, disillusioned, but also never cynical nor misanthropic. . Master camera angles often give the impression that Vincenzo is alienated from the eyes of the Chinese, which brings home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality very rare in the films about a "familiar" Westerner exploring a non-Western country "unknown". I can not recommend this film enough.
