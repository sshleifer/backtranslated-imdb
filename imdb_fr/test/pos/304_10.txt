Even with all the film dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's scale, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Taxi Driver), we have the feeling that we do not even know half of what happened. . Even contemplating horror is inhuman. And a progression - or a retreat? - the inhumanity it requires is a key element of Apocalypse Now, the largest and one of Coppola's most important films. Freely inspired by the 1902 classic, Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," which recounts the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that accompanies distance from civilization - a kind of bestial surface, like a lord of flies - which brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is that of Willard, a general charged with a special mission to Cambodia after the start of his first tour of duty in Vietnam. Willard at the beginning of the movie is stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to go home - echoing strangely to Nicky in The Deer Hunter. He is therefore contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade green beret who isolated himself in a remote post on the banks of the Nung River and who would have become completely insane - adored as a god by the natives and murdering without discrimination. The name of this man is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best being Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). As Willard heads back into an army boat with the help of soldiers, he witnesses the horrors and the madness - and the overwhelming inaccuracy of all this - leads to a strange sympathy and a identification with Kurtz even before they meet. By the time they do, Kurtz's methods do not seem as bad or as they should, and they certainly do not seem too unusual or out of place. Revelation - a place beyond morality, the outpost on the end of the world. The loss of civilization, the loss of judgment, of oneself. Kurtz's soliloquy about an atrocity he witnessed as a green beret and his subsequent revelation is one of the most frightening and successful speeches in film history. The film is about trauma, the human spirit and its breaking point. Here, it looks a lot like The Deer Hunter, and it's just as good. Apocalypse, however, eliminates the limits of what we can endure on a global level: Coppola's vast footage of Cambodia's wet and cloudy jungle and a helicopter opening sequence amidst exploding forests and a orange sky - on a track strangely matched to Doors' soundtrack - as well as scary scenes on the river and an air raid on a village where Wagner crashed into the speakers (a scene that turned out to be the one of the most terrifying scenes of war, a dark humor and a staggering waste of time) - all this contributes to the meaning of the Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at a distant point in the future, but of the Apocalypse now and forever. The deer hunter is much more intimate and personal, you can even tell by his title, and shows the total effect of trauma on the individual psyche, the degradation of the human soul and its ability to completely surrender to the forces of darkness . , or limp on it. That's why the two films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing. In "Heart of Darkness", Kurtz appears as a conflict between morality (civilization) and its inner savage. In Apocalypse Now, Kurtz left all the conflicts behind him. He is beyond good and evil. He let go of morality like a man drowning a saving hand in the moments before his death. Kurtz only expects death, citing T. S. Eliot in his temple for himself, lost in the jungle. His last words, and the words sounded at the end of the film, are: "The horror ... the horror". It refers to the infinite emptiness of existence, the human psyche, and the black emptiness in one's own mind, where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to express in words the experience of watching this film - the experience, in short, that Willard experiences during his journey. The final part, at the outpost, almost comparable to his brother's scene in The Deer Hunter, is one of the deepest, quietest, and most disturbing things I've ever seen.
