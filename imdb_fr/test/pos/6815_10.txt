I absolutely loved this movie ... So much emotion in such a short time. I loved the beginning and the way it puts you completely off guard. I like the story and the fact that the deer is imported. I know that when I think of deer, I think of innocence and prosperity. Moreover, in Psalm 42: 2, in the Bible, it is written, "As the stag protects streams, so protects my soul for you, my God." This could even connect the last moment when the woman says that everything will be fine. As if she knew that she is going with God. Maybe I think too much about that. But sometimes, it's interesting to see what's going on in people's minds. Thank you for sharing this masterpiece with viewers around the world. I live in Texas and I played it on the cable ... I immediately went to the computer to learn more about this film and this incredible director! I really liked the music used in the background. Music can sometimes make or break a movie. This definitely set the mood perfectly. Very good choice! <br /> <br /> Thank you again. <br /> <br /> Laetitia
