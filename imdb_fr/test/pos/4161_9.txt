Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agn√®s Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a sonic poem with striking graphics that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island, New York, at the turn of the century. . It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but deeply rewarding experience. The latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro), imbued with dreamlike and symbolic images with realistic realism, is like an impressionist painting - an interpretation by a cinematographic artist of what the immigration process could have been for our parents and our grandparents. Crialese's "magical and mysterious visit" was born from his visit to the Ellis Island Museum, the faces of the immigrants represented in photographs he has seen, and his research on the hard policies and procedures applied at the time. admission of immigrants. <br /> <br /> Guided by the letters he read from immigrants to relatives who stayed at home, Crialese identifies with these destitute immigrants who have seen the positive side of things beyond their test. For Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his eldest son Angelo (Francesco Casisa), America is a distant dream of which they know nothing. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they receive postcards from the younger son of Salvatore, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), dumb mute, who portrays the new world as a land where they can swim. in rivers of milk, sit under a silver tree or harvest carrots and giant onions. <br /> <br /> Salvatore, his two sons and his old mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) have thrown their animals in exchange for shoes and costumes and are embarking on the adventure with more hope than worry. but the equation changes quickly in the other direction. As they board the boat and settle into their cluttered third-class compartments, the film's most talked-about scene unfolds. Using an aerial camera that shows masses of people standing, as the ship moves away, the frame is divided into people on board the ship and those who greet the dock and how they are separated implies that they are separated from all that is familiar to them. On board the ship is a mysterious English woman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she travels to America, but she seems to represent the beginning of the modern world in which they enter. Although they watch each other carefully, Lucy is interested in Salvatore and asks her to marry him so that he can enter the country. The journey is perilous with a violent storm shaking the ship. Shot in total darkness, the passengers on board are thrown against the edge of the boat, then entangled and twisted on the ground, as in a macabre Totentanz. The rite of passage through the process of immigration to Ellis Island does not get any easier and Crialese attacks like illiterate peasants, in the name of the preservation of a "civilized" society, are forced to set up riddles, perform mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical examinations. prove that they are "fit". <br /> <br /> A wedding ceremony is like an auction and young women look depressed to associate with overweight middle-aged men. This is the only way for them to enter the "Golden Gate", however, since single women are rejected unless they have partners, to prevent the threat of prostitution. Through fog, immigrants can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no Statue of Liberty asking tired people and the poor, humiliated masses breathing freely. In their imagination, however, the river is still flowing, waiting for them to jump inside. Although the end is ambiguous and one door is on a white wall, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we all have to go through. the old world to the new.
