I thought the game was really great and I loved it. </ P> <p> <p> <p> The game is simple. like James Bond and complete missions in different places, like an arctic wasteland or a city. My favorite was the one with a tank. In two player mode, you and a friend choose from the characters of your choice and go out in a fight. In the area where you are, you will find ammunition and weapons to help you. From handguns to rifles to lasers and even your fists work. <br /> <br /> Again, with the two player mode, there are many places to go, and some to unlock.I find this game really fun, but also very moving.Because you never know really where your opponent is, and it's amazing to see them behind a door where you go. <br /> <br /> This game receives **** (1/2) stars or ***** Very good! Go play one day!
