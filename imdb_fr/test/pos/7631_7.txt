I read some reviews of this movie, which was recently released on DVD by Eclectic. Apparently, the opening titles are letterbox, but the rest (most) is in full screen. The first publication, in 1982 by Planet Video, is completely mailboxed. Although it was a primitive version, the compositions were correct. Later versions had a sharper and better image quality, but they were full screen like the DVD. Any release of this film must be powered by a mailbox, because it adds an added value to the visual experience of the old Planet cassette.
