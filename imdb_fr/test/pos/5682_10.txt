I have read many unflattering comments about this movie, and the only things I've seen that they all have in common are: "boring" and "unrealistic". <br /> <br /> First, they used real frickins' fangs! How much more realistic can you be? No CGI, no animatronics, no miniatures. Just a fang and a piece of meat. Have fun, guys! <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this movie starts slowly. The development of the character, the little they had, anyway, takes a little time, and I think it's mainly where this movie is missing. <br /> <br /> However, when the movie started, I found the action taken in hand dramatically. I do not mean that there is a lot of action. If anything, there are more times when the fang can not be seen at all, and people just wait. However, we know that there will be no relief and the crocodile is waiting for its time. It sounded like other movies that are horrified by non-action, like Open Water (another movie that has been criticized by some viewers as "boring"). Personally, I think that viewers who are unable to feel the suspense have had their attention removed surgically at birth, but it's only me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the characters feel real and the situation is such that it could really happen to anyone in the right circumstances. In addition, the dead are quite real and sometimes it is a little difficult to monitor. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a winner.
