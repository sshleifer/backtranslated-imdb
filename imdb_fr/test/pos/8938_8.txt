Seeing this movie the other night on demand and thinking, "This is the kind of movie that could have been portrayed by Alec Guiness and Glynis Johns if it had been shot in the late '50s. A joke in the English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Blethyn are very kind and sincere in their performances. Naomi Watts simply sizzles in a disjointed way, Jayne Mansfield (if she could have acted). The rest of the distribution has very good turns. The Welsh landscape is charming. An absurd premise, certainly and not at all credible, but it does not hinder the pleasure. It's not a big movie, but a really fun watch. And Walken is at his best far-fetched. A joy to see!
