I have already seen this story, but not my children. A boy with a troubled past joins the army, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary belief, to save lives. After losing his team, he holds a teaching position to train the next generation of heroes. The young rookie in trouble is played by Kutcher. Although his local love scenes are a bit steep and do not generate enough heat to melt the butter, he compliments Costner well. I never really understood that Sela Ward was the neglected wife and I thought she should have wanted Costner to leave his job for safety, not selfishness. But his presence on the screen is a pleasure. The two unrecognized stars in this film are the Coast Guard and the Sea. These two powerful forces should not be taken for granted in real life or in this film. The film has some slow points and could have used the lost 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships. But it still works. The scenes of rescue are intense, well filmed and mounted to offer maximum impact. This film deserves the applause of the public. And the applause of my two sons.
