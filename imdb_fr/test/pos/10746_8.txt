Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is back, having rid the sea of ​​the fearsome Pirate Lo. Back on Earth, he is assigned to the police where he must put an end to corruption and crime in a local suburb. Along the way, he is caught in the fate of several Chinese patriots who are trying to gain sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese Manchu government is looking for these revolutionaries and anyone who intervenes is in trouble, even if it is part of the police. I had high expectations for this film after watching Project A. But unfortunately, I was a little disappointed. There is just too little action compared to the first movie. There is just a good fight scene to the big end. This fight scene takes place in the "gangster's place" and it's good, a lot of people are flying everywhere and kicking and blows are being thrown. Jackie Chan and his stunt team do not disappoint at all. The end is very funny, Jackie Chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting things! The only bad thing with the end is that the fights are too short and forgettable. Conclusion: many fun moments, good acting and crazy stunts. But not enough to fight for a maximum score.
