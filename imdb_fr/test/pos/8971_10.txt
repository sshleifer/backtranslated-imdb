Charlie Wilson's war is an excellent example of how films should be made. This film is of the highest quality and is perfectly interpreted. Tom Hanks takes the lead and delivers an outstanding performance. In addition, Tom Hanks is commended by the incredible gaming ability of the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I have never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly. <br /> <br /> The film is witty, intelligent and well written. Julia Roberts is also a star in this film but she is easily concealed by the other two protagonists. <br /> <br /> I have rated this film 10/10 and I have the pleasure to recommend it to anyone interested in quality cinema.
