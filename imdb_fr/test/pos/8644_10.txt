Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. Even when nothing happens, it's suspensive. Filmmaker David Lynch abused some awesome cheap stuff here and there, but he inserted it with other cinematic techniques to keep him from becoming obtuse. <br /> <br /> Quite surreal, this film is like waking up and remembering dreaming but not enough to make it reasonable. I am still trying to understand everything and will probably have to see him again to catch things that I have forgotten and that could help me better understand. This is a very detailed scenario that is growing very slowly. So you must be patient and pay attention. Keep your trip away from the bathroom before you start. And yet, the plot is eclipsed by the theme, the mood, the development of the character and the shooting techniques. <br /> <br /> The dual role of lead actress, Naomi Watts, showcases her enormous talent. That is to say when I could look away from his co-star. What a pair of actors. <br /> <br /> Lynch surprises throughout the film with unusual camera angles, the length / timing of montages, jumps from one scene to another. Combined with clever use of music and sounds, all of this helps to create suspense in our mind, probably a major goal of the director. Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, even asked me to talk to the actors to be careful here and not be so naive there. You know, the kind of things you want your kids to do in movies.
