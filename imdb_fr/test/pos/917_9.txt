This film has a spartan and resentful aspect that leaves us plenty of room to participate in the action without any clutter telling us what we are supposed to feel; in 'Blue', everything was openly sad (of course, as powerful as hell, but still); in 'White' it was a delicious fantasy. But there are no clues or emotional cues of this type in this one. It's as if he ends up letting the strength of the tale play his own magic without dazzling embellishment. I think that's what makes it the most enigmatic at first, but ultimately the most transcendent and the most redeeming. Never has a ruthless and implacable honesty been so beautiful.
