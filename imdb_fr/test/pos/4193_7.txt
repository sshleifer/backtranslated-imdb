The Beatles had just done "Magical Mystery Tour". There was a general feeling that performance, peace and drugs naturally went hand in hand. In Los Angeles, there was a subculture of the movie that knew something was going on. Nicholson belonged to several of these gangs. <br /> <br /> Before deciding to become a serious actor, before "Easy Rider", before "Pink Flamingos", before "Day for Night", several experiments do about it. An important one is the "Zaragoza manuscript". This is another example. <br /> <br /> Jack writes. He plays with the circular narration, the reference to himself, the reference to the film, the hateful performance, the pain of creation, all on the periphery of kiddiepop safe. You have to see that, if only to know something about Jack. <br /> <br /> Some actors act by digging in their skin. This is a common technique. Some dig deep, but after a while, they become boring because they are incredibly superficial people. There is not enough material for a career. Think of DeNiro and Hackman. <br /> <br /> The others are very interesting people, who seem to become more and more interesting over time. When they dig in the barrel, they put things back because of the pain of digging. Think Sean Penn and Jack. At the bottom of Jack's body, at the end of the line, he turns, the base of each character is this experimental and risky author / director. <br /> <br /> Who cares if it's a bad movie? It's bad because it took some risks. Watch when a tear is wiped from Annette's cheek by the director. It's a fond blunder for the whole Brando thing, something I've heard Marlon laugh about. It's one of the richest moments in the history of Hollywood cinema. <br /> <br /> There is another reason to look at this. Music in the cinema has a strong root in dance. The revolution in the film is often based on music. Whole cultures are thus swept away. <br /> <br /> Toni Basil, an unknown giant who invented the fact that billions of people are dancing now. She was as influential in pop choreography as the Beatles in music. She was already well engaged in her career when she was called to work there. But this is one of his first appearances on the screen. You can see her work from end to end and herself in the rather cool segment of "Daddy's Girl," on one of Nilsson's best songs. (Followed by Frank Zappa cameo.) McCartney would refer to this scene in his special years of TeeVee later. <br /> <br /> A third reason to look is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the movie: a character named "Lady Pleasure" kisses each monkey in a continuous long stroke and then departs with disdain. She is known as I.J. Jefferson, but is actually Mimi Manchu, the mistress of Nicholson at the time and LSD partner. Red hair, psychedelic behavior. Charming. This scene speaks volumes about Jack's feelings about boys. <br /> <br /> Rating of Ted - 3 of 3: It's worth watching.
