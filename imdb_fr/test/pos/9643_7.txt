While I'm typing these comments, I'm watching a DVD of this film that I just received from a mail-order seller, and I find that it resists extremely well, with strong characterizations, credible situations and action scenes well staged. . <br /> <br /> It's been a good 45 years, maybe 50 years, since I saw HELL BELOW, but the scene that deeply impressed me is the death of Sterling Holloway, that many commentators mentioned here. . I have not arrived at this scene yet, but I can answer for what other comments have said: once you see Sterling Holloway's death scene in this movie, you will not forget it never. Judging by the strength of the film so far, I really expect this scene to live up to its memory - undoubtedly among the greatest death scenes in the history of cinema. The film is worth seeing for the only moment, but even without it, it would be a first underwater drama of the first order.
