Jimmy Stewart brings to life the story of Charles Lindbergh, who tells almost the entire film as he crossed the Atlantic. It's well edited with flashbacks on Lindebergh's life. Franz Waxman's score is a brilliant shear and really gives the photo a heroic feel. One of the most remarkable roles of Stewarts and this film can be delivered many times. Bud Hamilton, the mayor of JAWS, appears as Bud Gurney. He released on DVD 08/08/06 with the release of some other classic Stewarts films. I consider Jimmy Stewart as the greatest actor in the Americas and I do not get tired of seeing it in all the movies I see, look at this picture and you will agree.
