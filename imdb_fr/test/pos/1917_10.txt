I saw this movie on TV and I loved it! I am a real disaster movie fan, and this one was great. The cast was composed of really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in a league of his own. He can play comedy and thriller in the same film as few others. The scenario is great too. The idea of ​​being able to follow the chronology of what will happen and use this timeline to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea. And this film presents it in almost completely believable way.
