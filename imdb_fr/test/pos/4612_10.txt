A powerful first film by Murali K. Thalluri that explores the life events of a group of high school students, each in crisis one way or another. The film begins with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then retraces the life of the group during the previous hours, leaving the public in suspense until the last minutes of the identity of the deceased. Each of the main characters is confronted with major stressors that could potentially precipitate suicide. The casting of strangers provides performance full of power and emotion. Fantastically well done, especially considering the youth of the screenwriter / director who was 19 when he wrote the script.
