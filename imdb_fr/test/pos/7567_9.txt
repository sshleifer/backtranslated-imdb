First of all, despite the low rating given to this site, I saw something worthy in this film and will defend it with pleasure. And no, I'm in no way bound to the crew ... <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon The Wind's DVD, and I had the strong impression that it would not be quite as before. like the video packaging described. So I tried my luck and I was pleasantly surprised by this strange and very different drama. I suppose that the marketing and synthesis of DVDs was the work of MTI Home Video to link a rental or a sale (the slogan "Love comes in many forms" was replaced by "Terror is under many forms "). Of course, renting and selling smaller movies is highly dependent on the attention of viewers, especially if they have never heard of the film before (a similar case occurred with THE ITEM). This is probably what goes against this publication, while horror fans read the description of an "ancient wind" carrying "omens of the apocalypse". It is easy to think that this is the subject of this film and that some students in the history of this story will become wild savages who engage in a slaughter. So, by the time this review was submitted, is probably the reason for the lower rating assigned to IMDb. I can understand the people who get upset and think they are fooled by this summary, seeing the apocalyptic introduction and then undergoing a dark drama. I can forgive the marketing choice because I enjoyed The Wind and thought it was a refreshing change of pace from the main Hollywood offerings. However, if the intended audience was listened to, more people could be heard. <br /> <br /> The "wind" in this film is basically a metaphor for society, it's the story of four friends who make bad choices and whose lives quickly turn into a desperate self-preservation. After being too far away to "teach a lesson" to one of them, a death occurs and each person tries to save his position. The manipulation between them becomes the norm and, in the end, we see how self-preservation becomes their main motivation for good judgment. Civilized to wild, basically. This is very evident everywhere, noting that the use of a knife, stick branches, punches and kicks are instruments of violence rather than firearms. In a way, these characters do all that is wrong for the right reason, just to stay informed, because they have already taken things too far. Although there are many violent implicit images, it is interesting to see that there is no absurdity and nudity. <br /> <br /> What works in favor of The Wind are the "unknown" actors. Larger stars were originally planned, but I think it works best when you have lesser known and capable actors. In this way, you can go into the story without thinking, for example, "oh, it's Tom Cruise," instead of a truly tormented person facing an extraordinary situation. Even unusual conversations (like between Mic and Billy in a field, and Mic in front of Claire in her room) stand up well and feel pretty natural in the strange world of Fairview ... which has cozy houses, a forest and large fields. I kept thinking of the quiet landscapes hiding darker secrets in The Reflecting Skin, which director Michael Mongillo mentions as a source of inspiration in his commentary. <br /> <br /> The Wind manages to get the messages through without being too hard. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look closely, you will see many symbols and dialogues that other directors will pound your head with. I even understood the infamous "kissing scene" between Claire, John and Billy in the context of the story without being surprised that it happened. I'm always amazed at how some people (mostly guys) who complain about two men kissing each other in a scene would obviously have no problem if the scene were two girls kissing each other instead. Everything is well managed here, and additional views will make things clear without making you moan and say "oh man, how did I miss THAT ..." Things got progressively integrated and I appreciated that. You can also listen to the commentary of the DVD to discover more things revealed! <br /> <br /> For those of us who have "understood" the intentions of this film, The Wind is a breath of fresh air (no pun intended). at a time when most films are made for the sole purpose of earning money and being heard, which eliminates other films from their box office when they are mentioned in Entertainment Tonight or CNN. <br /> <br /> Years later, it's always the big little discoveries such as The Wind that stay in my mind, are not treated as star-driven blockbusters. <br /> <br /> If you have gone beyond the marketing ploy of MTI Home Video, you may find it interesting. I highly recommend it to friends who are looking for unusual movies like this one.
