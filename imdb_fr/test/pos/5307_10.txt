It's a great movie and was immediately placed in my top ten (believe me, I know the movies!). This is one of the movies that really makes you think, not necessarily about the screenplay but about yourself! The film tells the story of a fifteen-year-old boy (Leland Fitzgerald) who kills an autistic boy. he is sent to a juvenile hall where he meets Pearl Madison, his teacher. His relationship with Pearl grew slowly and finally, Pearl decided to write a story about Leland and his peers, but as he discovered Lelands' motive, he discovered that he had to solve his own problems first. <br /> <br /> a great movie and a must with good music from the elves and a fantastic score! Look at this!
