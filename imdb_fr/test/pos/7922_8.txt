(Watch out: spoilers, although it's hard to ruin this movie by telling the story's details.) <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for all the world. It's very old and it's, uh, clumsy. What makes it ideal for me is the soundtrack, not the soundtrack, but the soundtrack update. Better yet, the orchestral version created by Prokofiev (my favorite performance is that of Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony). <br /> <br /> The movie is really fun in places. This is reminiscent of the old "Dream of a Summer Night". Some of the outdoor scenes are pretty beautiful. Some of the actors are also beautiful. (The actor who played Nevsky could have been a superstar today ... Ditto for the warrior, Vasilisa - definitely a rocker.) <br /> <br /> This is perhaps the best collection in the world, on film, Russian pithy sayings (There are tons of them - they make up most of the spoken lines). <br /> <br /> Battle scenes look much more realistic than most of Hollywood's high-budget films. These guys are as clumsy in their battles as real peasants. The weapons look mean, so the actors probably tried to avoid hurting each other. <br /> <br /> The actor playing the German "grand marshal" tries * really * hard to sound scary at the beginning of the film, but he looks like a real cat. Once captured, he looks * so * pathetic. (Says a lot about the intended audience, da?) <br /> <br /> The German army brings a * really humorous * organ, played by a character in black dress. Watch the Russians stun * while * this one is playing. <br /> <br /> Once the battle is over and almost all Germans dead, the best part of the film (and music), sings to the dead soldiers who died defending the homeland. This part is so sad that it's almost an anti-war statement. <br /> <br /> Ten times more men than women have rated this film. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> Warning: Joseph Stalin liked this movie. Ironic - he killed more Russians than anyone. "Those who come to Russia with the sword will die by the sword".
