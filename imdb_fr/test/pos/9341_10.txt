The stars and the planets had to be in the proper alignment, the day of THRILLER's design. Michael Jackson's album kills the charts, John Landis still has a lot of good will from his film "An American Werewolf In London" (not to mention his classic comedies ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS) and choreographer Michael Peters. creating some of the most innovative and influential pieces for music videos of this period. <br /> <br /> Never before, nor since, has a single film illuminated, exploited, or underlined the incredible talent of MJ or the more supernatural aspects of His character perfectly resembles THRILLER, the long video forms the more successful in the world (if not officially the first) and the most memorable. It's also the most expensive at the time, but every penny and all the talent behind its creation and execution are on the screen. And how would it be complete without the "rap" of the original song, provided by the late, the great Vincent Price, to add even more cache to the chills already present? <br /> <br /> The days of glory of one of the greatest artists in the world have long passed, but no one can ever take away the hard facts acquired from man, which is probably the most memorable . If you do not think so, remember: Halloween is coming. I will not be a little surprised when, like the other Halloweens before it goes back decades, it appears on a special Saturday Night Creature Feature show. <br /> <br /> As will be the case next year and the following year. .
