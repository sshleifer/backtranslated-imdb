This film is one of the only historical documents showing the talents of so many black singers, actors, actresses and dancers. Many who are no longer with us. The ones we have the chance to appreciate today in 1999, through this film, allow us to recognize the talents that existed at the time. That's why people who still live today, as well as the dead, are super-stars icons. Because of his educational background in music, theater, filming, design, singing, etc., this film belongs to him alone to the inhabitants of this country. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie. The sound was excellent! The film seemed to be complete, the color and clarity were good, but good considering the age of this film without any repair on the images. I agree with all the previous positive reviews. I have no negative opinion. <br /> <br /> I only wish to make one request. Please, make it available so that everyone can live this historical experience.
