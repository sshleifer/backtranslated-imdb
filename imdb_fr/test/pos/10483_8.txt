St√©phane Audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community at the end of the last century. Two beautiful and musical talented sisters give up their own perspectives of happiness and marriage to care for their aging father. One day, a French girl, Babette, comes to work for them. After a few years, she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who welcomed her. His solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast, which will change the lives of all those invited. It is a film about human and cultural interactions, reflected in the changing language of dialogue between Danish and French, and more specifically between the conscientious sobriety of Protestant North Europe and the sensuality of the Catholic South. It is also about human needs and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. A deeply edifying film.
