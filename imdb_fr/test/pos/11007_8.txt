Salmen is a long film for its kind, and the pace is often much slower than expected by the Western audience. That said, I enjoyed it both in terms of interesting subjects and beautiful images that this film contains. Some landscapes are truly breathtaking and there is enough interest that most of them can survive in Selmen with minimal use of fast forward. <br /> <br />
