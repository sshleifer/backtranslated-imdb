Nightbreed hit me the first time I saw her. And that has resisted well over the years. The sets and effects of monsters work, are among the best I have ever seen. No one I know seems to have seen this film, which I think was greeted at the box office, because of the lack of interest in horror in the early nineties. It plays like a dark and horrible fairy tale, and is much deeper, so do you think, with a strong message against fanaticism, presented by a rich mystical past, created by Clive Barker. What is nil is that the movie ends on a really cool away note, which we will probably never see. My only minor complaint is that Craig Sheffer is at best only a passable actor, and that the project could have benefited from a better actor in the play. Just a minor complaint if Sheffer is fine. I had a similar problem with Scott Bakula in Lord Of Illusions by Barker. It's not really a terrible performance, but I did not like it as much in the role as if I had other people.
