I know a lot of people have said do not bother with this movie because it's not a good fight movie and difficult with subtitles. It's a very lazy way of thinking about a movie. If you want to focus on this part of the film, you have to look for something else and learn to respect the cinema as art, it's a masterful work. If you want to watch that, it's not really about fighting. There are good fight scenes that are sometimes pretty well filmed with good camera work, but the story itself is what keeps the story together and is the important part. This is not the basic film of Kung-Fu. History is at the heart of concerns, not fights. The combination of the two is an excellent film that deserves to be watched. She is even better in the original language with subtitles.
