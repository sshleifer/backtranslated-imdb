By far one of the best sci-fi movies on the market. However, it takes multiple visions to understand the concept of the film and to be able to appreciate not only the special effect, but also the main plot of the film itself. I think this film received such bad reviews because no one took the time to watch the film as it should. There are times when you would want to hurry and go, but they are rare. Hooper, who directed TCM 1 and 2 with a remake of INVADERS DE MARS, and THE FUNHOUSE did their best here. A good score, good acting and great effects make it a movie to add to your collection. If you have the opportunity, watch the widescreen DVD version, highly recommended for all science fiction fans.
