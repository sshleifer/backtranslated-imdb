It was a random rental at the video store. But I was impressed from the start. Wooden Camera is a gem of a second feature film by an engaging director. The film captures deep moments and often frustrating and complicated interactions often experienced by young interracial friends in a post-apartheid South Africa. The young actors are very good and well oriented in their approach to the basic material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visual elements offering a frame-by-frame study of a deeper understanding and accomplishment without falling into stereotypes and iconic clich√©s. The musical score of the film gives body to the film without being invasive. After watching it a second time, I found the DVD on amazon and I'm happy since.
