"twin peaks" and "blue velvet" have always been my favorite movies, and while Lynch's previous films have been slightly disappointing for me, they're still worth watching on and off. to be pretentious, the lynch can be like a good wine - you have to savor it and ruminate it. but in the end, you have to make up your own mind about what you saw, because Lynch never gives you the complete answers. <br /> <br /> many people will come out of the "mulholland reader", probably wanting to choke the mind-blowing visual puzzle that has just unfolded in front of them. but there is a twisted logic in this film, just look for clues. Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives at Hollywood, doe eyes and looking for celebrity. she then finds in her bathroom an amnesiac who has escaped an attempted murder on a mulholland road. together, they try to discover the secrets of the life of the amnesiac. all this leads to a club called Silence, where a blue box will reveal everything. and that's when the movie throws everything out the window. the people we thought we knew were totally different people ... is it a dream? a reminiscence of previous escapades of life? either you will like this movie, or you will hate it. David Lynch still draws such extreme reactions from his viewers. but as his universe itself always speaks of extremes, it is normal for his films to provoke such reactions. <br /> <br /> It is better to watch this film thematically rather than as a direct narrative. and appreciate the fact that Lynch is a filmmaker who will always let you draw your own conclusions. he has had many imitators lately, especially in "vanilla sky", where a dazzling film decides to give you all the answers in the last five minutes, and you will probably forget this movie as soon as you leave. the cinema. Mulholland Drive will haunt you.
