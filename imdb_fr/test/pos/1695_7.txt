"Landscape after a battle" opens on a snowy field full of fences, avoiding prisoners - with rather amusing movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we learn soon enough to know these prisoners like a crowd, and when they (also treated with humor) bury a living man, the protagonist stops for a moment, but he is soon more busy finding books in the overturned camp than to worry about his neighbor. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film takes place in an American camp where prisoners are not released, in a sort of semi-liberty camp. A perfect set for a study of war crime, American camps, Polish nationalism, catholism, grief and human misery in general. <br /> <br /> The film takes an important turn. Women come in and the movies change their light, color and temperament. At the same time, it turns out that these prisoners were slaves of the Holocaust. I think one of the main political themes underlying the film must be to deal with the way humanity treats Jews under and after the World War, not just Nazi exterminations, but of all humanity that allow it - and even force them to leave Europe after the war. Emotionally, the film deals with grief and its problem, the difficulty of leaving grief in its environment and the difficulty of sharing grief with people with different experiences. <br /> <br /> But the film is a carpet of underlying contradictions, humor, irony and sudden beauty. Several times during the film, a gypsy prisoner plays on a harp, an emotional air brutally rejected (filmically) by the protagonist. This example takes up an essential essence of the style and theme of the film. When it comes to humor, it's very funny to see the protagonist lose and constantly find his glasses, in the crowd, in the haystacks, etc. <br /> <br /> It's not difficult to understand Spielberg's respect for Wajda when we see this film. The good treatment of light can be compared to Spielberg. The Grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrativly, he just pulls the film out of the camp, but filmically, he brings the film to dream and eternity with deep beauty. In any case, there is also another scene that I can not leave without comment. It is the Christian supper. Undoubtedly ironic, but simultaneously deeply religious, we see the moment of transubstantiation, everyone kneeling, while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy. His bells mock the scene, but also give him emotion and love. When Nina takes her bread, the sun falls on her and the bells ring spherically, this is the climax of the film. <br /> <br /> The main roles of the main actors are excellent. Olbrychski as the perfect protagonist of Wajda - the thoughtful mind that doubted, unable to give life to all aspects of his mind and emotions. The beautiful Celinska plays with her great body and makes her debut in a character unable to express all that is inside in her proud movements. <br /> <br /> Those who try to describe everything can often not take anything into consideration. This is what Wajda manages. His films are very touching, deep or beautiful, but they pay special attention to life and society. A moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second, the moment of sorrow for the third, a moment of nothing for the fourth. <br /> <br /> There are at least two reasons to pay attention to Wajdas films from this period. The first is the remarkable free expression of profound political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Second, Kusturica has developed a narrative and filmic language.
