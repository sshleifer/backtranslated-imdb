"Kramer vs. Kramer", an Oscar winner, follows the famous businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce with his bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day, Ted's wife leaves him and their child in search of a better life, forcing Ted to get closer to his son (Justin Henry). The two links and become very close (but only after a few frictions), and as everything goes perfect, Ted's wife returns to town and wants sole custody of their son. Ted goes on a mission not to let his son get caught, and fights his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives an extraordinary performance with Meryl Streep and the young Justin Henry is impressive.
