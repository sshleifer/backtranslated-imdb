The summary only concerns those who hate this movie, finding the correct or average movie is acceptable. Visiting this film on IMDb made me nostalgic because I could not help coming back in 1994. I was one of the lucky few to have seen this movie in theaters. It instantly became one of my favorite comedies and it took a few years to make it my favorite. How can I say what made this movie my favorite? Was this excellent writing (the story was OK but the script and dialogues were fabulous) Was it superlative performance? Was it the mood of the movie? <br /> <br /> After thinking about it for so many years, I thought it was a mix. It's one of those films that had no flaws, not even his music. (The other film that comes to mind is Sholay right now) drama and comedy. One comedy is not enough. I want moreeeeeeee ..........
