Charles Darwin begins a war with a completely predictable end. War with God His theories resemble the fact that God has nothing to do with humanity, that he has nothing to do with the amazing world in which we live. Wild, hard, ironic and chaotic, these words surround the spirit of the character thrown into a universe of material truth, which slowly pushes hope for God out of his mind. Nevertheless, the film as Charles Darwin always sees the wonder and beauty beyond God in the universe of infinite evolution.
