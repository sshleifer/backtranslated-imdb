America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense of the word. He has a good host, great guests, great production and some of the best modeling professionals in the world who contribute something they have not done yet: to present a real American Top Model. Of course, it is not easy to do. As a result, the United States and the world would already have 10 big models competing in this cruel world. <br /> <br /> But it's obvious that his intention is not to present America's next model, but yes, America's Next Pop model. The show brings together a number of models without any experience of different personalities and facing big personal, professional and financial problems, which gives them a chance to realize a dream or make their life worthy. It is obvious that Tyra Banks uses all this to her advantage, she gives the dream, but in return, she wins an audience and is gaining popularity. In any case, she deserves it, because she is intelligent and, if I may say so, pioneer of this kind of show. Tyra is also a great observer and knows how to give sound advice, differentiating herself from other models and hostess of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil, for example, Fernanda Motta is her hostess and her model "Once upon a time". She does not even have 1/10 of Tyra's professional skills, which keeps her on top. Tyra has a professional and personal knowledge of what she says and she is an excellent mentor because she not only criticizes but she points the wrong way and teaches the right way wisely. <br /> <br /> The series does not suffer big problems, it does and fulfills its promises during the cycles. The models chosen for the show are actually not the best unknown models of any country, because Tyra Banks bet with the difference, and she is right, because she (and a good part of her public) think that the moment has come for modeling world to change some parameters. During the cycles, she and her team really participate in the debates, during which the weakest go away and the most promising ones have new chances to prove their abilities, but they must be quick to do it, if not they lose it . <br /> <br /> Another very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows who should or should not win even when she is against people's opinion. She knows that whoever wins will be famous, but has very few opportunities to become a top model recognized worldwide. In the same way, she knows that the second place sometimes has more value than the first, because the 1st place wins the title, but the second place is not stigmatized. She hardly makes mistakes in deciding the future of a model during the show. <br /> <br /> After 9 cycles, the show is a little tired by some old ideas, it's time for Tyra to change some things and some lines because it gets boring and comparing the first few cycles, it's see she's bored too, so she has to do it if she wants the show to last a little longer. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, the show explores fashion. and the world of modeling, but it's also fun for those who live outside of it all. This gives the girls and the market an opportunity, and also gives good advice to those who have the same dream.
