"All Hazards Classes" is one of the best "gangster" movies that France has ever produced. A perfect cast: Lino Ventura, a young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who realized "a breath of fresh air", Godard's thing, the same year), Marcel Dalio and a beautiful support cast; brilliant scenario of Jose Giovanni - who also wrote "the hole" the masterpiece of Becker the same year! What a year for him! Beautiful black and white cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet. And a sustained action game under the direction of Claude Sautet, who surpasses Jean-Pierre Melville. While the latter films a film of gangsters with metaphysical pretensions, which sometimes lasts more than two hours, Claude Sautet stages men of flesh and blood, and the presence of the two children adds extra moments. poignant that Melville was never able to generate. And Sautet avoids the pathos, an excessive sentimentality: the last time that Ventura sees his children, going down on the metro is a source of emotion contained. <br /> <br /> Ventura portrays a gangster who thinks he can count on his old acquaintances, but they are all cowards - we are far from a virile friendship dear to Jacques Becker ("do not touch the grisbi") that Melville was to continue throughout his career. the sixties - sometimes encouraged by ugly women (misogyny film noir par excellence), living in a rotten microcosm, ready to inquire - we are far from the simplistic behavior of Jean Seberg in "the opus" of Godard - . <br /> <br /> Cloquet does wonders with the photo: the scene on the beach a night without stars when the two children see their mother die after the shooting with the customs is absolutely breathtaking. <br /> <br /> There is good use of the voiceover, which Sautet uses only when necessary; thus, the last lines make the end even stronger than if we had attended the scenes. <br /> <br /> Claude Sautet had found a good niche. He follows the "all-hazard classes" quite well with his "left-hand weapon" (1965) that features Once again, he used a deserted island and a ship. After that, France would have had a Howard Hawks. In his later works, only "Max and the Scrapers" (1971) showed something of this brilliance. He had become, from "the things of life", the director of quality cinema that focused on middle-class people with tender hearts in such works as "Cesar and Rosalie" (1972). , "Vincent Fran√ßois, Paul and the others" (1974) or "Mado" (1976)
