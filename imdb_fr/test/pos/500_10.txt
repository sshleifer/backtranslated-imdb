It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again without getting bored. This is by far one of the best comic book adaptations of all time. I liked this one even more than the X-men. In fact, this film is a kind of cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before one or the other. Wesley Snipes does a great job with Blade's character. He's just not a superhero without emotion. In addition, this film does not pretend to get a score of pg-13. Of course, comics are mainly for children, but I like a little more in my films. Let's face it, if we were in these situations, we would risk a storm to make it more realistic. This comic adaptation also has something that many do not do. A good fight in the end between the bad guy and the good guy. Let's face it, none of Batman's films had a very good final fight.
