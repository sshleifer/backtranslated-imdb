In general, I'm wary of movies hovering around the mark 6/10 on IMDb. I would like to think that people know what they are talking about and what they like. I guess the thing with criticism is to take an approach of "Hey, if I liked that kind of movies, would I give it a higher score than I'm about to give it?" now, because I do not like these types of movies "Again, people judge differently, basing their value more on acting, or perhaps story or staging. Anyway, landing here on the plane - I had already rented this movie and I had not had time to watch it, this morning I did it. <br /> <br /> Wow! See this film. I am personally interested in the paranormal / have read a bit about the imminent death experiences, so automatically I became addicted. I'm not sure some of the comments here said that a quality cast was wasted - I disagree - the cast of actors here was superb, I think it's the only time I did not do it Attention to Julia Roberts, it was good to see Kiefer Sutherland's 24 (currently at the time of this review, serving a DUI prison sentence), and Kevin Bacon with an interesting hair style. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked the direction, the atmosphere, the acting and the story, especially the idea of ​​karma, and to quote Nelson Wright, "All we do account". So true. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
