Hey, you're not alone! I remember Nichols! I was just 17 years old when it was. I remember James Garner was one of the coolest actors, and Nichols was such a big show. I could not believe it was such a short time, I wish I could remember the last episode, I probably did not see it ... there was no VCR at the time, so it was when you saw it, and if you missed an episode, it was gone forever unless it came back on the reruns of the summer Anyway, it would be nice if it came out on DVD, but I do not think many people know it. What a pity. <br /> <br /> A few years later, Garner won with Rockford Files, and he brought his mate Stuart Margolin from Nichols to play his team-mate Angel.
