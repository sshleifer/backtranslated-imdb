This film was unfortunately under-promoted but turned out to be really exceptional. When I entered the movie theater, I did not know anything about the movie, except for a friend who wanted to see him. <br /> <br /> I was caught off guard by the high quality of the film. I could not imagine Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance really represented his character. This film is exceptional and deserves our financial support, unlike so many other films. I do not recommend any movie, but in this case, I highly recommend everyone to see it. <br /> <br /> This movie is really exceptional!
