I'm not an American, but Meatballs always hit me a lot. Maybe because it's a sweet and cute film. Watching it again today made me sentimental for a time when I can not really put my finger on a place that I can not remember very well. <br /> <br /> Meatballs is simply a good movie. It reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and everything was possible. If you are reading this, you probably know what I mean. <br /> <br /> All I can say on top What I have already said is that Meatballs must be even more nostalgic if you are American. <br /> <br /> I guess you know what I mean by that too.
