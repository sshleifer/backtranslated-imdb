039: Anna Christie (1930) - published 21/02/1930; On October 24, 1929: Black Thursday, the stock market collapses. Now, the country and the world will turn to Hollywood to escape the Great Depression. <br /> <br /> BIRTHS: Anne Frank, June Carter, Yasser Arafat, Bob Newhart, Barbara Walters, Doris Roberts, Ed Asner, Dick Clark, Roy E. Disney, Gene Hackman. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Our odyssey finally resumes with the first sound film of Greta Garbo, a study of characters baptized Anna Christie. An excellent performance by Ms. Garbo, who immediately showed that her talents could stay silent (I wanted to see some of her work silent, but Netflix does not seem to store them, it's strange). One thing I've noticed many times is how the Swedish accent sounds, like replacing the letter J with a Y sound. Anna ended up being the only character I loved; I did not really care about his separated father or prospective suitor. Sound recording systems seem to be getting better (no one is bending to talk in the mysterious can), but the camera still does not move. We will make sure that changes as our odyssey continues. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Our first film of the 1930s is the first sound film of silent star Greta Garbo, Anna Christie. It's a very simple movie, with only about five different places where we spend long periods of the film's 89-minute duration, often with a static camera. It was great to see Marie Dressler in the sound as well, and quite hilarious as what we hear is an endless chain of sincere but drunken insults. I really liked the performance of Garbo, who supports the film even in the most difficult moments. I did not really like George Marion or George Marion, maybe because I had no sympathy for both of them. So I was relieved and excited when Anna finally defended her personality and showed them that she did not belong either. his separate father or muscular Irish boyfriend. It is also a pleasure to see that the famous silent screenwriter Frances Marion has not failed to pass from silence to sound. <br /> <br /> Last film viewed: Speedy (1928).
