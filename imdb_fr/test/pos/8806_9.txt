Human Traffic is a view of an average weekend for a group of friends. This is a flying view of their lives (and their minds) that will show you how this group of friends understand each other. There are many moments in which everyone can relate to each other, such as being out of one's head during parties and talking to strangers completely. The characters are all people you can understand and they are believable in the roles they play in the movie. The situations in which they find themselves are all situations in which we all found ourselves, and this is where this film succeeds. The topics related to sex and drugs are superbly treated so as not to interfere with the relationships between the characters. The story of the film is not everything, but it is not a criticism. It's a movie about people. It's a well written film, with a soundtrack to die for. DJ's Pete Tong has put together a great selection of tracks for this file, which makes it one of the best movies I've seen in 1999. After watching this movie, I felt like partying the weekend. Fantastic movie! Jo Brand as Voice of Reality - Should I Say More! <br /> <br />
