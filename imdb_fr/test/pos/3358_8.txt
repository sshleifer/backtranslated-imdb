I am an unconditional fan of the army of dads and nothing will change that. I have all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks and every time I watch / listen to them, it's all new. <br /> <br /> The movie. The film is a cover of some episodes, Man and the Hour, Enemy into the Gate, Battle School and many others with a different look. The introduction of a new general instead of Captain Square was a brilliant decision, especially when he did not cash the check (something that is rarely done nowadays). <br /> <br /> It follows from the first years of acquisition of equipment and uniforms, start-up and training. All in all, it's a great movie for a boring Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Two setbacks. One is the derogatory faux German accents (one, the Germans can not pronounce the letter "W" as we do) and the two The casting of Liz Frazer instead of the familiar Janet Davis. I like Liz in other films like reports, but she does not wear it properly and Janet Davis would have been the best choice.
