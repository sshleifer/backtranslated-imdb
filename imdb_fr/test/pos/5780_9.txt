I give this film 9 out of 10 only because there are not enough specific scientific references on the amount of energy needed to produce food in order to satisfy the enemies of science. mdixon seems to believe that the commentators, although biased, invent such things, but even a basic understanding of the resources and laws of thermodynamics would indicate that they are at least on sound scientific grounds when they say that one can not continue to depend. oil, we must switch to different types of energy and have no plan to replace the amount of energy we derive from oil. Other civilizations refused to face the facts of life and perished. Read "Collapse" by Jared Diamond, a popular book, or any basic textbook of ecology or earth sciences, and you can check out the basics of this film. Go ahead, play the violin while Rome burns!
