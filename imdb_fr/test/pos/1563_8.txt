I just saw this on the cable. I liked it. This caught my interest and the dramatic choices were good. The old couple was very good and good at being subtly scary. Cinematography is not terrible, but the shabby video also adds to the realism, so it's a compromise, you know? Sometimes the girl struck the accent of New England. The focus would be somehow coming and going. Anyway, I thought the movie was overall well done. The story was strong and dramatic tension prevailed because you felt there was a subtle mystery, even though things seemed trivial. Good job with a small budget. Another good filmmaker SUNY Purchase. Path to follow.
