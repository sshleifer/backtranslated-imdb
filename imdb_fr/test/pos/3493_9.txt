The Ali G show was really something extraordinary - he was a stupid amateur rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually a very smart guy, who claims to be stupid, to get really honest answers from people ... and it's very funny. So, I did not expect the film to be good, because everything was played - no real people or interviews. So, the base point of any show has been lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Of course it was stupid, but who cares if you can not stop safely with a car battery, as someone said? It was not supposed to be a realistic documentary ... And it's not like in the show, it's going in a totally different way, but that does not mean it's bad. When I finished watching, I was totally impressed, but now, when a certain amount of time has passed, I realized it was not that special, but it still deserves a nine - at least for what it's supposed to be.
