I had never realized how wonderful Lana Turner was before I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and was beautiful. What a pleasure to see her dancing with George Murphy. The scenario was typical of the day, but the dance was really special. I do not get tired of watching Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner in this movie was just as great. I always thought of Lana as an average actor who tended to play more often. She should have done more dancing and fewer roles of Maddam X and Peyton Place. I had a new appreciation for her after watching this movie and her wonderful dance. Too bad that "the Academy" does not give an "Oscar" to dance.
