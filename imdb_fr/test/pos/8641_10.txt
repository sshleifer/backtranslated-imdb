Spoiler Alert - although it is a plot almost as difficult to mess up as to explain completely. <br /> <br /> "Mulholland Drive" is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his TV series 'Twin Peaks'. As Lynch enthusiasts know, her style and vision are a unique blend of film noir, horror movies, surrealism and parapsychology. with a good dose of post-modern self-awareness and black humor cast for good measure. All these elements are at work in Mulholland Drive, making it a fascinating, breathtaking and very satisfying cinematic experience ?? especially if one does not become too obsessed with the idea of ​​making all the pieces of the plot fit into a logical and mysterious whole. <br /> <br /> The film features superb performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in different ways in a Hollywood setting mixing hallucination with contemporary reality, retro nostalgia 50s and satirical self-magnification. Their seemingly random initial encounter occurs after the film's opening scene, in which Harring's character escapes an assassination attempt through a car accident, not to mention horrible. Straddling the hillside of Mulholland Drive at Sunset Boulevard (the two most archetypal streets of Hollywood), she travels to the very apartment that Betty (Naomi Watts) is about to sublet at her " Aunt Ruth ", an allegedly successful actress who went to Canada to start a new film. As we will see later, Betty herself arrived from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest. <br /> <br /> An energetic and stylized flashback on the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame Betty's descent from innocence to starlette's brilliant eyes to stupid folly her despised lover and her role as an actress. Unable to remember his own name, the character of Harring adopts the name "Rita" from a movie poster for the film noir "Gilda" that adorns Aunt Ruth's apartment. (In fact, it turns out that Aunt Ruth has been dead for a long time and that her apartment is a good question to resolve during her next visits.) Anyway, Betty decides to help Rita discover what's has passed and to discover the source. silver scrolls and a mysterious blue key that women find in Rita's handbag. The two women begin to gather clues that could lead to Rita's true identity. By the way, they also become lovers, emitting at some point such incendiary chemistry that I do not remember his equal in the traditional treatment of lesbian problems (if a film of Lynch can be described as "general public" "). <br /> At local restaurant Winkies (a recurring place with a dreamlike meaning behind her thick, realistic façade), Rita's attention is drawn to a waitress's badge that says "Diane." This leads her to remember a lady named "Diane Selwyn", to whom the two women will soon visit and that, at the insistence of Betty, she burst. I will not reveal what they find inside, but let's just say that the scene is restored with the lynchian goosebumps of time. Thereafter, Rita wakes up in a sweat at night, speaks Spanish and takes Betty to a magic show / theater called "Silencio", where the arts of illusion and lip / instrument synchronization are practiced with a manic intensity and where the lady with blue hair, as she is mentioned in the closing credits, she reigns as president muse. Framed by the Silencio theater with blue lights and red curtains, the lady with blue hair occupies the last shot of the film, perhaps a symbol for the control of the artistic imagination ?? a bit like Steven's "man with a blue guitar" filtered by the surrealism of drugs. <br /> <br /> During Silencio's sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio's synchronous cameo for his own Spanish interpretation of Roy Orbison's Crying, a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own handbag for discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key of Rita's handbag. Even if we do not deepen the Freudian sexual symbolism of the stock exchanges, the moment is singularly Hitchcockian in the sense that the correspondence of the key and the box leads to a complete reversal of what we thought we knew and to a whole new set of rules. relationships of character and meanings. The discovery that Betty is a sought-after Diane Selwyn and Camilla Rhodes's despised lover (that is, Rita) is not the least of these setbacks. Camilla is in her turn a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to obtain and, more importantly, to which she is emotionally submissive. <br /> <br /> After these discoveries and others in the last third of the film, the problem of counting the first two thirds of the film is not solved as clearly as in "Vertigo". While fragments of images and dialogues suggest that much, if not all, of the previous material is projected and displaced from the inflamed subconscious of Diana herself, other fragments suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of Diana. a group of characters directly inspired by "Twin Peaks", including Michael J. Anderson, resuming his supernatural powers and a Bob-variant who hangs behind Winkies and who is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its associations iden- id. <br /> <br /> we assemble the pieces together, however, the set of "Mulholland Drive" is much bigger ?? and more mysterious ?? than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a journey that is wonderfully inventive, provocative and pleasantly disturbing. In addition, the cinematography of the film is breathtaking, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospheres, superb acting and masterful direction / editing. This is perhaps the best unrecognized picture of 2001 among the most important American releases.
