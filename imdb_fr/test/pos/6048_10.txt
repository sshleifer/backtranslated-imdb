By today's standards, the DI might seem a little hokey. Lee Emery's version is more accurate. I graduated from training camp in Parris Island, South Carolina, in 1964. Jim Moore is as close to reality as what you might see on screen in 1957. I can not comment on intrigue, but I thought the end was unrealistic for MCRD. PVT Owens is like many people who found themselves in a much more difficult situation than he had planned. Like so many others, he joined the Marine Corps for all the wrong reasons. My Intructors were more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. Much more. The DI is more Korean and Full Metal Jacket is more Vietnamese. Today's movies allow this kind of thing on the screen. I have DI in my collection. I only found it recently on DVD.
