Someone definitely has The Wind project and I can not believe that what I saw on the screen has a lot to do with that. It's a better and stronger film than most independents I watch throughout the year. Cinematography shows true love and mastery of the craft and the cast was perfect. I would love to see more of these people, especially Zeke Rippy. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story and scenario, I'm not sure that the negative comments that precede this article were written in order to inform Someone else about movie. The long unfortunate messages that took hours to compose and are the only comments left for any film on this site by the critic, are an obvious defamation directed against the producers of the film. I do not know the story from the inside, but it would probably make a good movie. What I know about this job is that productions that try to make everyone happy usually end up being awful. When the filmmaker has the courage, the will and the good sense to "kill babies", we always end up with hurt feelings. It's also part of the job and one of the best learning tools available to those who are really committed to film. Of course, chess has nothing better to do than stay home and write false reviews on the Internet as a form of vendetta against those who snubbed them (read: were honest and honest with them). And that's my best guess for the bad reviews. To the extent that there is a grain of truth behind everything, there is one point to make, but these exaggerations of the grains are so excessive that they are obviously fictitious. <br /> <br /> This is not a bloodshed slasher, if that's what you're looking for, it's more the thriller with psychological suspense, which is not generally appreciated by the lowest denominators common. The best way to see this film is to try to remove all the preconceived notions, to insert them and let them unfold - seriously, the characters are defined by their actions and their words and when you see what these people are doing and what they say, I do not think you can deduce that these characters were undeveloped. Maybe misunderstood. <br /> <br /> Overall, I agree that it's a well done and compelling film. I might not have given a 9 under normal circumstances, but the serious negative comments really attracted me to the picture (I have a secret love for the very bad cinema). For me, odds lower than 5 should be reserved for shlocky movies, incompetent, misinterpreted and stupidly written. None of this applies here - it's a quality film with real talent. I gave him the new one to tip the scales in the right direction. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
