I feel privileged to have seen this film by chance. In fact, I came across this film by accident. I was recording another movie on Showtime one night, and this movie started afterwards. So I sat down and watched and the boy was blown away. The acting is absolutely superb. Kathy Bates ... who is my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes has given an amazing performance as a domineering mother who desperately tries to keep her old school values ​​(religion, family) at risk of alienating her family. Martin Sheen is superb as a "hard" patriarch who really does not control his life or his family. What I really liked in this film is the way it tells what happens when the heroes come home. This shows the real damage suffered by our soldiers who engage in useless wars for political and financial gains. This film completely upset me and I feel lucky to have accidentally recorded this film and to have seen it. It's a must for anyone who wants a real drama, it's not too melodramatic and preached, but shoots your heart like no other
