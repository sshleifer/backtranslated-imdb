I loved this show. I think the first time I tried the ice cream rocky road was due to this show. Was not the store located on the beach or something? In fact, I wrote with Marci for several years. I lost contact and would like to be able to reconnect now to adulthood. Does anyone know where she is now? I wish they put it on DVD. I seriously doubt that since I think there may be five or six people who even remember the program originally broadcast. They do not do shows like that anymore, do they? I wonder if that would still be valid today. Do you know anyone who could burn DVDs from the show they recorded on VHS? I would be willing to pay (within reasonable limits).
