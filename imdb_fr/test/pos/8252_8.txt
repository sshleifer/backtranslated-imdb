I remember seeing this film in the mid-80s as a well-paced and well-played piece. I now work quite often at Berkeley Square and I had to get a copy of the DVD to remind me how much the area had changed little, although my office is nine to 30 seconds from the "bank". Even the Jack Barclays car dealer is still there to sell Bentleys and Rolls Royces. <br /> <br /> It looks like the DVD should come out soon in Region 2. Region 1 copy I is of very poor quality. Hope they cleaned it up. <br /> <br /> Only the slightly shady escape sequence of the court spoils what would otherwise be a good movie, but I guess that matches the caper tag that goes with it.
