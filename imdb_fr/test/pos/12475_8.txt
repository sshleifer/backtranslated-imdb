The ruthless mercenary Bruno Rivera (Paul Naschy in nasty form) betrays his pregnant partner / girlfriend Meiko (well played by Eiko Nagashima) to have exclusive privileges on a fortune in stolen diamonds. But Meiko manages to seriously hurt Bruno before he goes away. Bruno goes to the sumptuous chalet of Dr. Don Simon (a beautiful performance by Lautaro Murua). He also attracts the attention of Simon's two daughters: the flamboyant Monica (Silvia Aguiler) and the sweet Alicia (prettily tried by the charming Azucena Hernandez). However, Bruno quickly realizes that something is wrong with this isolated place and plans to escape as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, bitter Meiko tries to find Bruno to get revenge on him. Naschy, who wrote and directed as well as stars, concocts one of its strangest, most twisted and most evil horror vehicles in its history, with this oddity little seen. The quirky plot and the mysterious atmosphere become more and more strange and annoying as the story unfolds, eventually leading to a surprisingly surprising surprise ending. This film also enjoys occasional moments of graphic gore (beware of the memorable sequence with a poor devoured guy alive by vicious carnivorous pigs!), The thick cinematography of Alejandro Ulloa and a good dose of nudity and soft core sex. Roxana Dupre in the role of sassy maid Raquel, Pepe Ruiz in the role of playboy boyfriend Don Serafin and Julia Saly in the role of Teresa. A shocking pleasantly sinister and that is worth it.
