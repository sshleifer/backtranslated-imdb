The Frozen Limits is a big screen vehicle for artists known as The Crazy Gang. It was a group of British artists formed in the early 1930s. The main men of the group were Bud Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Naughton and Jimmy Gold. Very popular in the variety halls, the group was also the darling of the royal family of that time. The plot here sees them as the troop of Wonder Boys who went in search of their fortune in Alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper. The only problem is that when they finally arrive at Red Gulch, it turns out they are 40 years behind! <br /> <br /> I shudder often when I see the statement "it's very British" because it implies that the British Isles may have trouble getting it. It bothers me because, in the Internet / Internet era, I have gathered a host of non-British film lovers known to have divided their sides to the best of Ealing, Will Hay and the imperious Terry-Thomas. So, is it true that something like The Frozen Limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non-British audience? Yes, it's true, it's so British, but it must be said that classic movie buffs are very familiar with history, and that ultimately, the visual joy is universal. With the anarchic "step", the Wild West is an absolute winner. A winner who is likely to be more appreciated by an American public than by a British public. Not all comedies work and, in truth, the "Big Six" are largely dominated by a Moore Marriott flip-flop. But there are skits and parodies that deserve respect and a sign of approval from more illustrious comedy actors. It is unlikely that you will fall from your chair much as I did because of an Ovaltine gag, but if you are a big fan of comedy movies? In the worst case, I'm sure you'll recognize that there are some very talented people at work here. <br /> <br /> Now, do the gendarmes always receive their man? 8/10
