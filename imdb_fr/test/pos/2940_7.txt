This show is my guilty pleasure all the way !! When I first became interested in America's next Top Model, I was expecting to be bored and to find it very very stupid. I do not have this show is really serious fun. I read in one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be the top model of America. And that's the case! Who does not like the glamor and excitement of being a model? On ANTM, you see what it REALLY looks like. And who does not like to hear the girls contradict themselves and fight? Or love to want to throw something on this Janice lady? <br /> <br /> Give this a chance. Do not expect something intelligent or show that you can expect for a life lesson. Just enjoy it for what it is. Serious fun!
