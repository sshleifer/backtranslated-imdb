This is a movie that is much nicer than its rating of 7. In many ways, it looks like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS - with much of the excesses and leanness of VALLEY a little polite for the public of 1959. Like this last film, they are both about three young women who are making the fast track to success - although this time it is in the world of publishing rather than in the entertainment industry (although one of THE BEST OF TALLYTHING's ladies has Broadway aspirations). <br /> <br /> The film begins with Hope Lange entering the business for her first day of work. It has been entrusted to Joan Crawford, the boss of the tough guy, who plays his first supporting role in decades. Despite Crawford's ugly appearance, Lange is determined not to give in - to succeed in this job. And, over time, she quickly climbed the echelon from secretary to editor. At the same time, his two new roommates are also trying to climb the ladder: one on the stage and the other on a relationship with a rich playboy. As in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, they all have highs and lows (especially low), but at the end of the film, we can hope that at least some of them will succeed anyway. Although bruised and bruised. <br /> <br /> In this film, men are mainly pigs. The only guy who looks decent is played by Stephen Boyd, so naturally Hope Lange neglects him to never make a good ex-boyfriend. As for the characters of veteran actor Brian Ahern and the rest, they are sexist and ultimately you understand how Crawford has become so bitter and so mean. <br /> <br /> This movie has it all - adultery, pre-marital sex, abortion, etc. and is certainly not an artistic triumph. However, thanks to excellent production values ​​and a juicy scenario, this one is a pleasure to watch. Do not expect Shakespeare !!
