I have been very involved in the Hitchcock series lately. I'm still renting one of his movies when I'm in Blockbuster or Hollywood Video. As I said before, Hollywood is losing contact, I needed a reminder that there were great movies. Not to mention, I want to be a movie lover, not a movie buff. Is there a better way to do this than with Alfred Hitchcock's movies? <br /> <br /> The man who knew too much is another great and exciting thriller featuring Alfred's favorite favorite man, James Stuart, and the woman who steals the Dorris Day series. They play the roles of husband and wife who go on holiday with their son, but when a spy tells James information that could stop another, his son is kidnapped and kept in exchange for a ransom. James seems to just doubt Dorris and his ability to find his son, but it makes a comeback and eventually become the hero of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting game again, I would say that Dorris is the one who overshadowed the entire cast. James did a great job together, these two made you sit down and never move through the movie. I loved the little piece of comedy at the end that Alfred added. You will see what I mean. I always highly recommend this movie, even if it is not the best Hitchcock movie, it remains a treasure. <br /> <br /> 9/10
