Should we take the opening shot as a strange frame ??? I guess we have to. Anyway, two women are behind an umbrella that closes, they go up to the talent agency and we accompany them ... and then they will never be seen again. Okay, how come it's not INSIDE the place, on the piano, or even outside with the piano's SOUND, you're following inside and out , at the Hitchcock ??? So I suppose Clouzot already tells us in a not very subliminal way that we follow a segment of the post-war society: especially how he then uses a Citizen Kane song = cut into about five pieces to show to the singing lady traveling with talent the agency until his first roses and the applause of his debut in Vaudeville. <br /> <br /> Next, we watch relentlessly disgusting details more or less small of a country beaten out of his knees torn by the war. And no one has ever managed a little disgust better than Clouzot. In fact, pity he never tried Sartre's nausea. Almost everything we see after the first few minutes makes us a little nauseous. ... okay, okay, I'm blatantly exaggerating, let's just make a general impression of the movie. Look well, actually, and you'll even see one of the cops picking his nose. And in how many movies has anyone ever done that. Then, the main torch blows in front of the lesbian photographer and notices that she does not literally blink or raise an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> The interest of all this is an almost feverish immersion in the contiguity, apparently, until you can feel virtually every scene as well as see it and feel it. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the film, others here have them much more detailed than me. But forget the mystery: it's the ultimate McGuffin. Clouzot is about as interested in the real killer as these two women who arrive in the rain in the very first seconds of the film and are never seen again. From beginning to end, all he wanted to do was follow a group of people, even the most interesting ones, and say, look here at the bustle of this woman, the attachment of her pants in her insignificance, years and years ago. Tina Turner sang we do not need another hero. <br /> <br /> Even the forced lightness of the end is sadly in a dilapidated neighborhood of Paris and in an apartment with bare walls and cold. Only couples have fun to flourish, as if to say there must be two or three million people like you all over the city, working every day for a little love at night. <br /> <br /> From there, it was just a small step towards Wages of Fear and ultimate despair. <br /> <br /> They do not even know how to make movies like this one in the United States. In fact, they did not even know how to do it in France, let alone now. The implacable detail of the gesture makes even the neorealists of Italy look like bad psychologists. Which makes Clouzot a species of Rosselini in speed. <br /> <br /> Nonsense very nice, this movie. The only flaw, it seems to me, and as another viewer pointed out, the main woman is not quite right. Everyone in the movie is pretty much casting.
