Young boy from Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper. Later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he drew cartoon characters on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, in collaboration with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that offered animated commercials and tiny cartoons to local movie theaters. Always innovative, his series ALICE IN CARTOONLAND innovated by placing a living figure in a world of cartoons. In 1923, Disney and Iwerks returned to Hollywood, where Roy, Walt's older brother, became his business leader and advisor throughout his life. When the distributor wins a series of hits with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit, the character of Mickey Mouse enters Walt's imagination, thus ensuring the immortality of Disney. STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), Mickey's first appearance on screens, was a resounding success with the public thanks to his synchronized music. The SYLLHONIES OF SILLY soon appeared and the growing team of talented animators conquered quickly a new territory full of color, deep illusions and radical progress in the development of personality, an area in which the genius of Walt was unbeatable. Mickey's fiery and mean behavior had captured millions of fans, but other animated companions would soon join him: Donald Duck, the spooky temperament, the funny Goofy and the energetic Pluto. All of this was preparing for Walt's greatest dream: animated feature films. Walt persevered and delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi and Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that all his fortunes were started by a mouse, or that the childish simplicity of the message and his hard work always bear fruit.
