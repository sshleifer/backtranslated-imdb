This is definitely one of the classics of the ultimate cult, not to be missed for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything that a good 70s movie should have. On-the-fly dialogue, misbehavior, enthusiasm, sex, speech, political disadvantage, violence and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must. <br /> <br /> As with many of these films, the plot has little meaning. What I deduced from it is that Dolemite, a pimp hunter, was charged with stealing furs and drugs worth half a million dollars. While working, Willie Green (the same man who framed him), his nemesis, grabbed his nightclub. However, the friendly guardian (the only white character in the movie who is not completely demonic or incompetent) decides to release him to stop the demonic Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Fortunately, he knows kung-fu, as do about 50 to 75% of the characters in this movie. And luckily again, while he was locked up, Mrs. Queen Bee sent all her "hoes" to the kung-fu school. With this army of kung fu on his side fighting "hoes" (his words, not mine), he plans to resume the disco of Willie Green. However, two racist white policemen are again trying to beat him up and send him back to prison. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, do not try to follow the plot. I have seen this film about five times and many elements seem to have nothing to do with anything else. Support characters come in and out of the movie. I'm still trying to figure out what's going on between Reverend Gibbs, Mayor and Hamburger Pimp. Who cares? The scenes with these characters are all priceless. As for the dialogue, its horrible with the delivery even worse. Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, so I start to wonder if this movie was supposed to be a parody or a serious action movie. It seems he can not decide which one. Lines such as "Yeah, I'm so bad, I break my ass twice a day" call for further investigation. Anyway, the movie is hilarious and the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese factory. One of the hilarious elements is one of the most sober uses of sex and nudity in movies. Actors you would never want to see naked undress (including the Mayor and Queen Bee). Not to mention the fact that the micro boom seems to appear in all other scenes. <br /> <br /> Above all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to have a good time and is certainly charismatic. His musicals have had a considerable influence on the current gangsta rap, especially with Dr. Dre who sampled it on his groundbreaking 1992 album, "The Chronic". Technically as inept as the film is, he is culturally influential. More importantly, it's a good time. The biggest crime that an exploitation film can commit is boring, and this despite all its faults is fast paced and fun. In other words, if you like this kind of movie, you'll love "Dolemite". If you do not dig it, you're a "blockade"! (7/10)
