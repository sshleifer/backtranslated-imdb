Mel Brooks really outdid herself with this hilarious staging of Robin Hood's story. The cast is perfect and Cary Elwes does a good job in his role. In my personal opinion (aside from the fact that I'm a fan of Cary Elwes), this movie is the best and the funniest I've ever seen! It will make you laugh every time you see it!
