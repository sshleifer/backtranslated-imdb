I own the miniseries on DVD because I like this story so much. It is one of the best surviving pieces of civil war I've ever seen and tells a story of friendship divided by war. The costumes are great, the stories are great, I like the way the story jumps from one character to another to let you guess what will happen in their life There is a great balance between good and bad. the evil. In my opinion, some evil characters are too beautiful not to be watched. Whenever something more despicable than the last happens, I curse the TV as if they could hear me. I love the fact that this miniseries gives me the feeling of being involved in its drama. However, I would advise NOT to watch the third movie in the DVD series. This is a disappointment compared to the first two movies and most of the original characters do not come back. I do not want to remember the end of the third film, I prefer to live with the thoughts of the end of the second film. It makes me happy.
