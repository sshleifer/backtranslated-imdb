As a Canadian, I did not know much about the Whitlam dismissal. I had read the Wikipedia page about these events, but that was about it. Earlier this year, when Canada went through a potential constitutional crisis (fortunately failed) that may have led to an intervention by our governor general, the dismissal of Whitlam was mentioned in the press. In an effort to find out more, I ordered the DVD of this mini-series on EBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed by the interest of the story. As dramatic as the events were, it could have been a very boring political drama. However, it was a suspenseful mini-series. I was also impressed by his comprehensibility, despite my lack of familiarity with Australian politics. It did not take long to determine who everyone was and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> That said, it's not a completely unbiased story. Malcolm Fraser is certainly described as a rather Machiavellian figure, who does not let anyone or thing interfere with his quest for the post of prime minister. Gough Whitlam is represented under a nobler, almost holy light. However, the actor portraying Whitlam channels the nobility so that it looks more like pomposity. I thought Sir John Kerr had been portrayed quite nicely. <br /> <br /> I must warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. I understand that this was done for television in the early 1980s, but it seems that no effort has been made to restore the quality of the picture or sound. It was very disappointing that no extras were added either. A documentary, even interviews with historical personalities, would have enriched the experience, but nothing is found. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this mini-series to anyone interested in real events.
