This film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of Roma communities woven together by music. It's really a musician's film, because of the lack of spoken dialogue - and what dialogue there is, is not important to the structure of the story. Some might expect a narrative of "customs, clothing and music" from National Geographic or a storyline about some central characters - do not look for it here. <br /> <br /> This is because he paints a portrait of a family of peoples, rather than telling a story of individuals. The plot is history through space (from India to Andalusia) and / or time (we can not tell) from a people. There is no need for narration. You have the feeling of a happy people, closely linked to small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great feeling of sadness in places, as a result of their rejection by society in general. <br /> <br /> It is therefore a paean to the Roma culture, very beautiful filmed, with a wide spectrum of Roma music, and a sting in the tail that is the oppression to which these people have been confronted and are always confronted.
