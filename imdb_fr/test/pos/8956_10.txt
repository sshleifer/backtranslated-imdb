I saw this film for the first time at the Istanbul Film Festival in 1994. It was so good that I took some friends with me and went to see him again the same week. The characters are very well played and the humor here and there is amazing. It's a very powerful gay movie. Some scenes give you the impression of watching an episode of Friends with much more sophisticated lines. I guess I'll put it in my VCR and watch it again tonight ...
