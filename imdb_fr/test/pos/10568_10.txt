The chemistry between Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy was incredible. They were quite convincing and really nice in their roles. Imelda Staunton played brilliantly with Ms. Sucksby's complicity. Despite the fact that she was a despicable opportunist, she still managed to make you sympathize with her in the end. Rupert Evans played the slime-ball gentleman with charm and snark. He was a stage thief. The story itself was very unique, as was the way it was told. The Victorian English decor with two main lesbian characters was intriguing and delightful. There were some fantastic and unexpected twists that really caught the public's attention in the story. A magnificent cast and an excellent story made this film superb.
