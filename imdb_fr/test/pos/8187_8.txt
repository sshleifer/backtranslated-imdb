I really liked the film, especially the interpretation of the beautiful Gong Li as a concubine. <br /> <br /> It was a little distracting, however, to have a Chinese dialogue PLUS subtitles in English PLUS a voiceover to the American accent, even though the voiceover was very well synchronized. <br /> <br /> The name of Qin shi huiang di (The first emperor of Qin) was Zheng, and his name was Yiong, so he should have been mentioned in English. as "king Zheng" or "emperor Zheng", and NOT as "king Ying Zheng" as at that time, the two surnames / first names were not used together. <br /> <br /> The state of Qin is pronounced "Chin" "not" shin "- a pity that the researchers did not understand well. <br /> <br /> I forgave it, but I was dismayed at the end when the commentary announced that he had been buried at "Zai-an" with his terracotta warriors.The city of Xi'an pronounced "See-an", never "Zai- an "- the American voice-overs would surely have been right!
