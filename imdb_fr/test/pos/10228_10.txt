I'd like to see links between NightBreed, The Fury and the X-Men series, much like the second Outer Limit series would connect stories and intrigue after the fact, to create a story. Bow although we never had the intention. I would also like to know if there is any other information, anecdotal or otherwise, about the relationship and / or collaboration between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I just can not believe that David Cronenberg appeared as a simple actor in a Clive Barker movie. Is there any additional information on the subject? Finally, 17 years have passed since the release of the film and I had hoped that there would have been a sequel. Does anyone know if there are any projects under development that have never materialized, or if, in fact, there are still projects going on?
