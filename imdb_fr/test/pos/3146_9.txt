In the world of "short films" (most of which are not), this film is a jewel. <br /> <br /> A silent and concise overview of the world of a young woman reading for a blind woman, here star star Elizabeth Franz - this film carries textures, layers and visual narratives of a nature dead sumptuously painted. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is minimal, the cinematography is stunning and the direction is clear, clear and convincing. I saw this film in a movie festival held in a noisy and crowded Tribeca bar - and in the first two minutes (and for the first time that night), the crowd fell silent. <br /> <br /> That says it all. .
