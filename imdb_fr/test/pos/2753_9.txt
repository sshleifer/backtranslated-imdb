The show is great. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Amazing dance. Publishers could not spoil it, not because they were not * that * bad *, but because the series is really * so * good *. <br /> <br /> Publishers are compulsive cutters, we do not see an unbroken scene for more than 15 seconds. It's good to show different angles, but these guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they'll remind you how many cameras they have on average every five seconds ... They manage to film the beginning a jump with a camera, then cut it in the middle and display the rest from another angle. <br /> <br /> Even if they have tried, they can not ruin this fantastic show. It is a must for dance and music lovers.
