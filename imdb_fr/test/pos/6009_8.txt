We all know fragments of Gulliver's journey. Little people, yes, of course. Lilliputians. Giants too, some of us can remember. Some might remember that the word yahoo comes from here. This is the case for most people. <br /> <br /> Swift's book is ubiquitous in school libraries. This is the first time I have read it and many people have read it for the last time. Like many old adventure books, it is written lightly. The children can read it. Yet he dribbles with satire, black and uncompromising. This is something most screenwriters forget to forget when adapting this movie. <br /> <br /> This film remembers it however. Our hero, Ted Danson, gives a credible and serious performance as a man adjusted to the world that has been thrown into mysterious countries like ours. Gulliver's travels criticize everything. Theists, scientists, government, people, ethnicity, humanity itself. Few people are spared and most satires are still fresh. <br /> <br /> Although very true to the story, the film also dares to add new angles, all of which work very well. The screenwriter deserves all the credit for having managed to balance time and activity so well (it's not boring). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​go far beyond a television film. With a little marketing, this film would have worked well at the box office. All the fantastic worlds that Gulliver visits are well done, explained in detail and often very entertaining, much like Swift's book. <br /> <br /> The actors are all pros, since it is a British production. Mary Steenburgen stands out alongside Dr. Bates of James Fox, this terribly cruel doctor who, like Nurse Ratched, wants only the best of the patient. <br /> <br /> This is a modest proposal, if you ever have the chance. to get this movie, do it. It's a real treat.
