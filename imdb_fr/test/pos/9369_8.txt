Crossfire remains one of the best movies with a Hollywood message because, unlike Gentleman's Agreement, whose admirable will has not been beaten, he chooses to send his message in the form of an excellent black thriller rather than constantly an outraged star say "It's because I'm Jewish, is not it?" It's much easier to make it clear that hate looks like a loaded weapon when corpses are real rather than metaphorical. Somewhat shamefully, the short functionality of the Warner DVD does not mention the fact that the novelist Richard Brooks has disavowed the film because of the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-Semitic murder, but it is interesting to note that if the victim is killed mainly is Jewish, there is little doubt in the performance of Sam Levene that the character is actually also gay ?? It's not a choppy caricature, but his scenes with George Cooper's confused soldier have two facets. The murderer does not have much of a mystery: even if the murder takes place in classic black shadows, the body language of the murderer is immediately recognizable, but the characters in the film are drawn to the same conclusion before halfway through. : the tension comes from the fact that we proved it and saved the guy from the fall. <br /> <br /> The band of soldiers who have come together to try to solve the problem of their accomplice is an element of Ealing Films. a plan for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is purely black RKO. Established on a long sultry night, the movie has a great look filled with dark and dark shadows born as much economy as style (it reduces the lighting time and gives the director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with them. actors) and high-quality actors make the most of the script: a casual but discreetly charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young's Maigret-type detective, Gloria Grahame's tramp, and the frightening Paul Kelly as his compulsive liar admirer, a guy trying to tell stories of other people trying on ties. But the lasting impression lies in the excellent performance of Robert Ryan, who could leave alone, while doing his best to help the man wrongly accused on death row. A big surprise in 1946, as a reward, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found themselves under investigation by HUAC, which itself had a notable tendency to target Jews. So much for the crusade?
