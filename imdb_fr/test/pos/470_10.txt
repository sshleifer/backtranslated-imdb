This film is engaging and complex while maintaining simple beauty. Our two characters unite to share the basis of curiosity and loneliness, but it is a stepping stone to learning about these people, their lifestyles and their past. The two main actors (Bohl, Brundruge) were in the moment like none of the two actors I've ever seen. 100% credible, they transport the public seemingly without effort, in their world. The actors' flawless acting, combined with Bechard's beautiful and realistic dialogue, and his true direction propels the story into a striking and touching finale. This film is a visual treatment that increases the intensity of the story. The soundtrack serenates the viewer, soothing while pulling the emotional content of the film. I think this project is nothing more than a masterpiece. intriguant.intense.
