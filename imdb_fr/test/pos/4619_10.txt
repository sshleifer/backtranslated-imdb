I saw this film in preview tonight and it was fantastic. It presents the problems faced by the average high school student. <br /> <br /> I left the film, stunned, saddened and grateful that this film has the opportunity to raise awareness of these issues (bullying, rape, suicide, suicide). It's a fantastic Australian movie. <br /> <br /> Go see him. <br /> <br /> Support him. <br /> <br /> Learn it.
