I totally agree with the comment left by "coldshitaction" and how this film is a masterpiece. I've never seen an adrenaline-flowing movie like this movie does, and that's what happened when Bronson came out of an emergency exit with some sort of M-60 and he's like a man, he's a genius. Probably the best action movie ever made (no exaggeration either), it's really the best action movie ever made. From the beginning, know that you are caught off guard when the police let Bronson go tell him to clean up the slum. Once again, genius. And again, Bronson is a bad ass. Paul Kersey is just as cool, maybe even cooler than John McClain or the Terminator, he's just a bad ass. And what's great is that he's a good guy and buys ice cream for a kid and helps an older couple before he kills a bag. genius. Highly recommended, if you hate this movie, you are crazy.
