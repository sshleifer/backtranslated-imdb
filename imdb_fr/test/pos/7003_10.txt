As a fan of zombies, I really like these types of plots in which people find themselves in strange places surrounded by evil monsters! PB is also an excellent link with Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang must run as fast as possible, away from darkness. There are so many metaphors in the story! Riddick is that bad guy, but he's also the hero trying to save people at a slow pace. The Imam Muslim relies on the positions of the sun for prayer five times a day, but he is stuck in a country where darkness reigns. Overall, I recommend this movie to all science fiction fans. You will not be disappointed.
