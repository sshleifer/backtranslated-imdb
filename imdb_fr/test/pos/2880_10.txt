The problem with other actors portrayed in the role of Dorian Gray is that they seemed too old for the role (Hurd Hatfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher, Ben Barnes) or that they were unable to to get rid of the aristocratic English way. without being on stilts. Dorian is the 19-year-old (roughly), milky-skinned, honey-eyed young man described by Wilde. The challenge is to find an actor who has the maturity and the range of the piece (ie naivity, hardness and manipulation), but at the same time, looks like someone in his end. 'adolescence. And Peter Firth succeeds in this great adaptation to British television. <br /> <br /> Gielgud in the role of Henry Wotton, although he is considerably older than Wilde had in mind, works wonders with his scenes - Wilde's aphorisms never sounded so natural and not forced. Especially George Sanders in the 1945 version was rather weak in comparison (and his suit was not suitable). <br /> <br /> Finally, Jeremy Bratt plays Basil as the most masculine and the most gay of the trio, again an appropriate interpretation. In general, the film contains enough homosexual subtitles without making Dorian himself gay - he's all for everyone and there would be no sexual or drug-related perversion he did not try at the time. 18 years covered by history, but it makes him more narcotic. than homosexual. It also seems to cause havoc among men and women, as it should, according to the novel. <br /> <br /> Of course, the budget of this production was not very important, so everything seems a little scenic. In particular, Dorian's encounter with Sybil's brother suffers from an obvious studio look. In addition, Dorian's last shot (a puppet, I guess) in a toad-like white make-up is more hilarious than convincing and Basil's scene of death is inadvertently funny. (Also, as far as I know, Basile should have been killed sitting at the table.) <br /> <br /> But overall, it's a very useful adaptation. I'm sure Wilde would have liked it. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so many sex scenes, but Wilde's decadent world of scented flowers, sumptuous sheets and precious gems is not really explored here, that is to say that aesthetics is completely lacking. But like "I, Claudius", the excellent acting makes it easy to forget these shortcomings of production values.
