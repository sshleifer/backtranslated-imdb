May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie. Many stupid good things to laugh at. However, do not watch the TV version, they cut a lot. Dom Deluise is pretty good as a Mafia Don who is hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes is a long drive from Jersey. Also, you must love them by checking the script to make sure that Robin will have another chance. Also: 12th Century Fox. <br /> <br /> Problems? The rappers at the beginning and end seem rather old-fashioned. The songs were rather lame. Once while watching this movie, I could think a few more times when they could have started another joke or joke. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, a pleasant cinematic experience. A must for comedy fans.
