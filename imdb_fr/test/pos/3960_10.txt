Let me clarify that. It's not a "good film", but I'm so happy he's there, I'm so happy to have seen him, and for the part he's playing in my DVD collection, it's is sublime. This is the ultimate universe of PG-13. It's our university, as we imagine when we're new to high school. It must so suspend the disbelief that it could as well be held on Mars. It's so healthy that even when he tries to be dirty, it will not make your grandmother uncomfortable. Looking at it requires so little sophistication (in fact, thinking too much about what's going on will hinder your appreciation of this work), it makes me feel like I'm 12 years old again. And this kind of experience is worth more than $ 9.99.
