I gave this show a chance thanks to Jaleel White, not to his Urkel character, but mainly to the XD voice of Sonic the Hedgehog. In any case, as I said, I gave him a chance and I loved him a lot. I never cared about the character of Urkel, so I was delighted to see Mr. White play a role other than that of the nerd, always annoying. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (who was first called Calvin, but the second episode, everyone called him "J") was very entertaining and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was when J went out with the ex-cowboy cheerleader with the snobbish kid. ("Do not talk like that about my mother!" "It's an adult speech, you stay there!") The only ox I have is that the series was supposed to have 3 main characters, but Mr. White's character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two (who are married) still had the stories back ... This is not really a good thing when a story about these two women possibly pregnant takes the place of J. keep the dog of his girlfriend ..... <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I would like this show to last a little longer. Unfortunately, it seems that people were not interested in Jaleel White as anything else that the boring moron of God-Awful known as Urkel .... <br /> <br /> I at least hope to put it as a DVD box together.
