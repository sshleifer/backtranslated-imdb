If all films were to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice should be. It is a monument in the history of cinema. Much criticized for his slowness, boredom and overly obvious sense (an old man discovers the beauty of a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should enjoy this film for what it is . 'Morte a Venezia' was filmed 30 years ago and represents an even more distant period at the beginning of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Life was so slow, compared to now. People were supposed to behave in a certain way, hiding even their real emotions. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the lead actor, are admirably successful in showing how the aging composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, it should have been a shock too powerful to be accepted. We see his inner battle, mainly on Bogarde's face, against the beautiful landscape of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music composed by Gustav Mahler. <br /> <br /> This film is slow, we can not deny it. No special effects, car chases or fighting to keep the audience stuck on its seats. No sex scenes either; the interaction between the man and the boy is limited to stolen glances and an occasional smile. <br /> <br /> So, basically, there is not much going on in this movie? Not if you want your senses to be hit like a low drum. If you want them to be played as the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto, it's the movie to do it.
