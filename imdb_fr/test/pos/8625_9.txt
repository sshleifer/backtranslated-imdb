About 12 minutes after the beginning of the song, in the scene where Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr kiss for the first time, there is a very nice song playing ... what is this song? And by whom does he sing? It's a song that looks very romantic and it's a singer, a piano, etc. I have tried everything in the world to search for music on Google and iTunes, etc., but it just does not come, even on the lyrics sites. So, if you hear it, I'd love to know enough to try to get the CD with this song or find it on iTunes. I do not know if my email address will be pulblish, I'm new to this area ... but I'll be back here.
