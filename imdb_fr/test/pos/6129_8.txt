Like those who listened to radio reports about the Pearl Harbor attack, anyone who has ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it - and some thirty years later late, the film is still one of the most indescribable. vile, obnoxious, disgusting and hilariously funny movies never put on celluloid, guaranteeing to test the most robust stomachs and funny and funny bones. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a budget close to zero and one of the most disappointing cinematography PINK FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families fighting over the tabloid title of "The Filthiest People Alive". How dirty can they be? Many: the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable demonstration of rectal control to a portion of doggie doo, and I guarantee you that you will not want to eat egg for several weeks at least see it. <br /> <br /> The casting is either wonderful, atrocious, or terribly wonderful, it depends on how you look at it. The star, of course, is Divine ... and describing Divine as the BIGGEST drag queen on the planet would be the least we can say of the year. She is a mammoth creature adept of eye makeup, orange hair, and BIG expressions - she is the Charleton Heston of the flirting, and if she runs almost a jog, stops to go to the bathroom on the front lawn, or surprising real-life shoppers while strolling along the Baltimore sidewalk, she's both indescribable and unspeakably funny. Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills and the still dreadful Edith Massey, members of the Divine family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as a couple of sellers of babies enslaving whites who challenge the status of Divine. <br /> <br /> It should be clear that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a film that will please everyone, and viewers who only know the director John Waters through subsequent films such as HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will be in a major impasse. But if you want to see something completely different and even Monty Python can not imagine, here's the movie for you. Just be sure to eat before you see it, as you probably will not want to eat later - and you may want to keep a bag of barges handy just in case. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
