Among so many excellent and so on in Nevskiy, a particularly compact * zing * tickled me so hard that it's the highlight of the movie for me. <br /> <br /> Or at least one that tends to push harassing people to see the film, brandishing the record in hand to accentuate. <br /> <br /> The vague existing abstract recognition of the simple and concrete guilt involved in the guilty pleasure of this can really freeze and push me to pay the intellectual bill afterwards. <br /> <br /> Until then .. <br /> <br /> The disappearance of the organist was so right.
