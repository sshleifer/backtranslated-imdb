I liked this movie, it could have been so much better. I was expecting more action than I had ... which was more of a comedy than anything else. Admittedly, it was serious in places and there was a good fight scene here and there, most of the time, it was more about romance and comedy, with action and no horror. Which is hard to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his partner and must train another, his sister is going through a difficult break, but she is pursued by a vampire of all things. Admittedly, this vampire is rather nice and does not fear the blood. So that's all there is to it, except for another vampire's plot after some royal vampires so he can get the ultimate power. Some of the problems of this movie are that its plot goes here and there and that the movie had a very uneven flow, that it seemed to change the genres a little too. One minute of action, the next pure comedy. However, the girls were cute, there was action, the comedy was worthy of a laugh or two and Jackie Chan looks pretty energetic or two. This film probably just needs more development in some areas, like the villain who is not really explored at all. So, for a movie with some good fights and a chuckle or two, it's pretty good ... but why was it rated R? I saw that the PG-13 we created is much worse than that.
