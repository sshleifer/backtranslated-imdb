I first saw this film two years ago at the movies and fell in love with the dark story of two teenage sisters who are burrowing at home in their big country house with their father and mother-in-law. Their relationship with their mother-in-law is at least tense, as the mother-in-law seems to be more and more unstable in her battles with the youngest girls. The film features ghost and horror effects in oriental style, which adds a strange and disturbing aspect to the story. At first, it is unclear, but it is all the more intriguing. <br /> <br /> Management is incredibly good. , and the acting is beautiful, with the mother-in-law particularly incredibly good rocking from one mood style to another in the movie. The big house adds to the mystery and there are enough points in the movie where you will jump from your seat. This film clearly shows me why Korean cinema is probably the most original in the world at the moment. Unfortunately, the Western world has nothing like it in Western countries, and I can really see it influencing filmmakers around the world over the next decade. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended in my opinion, a real joy and fear
