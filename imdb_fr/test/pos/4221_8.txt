This is the funniest sequel I've seen in a long time. It's a lot funnier than the other three and not a bit scary. There are very bloody pieces in the movie, but not enough to make you sick. In this one, he has a doll companion, hence his name. If you liked the first three then you'll love it, go watch it!
