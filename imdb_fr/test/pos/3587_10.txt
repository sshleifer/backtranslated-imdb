The Blue Planet series is without a doubt one of the greatest documentaries ever made on the ocean. For five years, the filmmakers worked tirelessly on the series, obtaining sequences that have never been viewed (ie in the title The Deep.) <br /> <br /> I recommend to watch this series. Seeing the fisherman fishing outside of the small pictures shown in textbooks is really a treat, but only a needle in the vast haystack of the sea covered by the Blue Planet. From the ocean to the tidal pools, through the coral seas and the darkest part of the ocean, the BBC takes the viewer on an almost magical journey across the ocean. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that one of my first dreams was to be a marine biologist. After seeing this series, it has been revived. I've been studying the oceans of this world for years and have seen countless documentaries about coral reefs and dolphins, whales and crustaceans. But overall, no one has managed to capture life under the waves as well as this group of people. <br /> <br /> Look at the "Blue Planet" series in its entirety, I promise you you will not regret it.
