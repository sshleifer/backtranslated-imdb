Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matter how many times you watch the same thing, the series is never monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest humorists in the world who does not even need to talk to make people laugh. His gestures, facial expressions and face are so funny to watch. The situations he faces in the series are simply hilarious and his way of managing them is even greater. There is simply no reason for this show not to receive 10 because it is fabulous. It's something that would make even the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. Some of my favorite episodes of the series are: 1) When Mr. Bean is staying in a hotel 2) The one where he is watching the horror movie 3) Watch out for the baby (The diaper scene in particular) In fact, all episodes are so good that it is really hard to criticize the series. Mr.Bean can go anywhere to prove that he's funny, including completely undressing in one of the episodes. the way he handled this situation was simply breathtaking. 10 of 10.
