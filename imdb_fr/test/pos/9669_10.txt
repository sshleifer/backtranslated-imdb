Ignore the comment before mine. The show is a comic genius, the most underrated show of all time. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, the flashbacks are hilarious, who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story, they make me laugh so much that it hurts and is not it the idea of ​​a good humorous program? People who think it's not funny just do not have a sense of humor. Who cares if they are random, it's a TV show that you can do what you want and people say that it's not realistic, any more than a cartoon, it's animated. Reason 2, the jokes are usually hilarious, Seth McFarlane and the other writers are so funny, everything, references to Star Wars to make fun of celebrities, I love them all. And Reason 3, the scenarios are just brilliant and fun, they prepared all the jokes with their wild nature and their delirium, even more funny. <br /> <br /> I took it late at night on BBC2 I never went back, I have the 7 seasons, plus the kind of movie thing (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), I have several t-shirts, posters and my collection continues to grow. I have never had a collection of TV shows before, but it was so funny that I had to have everything. <br /> <br /> Watch season 3 with confidence and trust me, you'll be hooked for life, the funniest show ever created and I hope it never ends!
