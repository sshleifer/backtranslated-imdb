The hunters' war on everything. 5 words that I like to watch. Hunter's War is an excellent Australian comedy. As their name suggests, they are at war with everything. They mostly seem to like to hit the polish. <br /> <br /> The Chaser is one of the best comedies I have ever seen and is at the top of the list in Australia. It is on the Australian Broadcasting Corparation (ABC) that are some of the best comedies. <br /> <br /> He won the Australian Film Industry (AFI) awards but did not win the best comedy of the Logies. <br /> <br /> Last year (2006), the channel aired on ABC on Friday night, when everyone was out so no one could watch it. Well, they were transferred Wednesday night at 9 pm (a much better time range) and the best thing to do is if I miss an episode or if I just want to see it again, I can download it from www .ABC.net.au / chaser.
