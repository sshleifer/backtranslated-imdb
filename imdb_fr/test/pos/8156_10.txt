It's a beautiful full movie. A moving experience filled with real emotions. There are lessons to be learned here about love, sex, work, religion and American culture, regardless of sexual preference. <br /> <br /> This film is also a scathing accusation against Mormon belief (church of Latter-day Saints) system, any conservative faith could easily take its place. But it is a little ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the Mormons in no uncertain terms. Here is a faith that for generations has forced believers to practice polygamy! And these true believers only abandoned this practice because the federal government had forced them to do so for Utah to join the Union. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scenes presented in the unclassified version are tasteful and surprisingly brief. Nothing in this film would offend those who are open-minded. <br /> <br /> The story of this film is so obvious, it is that homosexuality is perfectly natural for homosexuals, as well as heterosexuality, for heterosexuals! Although love and sex are obviously very different needs, it's absolutely beautiful, beyond words, when both occur at the same time between two adults! A deep erotic love is one of the most precious gifts of life! Congratulations to the filmmakers for a job well done!
