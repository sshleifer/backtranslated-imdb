Todd Sheets is back with another entertaining and terribly entertaining clunker, which is just awesome, but which is actually a weak excuse for skinning as much bloodshed as bright guts. An evil demoniac scarecrow resurrects the dead as voracious and sprawling zombies to feast on the living. A bunch of schoolboys bickering, a trio of escaped convicts led by the evil Slade (Byron Nichodemus harassing him to a scandalous degree), two equally wild sleazeball thugs and a trio of sisters hotties must do their best to survive this heartbreaking trial. That's all for the unnecessarily confused and complicated conspiracy, but fortunately, this hilarious and horrible lack of guts lacks narrative coherence (abundance) that it more than compensates for by a plethora of pleasingly gloriously gross gore. Disgusting moments include a woman who had her fingers cut off, a deadly shot in the groin of a young child, an attempt at necrophilic rape, evisceration and, of course, a more repulsive consumerism. intestines than to shake a pile of wet intestines. In addition, we also have a rough and grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between ramshackle scenes and black-and-white combat scenes, inapplicable, ugly staging of a uniformly pathetic unnamed cast (Jerry Angell, in particular, head-to-head flute, dishonorable for his ridiculous abysmal absurdities such as the psycho-criminal criminal besides Joe Bob), a thrash metal soundtrack that smashed his head, and a generic shivery'n'ominous synthesizer score. Let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which many of our survivors fall on a few flasks of flesh-eating bacteria to use on the hordes of the undead. Of course, this movie is a pure dreck, but it has some absolutely abominable quality that makes it in turn a lot of Grade Z fun so horrible, it's awesome for hardcore hardcore fans.
