I was very impressed by Mick Molloy's latest production. As a fan, I was used to a kind of humor different from the one presented here. He wisely chose a more subtle and broader form of comedy in Crackerjack, rather than his usual wanderings. It is sometimes inconsistent and uneven, but a decent script solves the problem and allows for entertaining visualization. Directed by Paul Moloney (who has directed almost every Australian TV series imaginable), Crackerjack tells the story of Jack Simpson, a guy who belongs to his local bowling club for the sole reason of parking. When the club encounters financial difficulties, it is obliged to compete competitively to raise the necessary funds to prevent the club from becoming a paradise for poker machines. A familiar and successful formula that is well managed. It is undeniable that the film owes its success to the big cast of Molloy. He seemed to have excellent connections with Samuel Johnson and excellent chemistry with Judith Lucy. Although the character is probably not far from his own personality, you can not help wondering why he did not try his arm at the movies. earlier. To delight the experienced actors, Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter are delightful and often support their scenes. These are two good actors and the couple is easy to do in their roles. Without the huge success of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", Crackerjack would have reached number 1 at the Australian box office, but if you consider what it is and who is involved, even in number 2 was an exceptional effort. In short, a spiritual film and well-being. An excellent cast, an excellent team and an excellent soundtrack combine to make one of the best Australian films of 2002. 7/10.
