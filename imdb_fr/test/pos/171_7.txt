Three ten-year-old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to sneakily kill anyone who offends them. <br /> <br /> While killer kids movies were not quite new at the time of this 80s tornor the theme of kids as murderers works well for this movie. Bloody Birthday gives thrills and suspense, while being a competent killer thriller with strange qualities. It straddles a thin line between cheese and goose bumps, but remains entertaining throughout an interesting scenario. There are very good scenes of murder, and a good deal of nudity to establish that it is a guilty and total pleasure on the part of slasher. <br /> <br /> The distribution does a pretty good job. Young stars Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel deliver menacing performances, while new star Julie Brown performs a striptease before a memorable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg succeeds well as a teacher and Jose Ferrer makes an apparent appearance. <br /> <br /> All around this quirky entry, it's not bad, although it's not flawless, but it's worth watching for genre fans. <br /> <br /> *** on ****
