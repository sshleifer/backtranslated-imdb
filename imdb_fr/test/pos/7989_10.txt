Batman Returns In my opinion, the first Batman in the Batman series was only half of the movie that Batman Returns is. In Tim Burton's first Batman, only Batman and The Joker were played to perfection by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. <br /> <br /> In Batman Returns, we have what I think is Batman's most perfect movie (yes, even better than Dark Knight). Keaton comes back as a Batman and is perfect in the role that never goes too far with the character of Batman, which is perfect in this movie when it comes to the two bad guys he faces. You first have Danny DeVito, who is deliciously crazy like the Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer in Cat-Woman, who, I dare say, is one of the most interesting and complex villains in Batman movies. That's what I feel for Pfeiffer, because she becomes the cat-woman. She begins by being the rather pathetic mouse, Selena Kyle, then truly plunges into the dark side of her mind. You thus get the brilliant performance of a woman who is going from trying to be a hero to a villain and then I guess going back to a hero at the end. Also in this amazing cast, you'll have Max Malreck, the demonic businessman, played by the incredible and legendary Christopher Walken. While in a supporting role, I like this role and it is perhaps the look of Schreck in the film that makes his performance even better than it already is. <br /> <br /> As far as history goes, I must say that Batman Returns has so much more to do this time than the first Batman. Part of the reason I liked this story so much is the fact that Burton dared to run in a much darker and crooked way, as opposed to Nicholson's. You have the story about the penguin and how he tries to deceive the people of Gotham into making him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her fight to decide who she really is and what she should do with her new character. As for Batman, I get the impression that in this one, he is no longer the leader of the rings who keeps both stories together, but of course he kicks at the same time. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was a dark and atmospheric film, as was the story. Gotham City has never been as good as on Blu-Ray and HD, so if you're lucky enough to see it that way, then do not miss it, because it really adds to the overall Batman Returns experience. . <br /> <br /> In summary, I really feel that Batman Returns is, for me, one of the best Dark Knight heroes, because I enjoyed the film for the incredible performance of Heath Ledger as a Joker, I felt that the film was missing something. Batman Returns does not lack anything, so if you want to see an amazing movie with what I consider to be a perfect cast, then it's up to the Batman to turn on Bat's signal.
