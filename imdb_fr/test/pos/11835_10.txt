This charming and well-written film is based on a New York play with the same title, where Sir Aubrey (Sir Charles Aubrey Smith, Knight of Truth in 1944) is at the origin of the role he plays in the film. Here in 1931, we see him at the beginning of his actor's rebirth at the very beginning of the "talkie" period and the character role he would assume until his death in 1948 after completing his last performance in Little Women released in 1949. <br /> <br /> This captivating piece tells the story of an old British aristocrat who locates his illegitimate children and presents himself to them after driving them to his mansion in England. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies plays her daughter by mistake and it's a tour de force for her. She is at once endearing, impatient, superficial, enchanting, wise and compassionate, while creating an indelible and seductive character that remains firmly anchored in her memory. <br /> <br /> Ray Milland, 26, appears here in a small but prominent role that has already appeared in seven other paintings, and more than in the movies for a little over two years. <br /> <br /> The film should be broadcast as a representative of the production of the 1931 factory in Hollywood, of course, and as such is not without flaws. However, it is a charming pleasure from the first to the last scene.
