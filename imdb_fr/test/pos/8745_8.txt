I read countless reviews about the superiority of the miniseries. I certainly can not accept such a statement. If you analyze all aspects of a video / film production, the film is undeniably superior in many areas. <br /> <br /> It is certain that many of the comments are valid for certain -series. More specifically concerning more sons (customs agents) and more developed sons (like the Pakistani farmer and his family). That said, I found Catherine Zeta-Jones's character much more convincing as a desperate woman, from poverty to wealth, who "will not come back". She is a much more sympathetic character than this cold woman who did not seem to have so many reasons to turn quickly to evil. (And yes, I understand ... her children, she was desperate, I just did not see her so desperate.) <br /> <br /> Also, while I enjoyed some of the more elaborate storylines in the mini-series, the character of Benicio del Toro was very convincing. An anchor for the film. This thread has been changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) to good manners. A fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I doubt that someone so pure can exist within such a system, but I do not know enough about the politics of the nation to discuss it). <br /> <br /> After watching the first episode of the mini-series, I actually revisited the film. Why? I kept reading about the fantastic game. I found the performances of the first episode of the mini-series quite laughable. Admittedly, this improved as the miniseries progressed. Now that I have just finished both versions in a few days, I can not agree that the performances of the mini-series have reached the same level as, for example, Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, although Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan were very good. I also think that the police in the movie far outperforms the miniseries. The Germans never impressed me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the dialogue, as presented in the film, is much more nuanced. Especially in almost textual scenes. "Be careful, you start to look like your husband." as opposed to "HAHAHAHA, you speak as Karl." Once again, I found the actors in the miniseries very unconvincing. It was an excellent example. <br /> <br /> Other higher aspects of the film, in my opinion: score, cinematography, editing. <br /> <br /> Do I complain that the film is not long? No, I think it was a fantastic adaptation considering the format. The changes made were autonomous. I mean, would you like to stay in a theater for 5 / 7/10 hours. Of course not. <br /> <br /> Mini-series: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Movie: 9 out of 10
