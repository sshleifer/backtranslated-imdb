- The Best Bit: When the Ugly Monster (Nicholas Turturro) Calls the Runaway (Matthew Modine) "Shane! .. Come Shane!" and when the older sage asks him "What are you doing ?!" he just plays "Enjoying My Time!" In fact, like me for the moment! <br /> <br /> - The scariest part: I was always wondering where to look: where did I ever see this girl? or ? or ? Until I discovered during the closing credits .. OHH MY GOD! She's (Elizabeth Berkley) .. Showgirl fiasco! But I just could not recognize her with her clothes! To tell you the truth, I felt a brief tremor. She is really cute and nice but maybe Hollywood had no mercy! <br /> <br /> - The sexiest moment: when (Berkley) says: "Do you mean the kind of things that gives you an edge ?!" <br /> <br /> - The dullest thing: The assistant delayed after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy in the end !! ??, plus the Mexican ferryman took 3 bullets (in the same car!) and he is not dead either !! ?? <br /> <br /> - The ugliest thing: All these murdered people, as well as the numerous hall (F) to a boring extent! <br /> <br /> - The most beautiful thing: The scenario, intelligent and crazy, with all the fun characters and tumultuous situations, the acting was sweet, especially of (Paul Rodriguez) who stole the show for (because he had the best dialogue too!). <br /> <br /> - The most disappointing thing: Although the management did not disturb the spirit of the story, but at the same time, it did not give it a unique touch, an unequaled signature, a sort of madness hilarity like that of history itself. However maybe the low production did it badly! And of course, easy and tasteless music that could be so because of cheap production too! <br /> <br /> - The most confusing part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented man, but what exactly did he do to get off Hollywood's "A" list ?! What could be the thing he did (or did not do!) To end up as a light and independent joke like (The Shipment)? !! <br /> <br /> - The most absent scene: Where is the Mexican smuggler (Jose) ?! I thought we'd see him again at the end, becoming a small surviving criminal who, in a gadget like this one, could bring about the ongoing mess of this world. <br /> <br /> - Most of the questions I asked myself after the end: When will we see (The mailing - 2)? As I am so eager to see this beautiful little comic and stormy atmosphere! <br /> <br /> These were my own answers.
