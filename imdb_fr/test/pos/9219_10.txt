I watched this movie when I was a kid and I still like to watch it from time to time for the nostalgia factor. When I was younger, I loved the movie because of the entertaining storyline and interesting characters. Today, I still like characters. Moreover, I think of the plot with greater esteem because I now see morality and symbolism. Rainbow Brite is far from the worst movie of all time, and even if it is outdated, I'm sure to show it to my children in the future, when I have children.
