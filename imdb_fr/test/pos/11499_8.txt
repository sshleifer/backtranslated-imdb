Some people drift in life, passing from one thing or person to another without flinching; others attach themselves to a cause, to another person or to a principle and remain categorical, attached to anything - and figuratively or literally, they give their word and stick to it. But we are all different, "made of different clay", as one of the characters in this film says, which makes life so interesting. Some people are just crazy, though - and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes for things, for life, to work? Writer / director Lisa Krueger tackles the problem, using a light-weight approach to examine the thin line that separates being committed - and how one "commits" - and the obsession, in "Committed," featuring Heather Graham in a young woman who is categorical, committed, obsessive and maybe also a little crazy. Her name is Joline and that's her story. <br /> <br /> Certainly, Joline has always been a committed person. in work, relationships, in life in general. She is a woman of her word who is at all costs. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to tell Carl-- and 597 days after the wedding, he left; to "find" and understand everything. When Joline realizes that he will not come back, she refuses to abandon him, nor to their marriage. It may be because of this "clay" of which it is made. Anyway, she leaves home in New York and goes looking for her, which she does - in El Paso, Texas, no matter where she is. But once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, leaving her space and not even letting her know she's there. She considers Carl to be in a "spiritual coma" and it is up to her to watch over him until he comes back to him. And while she looks and waits, her life is anything but dull when she meets a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local restaurants; Carmen 'Grampy' (Alfonso Arau), who is something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has problems with Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic), an artist who makes and loves pinatas. For Joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about Carl, but even more about herself. <br /> <br /> There is a touch of humor, a touch of romance and some glimpses of human nature in this original film that is more about character and character than the plot. And Krueger presents all of this very well by offering an engaging and entertaining film. His characters are very real people, with all the needs, needs, and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic group through which she tells her story. We see it from Joline's point of view, because Krueger makes us aware of his thoughts and, therefore, his motives, which gives a decided view of events as they unfold. This, in addition to the deliberate rhythm it defines, which allows you to soak up the atmosphere and atmosphere it creates, makes it a very effective story. This subject has a serious underlying, but Krueger chooses to avoid anything that is heavy or too deep and focuses instead on the natural humor that comes from the people and situations encountered by Joline. And the result is a well-textured, touching and optimistic look on what we call life. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham takes over this role from the beginning of the film to make Joline a full-fledged creator. She plunges into the room and gives a convincing and credible performance, adding small personal traits and nuances that make all the difference between a performance that is a mere representation of a person and a reality. And for this film to work, it was imperative that Joline be viable and credible - and Graham succeeds on all fronts. Her on-screen presence has never been so appealing, and her vibrant personality, or even the way she uses her eyes, is enough to attract you entirely. it's all part of the character she creates; There is a call to Joline who breathes all her face, who she is inside and outside. She is a nice and nice person, and because you have shared her deepest thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job all along the way, starting with how the character was written, how Graham gives him such a living life. <br /> <br /> As a Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is also totally engaging. Her performance is very natural and direct, and she uses her instinct to effectively create her character. It has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and this gives it an attractive and realistic appearance. It is refreshing and open; you have the impression that Carmen is not the type to remember anything, but that she is totally honest on all fronts and that she is also part of her calling. And, like Joline, this character is well written and Velazquez gives him life convincingly. <br /> <br /> Overall, there are a number of remarkable performances that are at the heart of the film, including Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who, with very little time on the screen, manages to create a memorable character. <br /> <br /> The secondary actors are Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl Editor) and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist). A film that says something about the value of taking a step back to examine The Big Picture - thinking about who we are, where we are going and what we really need - "Committed" is a pleasant experience. a ride is definitely worth taking. 8/10.
