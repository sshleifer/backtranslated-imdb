To tell you the truth, I do not speak Tamil and I did not understand the film. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained everything to me. What a beautiful film! After watching this movie, I thought I should have watched a lot more films from Tollywood (Tamil film industry). The war scenes were incredible, the camera work excellent and the plot beautiful. The actress "Simran", what a beauty. Give him a prize for the best person. Ding, Ding, Ding, go I feel an OSCAR winner. I did not understand the songs, but they were excellent. Mani Ratnam is an excellent director and I hope his next film has been a success.
