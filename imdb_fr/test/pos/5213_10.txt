The only reason I decided to watch this movie is because of Karen Sillas (Alyson Haywood), "Bad Money", '99, deeply involved in Gary Cole, (Dave) "Cry Wolf", 2005, who is a great war hero and has all kinds of ways to make money and that seems to never stop telling LIES. Alyson and Dave are trying to rebuild an old house and restore it to comfortable living conditions. The relationship becomes awkward and Alyson decides to find out what's going on and the plot becomes very mysterious. If you are a big fan of Karen Sillas, this movie is for you. I only wish Karen to appear in more movies, I miss her great talents.
