RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955) <br /> <br /> For me, it seems very risky to try a Hollywood remake of Jules Dassin's classic 1955 RIFIFI. Scheduled for release in 2007, Al Pacino will apparently play the main role in the role of Tony the Stephanois. A risky business ... How will they succeed? <br /> <br /> Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and tried his luck in France by making this little masterpiece, called Granddady of all caper and hold-up movies In my opinion, this remains a unique classic, beautifully filmed with one of the most memorable endings to have been filmed, whatever his opinion of the film. <br /> <br /> During In recent years, RIFIFI has become dangerously surpassed.However, do not forget this French French classic.Go and see it, before the remake is available, to have some ammunition to compare the two. <br /> < Camera Obscura --- 9/10
