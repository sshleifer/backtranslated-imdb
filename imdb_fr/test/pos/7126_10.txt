I laughed so hard most of the time that people stared at me because they could not hear my laughter. I literally fell out of my place at one point. <br /> <br /> I'm a bartender and bouncer to make a living in the real world (note that I use the term real world, unfortunately, it must always come first), and every time I say to someone I play role-playing, it is usually followed by one of the following two questions: 1. What, like D & D? I played it in high school. <br /> <br /> 2. Really? I searched or a group forever! Have room for another? Very rarely, people do not know what are D & D and games. <br /> <br /> That being said, almost every person watching this movie can get something out of it. Even if you are not a player, there is a chance that there will be something in your life that allows you to make fun of it in a light way, and that alone means that you can relate to hijinx in this movie. It's just a light happiness in an hour and a half.
