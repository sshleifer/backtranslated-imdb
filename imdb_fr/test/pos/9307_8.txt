We watched this film in my chemistry class, so it obviously had educational value. I thought the film did a great job mixing the science, moral issues, and personal experiences of the Manhattan project, but it was not really about strong play. I would recommend this film to scientists or those interested in the moral issues of Fat Man and Little Boy, but if the subject of nuclear bombs bores you, do not see it.
