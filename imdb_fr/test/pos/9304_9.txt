Many productions talk about the development of the atomic bomb. Robert Taylor's movie ABOVE AND BEYOND (inter-service propaganda waving a flag really, if you believe it, you think that the Army Air Corps, in the person of Paul W. Tibbits, directed the entire series!), The NBC produced ENOLA GAY (probably MUCH closer to the brand), and the BBC-TV series, OPPENHEIMER, starring Sam Waterston in the lead role. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach as the BBC series, but expands it; he avoids the "Gee Whiz" technology of the Manhattan project and focuses on the human aspects; the personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppie, it covers a wide range of mythical but fairly typical people who were part of it. <br /> <br /> Doubtful, Dwight Schultz did a good job as Oppie, presenting a dream academic, Ivory Tower. who struggles to link his contributions as a physicist to his inclinations to see the world in a broader social and moral context ... only to overcome this struggle with a compelling desire for personal power and glory. In THE DAY AFTER THE TRINITY, it was clear that Oppenheimer considered himself a "superior being" because of his vast intellectual prowess. In the end, it's the fall of Robert Oppenheimer; he saw himself as a kind of "king / philosopher", a moral and intellectual superior who could (and should rightly) "wisely" prescribe what was best for the rest of the world. development and deployment of nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, wisdom does not dictate the actions of nations or the direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does not confer temporal power. When trying to exercise such non-existent power (as Oppie found by opposing the development of "The Super", the hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and banished by those who REALLY have power . <br /> <br /> I found myself criticizing Schultz's character in a way; his Oppie exposes himself closely and personally to the Manhattan project, despite the doubts and fears that tore his intellectual bases. The true Oppenheimer should have taken a different approach; in the beginning, he should have taken the firm resolve that the project would result in an ultimate good. Ugliness produced along the way would be an ancillary price that should be paid to reach this ultimate good, and it must be ignored ... at least until the end of the project, when it was permissible to evaluate the gains. and losses. Oppie clearly did so, and his controversial post-war statements that science now knew sin had resulted in controversial statements, and it was an acquaintance he could never lose. <br /> <br /> As the project progressed, such considerations had to be ruled out if he wanted to preserve his mental health. <br /> <br /> Because of this ambiguity, Schultz's character is a weak, scared little boy who would NEVER have been a "quick breaker coordinator", as Oppenheimer reportedly dubbed his post. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman's view of General Leslie R. Groves is fascinating, and a bravura performance, so maybe a little bit on top. <br /> <br /> Groves was a civil engineer by training, but he was above all a SOLDIER, and a general in addition! He is in the habit of demanding that things go his way ... extremely driven, a spoiled child, speechless, angry, reverent, and not too proud to kneel. and pray. In other words, very similar to REAL soldiers (that is, NON-civilian engineers), aka George Patton! Not only does Grove's mission come first, but it is his ONLY consideration ... that feelings and egos are damned, with the exception of his OWN of course! <br /> <br /> Groves could not admit it, but he knew very well he needed Oppenheimer; military rank meant NOTHING in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppie was a necessary interface between the two worlds he had to ride. <br /> <br /> Again ... I have to criticize the script about it, and for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In reality, Groves already owned Oppie; Otherwise, Oppie would never have been chosen for the job. The story tells of MANY cases where other scientists, some as prominent as Oppenheimer, simply strayed from Groves' recruitment efforts. At one point, Groves was so desperate that he proposed to REDUCE the physicists he needed! <br /> <br /> The Groves attempts in the film to manipulate and control Oppie were INNECESSARY ... they exist here only as a dramatic device that helps make the movie feel pretty ugly. <br /> <br /> "Michael Merriman" by Kusak is a composite of several real characters, but they date from a different time. Several research accidents similar to the one described have occurred in post-war weapons research. <br /> <br /> Merriman's overdose of radiation creates another ugliness in the film, but that is, in my humble opinion, necessary and fairly accurate. People with weak stomachs will have trouble managing hospital sequences; they are all TOO TRUE. <br /> <br /> The main idea that comes to mind, but not enough, in my humble opinion, is the great truth of the Los Alamos experience. The scientists who signed were young, idealistic, naive and talented. Most were first out of the campus shelter. For them, the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice large-scale experimental physics without the budget constraints or "excessive" bureaucratic control. <br /> <br /> It's not just their brilliance, but their juvenile exuberance that gave birth to the atomic bomb. <br /> <br /> There are many things here to make the viewer extremely uncomfortable with this movie. Similarly, if you filter the Hollywood BS (there are not many), it is probably a pretty accurate view of the interior of the Manhattan project.
