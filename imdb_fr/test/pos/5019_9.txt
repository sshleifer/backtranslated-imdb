Why would this film be so good, but only yield $ 95,000,000 and NO prizes? John Travolta knows what he's doing. He knows he is Michael, a magical angel who smokes with a dying, smoking woman, is now in a car with the staff of "The National Mirror" and their dog, Sparky, on their way to Chicago. It then turns into a road trip that is both awesome AND awesome. I do not even think that the scenes of death (3 to be exact) make it a tear. The soundtrack is the best with "Heaven Is My Home", "Up Around The Bend" and "Chains Of Fools". I have very high expectations about this and I say that it should have been a little more respectful in the 90s. Read my comment. Goodbye!
