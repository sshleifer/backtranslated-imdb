Kannathil Muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere films ever seen. the story of an adopted girl who, at the age of 9, learns the truth about her parentage. she embarks on an effort to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist. <br /> <br /> The greatness of the film lies in its simplicity. mani ratnam generally tends to create thoughtless and pompous characters in this movie, each person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere. That's why he is ranked among his best films. <br /> <br /> The film is exhausting, moving and draws the heart of the viewer: Keerthana, 9, the Amudha and his adoptive mother, his adoptive mother. just awesome. their relationship is the cornerstone of this film. there are some notable flaws here, especially the scene where Amudha learns that she is an adopted child, she is discordant and seems totally unreal. it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would announce such news in the way they did. Surprisingly, brilliant songs are another flaw. they seem forced again and stand out, not mixing with the rest of the scenario. <br /> <br /> That said, it's still one of the most poignant and beautiful films to come out of India for a very long time. . this beauty is not only in the script or characters, but also in the technical brilliance, the work of Ravi Chandran's camera is pure poetry. all characters play credibly and realistic humor, especially in flashback scenes, is entertaining. <br /> <br /> a sincere 9 !!
