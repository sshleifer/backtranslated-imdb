Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau must be one of the best friends ever to work together. They made a lot of movies together, I think they are fantastic when they work together in a movie. Out to Sea is a fantastic comedy that I think I'm watching. I give the film 10 out of 10. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau will be remembered when the films they made together will be on television. We will miss them very much. May God bless you both.
