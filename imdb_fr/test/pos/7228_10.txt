Wow, this movie is amazing. It's an excellent movie. There are scenes of illness (not as close as Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie), nudity, and it was the first appearance of the penis monster in a movie! This has prepared the scene for a lot of Troma movies, it's a very Tromatic movie. He mixes comedy, romance and my favorite, HORROR / GORE! Not so much gore in this movie, but enough to satisfy. This is the best adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Much better than any other version. They make it so fun and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hey ... I like him. :) All I have to say is that it's a very good movie, very funny, and Lemmy is a good host. The acting is good and Kaufman leads as always. To see for all TROMA fans!
