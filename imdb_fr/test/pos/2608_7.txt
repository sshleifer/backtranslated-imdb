This is a cute movie starring Spanky, Alfalfa and Buckwheat comedies "Our Gang". Placed in the south during the Civil War, it may seem a bit odd to see Buckwheat as Spanky's slave, but this film is as charming as the best shorts with the same cast. It was the only feature film of Our Gang, and I highly recommend it to the remake of The Little Rascals of 1994.
