In a critical scene, while Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is lying in the Cave Of Swimmers, she writes a text read aloud by Hana (Juliette Binoche) in which she proclaims that "the light has gone out now, and I write the darkness ... "A sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic splendor of The English Patient, which is not boring. With such a dramatic sweep that keeps them going, and a flawless strength of the film, this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and novels of the Second World War, taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia independence in the form of Tuscany. <br /> <br /> The English Patient indisputably pulls the strings of the heart and takes us into a mysterious first act, a second romantic act and a beautiful ... last final act, and it's not nothing. This is the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic even when Count Almásy, from the beginning, turns out to be a completely inimitable character. Generally classified as a villain, he shows stained colors, but ultimately human as a man caught in a desperate love he has to fulfill. Many people will criticize this film based on its so-called "glorification of adulterers". "but those who know nothing, the contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the beginning) are spectacular, because the patient is the lamented man who suffers because of what he has done, the evil that was in his time now missing, while the man before the accident is an individual like any.He wants this woman, but he can not have it, Fiennes brings to Almásy the human qualities of 'Almásy in a way that no other actor could, he could not have found a better actor for this work. <br /> <br /> So, please take those comments to heart, see the film, those who call it "boring" or "despicable" know nothing and should be ashamed of a one-dimensional view of the film, as they have neither studied nor corrected, and probably do not plan to correct The English Patient is the best of all the movies to ever win the Oscar for best film, and for so many reasons hidden sounds in their poetic triumphs.
