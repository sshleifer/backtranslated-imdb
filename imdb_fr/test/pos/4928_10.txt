Tiny Toons is the first cartoon I remember being a kid and I loved every minute. When I was four or five years old, my parents bought the video How I spent my holidays. I watched it again and again until I repeated every word. A few days ago, my three-year-old cousin came and I had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old relic of my childhood. <br /> <br /> I knew he was going to laugh, but I was surprised how much I laughed. Like all movies and episodes of Tiny Toons, humor is more based on wacky humor and genius and succeeds tremendously. Bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Pig Maton and Fifi all endure incredible adventures with Bugs and Babs whitewater rafting with a little help from Superman, Plucky Duck and Maton pig. continues a quest to find cute kittens in a safari country. <br /> <br /> Part of the classic humor emerges from this tiny adventure and is one of the best crazy comedies I've ever seen. My favorite gag was to be the monorail when Hamton and Plucky arrive, ride the monorail and leave (much to Plucky's dismay). No matter how old you are, you will laugh to tears without having to worry about language and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiny Toons Adventures: How I spent my holidays. Featuring the voices of Charles Adler, Tress MacNeille, Joe Alaskey and Don Messick. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
