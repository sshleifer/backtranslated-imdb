Intense domestic suspense with the hostess (Lupino, excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant cleaning lady (Ryan). The two masters of the genre are at their peak, their best eroticism, because they associate mind, emotions and willingly in a strange hostage situation right out of the Saturday Evening Post. B & W richly colored with an unusual amount of close-ups. The girl who teases Ryan is really well run here. Suburban melodrama improbable but satisfying.
