This film was a pleasant surprise for me. In all honesty, the glimpses seemed horrible, until Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented it with reservation, but I really enjoyed this movie. There were great actors, some good twists, and of course Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. It is definitely worth checking out.
