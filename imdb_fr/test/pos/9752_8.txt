I found this educational film, entertaining and very moving. I was impressed when I learned how much Judge Arbor contributed to Kosovo. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is greatly underrated and it is good to see her again in a Canadian production. Leslie Hope (24 years old) and John Corbett (Sex in the City.) <br /> <br /> Although the story of this film may not be completely factual, it left me the desire to find out more about Arbor's word. An excellent film to inspire young women. <br /> <br /> I say that the film is a "must see".
