What a surprise this movie was. I saw many of Fulci's horror movies and zombies, and I was amazed that it was by the same director. He also wrote the play that shows that the guy was quite capable of creating a complex and complex story. The dubbing about it is not good, but far from the dreadful break-in that hinders even later the howlers like "Manhattan Baby". <br /> <br /> The photography of this film is fantastic. A strange highway, almost futuristic, appears throughout the film. She focuses on a small town where young boys are murdered. A scene where a woman is beaten is uncomfortable to watch, but refreshing compared to the usual cinematic violence. <br /> <br /> What went wrong Lucio? Perhaps there are strong arguments to suggest that it had reached its peak with this film, which then slowly deteriorated.
