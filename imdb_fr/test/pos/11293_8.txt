Do not watch this movie while you eat or soon after. <br /> <br /> That said, Begotten will stay with you for the rest of your life, whether we like it or not. Based on the nihilist philosophy that life is nothing more than the man plunging above the earth (to paraphrase the title / introduction sequence), this one will most likely contain the most intense imagery and macabre you'll see in a movie. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue, only images after pictures describing the cycle of life. The combination of the film of black and white photographs and really terrifying background sounds has the effect of making the message of the creator understand. <br /> <br /> The film begins with God (represented as a bandaged and obviously crazy man) who opens his torso with a straight razor and then dies in his own filth. After her death, Mother Nature emerges from her corpse to immerse herself in her blood and sperm and gives birth to Man, represented by the fly of a human being convulsing on the earth. <br /> <br /> The landscape is a barren desert populated with wrapped humanoids that end up falling on Mother Nature and Man. After a series of violent scenes illustrating the rape of nature and the destruction of man, these humanoids proceed to the destruction of the remains of corpses in the soil and the cycle of life begins again. <br /> <br /> I actually rented This comes from Blockbuster one night, based on cover art and hype content, but it's definitely not a Blockbuster type movie. Do not expect a story, a dialogue or punches. These are intense images based on a dark subject. <br /> <br /> I give this movie some great acclaim for the movie and the audio, but I do not think I'll watch it too often, if that's it again. I like my dark and unique films, but this one is exponentially higher than expected.
