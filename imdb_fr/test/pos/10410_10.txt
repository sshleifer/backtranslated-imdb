www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html An excellent TV series to record on DVD. It was a show I rarely missed. I found a petition to bring it back to DVD. I remember a show where this obese woman was wearing a pair of glasses that allowed her food to talk to her. Needless to say she could not eat her friends so she died of hunger. Another episode saw an accountant visiting an underground branch of sewer and metro security. The accountant wanted to stop funding the project. In the end, the security branch was underfunded to fight the cannibal creatures who lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
