Father Hood <br /> <br /> I can understand why many people hate this story of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across America, but I saw a lot worse, and when I seen those years ago - I did not think it was particularly horrible. Patrick Swayze is the worried father who takes his children with him for personal reasons, and Halle Berry is the cop who pursues them. <br /> <br /> Overall, a decent way to spend a few hours of your life. You could certainly do worse - never heard of the movie "Pod People"? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 on ***** <br /> <br /> Filed PG-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content, violence and language.
