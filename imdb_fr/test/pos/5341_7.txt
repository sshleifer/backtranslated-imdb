Upon entering this film, I was a little cautious. I have always been a bit skeptical about clay films. I've always loved decent animated movies, but I've always been different with Claymation. But this one took me by surprise. Wallace And Gromit are extremely adorable characters, and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. There are silly jokes for kids and subtle ones, but above the heads of young kids, jokes for us, older people. A very neat film and although the story is broken, my interest began to end. <br /> <br /> It's so rare to find pure and uncorrupted humor these days, this movie has been all the more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit indulge in their usual activity, namely to exterminate HUMANLY the nonsense that ruin market gardening. But this time, they find themselves fighting a kind of huge monster rabbit that their humanly constructed traps can not even keep under their fingers. Big bursts of laughter and a good hour and a half of pleasure. If you have not exhibited at Wallace And Gromit, I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give it a rating of 7 and up is because it's still a family film and I do not have kids. . I feasted, but if I had watched with little stuffed rats and my wife, it was at least a 9! Give a shot!
