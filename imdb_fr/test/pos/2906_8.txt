I was going out one morning when I checked something on the T.V. and I came across this movie. I never remember seeing or hearing him. What a fun and interesting thing to watch. My meeting was postponed because I could not get out of this movie. There were real interesting things that marked the hour of history, and fun things that people today do not do in the movie because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism. The acting was good for a 1954 movie. Subtle and authentic actions from the characters that made me watch what they would do next. That's why I ended up watching it. I do not know why they do not show it more often. I would rather watch that than some movies they play more than necessary. For history buffs, those who love vintage movies and those who are part of the value groups will appreciate this one. "The Egyptian" offers a variety of flavors addressing a host of things to consider in human nature that have not changed since the present time. What does it say about us? Those who do not like movies that take their time to unfold and tell a good story .... are not in the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not have time to rent it if it is available, but if I could see it again, I would probably vote at 10.
