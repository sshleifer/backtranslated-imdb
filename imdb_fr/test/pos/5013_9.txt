According to many testimonies, Stu Ungar was not a very kind guy. He spat on the croupiers, stiffened people to whom he owed money and was verbally abusive. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers could choose to adhere the man to the cap, which would make him a sports hero who would triumph despite adversity. But High Roller does not do that. And it's a tough battle to take. <br /> <br /> Instead, we must look VERY carefully to see a man who has never matured, surpassed the scared little boy on the streets of New York, despite all his successes. And the only real approval he gets is that of death itself. Very brave (because people will not understand) and very touching (when you do). <br /> <br /> What is also brave is the use of a Scorsese sensation. "Aha! How derivative", say the people. Really? But there is practically no violence. And Stuey loved the gangster movies. Maybe the sensation reflects the Stu man and not the director Marty? And if it's really a low budget movie and so beautiful, congratulations! <br /> <br /> Finally, the structure of backward linear. Wow, it'll be hammered. Yet not only does it work exceptionally well, even for those who do not see the link with the "seventh seal". (PROOF: In SS, Knight plays chess with death.) In HR, Stuey says "We can play cards for, you know" ... Death says "Never very good at cards ..."). /> <br /> No delicate effect or camera movement. No shaky camera. Nothing connected at all. Just solid, tight storytelling. <br /> <br /> Maybe that makes the film too basic and somehow flawed. But again, the guy too. And that makes it pretty much right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
