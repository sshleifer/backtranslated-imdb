10/10 <br /> <br /> DISCUSSION ON THE PARCELS <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films ever made and I do not say it because I'm fooled by this apparently absurd presentation . Those who do not like the film because they do not understand the story often criticize those who praise the film by saying that they take his genius because they do not understand it. I do not consider this film to be very allegorical. For me, it's a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. The film confuses people because they expect it to have a profound philosophical meaning that they must interpret from scenes that are supposedly meaningless. I think they do not realize that the mystery comes from a chopped and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not a visual allegory chaos. Due to the limited length, I will try to stay brief and go back to the main concepts. <br /> <br /> The general plot: Diane goes to L.A. after the jitterbug contest to start playing. During an audition, she meets Camilla whom she falls in love with. Diane becomes furious with jealousy since Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) during a shoot and discovers the other woman (a blonde at random) during the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Motivated by her rage and possessiveness, Diane hires a hitman to kill Camilla. Once done, she is invaded by loneliness and slips into an unconscious imaginary world where she leads the life she wants. Diane is awake. In her state of consciousness, she is haunted by what she has done. <br /> <br /> The importance of fantasy: the film begins, after the credits, with a 1st person p.o.v. Shot of someone crumbling on bed and slipping into unconsciousness. This is where Diana's fantasy begins. The accident serves as a pretext to "bring back" his dead girlfriend and justify his fantastic life. She portrays her girlfriend as being sweet and innocent because that's what she would have liked to be. In the meantime, she acts as if everything is "like cinema" because she has a personality of escape. In a sense, she kills herself and assumes the identity of a waitress named Betty at a dinner party. The story that revolves around the director is the direct result of her feeling that she was a victim of reality, just as she was and that she "convinces" herself that he had been forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in fantasy is actually the random blonde of the engagement party. She hated her so much that she turned him into Camilla and made her the ultimate antagonist. She then took the real Camilla and turned her into a perfect girlfriend submissive and submissive to the movies. She was inspired by Rita Hayworth. She also describes the perpetrator as a very clumsy person and unable to further justify Camilla's survival. Her fantasy world, sadly for her, was a quest for Diane who ended up being herself and made the world of dreams die by guiding her through a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio who had chanted "there is no group" and the "instruments" you hear are not really there; it's a metaphor for fantasy. She begins to shake violently because it undermines her perception of the environment. The other reminder is the blue box ... In fact, the blue box is not the reminder itself (rather a Pandora's box, actually), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds him of Camilla's real death, because that's what the killer said would have revealed when it was done. In addition to having love, all her creation is an escape from reality by living in the idealized Hollywood she hoped to be part of when she arrived. <br /> <br /> This is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who has lost a dream. It's not a series of random things specifically designed to disturb and it's not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate piece of the human condition that is presented wonderfully. <br /> <br /> However, that's all I think. I can be far away. Or it may not mean something. Many disagree with me. Awesome! After all, why does it have to mean something? Why can not it just be a statement in itself? And if coherent and sensitive narratives are barriers to artistic expression? Peter Greenaway, for example, has spent a lot of time eloquently supporting this idea by saying, "I would say that if you want to write stories, be an author, be a novelist, do not be a filmmaker, because I believe that making film is so much more exciting in areas that are not primarily related to storytelling. "And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the film is not related to his art. "I did not understand!" So...? "Mulholland Dr.", history or not, affects viewers, harasses them, drags them, moves them, soothes them. The way it lends itself to interpretation is incredible. It never gets old. He never loses his sparkle. His visuals are always effective and beautiful. It's cinematic perfection no matter what. Enjoy.
