The funniest show ever seen on television, even if the humor is not suitable for everyone. I realize it would have been difficult to keep the series fresh if it had lasted longer, but it's unfortunate that only six episodes were filmed. The gags fly quickly from the opening credits to the end, when we saw Drebin and his boss, Ed Hocken, pretending to be a freeze-frame of the closing credits, during which the criminal (still in motion) would see everything the still world. and try to escape. In another episode, the building began to collapse around them while Drebin and Hocken remained frozen. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was a comic genius of Frank Drebin and an ideal choice for this show ?? how he managed to keep an impassive face through some of that is beyond me. Because jokes and visual gags come so often and quickly, you can watch the episodes a second and third time and catch things that you missed the first time. If you are like me, you can watch them again and again and always find yourself laughing. Even jokes that had no meaning or reason apparently, such as the slogan "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln" in the opening announcement somehow worked? perhaps they were thrown there precisely for this reason. <br /> <br /> Cleverly imitating the old Quinn Martin detective / cop programs of the 1970s, the police group would come back from the commercial break with the words "Act Two" on the screen, which was immediately followed by "Yankees One" or another chip. In the opening credits, the title of the episode will appear on the screen, but the advertiser will pronounce a completely different title. My favorite jokes and replicas of this series are far too numerous to list, but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks an unlucky boxer who has already had fierce battles: "Do you think you can beat the Champ?" The boxer responds, "I can take it blindfolded!" What Drebin answers, "But what if he does not blindfold?" A minute later, referring to the seedy little boxer's apartment, Drebin told him, "I'll help you get out of this sewer." The next thing you see, Drebin pops up through a manhole in the street! In another episode, Drebin and Hocken challenge the suspect's fragile alibi. Drebin, not believing him, said, "Okay, let's say you went to the movies." After a slight pause, Drebin, Hocken and the suspect all look at the camera and say in unison: "You went to the movies." Moments later, when Drebin is forced to let the suspect suspect free, for lack of evidence, he breaks loose and shouts angrily, "Tell this striker to take off! What we see next is a cop who signals a World War II-style airplane to get on a runway right in front of the building! Although there have been many classic quotes from Drebin, one of them is particularly memorable: "Sorry to disturb you Mrs. Twice.We would have come earlier, but your husband was not dead at the time. time." Another classic was, "I'm a locksmith, and I'm a locksmith." When the father of a visibly shaken abduction victim asks Drebin, "What am I doing, I am doing it?" ?? Drebin, in classic fashion, replies, "Well, if I understand correctly, you are in the textile sector." As I said, humor is not for everyone ?? many people will not get it. During the brief passage of the series, I remember that the reaction was very mixed. Some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and it was one of the funniest things in the world, while others thought it was stupid and not funny. For me, the police brigade, even more than 20 years later, is the funniest thing I have ever seen on television. I highly recommend younger viewers who like this kind of humor but have never seen Police Squad being too young at the time of the show. I found that the six episodes were even more funny than the following "Naked Gun" movies.
