Imaginary Heroes tells another wave of darkness and denial that lies beneath the surface of the American suburbs. It tells the life of the Travis family, all recovering after the suicide of their eldest son. <br /> <br /> The couple at the center of the film is the mother and son Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) and Tim (Emile Hirsch), both acting in different ways following the death. While Tim is experimenting with prescription medications and her own sexuality, Sandy is getting regressed, smoking marijuana, and overcoming an old act of infidelity. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sandy and Tim is well explored, especially when it refers to the two people excluded from their own family: Sandy because of his affair and Tim, at first, for always being in the shadow of his older brother, who has more success. Sandy's husband, her husband (Jeff Daniels), has much less time and orders Sandy to prepare an extra plate of food for her dead son and place it in his place at the dinner table. Michelle Williams' older sister, Penny, is underwritten and could easily be removed from the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite its long running time, Imaginary Heroes does not explore its many subplots as much as individual stories deserve it, the film's black comedy does not translate as well as it does. writer / director Dan Harris may have liked. And the representation of a troubled family dynamic is not as clear as the many other films with similar ideas. Despite some problems, Weaver and Hirsch play a leading role and allow the film to easily reach its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Rating: B-
