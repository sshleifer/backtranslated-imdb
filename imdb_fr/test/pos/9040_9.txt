It is quite surprising that this wonderful film was shot in 1949, when Hollywood was generally in the sand about the black and white problems of that time. The film deserves a lot of congratulations for taking this position, for playing exceptionally in lesser known actors and for its ultra-intelligent scenario that does not insult the public and does not seek an easy solution to white racism. Moreover, with its rather modest budget and speed of execution, it does an incredible job! <br /> <br /> Juano Hernandez (exceptional actor who played minor roles in many films of the time) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South. The crowd did not really care about the details - she is just leaning forward on a hanging. And, despite his commitment to the law, the only lawyer in the city who has agreed to defend him also assumes that he is guilty and does not really want to know the truth - just delay the hanging until they can condemn it and then have a legal suspension! Fortunately, a young white man (Claude Jarmin) begins to question the innocence of Juano and seeks the truth. That's when the best character of this wonderful drama is presented - played by Elizabeth Patterson (the old lady who later performed Mrs. Trumbull in I LOVE LUCY). On her own, she steals the limelight as a White with not only a conscience, but the will and determination to defend the black man. At a wonderful moment in the film, a crowd tries to push her back to surrender to the prisoner to kill him, but she remains very firm and forces them to step back. There is much more in this rather complicated but intelligently written story, but I leave it to you to see it yourself. Look at it with your children if you have the opportunity - it will open an amazing dialogue about how much race relations have developed over the past 50 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, apparently, 1949 was a good year For Hollywood, Twentieth-Century Fox also released "Pinky", an effective and powerful film about racism, interracial marriage and even rape ! See both movies if you can.
