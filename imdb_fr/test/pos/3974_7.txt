(Synopsis) Bartleby "B" Gaines (Justin Long), a graduate of high school, finds himself without college. He has been able to speak and solve all the problems he faces, but he has not yet managed to seduce the college admissions committee of eight colleges. His mother and father are very disappointed that Bartleby was not accepted at the university. His parents think that if Bartleby does not go to college, he will have no future. Many of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they have enrolled in. To satisfy their parents, Bartleby had the idea to create his own college with a website. They convert an abandoned psychiatric facility into a South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the website says that we accept anyone. On the first day of school, they unexpectedly had a large number of accepted students who were also rejected by all the colleges. With a million dollars in tuition fees, Bartleby must turn his fake college into a functional college. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as Dean of the College. The fun begins when they design their own program, set their own rules and party all night long. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The principle of creating a college without a teaching staff is a bit off. Since it was a fake college, Bartleby really did not need staff. The film reminded me of the classic movie "Animal House", the university setting, the fraternity, many gags and pretty young women. These new first-year university students had a different notion of what the university experience was. The film not only has a lot of humor, but also a good message for life. People should realize their dream, create a passion for what they want to do in life and not be content with what others want them to do. The end was a bit unrealistic, but it's just a movie. The film was designed for young people to have a little fun. (Universal Pictures, Duration 1:32, Rated PG-13) (7/10)
