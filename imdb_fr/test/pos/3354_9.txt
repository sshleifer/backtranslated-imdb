The first time I saw Alice in Wonderland, a Grade X musical, was in the early '80s in a movie theater in New York with friends. I remember we really liked the movie, even though we wondered why all the "wonders" were covered with various colorful shapes and why the film suddenly jumped from scene to scene, leaving us guessing .. What we just missed Obviously, it was the modified (hashed) version of the software, which left me wanting to see it again soon, but in its original full version. Well, more than 20 years have gone by, during which I have forgotten everything about this film, and just a few days ago I stumbled upon a very popular VHS copy (which had had better times : faded colors, scratching and some flaws), but guess what? This is the original uncut version and this time I really had a good time! Humor, Musical and Porn may seem like a delicate combination, but in this case, it really works and, unlikely, the vast majority of annoying porn movies invading our screens, it's a really fun and entertaining sexual fantasy that will not disappoint you not. . The staging is clever, the fast editing makes the film fly like a bird, all the familiar characters are adorable or just funny, all the actors seem to have fun, the songs are catchy (it's worth mentioning the one about "growing up "sung by Alice at the beginning of the film and the hilarious film" What a beautiful girl does you like a knight ", the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged (Terry Hall, surprisingly energetic, proves that she can also" dance "dance with enthusiasm his guts ... Do not worry, she also does what she was known for ...), the acting, singing, decor, costumes are quality and then ... there is Kristine "Blue Eyes" DeBell, in the first main role of her career and (oh boy!), She has indeed some HC sequences! Personally, I think they are absolutely not unpleasant, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and very exciting. ne and (ohhh!) So pretty; With the help of her new friends in Wonderland, she discovers her body and her sexuality so she sings, she dances and ... what are you waiting for? She is also experimenting with sex! The final sequence, when she finally makes love with her boyfriend, is exceptionally well photographed and realized and is the highlight of the film. I think that his "role-playing" (his innocent blue eyes and his captivating smile) and his ability to play roles make these explicit sequences more than acceptable and actually very enjoyable. There is a lot of sex in Wonderland and everyone seems to want to "get to work" with the first boy (s) available, which means a lot of fierce action. On the other hand, some close-ups, clearly "stuck", just to make "porn hounds" really happy, are a little redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, sexual action is not offensive because it is handled with great humor and blends in perfectly with music, dance, and comedy. If you think that your partner and you can handle the graphic sex, look at it together. Take my word, you will have an hour and a half of very good time (maybe also an extra action after show ...) This is "Adult Entertainment" so be careful, do not leave this video around or in between other children videos. If your 10-year-old can get his hands on it, he may be having fun, but you'll have to provide embarrassing explanations as to why "this" Alice is behaving quite differently than he evoked in Lewis Carroll's novel where he watched on Disney's video. I bet you will not forget this "one-of-a-kind" very soon. It's a shame they do not manufacture them like that ...! I give it a 9 out of 10.
