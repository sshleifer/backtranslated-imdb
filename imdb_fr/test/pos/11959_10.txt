What can I say about this movie if it's really fun! <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays Hoops McCann, a high school graduate who has two choices, to learn to sweep the street or spend the summer in Nantucket with his friend George Calamari (interpreted with hilarity by Joel Murray) and his crazy friends. <br /> <br /> When I say wacky, trust me, it can not be more zanier than the brothers Stork, Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Add a little girl named Squid and her funny dog ​​and a superb performance of Demi Moore and you'll have the stuff of a laugh, movie. <br /> <br /> Laughs flow freely in this film and in history The line, although the good against the good and the good conqueror typical, is great with the turn of a regatta like the strong test. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes laughter and feeling good. If you like * fully * enjoy your movies, then you can not miss One Crazy Summer!
