At the end of my review of Cache, I wrote that I was intrigued by Haneke as a filmmaker. That's what led me to get La Pianiste's DVD, which I just finished watching about half an hour ago. <br /> <br /> Everything has been expressed, here at IMDb and in many external journals - the most macabre a twisted pathology that would "create" a person like Erika de Huppert, who is still trying, after years and years to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and all the rest of her life, to start with herself. She has repressed everything that could free her from her self-imposed attachment, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of going crazy, where she can not even begin to understand what a real feeling in love would feel. I love. <br /> <br /> This is a graphic portrait of an invalid, a cripple who has never found the strength to get out of his childhood and become a functioning adult. I think this topic concerns us all - we all aspire to autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even aware. He also brilliantly discusses the contrast between what one fantasizes sexually and the reality of these fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. Huppert's character gets what she asks for in the movie and it's hardly the emancipatory experience she's imagined. <br /> <br /> Regarding the highly discussed scene in the bathroom: I really enjoyed the fact that this sequence receives all the erotic load possible (for the viewer, I mean), drawn from cause of the previous scene, where she Put the glass in the pocket of the girl. At the moment when she is staging her scenario of this kind in the bathroom, we have already discovered that she was dangerously disturbed and that it is not an excitement, her little session of domination with our poor dupe without suspicion . <br /> <br /> I think another incredible feat of this film is that halfway through, I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I read subtitles. It never happened before, in any foreign film, and I saw a lot of it. <br /> <br /> In this film, like Cache, the end is not entirely wrapped up in a pretty little tidy bow, but unlike Cache, we have at least some idea of ​​the purpose, even if we do not do not do it. even know for sure if the character of Huppert is alive or dead. After experiencing The Pianist, Michael Haneke is, needless to say, more than anything intrigued.
