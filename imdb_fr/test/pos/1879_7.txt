Man with the Screaming Brain is certainly not a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never a featured vehicle for Bruce Campbell, which means it works like a kind of summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action and happy ending. As a writer, Campbell is not homogeneous - there are many things in history that do not make much sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts because a female brain there has been implanted?), and some scenes resemble other incarnations of better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William fight for control of William's body, is quite out of Evil Dead II). However, there are a lot of little touches and non-sequiturs that look pretty bright, like when William is panicking and shouting at a statue: "What are you looking at ?!" The film looks like an original from the Sci-Fi chain, probably because it was. The acting game is actually quite good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and devious, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her at times that history never explored. Ted Raimi has managed the classic role of gruff wizard pretty well, and Bruce is funny as an arrogant, sardonic and condescending American jerk. (Now that he's writing his own movies, you'd think he'd be playing a role for which he's not been tagged yet.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a weird and absurd B-movie that should be nice for any who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.
