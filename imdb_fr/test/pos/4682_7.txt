My reaction to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably inextricably intertwined with the events that occurred in my life when I saw it; This is the first film I saw after I got a job after 8 months of unemployment and I go back to school to retrain. Money was always tight, but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie at the movies and paying bills (or lunch) and the feeling of relief and gratitude I felt at the time was enormous. As a result, my pleasure for "Italian Job" was probably very out of proportion to its current value. <br /> <br /> And yet, I got it used on DVD a few weeks ago and looked at it again, and I still enjoyed it tremendously. I've never seen the original (although I've heard it's an absolute classic), but its modern equivalent is eminently observable if you have a taste for the values ​​of modern production applied to intrigues and themes of older films. <br /> <br /> What attracted me most initially was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis wrote some of the most flexible, textured and enjoyable soundtracks. IJ opens with a devious, witty and thrilling arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brushwork and quiet moments - it has totally conquered me from the first seconds. And the whole movie is like that - I have not heard that kind of music resonate since Stewart Copeland left the police and started producing soundtracks for movies like "Rumble Fish". There are at least a dozen irresistibly marked motifs here, as well as covers of pop songs ranging from "straight" to "inspired". For people for whom the soundtrack is important, this film is a delight. <br /> <br /> Turning to the film: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he has no problem playing the main role, and the film does not ask him to do anything he can not not doing well. He is the weakest "major" actor in the film, but that's because the rest of the actors are very strong, especially Donald Sutherland. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all achieve solid, fat-free performances. Norton seems to be mostly phoning him (rumor has it that he does not really want to be in the movie), but he's still natural, even at 1/2 power. My only problem with the casting and the game is the character "Wrench", who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be in the film, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can attribute some to the size of the piece and the nature of the character "late"). If I were cynical, I would ask myself with whom did the actor sleep to find himself in this movie in such a supernumerary role? Nah, it will never happen ... <br /> <br /> Values ​​of production, camera work, stunts, plot ... everything goes well and Gray and his production team put things in place of perfectly harmonious way (with the exception of "Key", see above). <br /> <br /> The dialog box has a nice and light touch that rewards your indulgence. In addition, several major and minor conspiracy gains are satisfactory along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he just lost the surprise element "there ...) <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie requires a certain level of" suspension of disbelief "to work, but if you just relax and accept the mechanics of the safety of a submarine safely, or probability that anyone succeeds in hacking and manipulating LA traffic via a laptop, etc.), you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> "Italian work": it's a light summer down, but that's good for what it is, and it does not try to be different thing. This is not enough for an "8" but I would give it a "7.5".
