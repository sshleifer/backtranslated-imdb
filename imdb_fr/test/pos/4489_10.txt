This is one of the classic episodes of TWILIGHT ZONE, where, in the simplest of situations, the viewer was plunged into an apparently symbolic conflict, with the sole aim of finding the surprising and strangely acceptable solution. Five characters are in a container / jail: a major, a ballerina, a bagpipe player, a clown and a vagabond. They are certainly a strange choice of guys to be in this isolation room, but they are all in (nonetheless) and they try to understand why they are there. What do they have in common? Nobody can understand it. But little by little, the major organizes them to work to bet while standing on the shoulders of each one. And the major, go to the top of the line of numbers arrives at the entrance, and .... I'll leave it like that, although one of the other critics on this thread is actually running away from the story. <br /> <br /> The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, the famous piece of Pirandello. It is doubtful that the goal of the series is to parody this piece: Pirandello's characters analyze their roles and their relationships with each other. But the five characters here, while trying to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters of Pirandello who know their current situation. This uncertainty about what is happening suggests to the audience that this is an abstract drama. <br /> <br /> The actors, William Windon as major and Murray Mattheson in particular, are doing well. And the conclusion, planned or not, is very effective.
