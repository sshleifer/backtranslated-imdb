CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST is a perfect movie. A flawless film about all the faults of humanity. Outside, it may look like a movie about death, but it's actually a movie about life. I just can not recommend enough this movie. And do not be afraid, dear readers, this is not a depressing movie. As stated, it's a film about the brightness of life under the guise of death. You are going to laugh. You will cry. You will realize that life is fragile and short. And you will leave the viewing with a better understanding of the precious life. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> (visit www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film and reviews of other foreign films)
