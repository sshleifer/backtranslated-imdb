Some may think that Imaginary Heroes is a movie exactly like "Igby Goes Down", but that's not the case. In Imaginary Heroes, the director introduces us to the Travis family and his entourage. <br /> <br /> The film itself is great and the acting is extremely well done. The actors of Weaver and Hirsch are credible and help make the film what it is. The actors, the director / screenwriter, Dan Harris, have made a movie that many people should see. Do not think it's just another teen movie, it's a movie about a family and their problems. I gave this film a 10/10, because I think it's not the best movie, no movie can be, but it's as close as possible.
