The three main characters are hopeless, and yet you only feel sorry for one of them: Ernesto, devoted to Mercedes. That was part of the frustration: screaming at Mercedes for a hint and dropping the ugly Harry, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> Then there is the satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a big part as a transvestite, and Harvey Keitel's moving story that he played a gorilla in a cheap TV movie is incredible. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino makes a half monologue and Anthony Quinn makes Ernesto a rich man. <br /> <br /> Time and again, great moments appear in the story, but in the end, it's hard to know what to think of this movie. There is no happy end, or even complete end, but we feel pretty good. <br /> <br /> This film is strange, but so am I; No wonder I loved.
