looks like the betting movie I've ever seen. not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for sensible perception. Antonioni is comparatively wise to his film. The so organic roles of Malkovich are so true, the situations are so real. I changed my view of the world after this cinema. I am a beginner scholar in Russia - country of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky - and I am quite sure to look at Antonioni is nice and fun for the Russians because we understand his point of view. so I do not understand his least success on IMDb. I am sure that, coming from Russia and our people, we love Antonioni for his romantic soul and his positive sense of the surrounding reality.
