Shawn Michaels vs. Edge-8- Hard to believe Shawn Michaels is in the opening game but still a good match of the two men, Edge, whether you like it or not, is a great artist in the ring, and Shawn Michaels is just right age when it comes to his performance The Undertaker vs. Heidenreich. Coffin Match-2- OK, after a good opening game, now, what a draw. Undertaker had great matches at the Royal Rumble, and the 1998 Royal Rumble against Shawn Michaels was the same type, but it's way worse than this match. <br /> <br /> Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6- It's OK, I think the three men could give a better performance, it really did not give them the best of themselves. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton vs. Triple H World Heavyweight Championship-9- Triple H gets a clear win, believe it, he takes out the Sledgehammer but does not use it. Randy Orton did very well as if he had a concussion, but the way he got it is really ridiculous. I really liked this game, it's the best performance I've seen from HHH ever since. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble Match-7 - It was a lot of fun and I did not usually score the Royal Rumble match that high. The winner is again, very predictable, but it had a lot of fun moments to watch. The segments with Flair and Guerrero are hilarious the best segments I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent PPV and a must for wrestling fans.
