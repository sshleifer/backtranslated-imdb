I remember so much about seeing this film during its original release - the blaze of peace and love post Woodstock, as well as the tension of fear and paranoia that prevailed before the Watergate. It's hard to believe it's thirty-seven years later, and I can still remember thoughts that cross my mind while watching the movie with my best friend. Like marveling at Peter Boyle's characterization of the ultimate redneck, be sure to dedicate the rest of his career to it (Oh, what an evil!) And how the counterculture has shaken the sensibilities of most country. To this day, my friend and I still use Joe Curran's sentence from my summary above, faced with a dilemma; curious to see how such a line can stay with you for decades. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read the comments of the other players on this film, especially those indicating that the film has an outdated quality and how up the characters were. Nevertheless, if you were there at the time, the photo gives a rather precise description of the polar opposites that existed at the time, roughly side by side, as the events of history reveal. If you really want to be dated, when did you last hear the words Macy's and Gimbel in the same sentence, or a phrase like Joe's - "Come on, come with the Pepsi generation". For historical perspective, you have this great Nixon poster in one of the background scenes - "Would you buy a used car from this man?" With minor subtleties like these, director John Avildsen sums up many subtle yet timely allusions to life four decades ago. <br /> <br /> Today's viewing was just the second time I saw the movie, and I must confess I do not remember Susan Sarandon in one of the lead roles, but again, it was his very first picture. The scenes of nudity and free love were something quite new and daring at the time, shocking in fact, as filmmakers began to experiment with their ability to push the boundaries of propriety and convention. "Joe" took a giant step in this regard, especially since it was a "mainstream" image. <br /> <br /> Over time, what impressed me the most about Peter Boyle was the way he overcame Joe Curran's stereotype in or in some of my favorite works. I mean, how are you from "Joe" to that hilarious rendition of "Puttin" on the Ritz "in" Young Frankenstein "? And my absolute favorite episode of X-Files has Boyle in Clyde Bruckman, in a portrait at the tender and tragic, funny and serious that overthrows the roles of Scully and Mulder more than once, and as a career barber, Frank Barone must be one of the funniest characters in the history of television Even the repeated episodes of syndication are funny as he did, each time the elder Barone let out one of his observations.He is an actor that is already lacking in this viewer.
