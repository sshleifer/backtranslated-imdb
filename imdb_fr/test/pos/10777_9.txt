Oliver Stone hits the mark with this film, helped mainly by Bogosian's electrifying screen presence and brilliant, brilliant screenplay. Every moment is crackling with increasing tension, culminating in a memorable cinematic experience. If it has already appeared that the scriptwriter and director have the ability to merge two very unstable temperaments to create a seamless union of creativity, then that's it! The result is an outstanding achievement, made more timely perhaps because of the troubling fascination of our culture for celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame. <br /> <br /> A final indictment of the growing morbidity and self-righteous hunger of our society for the next big thrill. <br /> <br /> A film difficult to forget. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the dark side of human nature.
