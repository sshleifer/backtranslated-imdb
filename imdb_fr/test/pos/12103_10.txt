Like many other commentators here, I was expecting a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity - and I have more than I asked. I've heard and seen a powerful, exquisite, sometimes captivating, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (indeed) and absolutely breathtaking mix of music and musicians. It reminded me of many forms of Indian music (East Indies) but at the same time, it was very very different. <br /> <br /> From the first title of Baba Zula to the Kurdish singer Aynur (which voice) to Siyasiyabend at the jam session (or 'Jugalbandhi' as it is called in India) in the small Turkish bar ft . Selim Seslar (big fan now :)), I enjoyed every minute and wished it did not end. /> <br /> One of the best comments on music I have seen and heard for a long time. <br /> <br /> I want a CD of the soundtrack and I hope to find it online somewhere soon as well as for the old and last albums of Baba Zula. <br /> <br /> A day later, the music is still engraved in my head and I do not want it to disappear. Turkey and especially Istanbul now seem so beautiful and exciting places - and I will start saving today to pick them up. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin - it's a jewel.
