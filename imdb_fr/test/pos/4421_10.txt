OK, so I liked Rachael Ray before, but now I love it! What an innovation I love the fact that she has a kitchen section - I admit that from time to time I skip this part, only because it makes me too hungry! But I also like the fact that you can get the next day's grocery list on his website. I like the fact that she has regular assistants and that she has made some of her viewers become her regulars. I like his personality and his creativity. I also like the way she fulfills her mystery guests. She seems so much more authentic than many other talk show hosts. She still has a little star and I love it. I love that she talks about her personal life there and reminds people how happy she is. She even mentioned tabloids before and it's so funny! She also has the funniest stories! Anyway, I'm a fan of life. Even my 2 year old son knows who Rachael Ray is and he loves him too!
