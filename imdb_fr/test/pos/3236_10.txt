VHS - I watched this over and over again and I loved every minute that I ordered the DVD. I only wish the film would last longer. I never worry about what others think I prefer to make my own decision and totally disagree with the negative comments and I will not let others ruin my enjoyment of the film. Make your own idea and do not let others put you off! I have all Jane Austen series on the BBC but it's my favorite. I see there must be a NEW Northanger Abbey released in 2007 that I will buy when it comes out, but that will not stop me from looking at Northanger Abbey out in the 80's.
