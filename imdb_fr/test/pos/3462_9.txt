As a "physically disabled" person (god, as I hate this phrase), I came across a cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch - all in all, it was a fantastic movie. yes, I was a little disappointed to find that no actor was disabled, and yes, I was a little disappointed that more films were not shot from the "real" point of view of the disabled (Can you imagine what it's like to be always the biggest person in the room and then have to live the rest of your life without seeing anything other than the butts and forks of others? idiot stop reading the newspaper in the only stand reserved for the disabled, enduring the gross bodily expulsions of all the others while you wait?). and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me! been there, done that, literally. but the film was true enough to be important - although I have never lived in a house or assisted living, there have been many times throughout the film where I found myself nodding and to tell me "Yeah, that's right ... it happened to me ...." What impressed me was that some of the commentators of this forum expressed the fact that the film allowed to see life a little differently and with a little more insight than the life of a silent "minority" - may "Do not ask for more than that in a movie, that makes you think and see life differently, in this case, the film has been enormously successful and should be asked of all students in the first cycle of secondary school. <br /> <br /> practically for all physically disabled people, independence is the only one of the priorities, if not the most important of our everyday life, from work to socialization to recreate. for those of you who felt that the movie was "clich√©", try to live our lives one day - you will see that the movie was "cliche" because ..... that's true . the challenges the actors have faced have only touched the surface of what happens to us every day - if we are lucky, we experience the same emotional and personal growth as the three characters (including the girl). Every day, we face obstacles to overcome - it's just that there is no dramatic and swelling music that accompanies our lives, unless it's in our ipods ... lol!
