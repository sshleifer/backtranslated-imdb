I enjoyed it a bit, but I have friends who hated it. There is no sex, but there is very little nudity in the episodes - which is a good thing. In addition, Keitaro has a toilet fixture that has been explored in at least half of the episodes. (The toilets are much more sophisticated in Japan.) Hmm, I wonder why I thought it was so high ...? It's certainly not that I love nude cartoons. In some ways, Keitaro Oe (the protagonist) is analogous to Johnny Bravo, except that instead of being an odious and muscular villain, Keitaro is a hyperactive nerd. Or you can think of it as Japan's answer to Leisure Suit Larry. It's easier to take if you watch it subtitled rather than dubbed, but it pushes you anyway if you give it a chance. He is the Goldenboy. <br /> <br /> The formula is the same for each episode. A boy meets a girl, a boy tries to win the heart of a girl despite his status as a pervert, but he succeeds anyway. Generally, the girl does not realize that she loves Keitaro as long as she is not thoroughly beaten and / or failed to make a spectacular tour de force, such as designing a modern operating system in one. week or win a race against a gas motorcycle using his bike. Episode 1 presents a rich software tycoon. I think that the animation of her breasts has considerably reduced the budget because she is the only woman to have this kind of animation. She also dresses completely unprofessionally. Most people who rate it negatively have probably never gone through the first episode. <br /> <br /> Episode 2 has a rich, young girl who likes to tease. She's only 16, but that's the legal age in Japan (and in some US states, I might add). His father is also a type of brutal yakuzza who has the reputation of killing guys interested in his daughter. <br /> <br /> Girl # 3 is the innocent sweet girl of a noodle shop owner who has mingled with a bad boyfriend. Aside from Keitaro's interference with the girl and being kissed by a guy, there is almost no ecchi in this episode - a sharp drop from the previous two. Nevertheless, Keitaro and his evil boyfriend are really fighting each other. <br /> <br /> In episode 4, Keitaro tries to impress a top-notch swimming coach. Keitaro seems more "direct" about her intentions with this particular girl than any other ... and she's pretty direct in return ... <br /> <br /> Girl # 5 is the biker. She is probably the heaviest of the 6 (though not super-flirty like girl 1) and the most racy in terms of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is by far the most exaggerated realism. Keitaro should have broken all the bones of his body at least twice during the race against the biker but I think the producers and writers said: "It's just a cartoon! We can do it all!" This lack of realism makes it a fan favorite. <br /> <br /> Finally, episode 6 introduces a new girl (who works in animation) and the previous five girls help Keitaro cope with the impossible resources and time. constraints to get an OAV at the door before the deadline. In terms of ecchi, this one is also very tame, but there is a lot of humor. The end brings together the 5 beautiful girls from the past who team up to chase Keitaro, who disappears unnoticed, apparently with the intention of raping him. Yeah, this "ALMOST" comes in real life. Someone has met Ukyo Tachibana (ala Samurai Shodown) with Steve Urkel (ala Family Matters) ... <br /> <br /> Overall, there is no middle ground for this. You will hate it or love it. If you're new to anime, you probably will not want to start with that. At the same time, if you can support characters like Happosai (from Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... or if you like comedies that lean more heavily towards stupidity but have a very sexual connotation, do you try .
