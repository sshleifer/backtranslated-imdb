Six teenagers go to an old abandoned schoolhouse where, 27 years ago, a horrible massacre took place for a night of pranks and pranks. Instead, the kids go against the vicious and insane security guard (excellently played with the extremely scary threat of the Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy) who committed vicious murders. Director Carlos Gil tells the intriguing story at a steady pace and does a remarkable job creating a fascinating and mysterious atmosphere. The witty scenario of Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers a clever mix inspired by slasher elements and supernatural elements that lets the viewer guess to the end. Fluid cinematography by Fernando Arribas uses experts in light and shadows. The dark score of David San Jose is also the case. Attractive and attractive young actors all contribute to lively and engaging performances, including Carlos Fuentes in the role of the leader, Ramon, Olivia Molina in that of panicked Maria, Zoe Berriatua in the role of odious joker Jordi and Carmen Morales in that of Sandra. The pieces of the murder are as bloody and brutal as they should be. Terrible whammy of a dark surprise ending, too. A solid and satisfying shocker.
