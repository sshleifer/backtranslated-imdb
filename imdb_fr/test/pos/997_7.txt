Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers of their time? Even an actor as compelled as Michael Redgrave once brought a disordered charm to a performance by W.B. Yeats. The life of writers is an inexhaustible source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> But, among all the poets, it was Dylan Thomas, a Welsh at the same time free, loving the freedom and loving a pint or two aged 39), who was close to the Film Industry. During the Second World War, he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote the scenario of a tasteless melodrama called The Strange Three Sisters, in which three old maidens from a Welsh village are preparing the murder of their rich half-brother. All this is now forgiven. <br /> <br /> In John Maybury's Edge of Love, Thomas is played by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. This is not a large scale biopic. The film covers four years of the poet's life during the Second World War, while he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and a former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), whom he has encountered by chance during the war. It seems that he loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women - with Thomas and with each other - is at the heart of Maybury's exciting film. <br /> <br /> The origin of this film is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson, the producer of the film, is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William, a war hero (played in Cillian Murphy's movie), married Vera while still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired by the film when she discovered a book by David Thomas about his grandparents, Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Homes and Bungalow, describing their tangled lives. Sharman Macdonald, script writer, is Knightley's mother. The play asks Knightley to sing, and her mother has included songs specifically for her. It is obvious that no film with such deserving family ties deserves to be done as succeeding. <br /> <br /> We start in London during the Blitz. The bombs fall, sirens lament, and Phillips sings to house crowds in a subway station. In a bar, by chance, she meets Thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and a child. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship that fears neither jealousy nor rancor. They soon share beds and baths, listen to Thomas read his poems, exchange intimate secrets and smoke their heads, as everyone did in wartime. Caitlin is more experienced in the world ("My first was Augustus John, he seduced me when I was 15 years old"). But it's the refined Phillips and soul that elicits Thomas's deepest reactions and eventually succumbs to his charms. In the meantime, she married Killick reluctantly, who saw her in the subway station and was instantly captivated by her beauty (if not her voice). <br /> <br /> This is an intense and strangely beautiful film, although Thomas himself is perhaps the least impressive character. He is best remembered for Under Milk Wood, his radio play on a day in the life of the legendary Welsh village of Llareggub, whose name spelled out in the back has not been noticed by polite English teachers. One day, I had a vinyl record of Richard Burton reading the poem (he appeared in a film of Under Milk Wood in 1971), and I never forgot the creamy and seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma, the magnetism of the man, is something that escaped me in Rhys' performance. Thomas appears as a strangely pale figure, even secondary, compared to the women of his life. <br /> <br /> In her previous film, Love Is the Devil, Maybury explored the hectic life of painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochists. relationship with her lover and model, George Dyer. The Edge of Love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what understanding this brings to the sources of Thomas's creative inspiration, I would say Llareggub. But as a glimpse of his egotism, his smoking mood and his general indifference to the feelings of others, he is wonderfully sad and revealing. <br /> <br /> Thomas had a good war, drinking and writing while other men (including Killick) were traumatized by the horrors of the battle. In a near-late scene, Thomas's behavior towards his friends seems ruthlessly hard. But it's not, after all, Thomas's movie. Murphy offers us a magnificent study of the condemned passion and the emotional weakening of the war. Miller is charming and pathetic as a woman. And Knightley seems almost too delicate to be real (as she did in Pride and Prejudice). But it's probably his best performance. And in all respects, the film is worthy of her.
