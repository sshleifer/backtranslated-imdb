"What Alice Found" was a nice discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, this is a combination of a road movie with an edifying story, as well as a journey to discovery. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Alice is the case study of a young woman who wants to break the unhappy life she leads in a New England city. Her pretext to leave is to join her best friend, who is studying at a university in Miami. Alice is the product of the home of a single mother, who is struggling to make ends meet, which contrasts sharply with the quiet life her friend seems to live in. In the flashbacks, we see Alice's life before leaving on the road. <br /> <br /> Alice, as her namesake in "Alice in Wonderland", embarks on a journey into the unknown to which life has not prepared her. American highways are teeming with predators in search of the weak and the innocent. Alice encounters a disaster when her car breaks down on the road and a sympathetic Southern couple comes to her aid when a strange man approaches in the dark with the excuse that he wants to help her. Sandra and Bill convinces her to come in their stuffed R.V. going down to the south. <br /> <br /> Nothing has prepared Alice for this couple to turn out to be. After all, in her protected life, she did not deal with Sandra and Bill, her new benefactors, during nights at rest stops on American highways. She is surprised to find that Sandra is not a prostitute who practices her profession among the crowd of drivers that we meet in these places. <br /> <br /> Alice, brilliantly performed by Emily Grace, is a study of how the young woman becomes aware of the new reality she can not escape. In fact, Sandra gives the impression that it is so easy for Alice to try her luck in the oldest profession in the world in order to raise funds that are sorely needed. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey plays a leading role as Sandra. Mrs. Ivey is perfect as a seemingly normal woman, one would not suspect she is doing the naughty with the clients she and Bill find along the road they are borrowing. Mrs. Ivey is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an accuser Alice. As a husband, Bill Raymond is good at his portrayal of the husband, who is actually a prosecutor. <br /> <br /> Under the excellent direction of Mr. Dean Bell, the film is not afraid to go to ordinary places movies do not dare to go. Congratulations to this director who wrote a plausible story and who put together the ideal cast to play it to our advantage.
