Fantastic documentary. A movie in a movie. I am so happy that Block has forged after the death of his mother. We wonder about the time and money spent on therapy. What would have happened if she had not had this hold? Did the therapist help him or did he simply develop an addiction that kept his bank account? The public must understand that divorce was less an option at that time. She was a housewife and was taking therapy instead of going to university or taking vocational training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation. I wonder if the therapist has ever tried to get her thinking about what she could have done to change her situation and break free? Meanwhile, the # 2 woman was exactly the opposite. She worked with her father. put an end to her bad marriage, supported herself and seems to be a very confident and generous person. Regardless of the state of the marriage, the Blocks did something good by raising three kids who could look at their parents' story, accept the content, share it with us and maybe get us to start conversations with our parents and our spouses.
