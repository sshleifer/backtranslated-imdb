If you like horror or action, watch this movie as soon as possible. If the opening scene does not raise adrenaline, someone should check your pulse. Excellent action, excellent casting and top one-liners. This is the only movie I saw in a movie theater where the crowd applauded every shot, punch and punch. Not perfection, but it does not matter when movies can be so fun. It's a pure momentum of dark comic action. 9/10
