"Shivering Shakespeare" could be considered the first classic of the "Our Gang" talkie era. To this day, Hal Roach Studios is starting to make talking photos and its success is "Shakespeare". <br /> <br /> The Gang appears in a version of Quo Vadis produced by the wife of Kennedy the Cop. The children do not find the play very amusing and are distracted by the spectators and do not remember their replicas. Among the funniest are Kennedy the cop as a giant, who wears makeup to fight a man overzealous in bull costume; and the terrible dancing girl (played by director Bob McGowan's daughter.) <br /> <br /> Several filmographies mention that "Shakespeare" has his first pie fight in a talkie. This may be true because they tried different speeds with the movie during the fight. Buster Keaton's brother, Harry, is at the reception of one of the pies. Very funny and a classic early talkie gang. 9 out of 10
