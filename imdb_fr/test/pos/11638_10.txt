From beginning to end, this classic of 1926, two rolls of Hal Roach Studios, seems to sum up what was amusing in the '20s. It stars Charley Chase, the genius of today's forgotten cartoon, and has been directed by the legendary Leo McCarey, unknown at the time, but who would make a living with Roach and move to a greener green in the 30s and 40s. Recently released on video and on record, this film is one of the ten best examples of dumb comedy and should be seen by an audience of all ages. Although his star has now virtually subsided, Charley Chase was considered the leader in the field of short-term comedy in the slow years of silences. He helped the careers of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they were teamed together, Leo McCarey and a host of other talents. It is unfortunate that we remember him today. Discover this little jewel of film. Once you've done, you'll be looking for other movies from this classic comic book. He has had his hand in more than 300 films and many of them survive. Rediscover this lost giant of a film of a bygone era and its giant star.
