Thorn-BMI stopped its activities, before ceasing to make films, they made an icy film. Use E.S.P. and telekinesis as the basis of the daughter whose father had terrible power. It was only after her father's death that Olivia discovered that her father Raymarovitch's nickname 'Raymar' had actually murdered six girls and planned two more using the technique of psyche vampirism. <br /> <br /> Our picture starts with 6 coroner wagons coming in and music to match Grusome's discovery of the 6 girls. All dead with wide open eyes in a closet. In the walls, there were all kinds of objects, the coroner's men were shooting an old man, when the blue lightning hit the ceiling, which created a circular hole that only made the film more strange! <br /> <br /> If you like extremely scary scenes this for you. Unless you can see corpses of years back at each level of decomposition, do not look at it without a friendly companion. Like "The Changeling", he has a horror stopping the heart. I gave it a rating of 7 it's in color, the actress Meg Tilly made her debut in this movie if you can find it to see him.
