I saw Conrack one night where I could not sleep and I was never so happy to have insomnia! This story of a young white teacher teaching black and poor children on a Carolina Island is an excellent advertisement for teaching and helping one another. Defined in the early 1960s with issues of civil rights, in Viet Nam and all that came with the 60s, we forget that the Peace Corps and many young people decided to make a difference by helping the unprivileged .Conrack, with his open teaching style, is interested in these children as people and encourages honest interaction The class that scared Jon Voight said they had 20 years of meeting and that 18 of these children have become teachers !! It's enough to make you think that we humans may have a chance to survive, hopefully. Watch this movie
