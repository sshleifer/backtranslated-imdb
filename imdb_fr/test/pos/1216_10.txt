THE WAND OF DEATH undoubtedly awards a score of ten on one, largely because of the masterful direction of John Woo, associated with the superb cinematography of Kat: some of the quiet shots alone are worth the price of a location; there are times when it ends up becoming a home-made art film. James Tien and Sammo Hung are the kind of bad guys you can not help but love. Tien is particularly good as the wicked villain. It's a role reversal like I've never seen before (Tien normally played the role of a hero and, in fact, with his mustache, I did not even recognize it at first). The "sharp teeth" of Sammo only make an already unsavory character even more imperfect; the fact that he is also a qualified martial artist makes him even less sympathetic - in a villain that you like to hate in this way. His choreography of fight scenes is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (sooner or later in the career) as a blacksmith, and I think I saw Yuen Biao somewhere on the way. Tan like lead is nothing less than gorgeous.
