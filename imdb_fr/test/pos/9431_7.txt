Not bad as an entry into the series, full of war propaganda, but the sincerity of Rathbone and Bruce makes me happy. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty fantastic story from start to finish, how much is there McGuffin? Amazing Watson (and Moriarty independently) unveiled the unencoded Dancing Men code so quickly - why were not you surprised! The message explaining that the bombshield / enlarger was tickling me was exactly the kind of cheap stuff that Universal would play - again, reminding me that they did not expect people to see it. look critically more than 60 years later. This (and I think all other Universal cauldrons at that time) had to be watched once or twice and forgotten. Maybe they should have realized that, basically, people are not changing, that what was fun for ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a small group now (2005) and tighten up on the screenplay and sets! <br /> <br /> Lionel Atwill was examining his rape lawsuit in Hollywood around this time. I wonder if it's this particularly effective makeup or makeup that made him so haggard that Moriarty? <br /> <br /> The important thing about SW is that this is the first Holmes film directed by Roy William Neill, I think he directed everything and he produced everything except one, thus establishing a wonderful ambient continuity.
