This film would be considered controversial today, but still very funny. Racial stereotypes are based on humor and not on hate. This film strips off and shows how corrupt politicians were in the early 1930s. This film proves that it began before the 1970s and beyond when it accelerated in the United States. Lloyd is still in his typical genre here, even though his character was raised in China. <br /> <br /> In this case, the paw of the cat means a person who is a candidate for a political position but who is used by the political machine established to advance his program. In other words, they think this guy (Lloyd) is harmless when he shows up for a job. Then, when he is elected, he surprises them. <br /> <br /> This same theme is used later in the James Stewarts movie, Mr. Smith travels to Washington. Stewarts is more famous and has a stronger message. This film is smarter and subtle that are brands of Harold Lloyds. <br /> <br /> It still remains the heart of the romantic comedy hidden in the front of the film, but today's mainstream would still enjoy political humor and the end is absolutely priceless. I wish someone could beat the current political system in this way. I was surprised how much I appreciated this film and I thought I would like Harold to do more like that in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> At least we have the one -this. I think the person who is the most quoted in the film is a fiction, Ling Po. I always thought that Confusicus was the sage, but this one makes me believe that the wisdom of China was not limited to him . It is a vast field of comedy that Lloyd has undermined in this film.
