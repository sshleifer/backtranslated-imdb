Fed up with the current film production, especially American cinema, I strived to see foreign films awarded at the Oscars. That's when I came across this jewel. Slow to begin, it is recovering well once declared war. Basically, an old girl is waiting for her boy to come back from her war history, her performances, her cinematography make her much more. Why Tatyana Samojlova as a young woman did not become an international star after that she passed me (even if she always succeeded in her own country). You make the trip with her: an impetuous and provocative girl who, through the ravages of war, becomes a very sober and dark woman who keeps a glimmer of hope (her final scene is devastating). We love it as much as the camera. And the camera work! Was it the pioneer of working with a portable camera? This really adds an immediacy to the story. And the beauty of it (as when Tatyana's character climbs the stairs and stands near a slatted fence). I am humble and grateful to see this movie.
