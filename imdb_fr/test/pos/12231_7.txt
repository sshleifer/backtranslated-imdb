Most Christmas movies have a "redemption" theme, but most are a variation on a very similar plot. This film is wacky and has an unusual plot. You may have to stay in place during the first half, while events may seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as incredible as real life - Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, says he did not never invented anything in his cartoons - they are all based on real stories told by his fans). The second half begins to match the plot. I liked that. <br /> <br /> BTW, a critic pointed out that the idea of ​​not having money available is not credible nowadays, but it's perfectly believable if you have lost your wallet - which wears ticket cards everywhere else while on a business trip?
