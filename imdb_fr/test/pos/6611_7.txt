This film deserves a lot of praise, because even though I am neither a surfer nor a skater, I remained inspired throughout the documentary. <br /> <br /> The depth of the story and the development of these two extreme sports highlighted what they could do for two groups of people. The dedication these people have is truly inspiring and it is because of them that others can now benefit from what they founded and do what they founded. <br /> <br /> Unlike most other documentaries, this one has been intelligently put in place. The amount of recorded and surviving footage over the decades is remarkable and for this reason some of the greatest montages I have ever seen have been collected and allowed the subject to stay focused. The film explores areas such as success, including making new faces, winning competitions and seeking fame. The film also explores recent images of the most famous surfers and skaters of the moment. <br /> <br /> As well as failures such as injuries or burnouts. <br /> <br /> It was also rewarding to hear the experiences coming from skaters and surfers themselves and not second hand information. This resulted in a better picture. <br /> <br /> Overall, a truly exceptional effort.
