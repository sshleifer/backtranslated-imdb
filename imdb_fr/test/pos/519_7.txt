"Witchery" is a good little Euro-Trash horror thread! David Hasselhoff is damn funny in this one and unfortunately he is one of the best actors. Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife ... she's hilariously nasty! The plot of this film is also ridiculous. There are a few holes that you can not help but notice, but it's fun all the way through. <br /> <br /> The gore in "Witchery" is really amazing. I loved the part where the old bag is "sucked" into the garbage chute and ends up in the fireplace for roasting! And the part where the lady "gets exploited" by the devil was damn disturbing. I would say that this one is a must for gorehounds. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an overproduced and well played movie, look elsewhere. But if you like the old-fashioned Italian style and everyone loves it, "Witchery" should be on your shelf. <br /> <br /> I am surprised at the low rating given here! What did you expect from you, "The Exorcist?" 7 out of 10, children.
