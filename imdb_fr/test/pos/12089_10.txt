I have been away from Istanbul for 10 years. Meanwhile, I have always lived in London. When I saw the movie, I realized how much I am Istanbuler. I am not just from Turkey, I am a part of Turkey. One of my roles is Istanbul, the sound of Istanbul, the people of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Probably Faith Akin thought he did an excellent musical documentary, but I must say it's more than that. It's a question of putting delicious mixtures of music, cultures, approaches, policies, very different ethnicities in a delicious pot ... <br /> <br /> As we all know that Turkey is precise, Istanbul is still an oriental city. or western city. As one of the group members said, Istanbul is a bicultural city. But much more an eastern city because we have always tried to be a western city. This shows that we have never been one. <br /> <br /> This film will be captured from the first second. The music is excellent, the people are fascinating. Especially Aynur and Sezen Aksu. Singers, group members! It's a pleasure to see you all in a small movie theater in Wood Green.
