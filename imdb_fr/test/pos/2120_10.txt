My children, DD 7 and DS 10, liked the movie so much that they were squirming in their place. It was good, old-fashioned, rated G, fun family. This movie was designed for kids .... someone really understands them. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see Julia Roberts, Brice Willis, Garth Brooks and the other stars appearing. <br /> <As a person living in the city and inspired by the fictional "Big Texas", I can say that they made an honest and accurate portrait. The children looked like children, not superstars. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone supports this film to make Hollywood understand that we need more movies like this one. Go see him, then spread the word!
