<br /> <br /> Oh my word !! I have never seen a film so devoid of any kind of moral judgment or consideration for anything other than the death of scum! Michael Winner makes a valid observation of human desires by displaying a gigantic world of deep and damaged executions. He does not feed us just a spoon with the absolute hell that we see through the face of mustachioed Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he feeds and says: Do you appreciate that? "And even if you say NO, THAT CAN NOT BE !!!! You will know that deep inside you will know ... it's a masterpiece
