"Games? Nicotine? Fist? We are moving in a downward spiral of iniquity!" This is what the chief of St. Swithen says when inspecting the master's commune at Nutbourne. Teachers and students at St. Swithen were ordered to share the facilities at Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during the Second World War. Then there is the teachers' library. "Samuel Pepys's diary? Abridged ... well, that's something for which you have to be thankful." What's new? Casanova's Memoirs? Is not that the book we surprised Jessica James in Decameron Nights! Well, really, no matter what else this place may or may not be, it's not a place to bring neatly nurtured girls! "<br /> < Yes, the Ministry of Education has made a terrible mistake. Nutbourne is a school for boys. St. Swithen's is a school for girls. And making it one of the best British comedies after the Second World War, Nutbourne's main master is Wetherby Pond ... performed by Alastair Sim, while St. Swithen's mistress is Muriel Whitchurch ... interpreted by Margaret Rutherford. <br /> <br /> "Saint Swithen?" said Pond. "You do not mean that yours is a school for boys and girls?" he asks one of the first girls. "Only girls," she said happily. "Does that mean, sir," asks one of Nutbourne's teachers, "that we should expect 100 girls?" "This means that not only has the ministry erred in sending a school here, but it is guilty of a terrible sexual aberration!" <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford's Miss Whitchurch, as positive and unshakable as a battleship, intends to make the most of it, quickly taking control of Nutbourne, if possible. Alastair Sim's Pond is exasperated until his big bald head and is determined to save his school. In the meantime, there are 100 girls and 170 young boys to feed and places to sleep (with all their teachers). The cooks and the guards, totally put on, go out. Miss Whitchurch and her daughters are, however, able to cook. "Come on now, Angela," she said to a girl trying to stir something in a big pot, "have not you made porridge?" "Yes, but no one has ever had to eat it." "It's a defeatist attitude, sweetheart, get on well and do not let yourself be shaken." <br /> <br /> Things are not going well when Pond discovers that four governors of a school he hopes to lead arrive at all times to see for themselves how well Nutbourne is headed. And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are doing in the new - a free boys' school, they were told. The only solution? Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and their students, concoct a split of the courses for a fraction of a second to make the allusion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen has no boys. Once the parents have inspected a dormitory and gone to class, the girls in the beds hide under and the boys hidden under, jump into the beds as the governors enter. The boys are seen in rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the goalposts are dismounted, nets for the stick are installed, and at that moment, the parents go to them to observe the girls. A parent spots his daughter in a science class, then a few moments later, he sees her in a choir practice, and then a few moments later ... "There is still Angela," she told Miss Whitchurch. "Why this is so," she replies, urging parents to avoid the approaching governors. "The child is very ubiquitous." <br /> <br /> When we leave Nutbourne, everything has been discovered. The students are struggling. Teachers are dazed (except for two who are kissing.) The Ministry of Education has just sent several busloads of students. Parents are speechless but governors are not. "We are waiting for an explanation," said one of them. Pond holds his head and shudders. "Do not you see I'm trying to think of one?" <br /> <br /> The film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation to another, supported by a very funny scenario and two extremely comical performances by Rutherford and Sim. Sim's funny exasperation and Rutherford's relentless determination are so well matched that it's unfortunate that this is the only movie they've ever done together. Joyce Grenfell, as Gossage, the great lymphatic sports teacher from St. Swithen gives them a little competition. If you keep your eyes open, you'll also find some fun references in which director Frank Launder works, including a gong in Nutbourne that looks like a dwarf version of J. Arthur Rank, a slight echo of The Third Man's zither theme. . and a stolen shot at David Lean's Oliver Twist, except this time the little boy walks over, holding his bowl of porridge and says, "Please, sir, I do not want any more." <br /> <br /> Frank Launder and his partner, Sidney Gilliat, are behind some of the best films produced in Britain in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes doing one, sometimes the other. In one way or another, they were responsible for first-rate films like Green for Danger (with a masterly performance by Sim), I See a Dark Stranger, The Vanishes, Night Train to Munich, Wee Geordie, Les Beautiful St Trinian's, The Rake's Progress and many more. With The happiest days of your life, Launder wrote and directed while both were produced. This is one of the best.
