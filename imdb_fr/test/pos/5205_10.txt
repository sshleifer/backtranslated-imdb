Apart from the small budget, there never seems to be more than 50 Germans in one scene at a time, plus the same 2 half-tracks, this film is of the highest quality. Everything is correct It's the essential, I think, uniforms with horror and disenchantment. Everyone is as gray as the gray uniforms. Gray men with life emptied of them. Forget US manufactured garbage like Gung Ho, Blackhawk and Private Ryan. It's one of the best war movies of all time. Only Cross of Iron beats this for tension and history. Could we have an unedited German version with English subtitles in the UK? Without having to pay ridiculous import taxes from Europe. Most other DVDs are multilingual. Why not this one?
