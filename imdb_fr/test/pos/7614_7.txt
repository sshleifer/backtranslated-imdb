Never Been Kissed gives Drew Barrymore the opportunity to do something that 70% of us might like to do. Return to high school and make the necessary corrections. In fact, the first time for me was hard enough and at my age, I doubt that I could succeed like Drew. <br /> <br /> Of course, the reason might also be that once we leave high school, cocoon and we have to face the big hostile world there. I have known a few people in my life who would come back and stay if they could. In fact, there is an episode of law and order that explores the dark side of this same situation. A girl who looks young enough to get by, spends at least three times in high school and kills the person who discovers her secret. <br /> <br /> With Drew, although it's a mission. She is a writer for the Chicago Sun Times and aspires to become a journalist. The publisher Garry Marshall, who plays the role that Donald Trump took over at the Sun Times, had this brilliant idea and Barrymore sees a person of a relatively young age to succeed in the masquerade. <br /> <br /> The first time in high school, it was bad enough. Drew was not the most popular at the time and she did not get better the second time. Until brother David Arquette goes back to school and helps him overcome difficult times. <br /> <br /> Of course, this raises many problems for Drew, peer pressure from two sources: employment and school. What is a girl to do? <br /> <br /> Never Been Kissed is a light and charming comedy that, to its credit, jumps on the opportunity to grossly exploit and offers us a good entertainment. Drew is very funny and sweet and his performance in moments of stress for his character moves well in pathos. Michael Vartan, as a teacher of English, is what I would like more in the field of education. Leelee Sobieski and Jessica Alba play a pair of stupid and stupid kids that Drew desperately tries to meet. <br /> <br /> It still does not inspire me to go back to Midwood High School.
