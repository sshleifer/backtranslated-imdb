It's a movie that is worth watching, although it's sometimes corny, it's great to see a young Sean Astin, and it ends up being a pretty funny and humorous action movie. I watched it a few times when I was young, and now I enjoy it when I insert the old VHS in the machine (I sometimes have a copy). So sit down with this movie, let the reality go for a little while, and you can laugh and spend a good hour and a half.
