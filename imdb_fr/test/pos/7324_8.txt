This belongs to their top category, although there are others, such as Micro-Phonies and Punch Drunks, which deserved more Oscar nominations than this one. But if nothing else, the recurrent announcement of the speaker "Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard," followed by Curly's "Woo woo woo woo," makes it a two-tier classic. First, it symbolizes everything the Stooges represent. my daughter loves to repeat the ad when she is doing something stupid. Second, the absurdity of these three people as doctors in a hospital; I imagine the terror I would feel if I were a real patient in a real hospital and heard this announcement through the loudspeaker. Throughout this short film, you hear this announcement and you know that something horrible is about to happen, and the voice of the speaker stays with you for months.
