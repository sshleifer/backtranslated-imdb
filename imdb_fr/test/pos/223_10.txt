Two years after "Plane!" Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker have launched one of his stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series, a glorious take on former American crime series such as "Dragnet". Nielsen played Frank Drebin, the American response to "Inspector Clouseau". He had the same style of humor as Avion! clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed nonsense and recurring characters like Johnny, the shoe shiner, who seems to know everything about everything. The stars (including William Shatner!) Were killed in the opening credits. "Police Squad" was the first American sitcom since "Batman" to miss laughter. Many lamented that only six episodes were made, but I think it was about right. The concept could never have supported a full series of 24 episodes. Five years later, "Police Squad" was successful on the big screen when the premiere of the "Naked Gun" trilogy was made public. Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie had the last word.
