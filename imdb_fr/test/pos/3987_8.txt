Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with sweet and bitter undertones is a great departure, pleasantly unexpected for Billy Crystal. This film has different heart-wrenching, dramatic and serious underlying themes (especially with a scene with Steven Seagal). This film was both entertaining and serious, a film about lost love, about father-son, husband-wife, friendship and values ​​with a good dose of humor, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy is not always maintained as in the new classical genre of this type, but the actual message and motivation of this film remains strong. The discovery of the scouting character of Billy Crystal in Romania, representing a giant human being, is revealing and the point of view of the scene on the agent of film is fascinating. However, the focus remains on the sensitive links between love and self-learning. Eight stars out of ten.
