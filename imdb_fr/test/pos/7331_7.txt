Flipper is a beautiful film comforting for the whole family. This is obviously not a good movie, Free Willy looks much better in almost every aspect of making a movie. It may get a bit naive at times, and writing and scripting are not the best part of the film, but it's an entertaining film with great cinematography (including underwater shots) and some messages important morals. Elijah Wood is once again proving to be an incredibly talented and underrated actor. It can make a bad movie, good movie - good, good - great and good movie becomes quite classic. Paul Hogan's performance was also very good and he is perfectly suited to his role. As I said earlier, the whole cinematography was very good. But underwater shots are certainly the best elements. So, Flipper is a perfect way if you want to see a nice, sweet and entertaining movie. If you like to make me sick and tired of modern Hollywood garbage, full of sex, violence, vulgarity and profanity, you will surely love this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7.7 out of 10.
