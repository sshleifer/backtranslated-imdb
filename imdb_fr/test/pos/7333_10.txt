This is one of the few movies with great acting, a wonderful story and interesting to watch. It's about changes in life. It's about knowing how to find happiness when one is true to oneself. It is about accepting oneself and accepting others. These are life challenges. It's about overcoming reality. It's about courage. It's about love. Both actresses are very faithful to their role. The actresses had a very good chemistry in the movie. This is the key to the film that made the film. It is rare to see an independent film like this one. One could say the hard work that the film crew had to do to produce this film. I wish to see more film from this producer / writer. See the movie, you will love it.
