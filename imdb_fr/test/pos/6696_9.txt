As for some of the best movies and series, I stumbled upon it quite by chance. It was late, there was a storm outside and I was sitting comfortably on the couch when I passed a channel that was about to show one of the episodes. I just intended to watch for a few minutes until the ads were finished on another channel before returning to a sitcom or another. About an hour and a half later, I remembered my determination and I was so glad I did not do it. Needless to say, I made sure to see all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> John Hannah was brilliant in almost everything I saw him and he did not let it down either. All other members of the cast do a remarkable job. Gerard Murphy is my favorite (except John Hannah of course). <br /> <br /> The only negative side of this series is the limited number of episodes. Only 8 with JH himself and 1 extra with someone else. I would love to see McCallum back on the screens, even if it would be with JH!
