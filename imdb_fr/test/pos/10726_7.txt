I remember driving with my parents and my sister. I was in 5th grade and I was still a child. The player was closed 4 years later, but the film is still in my memory. An adult film that a child finds entertaining. It is a mark of excellence. Hoffman is one of the best Hollywood actors, and this film proves it. I love the ice cream scene that Billy put and I remember the SCTV version in his film I make myself. Remember Joe Flairty crying. Please email me if you like the SCTV sketch. It's not a bad movie, it's the story of a father and his son. Touching and intercepting, I like the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy and how the streets change. Worth a second watch. 7/10
