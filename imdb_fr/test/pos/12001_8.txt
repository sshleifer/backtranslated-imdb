or any other story reminiscent of the Leopold and Loeb affair, this movie could entertain you. The cast includes Robert Culp, with Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as students. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is as usual, pretending to be fooled by early students. Caffrey ("Longtime Companion", "Buried Alive") is excellent and should do more of these menacing roles. Basically, both friends get tired of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic perfection; attending the best schools will only be funded if they comply. There is an excellent scene in which Culp hangs up Caffrey on embers after getting a low rank, threatens to cut his trust funds and Caffrey then says to his friend, "I hate him, I want him dead" ... <br /> <br /> Everything is not going well in Beverly Hills. It's always a great theme. I believe this film was released in 1990, just after the Menendez murders. If you look at "Menedez, a massacre in Beverly Hills" and then compare it to this film, you may find interesting parallels.
