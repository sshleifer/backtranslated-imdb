I was reluctant to watch The Return to Lonesome Dove after seeing and appreciating the original. Without Tommy Lee Jones taking over his role in Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston in Clara, I thought it would not sound authentic enough. Looking back, I can honestly say that he is a worthy successor. The actors really make the show with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder and Oliver Reed all preforming at their best. I admit that the story may not be as captivating as the first, but "return" certainly has its share of excitement and accounts for the romance of the Old West in an unusual way. Anyone who still has reservations can rest assured that The Return to Lonesome Dove manages to capture the "feel" of the original and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and check, Ol 'Gus would be proud!
