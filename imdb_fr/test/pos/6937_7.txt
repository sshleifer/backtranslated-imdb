"you can not take it realistically." -Sheets <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world apart. I have never really seen anything like it. The only thing I can think of comparing it is psychedelic drugs. Forgive the clich√©? I do not want to just say that it is inconsistent and absurd, although it is sometimes the case. I mean, it makes you go through such a wide range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly that you are overwhelmed and it's over, you find out that everything happened while you were sitting on the couch . <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this is an extremely low budget, as a warning for those who, after seeing "Shaun of the Dead", consider themselves as fans of illegal zombies. Also note that it is much more "brutal" than you thought. The children are disemboweled and someone makes fun of a teenager before shooting him in the shoulder. His corpse is subsequently "violated". These are certainly not faults, and I think it's all about the movie. But if it does not look like your kind of movie, do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I do not want to exaggerate about brutality, do not expect to be brutal. "Inside" or something.) I hesitate to give some of the plot because it is really full of surprises, even the opening scene, which has nothing to do with zombies, is both a classic horror scene and something quite original. <br /> <br /> I do three paragraphs and I did not say anything at all, that's why I thought the movie was awesome: 1. It's big and it keeps coming in. At some point, you expect this movie to become another NotLD clone, a board-up-the-windows movie in which everyone stays on a farm and argues, but at the end of the movie, the farm scenes will look like a distant dream. There are also a number of urban and outdoor scenes, which are rare in low-budget zombie movies. <br /> <br /> 2. Make-up / go re is much better than ZB1. More convincing and more creative. Something funny: the first zombies really look bad. Then, halfway through, they suddenly look really good, with prosthetics and everything. Some look like Fulci zombies, others remind Mr. Tongue of the "Day of the Dead". And there are big scenes of dozens of zombies walking around. Never get old. <br /> <br /> 3. There is something strangely emotional about it. A character claims that paradise exists and that our dead / undead protagonists are now in paradise. In the context of the film, we think this is true. Although the characters behave with a stupidity typical of the horror movie, they seem to really care about each other and, therefore, I'm interested in them. <br /> <br /> 4. The rhythm is great. There is hardly any boring moment. <br /> <br /> The only observation I can make that is on the verge of criticism is that Todd Sheets offers the strangest dialogue I have ever heard. Personally, I think that adds to the experience, but I do not think he's doing it on purpose. I can not give the film a perfect score. (Example: when a car breaks down, the owner screams after the passengers, then he says something to the effect of: "Sorry, I yelled at you guys, you do not know what it is to have your father standing in front of you with a razor when you're five. "wtf?) In the end, it becomes more than I can bear. Involves a montage with Bill Clinton, followed by some end-of-year credits explaining the metaphor of the zombie. Really, at this point, I would definitely relive my drug experiences. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 7/10.
