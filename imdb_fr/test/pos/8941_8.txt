This film had a distinct Woody Allen feeling, so if you're not a fan of rude humor, black humor or retrograde humor, you'll probably find something else to do.

I mean that in the best way possible. The intrigues are numerous, the twists are enough to fully engage the senses, and the characters are downright adorable. <br /> <br /> I had a great time with this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the demon :.
