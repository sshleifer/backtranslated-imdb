Yes, I know this movie is designed as a comedy! And the humor is at its height! But the theme of people becoming less intelligent in the future may not be so pushed! I can not say that this will happen, but if we do not take care of our education system, this could be a possibility! I noticed that some schools no longer teach the facts! (Like history, geography, basic things). The focus is more on learning practical skills! The theory behind most topics can be boring but it is essential to understand how things work! In the film, there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with Gatorade instead of water! Well, we can laugh about it! But if you have never been taught that water contains the minerals needed for plant growth, how would you know it! For me, it's a scary notion! So now you understand why this topic is no longer funny! Mike Judge may not care, but at the same time, he warns people of a real disaster if education does not improve quickly! Do I take this movie too seriously! Yes of course! To each his pleasure! I loved the work of Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead and Office space)! In these he could be critical and funny at the same time! In "Idiocracy" I missed that! Most events are too absurd and, as I said earlier, very scary! I think if you're in a positive mood, you'll like this movie!
