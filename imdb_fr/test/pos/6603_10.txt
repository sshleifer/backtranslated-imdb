My son, a passionate skateboarder, sat me down and made me watch it with him. As I love documentaries, it did not take a lot of pressure. All this unbelievable story - a bunch of poor kids who dribble around and end up creating something revolutionary overnight - as well as wood, wheels and lack of waves to surf - it really capsized me . It's always like that. I did not think I would like it the way I liked it, nor that I would tear up watching Stacey Peralta tell the story of Jay Adams' fate. And just looking at Jay Adams himself ..... the genius of the child who skates and the shrug of the adult who remembers. I watched it again last night for the tenth time and I still get goose bumps as I watch it go down the hill with Jimi Hendrix's "Freedom" playing in the background. And I tore, again. Few films have the same impact after several views. Brilliant.
