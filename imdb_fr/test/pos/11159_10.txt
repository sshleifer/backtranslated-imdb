This film is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are really hilarious. The dialogues are spiritual and familiar. The tension in the film does not come so much from the plot of the "murder of a mystery" as from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel. <br /> <br /> The first story concerns characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an aging dingfer, with a somewhat ridiculous machismo harshness, followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with many kind smiles. Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters, for example when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz to be intimidating. <br /> <br /> The second story tells how a salesman, played by Jean Yanne, gives his job and his wife to find the murderer of a young friend. Yanne plays the role with a kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could better describe that. <br /> <br /> After a moment, the viewer understands how the two stories are linked and meet at the end, in a surprising but also logical ending. <br /> <br /> The film is a successful mix of gangster films that are both witty and superficial, as the director's father (the famous Michel Audiard) used to write, and the "typical French film" with a lot of psychological depth and a lot of care in displaying emotions.
