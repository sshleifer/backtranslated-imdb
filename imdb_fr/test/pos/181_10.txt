While Boris (Aleksey Batalov) goes to war against the Germans on behalf of his mother Russia, his dear Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) marries his accomplice cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) in a moment of weakness shortly after the death of his parents. raid on Moscow. Through various trials and betrayals, Veronika will wait for a word or letter from Boris, no matter how long it takes, hoping it will come back to him. <br /> <br /> A powerful piece of film boasts of a simply incredible photographic work by director of photography Sergei Urusevsky. Some of the many beautifully framed and moving shots include the scene where the camera follows Veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye as she rushes through the body crowd to say goodbye to Boris ... and does not not quite join. even as we see Boris looking forward to the swarm without luck. The sequence after the air raid where Veronika climbs the permanent staircase that goes up the destroyed building that she once called home and the scene where Mark makes his lustful move against Veronika while another air raid continues right in front of the building as the wind shakes the curtains and splinters of Light emanating from the inside are just two examples of many examples in which Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius for framing images that will last forever on film. But without the power and tragedy of history about how war can forever affect the fate of a couple who love each other deeply and deeply, this film could not resist the beauty of the visual. Together, however, we end up with an astonishing film ... just a bewitching masterpiece of the Soviet Union after Stalin's last breath. I feel honored to have just seen such a good movie.
