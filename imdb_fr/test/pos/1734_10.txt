I'm a fan of the new Who fans who call him, excellent. They are entitled to this opinion, but the new series is not yet fully developed, it succeeds. It's definitely good. <br /> <br /> First the good things. The special effects are obviously better about 20 years later since the release of the latest episode of Doctor Who "Battlefield". <br /> <br /> One thing the BBC has always appreciated is Doctor Who (except when they tried to cancel the 70s and 80s). However, anticipation and pressure were good, but I think the new series has passed the test. It's good, it's still not excellent because it has its faults. Some of the "Dalek" stories were very poor. I guess it was written in minutes by an idiot who never bothered to remake Dalek's character or watch the old series. <br /> <br /> "Aliens in London" was by far the best episode. So far, this has started a new Aliens storyline that has lasted several episodes, including "Boomtown". <br /> <br /> Now, the other bad things, the mate, Rose, Billie Piper, are not great. She's actually quite annoying, but like Dr. Who, a young bopper had to be chosen and she got the role. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is respectable enough, he started to make a place for himself. He tried to play the right character, then funny, still missing the right typing line, but he took it much more seriously and it shows. <br /> <br /> The continuity remains wise, there are still some problems that have not been solved, Paul Mcgann. It was always the doctor before that, but it was not delivered. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, even though the series is generally good, I have not missed any episodes and it never bores me, so I recommend all the fans of Doctor Who to discover and see the new Doctor Who series.
