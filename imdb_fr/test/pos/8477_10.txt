Brilliant Biographic FILM ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Well, it's definitely one of my favorites. Biographical film. This film is for me a total surprise. I had avoided this movie for a very long time. It was because I'm not a fan of Jamie Foxx. I'm still not a big fan of him, but I'm of course a fan now. <br /> <br /> Well, he deserved each of his successes. His performance is one of the best performances I've seen in a very long time. It is really sensational! <br /> <br /> The narrative, or the unfolding of the story, is brilliant for a biographical film. I am a fan of DRAMA, so I was not bored at all. <br /> <br /> I was much too surprised to have liked the film so much that I did not see any flaws in the film. I think there is no flaw in the film. Maybe some event errors but hey who cares? <br /> <br /> The performance of the woman who plays Ray's mother was also really GOOD. Well, Kerry Washington ?? she has so much potential ... if given the right role, she could be the winner of the next Oscar. I cried very badly ???? <br /> <br /> I do not care if things are crazy or not because this movie makes me crazy crying ?? And that's a lot for me! <br /> <br /> In short, a SUPER FILM ????. One of the best of this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
