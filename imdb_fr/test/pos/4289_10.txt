Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to conceal a crime despite a multi-level betrayal? Tom Wilkinson is not a brutal Othello, in the context of modern England. Thus, little by little, a web of deception begins to be woven. And we see cycles of jealousy and drunkenness, guilt and fornication. And so the web of "separate lies" begins to fail and then close again. And life (and death) continues, despite the brilliant flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives. How many deceptive paintings must be displayed in this growing tapestry? The impetus is to support the reputation, the career and the privileged relations of this most civilized corner of the world. Wilkinson gives an emotional performance, full of grace, discretion and decorum, yet of humanity, of those who have a lot to hide. Those who want clarity and openness to the path of justice will be disappointed by the wickedness of so many deceptions. And yet, who among us does not have something similar to hide about his loved ones? Nevertheless, the viewer may wonder if this canvas is doomed to crumble one day.
