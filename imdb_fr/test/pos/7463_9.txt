I am really surprised at the lack of notoriety of this film. I think it has to do with distribution companies, etc. <br /> <br /> Do not be silly - if you want to have fun, take this movie - it's a very nice movie to spend a few hours with and the music is great. <br /> <br /> This is ... girls and boys and what separates them with little history, but all movies should not be PULP FICTION if they did ?? it's nice and cute and gives a good time. The girls are also very pretty and this makes the movie even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Why did I give him only a 9? The story could be a little more convincing from the middle. at some point, you start seeing events that are a little less reliable. SMALL SPOILER: The baby is crying and the father comes in and tries to relax him. now I'm not talking about a little cry but- no - a hysterical cry and 30 seconds after the father is out and "baby sleeps" - excuse me, when and how exactly did you calm him down and sleep and be able to leave his room in 20-30 seconds. but ignore that kind of small choice, because the movie itself is not docudrama - it's fun and it should be neglected.
