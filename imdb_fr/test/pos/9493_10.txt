I just watched some episodes of this series again on very bad VHS tapes on which I recorded the series. I'm happy to have done it though. <br /> <br /> Ramona is based on Beverly Cleary's children's books and follows the adventures of the eight-year-old Sarah Polley. She has fun with her friends and family and has problems much like many eight year olds. The ten episodes are very good. "Mystery Meal" depresses me as a vegan, but it's fun to see parents trying to get their kids to eat cow's tongue! And any episode that mentions Godzilla against the Smog Monster twice can not be quite bad. I like even more "Bad Day of Ramona". Although it's discouraging to see Ramona go through a difficult day, she imagines herself avenging on the uncle of her friend Howie (a pre-Psi Barclay Hope) who always teases her. "The perfect day" is also a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lori Chodos plays Beezus, Ramona's sister. I swear I saw it on something else, but IMDb does not list anything outside this show. Unfortunately, this series is not on DVD. Why is every crappy show made on DVD these days, with the exception of something I'd like to buy? An injustice if there is one!
