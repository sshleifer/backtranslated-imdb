In the early 80's, I recorded Honky Tonk Freeway from cable. Since then, I have been waiting, hoping it would be on DVD. Yesterday I found it. This is one of the best humorous character studies I have ever seen. The Old Fashioned episode is priceless. At present (28/04/02), only two have examined it. One hated, the other loved him. If you have a DVD player, rent it or buy it as I did.
