Inside I'm Dancing (Rory O'Shea Was Here) tells the story of two young men with disabilities, Rory O'Shea, almost completely immobilized and confined to a wheelchair, and Michael Connelly, weakened by multiple sclerosis and confined to a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> The film starts in Ireland and Rory arrives in an assisted living center. He ends up befriending Michael, but only after a few tense scenes where Rory rebels against the staff and other patients, in the usual "movie style", playing loud metal music, using swear words and a general smell. His nascent friendship with Michael is cemented by the fact that Rory seems to be the only one to understand Michael, or at least want to try. <br /> <br /> Finally, after a few trials and tribulations, the petition to two, and are granted, the right to live in a specially adapted apartment. The apartment is paid for by Michael's father who had essentially abandoned him because of his disability. The two also hire an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garai) to help them in their daily lives. This is essentially where the film's knot develops as both develop feelings for it. Michael is hit particularly hard. Unfortunately for both, but especially Michael, Siobhan does not feel the same and it forces her to leave. As Michael regresses temporarily and wants to return to the Asst. Living Center, Rory convinces him to continue living alone. The film ends on a sad note that many viewers have seen come, but we finally feel that Michael has truly become independent and that the future belongs to him, as Rory pointed out towards the end of the film. <Br /> <br /> You know, I can not say I've seen a lot of "disabled movies" and I do not know if they could be considered a specific genre. But there is a type of formula for them. A person does not want to live beyond his illness as long as a liberating force does not force him to do so and Inside I Dancing is really different. What works though is that the peaks and valleys that the two men cross are probably more subtle than you might expect. There are no intentionally free moments and no "Standing and Bravo" manipulations. The sad parts are sad and the funny parts are funny. Some viewers might go back a bit to the fact that Rory is a bristly punk, his ears in the nose being the "perfect rebel" cliche, but the actor, James McAvoy, makes it real. The same can be said for Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken, it does not seem to be invoked by a mediocre scenario that tries to make the public work, but rather by a young man who is really suffering from an unrequited love. The type of pain that many can relate to their physical condition. Again, these are the types of things that make the film work and makes it poignant without being domineering and enjoyable on many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
