I do not understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2 / 10? It's really great, very funny. I highly recommend this film to all, adults, teenagers and especially children! <br /> <br /> The story is about a 14 year old who is still lying at home and at school. One day, his task was to write a 1000-word story. But he did not do it, so the teacher told him to write it and gave him 3 hours, otherwise he would have to go to summer school. Yes, he wrote it in 2:45. "Big fat liar," I think it was a story of itself. On his way to school, he hit the limousine of a famous Hollywood producer and drove him away. But the kid forgot the story in the limousine. He told his parents and the teacher, but of course they did not believe him. And the movie producer, he took the kid's story as his new movie, "Big Fat Mentor". When the kid saw the movie trailer, he told his parents that he had written it, but they did not believe it. So he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: the truth is never overrated <br /> <br /> Enjoy this great movie, you will not be disappointed. Do not trust the rate of 5.2 / 10, it should be 9/10! Believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: sorry, my english is not good enough to make a better comment!
