It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's about true love and friendship. About transforming your life and doing something good for someone else. Thomas Bo Larsen may play the same role he has played in so many other films, but we have recently seen him play other roles, which he does very well too. But what if he plays the same role as in other films? he is perfect for this role. Ulrich Thomsen is also doing a great job. These two "low life" criminals are the best friends of all time. They share everything and they do everything for each other, no matter the cost. When they discover that Peter's daughter is being abused, they put everything on hold (things you can not put on hold unless you have to commit more criminal acts) and take him to a better place. They do the best they can ?? these two men are not brains but they have their heart in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Carsten are also my greatest heroes ??
