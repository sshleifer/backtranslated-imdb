I saw the trailer and read reviews, and my expectations were low for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. Although the plot is a little off, all the actors of the shooting of this film have made a pleasant film that will make a lot of laughs. The writing and the jokes are much more literate than I expected. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors who do good work, all. <br /> <br /> The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is pulled from "Ed" and new Apple computer ads. He had just become his own actor in "Ed" and he was excellent here. He is natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who does not pull a fist. It's part of "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central about every two weeks, but it really shines in HBO's "Red, White, and Screwed". I find him regularly on the uncensored comedy channel of XM Radio. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. It does not matter whether his speeches and lines are scripted or improvised. It is invaluable to deliver one's thoughts on the anxieties of the middle class. One thing about Black's delivery, his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. It just seems like he's having a conversation with you and I think it makes him subconsciously more effective.
