I loved this film! It was adorably touching and fun. Finally, here is the story of a group of people who have difficulties, break up a little, then decide to be themselves and find themselves happy; when was the last time you saw this in a movie? Facing the fluidity of life, love and sexuality, the characters face real problems (even in often ridiculous situations such as men's group travel and explicit liaisons) and manage to learn and grow without the film preaching darkly hopeless or too unrealistic. You'll love characters who, far from being hollow stereotypes, represent real characters with just a hint of truth behind their labels. <br /> <br /> A good romantic comedy for a Saturday afternoon, and the only movie I've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends well and where no one is forced to be what it do not want to be. Much better than Kissing Jessica Stein, a good choice if you are tired of watching gay movies that have painful lessons and bitter lessons. Or maybe you prefer a good British party? James Purefoy looks frisky as always and Tom Hollander is deliciously funny. So go ahead, look, enjoy; you will not regret it!
