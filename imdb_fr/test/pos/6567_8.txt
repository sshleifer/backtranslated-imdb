I happen to have read all the English mangas published by Junji Ito. I watched the film Tomie and it was a big pile of smoking shit. Fortunately, Uzumaki does justice to the manga. I think that those who have read the manga will really appreciate this movie, because many screenshots and camera angles are exactly the same as in the manga and it is interesting to see how the characters of the book are interpreted in the film. This film reminds me of a strange indiana. The end differs from the manga, which I expected. Kirie looks like his manga counterpart, and his male friend fits very well together. Very scary, I must admit, this film looks like a feverish nightmare, like the one you had when you were a kid. Not really scary at all, but odd, if you get my drift? Another great horror of Japan, get a copy.
