In Belarus in 1942, two Soviet soldiers were captured by Belarusian friends of the Nazis. In captivity, the two men's attitude towards their destiny differs greatly. One of the soldiers manages to find an inner strength and spirituality incomprehensible to the other man. Larisa Shepitko's latest film is one of the finest war films in the history of cinema. Vladimir Chuchnov's cinematography is incredible - especially in the opening sequence, where long, slow, slow shots describing the loneliness and almost desperate nature of the winter landscape of Belarus create a perfect climate. It is easy to make a comparison with Tarkovsky's films, especially since Tarkovsky's alter ego Anatoli Solonitsyn plays a small but important role in The Ascent. The acting game is globally brilliant, notably Boris Plotnikov as Sotnikov. The film reveals an old belief in the power of religious passion, linked to characters such as Dostoevsky's Prince Myshkin or Tarkovsky's tracker. However, it is not a weakness of the film, but one of its greatest strengths. The religious content seems so honest and human that it's impossible not to be touched. The emotional richness of the film can not be overestimated; the answer is not as simplistic as a brief summary of the plot would make you think. The slow development of the characters and the emphasis on their complicated relationship with each other is somewhat reminiscent of The Commissar, another great Soviet film. The Ascent deserves a second watch, as well as a third and a tenth. He continues to provide interesting ideas, beautiful pictures and emotional complexity.
