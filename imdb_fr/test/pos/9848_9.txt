I mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be careful because of what I'm discussing, although I do not really think I'm giving anything important. The "surprises" are really irrelevant to the success of this film or the ability of the viewer to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Although not without some very minor flaws, this is a beautiful and touching film about friendship, time, uncertainty and the choices people make in their lives . At the same time, it is also a very humorous film, with small comedy pieces, mostly unobtrusive. Much of the film is moving at a rather slow pace, but it does not seem slow at all, because the film draws one in the characters' lives and, at first, it is rather rather light. Some have pointed out that much of the film seems slow, but it's such a beautiful portrait of the life of such nice characters that you could watch it almost endlessly. As it progresses, the film becomes more and more emotional and progresses to the end and the progression is managed wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Eventually, some characters decide to rob a bank and although it may be a little hard to believe, it is irrelevant. It's a great addition to highlight the love these friends share, while emphasizing humor and adding a little more irony to the movie. And, although it's not really original to let a group of old guys rob a bank, the context and the details are quite original and they do it perfectly, which makes it really very funny too, as when Ismet exaggerates ( if I remember correctly) his aggressiveness to "disguise" the fact that he is old. <br /> <br /> As I said, most other comedies are rather discreet but still very humorous, so I always laughed. <br /> <br /> The actors are probably the real key of this movie. They imbue the characters with a deep personality and sympathy and represent them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or tiny details of the personality of the characters that are removed gently and beautifully. Of course, the film deals with the personality of these characters and the way they care and interact with each other. It was so successful because of them and if lesser actors had the same role, the film might have failed. <br /> <br /> Gule Gule is not without sadness, he simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful image. experience. In fact, the film is so moving and filled with love from such rich characters that it ends up becoming a very comforting, satisfying and even happy film despite its sadness. I could watch it again and again.
