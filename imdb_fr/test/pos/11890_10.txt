I have seen this film more than once. In fact, El Padrino was one of the best feature films I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly, Faye Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa were very brilliant. a real star in this part of Kilo. <br /> <br /> I heard that this film was shot for less than two million dollars. I have seen films shot for $ 33 million that can not be compared to the quality and value of production. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa why do not you receive offers and more movies !!! EXCELLENT WORK!!!!!!!!!! I can not wait to see the rest and I hope the action will be the same. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly created a cult character with Sabeva. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa moves in every direction A scene that looks a lot like the movie stars of the 40s and 50s. I'm tired of seeing these non-charismatic actors like Ben Stiller get all those movies when he There are talents like this that have something to show. a good film. <br /> <br /> GO GO GO KICK SOME BUT IN SALES EL PADRINO !!!
