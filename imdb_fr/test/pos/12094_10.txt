Turkish culture is complete with many different cultures. different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like the turkey mix. it has mainly the same language but different dialects. This documentary shows us these different types of music with different dialects and different instruments. You can watch reports with singers and bands, their performances, their daily lives and learn their thoughts on music. the film includes not only Istanbul music, but also life in Istanbul, the way people communicate and what they eat and drink. What is amazing is that even though I live in Istanbul, I learned a lot from this film.
