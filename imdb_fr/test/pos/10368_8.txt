Although I definitely read this book by Agatha Christie at one point, I did not remember it except the name "Abernethie". Which is a good thing, because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will unfold allowed me to re-appreciate Agatha Christie's pure GENIE: the way it misleads you and pulls you the cover under your feet are the main reason for its success and timelessness. In addition to his stories, his excellent production values, his beautiful places, his wonderful music, his high-level acting, his elegant staging, etc. are the reasons for the success and timelessness of this series - and all these virtues are present in "After the Funeral". One tip: be alert from the start - clues are ubiquitous even in the opening sequence! There are also quite annoying moments, contrasting with the peaceful English landscapes of the countryside and some small touches of humor. A must for mystery enthusiasts, and just a very good movie in general. (***)
