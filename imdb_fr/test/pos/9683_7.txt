Despite the apparent structural similarity with The Simpsons - big daddy, housewife, three kids, a pet, a typical suburban home, Family Guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposed to The Simpsons. Its greedy use (and sometimes too much) gags in section is his main stay since the first season. While some have put their finger on it (the bite Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito in season 5 is hilarious), others are less successful, seemingly unnatural. And they can be boring, especially when they do not advance the story. (The words of Jesus are totally insignificant and insulting) <br /> <br /> The chemistry that exists between Stewie and Brian Griffin lends itself to the purely comic gold, so much so that Chris and Meg only manage to fill the role of obligatory teens your typical dysfunctional family. <br /> <br /> However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: The unknown story, is MINNUMBINGLY horrible. Thank God, he went straight to the DVD. <br /> <br /> Unlike tedious comparisons with the Perennial Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach with Family Guy is actually very different: it's much more politically incorrect and surprisingly more cheeky. <br /> <br /> The creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, has criticized the famous Family Guy for his graphic standards "extremely low" from the point of view of a designer. I do not think it looks so bad, however, the details and accuracy of some parodies are quite successful. <br /> <br /> In the end, an excellent series to accompany a large bowl of crisps buried in ranch sauce and jokes on the ass.
