It's a very good black comedy, with a wonderful view of how different people perceive the same situations differently. The three main characters each met a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, a different male fantasy for each of the three men. Each of the three men experiences the same situations, but when he talks to other people, his perception of the situation is very different from that of the other two. It's a very good concept, probably not quite original, but it works very well in the movie. The plot is very good, very bizarre and extreme, making it a good black comedy. The acting game is also good, none of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league. The comedy is very black, even black in some scenes, and many people will certainly be shocked, but fans of black comedy probably appreciate it. Overall, this film does not suit all tastes, but most people who love black comedy will probably like it, because it is certainly one of the best black comedies. 7/10
