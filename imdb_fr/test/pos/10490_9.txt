It's a captivating story that borrows elements from Kennedy's assassination and uses them successfully to create an excellent western tale. <br /> <br /> The film has a good score, although it rests on the repetition a bit of the theme of the title. too much. Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are superb. This is a spaghetti western more cerebral than usual, which focuses more on the story than the action, and who succeeds because the story is excellent. This does not mean that there is no action in the movie. There are many and it is very well designed. This film attracts you immediately and keeps you absorbed until the end. You will always wonder what these documents contain that everyone is looking for. It also contains harsh commentary on American politics. <br /> <br /> This film shows why Valerii, in my opinion, is in a three-way tie with Sollima and Corbucci for second place in the Western spaghetti directors' standings.
