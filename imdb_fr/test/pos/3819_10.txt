I started watching The Outer Limits at 95, at the age of 10. It upset me at every episode, every episode changed, and every week I could not wait for the next one. The way writers have managed to make every episode so well and make it different from each of them in 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, extraterrestrial and human encounters, and to better understand the paranormal and its impact on people. What makes it a good show is the characters in each episode, they really show emotion and are very good actors. What you will also notice each week is an actor / actress that you will know from a previous concert and who is pretty neat in its own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to relax and sit on the Sci-Fi Show, then Outer Limits is for you
