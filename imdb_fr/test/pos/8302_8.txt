It's a real nerdy science fiction gem! Peter Cushing adds a great personality to this classic Midnite movie. <br /> <br /> I particularly like the sound design. The strange, agitated voices of rhinoceros creatures and creatures are all a strange background (Of course, the slightly dressed baby does not hurt either!)
