I liked it. In fact, I watched it again and again, and I could watch it again. This film does not become boring. <br /> <br /> The concept of vampire is revolutionized in this film. It's a job well done and ideal for today's generation. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me anytime and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue provides great comic relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is unlike any other. I can not wait for Blade 2.
