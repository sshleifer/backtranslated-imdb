E. Elias Merhige Begotten is a unique and surrealistic representation of the treatment of religion by humanity. There are different ways of interpreting things, but the plot itself is simple: a god takes off from himself and leaves his body, his mother Earth. The Earth then feeds the body of the god post mortem, then impregnates with what remains of its seed. As a result, she gives birth to a figure of the messiah who trembles, presumably at a young age, but perhaps in shock from the terror of life on earth. All this takes place in the first 15 to 30 minutes and then the rest of the film is made up of characters in clothes pulling the messiah (who constantly shivers, or grabs) through a desert landscape. The characters in dress only pause to brutalize the messiah, then continue to drag him. <br /> <br /> There are many ways to interpret this, depending on your level of optimism and your view of the world. This can easily be interpreted as a morose nihilistic atheistic allegory about the total lack of apparent power that Christian "divinities" may be perceived to have in a modern society that only invokes their names to promote one's own selfish goals. You can also interpret it as a postmodern pro-Christian allegory, in which you view the film as showing how mankind has twisted Christ's message around the message that its original purity and innocence can no longer be relevant in a world where this message and image are used inappropriately to endorse interpersonal violence, war, totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> The visuals of this film are phenomenal, and you will not see anything like this, period. If you can, look at the original version of VHS, I recommend it. I do not know if the images are changed on the DVD, but I have seen excerpts of this streaming on You Tube and the effects are seriously mitigated. On the VHS version, Merhige got the TOTAL BINARY CONTRAST. Which means that there are basically no semitones, with the exception of grain in some of the planes. Apart from that, this film offers the rare opportunity to see PURE white and PURE black. The result is breathtaking, hallucinatory and quite disturbing. This film gives Black Film a positively faded and mediocre appearance. The shots merge into one another in a surrealistic manner reminiscent of an Andalusian Dog without completely sung him, for an effect called a filmic Rorschach test. <br /> <br /> That being said, the film can certainly tempt patience and engagement of the viewer. There is no dialogue to begin. Throughout the film, the only sound produced is a relatively constant loop of chirps of hair, sometimes accompanied by gurgles and death ringtones from dying deities, and a buzzing synthesizer texture. Personally, I find that the film is more enjoyable to listen to by listening to experimental industrial music such as Downward Spiral NIN instrument remixes, more abstract sounds and experimental music like F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works very well with apocalyptic black metal. Basically any music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film, it's PRIME for postmodern recontextualization, like projecting it into an avant-garde music performance, or composing a music before -gardist to accompany him. <br /> <br /> Once the figure of the messiah is born, there is really not much change for the rest of the movie, which means that you are essentially sitting at least 45 minutes or more away from the figure the messiah who is drugged around the desert and beaten. He is dull of beauty but there is nothing new to reveal. This helps to make filmmakers' intentions to communicate that for thousands of years people have been using the name and image of Christ for personal purposes, but can be boring for a casual viewer or a short-term person. attention. Basically, if you are looking for a modern horror movie with suspense, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a unique cinematic experience and do not particularly like traditional Hollywood movies, this could be your quivering messiah.
