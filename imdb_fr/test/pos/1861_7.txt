Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly, both in real life, play a leading role in Creation, which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's life, which preceded the publication of "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, his famous work on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research has created a huge gap, a schism between believers of his time and scientists. At the time, he was supposed to go to war with God and even "kill God". <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as an extremely devout and loving woman. A revealing scene in the beginning, when she leads the dinner table in prayer and Charles does not say "Amen", foreshadows what will follow and the profound differences between the two. She is convinced that he will be eternally damned and bring misfortune to their families by rejecting God. <br /> <br /> Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife, his faith and his even stronger reason. There are beautiful moments when he observes animals, dissects their behavior and the sequences that compose them, explaining the phenomena of selection to his children, the first-born, Annie, having a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with England's first orangutan, Jenny, playing with him as if he were a child, deciphering every look and action. <br /> <br /> Annie, the eldest child, dies later and Charles is haunted by her death, after being close to her. In my opinion, this part was too long, bizarre and long. I did not like the scenes of tripples where he seems to lose his head and is pursued by the ghost of his daughter, screaming and screaming. Although Charles thinks that his wife blames him for his deadly disease, she says very poetically: "The truth is that if I knew what I know now, I'll marry you tomorrow." Their connection is strong and unbreakable despite huge differences in beliefs. <br /> <br /> When Charles finishes his manuscript, he hands the last copy to his wife, telling him that she can engrave it if she does not agree. She continues to read night after night and finally presents him with a package, the book ready to be sent to his publisher. In the end, reason and perhaps love triumph, for he makes his most ardent adversary an accomplice. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating that Darwin receives a complete Christian burial at Westminster Abbey, proof that his Well-known, innovative ideas were controversial, but already recognized as essential knowledge for the progress of the race human. <br /> <br /> The film relies heavily on Darwin's family life, his joys and his troubles. I have occasionally enjoyed this aspect, but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary about, I quote, "Hitler's passion for ping-pong". This is true in some respects and I can not but disagree with his desire to learn more about Charles Darwin's theories in this film. Nevertheless, there remains a well-executed and impeccable period drama. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 Fabio: 7 Total score: 14
