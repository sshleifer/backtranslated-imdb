It is a happy and alcoholic ASS CUSP who speaks! I saw the first and second episodes. The illustrations and animation are very good (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character is a gun, a badge, a pair of buttocks, shooting at anyone he thinks is offensive or "guilty". So far, the episodes have had simple and easy-to-follow plots that work very well with Assy's investigations. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, plays the sobering retort for A.A. antics and random "I have an intuition" leads. The lines of Assy are very funny and intelligent, here is one for example: "I have a ball and it carries your e-mail address, do not make me hit send" * bang * "looks like your inbox comes from 'Have a little new mail.' The suggestion box at Assy Mcgee's head office is for the moment consistent and accurate. As for the sound, it is perfect, the sound effects and the work of the voice are 9/10. Assy looks like Sylvestre Stallone, Don Sanchez, the mayor, the chief of police, all have voices that "match" their personality. I recommend it to all those who want to take a few laughs before going to bed, because it is broadcast Sunday night during an adult swim. A comedy very funny, imaginative and visually different. 10/10
