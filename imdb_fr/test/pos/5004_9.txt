I saw it last week and the skit about Korean cities was fun. Very tongue in cheek and adapted to the political climate. Full points to the authors and Spike for that. The part where he forces the translator to pull a rickshaw and throw the Korean words could only have been removed by Spike. It's a brave attempt by Fox. It's a brilliant show and I hope it ends. My wife and I watch it regularly and, even if it comes up against a few other programs, we are now viewing it on MySpace. I hope Fox will devote all his resources to the show and make it daily. I can not wait to see Bobby Lee on his show. With people like Bernard Abedalla behind the show, it's on the right track. Also Mary Mae as his wife is beautiful.
