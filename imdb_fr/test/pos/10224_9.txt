I would like there to be a category to put this in other than Horror. It's just not. Admittedly, it's horrible moments, but I do not think it makes it a horror movie. I will give that movie could have been better. A million little things could have been improved. <br /> <br /> That said, I like this movie. I am often sad that people misunderstand the essentials. It has always been clear to me that the purpose of this film was to say ... things are not always what they seem to be. Sometimes the "bad" is not. <br /> <br /> Barker was at a Con where I went and he had a little chat and then watched the movie. It was very interesting. Many things he wanted to put in the movie could not be, and a piece was cut from the movie he thought was long lost. It's a piece that has shed light on Boone and his girlfriend, as well as other details. <br /> <br /> I know some people are embarrassed by not having more information about the whole "race" in the background. However, I always thought that it gave the movie a more "real" feel. I read the news on which most comics were based. Because of this, the movie has always seemed to be a base for the whole story. A much more complex story that unfortunately has never had the chance to live. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws of this movie, I think it has a lot to offer. The "monsters" are wonderful, very imaginative. Although the game of actors is sometimes a little stiff, there are some lines very likely to be cited. Every time I look at it, I find something new. Keep an eye on Boones chest towards the end. At one point, Decker stabs him and soon after, Boone falls on a card table. He is left with a card stuck to his chest. This card stays there for a moment, even after Lori removes the knife. He stays there until Boone takes it off casually. I like this. It was a nice little detail I thought. <br /> <br /> Basically, what I mean is that ... if you're looking for a horror movie, do not look at it. If you believe that sometimes men can be more evil than anything we have imagined. This is the movie for you. It's a film about how men destroy what they do not understand or fear.
