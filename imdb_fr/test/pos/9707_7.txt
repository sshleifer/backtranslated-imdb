Johnny Knoxville went crazy. <br /> <br /> In the first Jackass, he loved jokes more than physical jokes ?? his opening gag of the car and the last bit involving an air horn on a golf course were closer to some kind of extreme extreme camera? but in Jackass: number two, he's really unleashed. <br /> <br /> It starts with a sequence in which he is chased into a living room by a bull or later when he rides a rocket (a waterfall that almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion on the side of the rocket), and especially when he stands voluntarily in front of a defense mechanism and takes a wreath of shots in the belly, Knoxville is a madman. In the first film Bam Margera and Steve-O ?? notorious revelers ?? were daring, but you know it's a shame when you see Knoxville pushing them to do a stunt. <br /> <br /> This is basically a series of cascades drawn by types consumed by testosterone, constantly trying to each other. This will end up with the death of one of the cast members ?? in Jackass 2, Steve-O almost loses a leg in favor of a shark, Knoxville (as mentioned above) is almost impaled by a rocket explosion, and so on. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed because of the success of 2 and, frankly, I can not imagine any waterfall surpassing the bull in the opening scene of this film. it's incredible pictures. It's almost unbelievable, and I wondered if it had been falsified, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (Which is actually pretty scary.) And in terms of extremes, Jackass 2 far surpasses his predecessor? it also looks more cinematic than the first movie, with fewer cheese titles preceding the waterfalls made famous by MTV's original TV show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, boys have had too much freedom here, and many of the gags are just lame exercises in crudity ?? I can enjoy the occasional gaffe, but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet or seeing Steve-O take beer thoroughly (yes, honestly), becomes squeaky after a while. Even the boys from the fraternity at the screening I attended ?? who were excited when Wee Man took a playing card in the back and was zapped by a rigged chair? have been disgusted by some of the scenes in this movie. It's not a question of getting away with it as much as possible ?? it's a question of saying, "Is it even entertaining or funny?" Unfortunately, this is often not the case. <br /> <br /> But for every lame stuntman involving feces and farting on people's faces, there are some great hidden camera elements. Wacky director Spike Jonze ("Adaptation") disguises himself as an old woman and gets naked in the streets, sagging breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite sketch involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, going out to lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol, smoke and swear and insult people. It's a classic comedy pushed to the extreme with the freedoms of an R-rating. It's too bad that they had to ruin all these good things ?? including a last segment involving an elaborate terrorist joke ?? with crappy jokes along the way. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough wit and madness in this film to deserve a viewing, and the concept of extreme film has taken on a new dimension.
