... but you've probably already seen it, otherwise you would not be here. It's so dark that you probably stumbled over it as if I had done it because this little-known gem is not getting word of mouth. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you know how the scenario will move but watching our innocent redhead nurse assemble the pieces of the puzzle is a high quality entertainment. Most horror movies bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture, but do not look in the basement plays it subtly, creating a higher suspense. Note to horror filmmakers: Some of us love subtlety! Charlotte, a charming and hospitable nurse, works in a sanatorium but is dismayed to learn that she is a victim of the terrible accident of the chief medical officer and is now subordinated to a mysterious doctor, whom we all know he does not know. is not a doctor at all. . The suspense has been built through the outcome of the Charlotte events with the help of many patients, but which patients can Charlotte trust? This is a gem and is my absolute favorite movie TRUE HORROR. I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead, but they play more for the HORROR-COMEDY audience. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (Pretty tame for horror standards but there's a good dose of gore all the way through the movie.) The opening scene is classic, no other movie horror does not start better and the end also has its share of gore). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$ (Eager to fall in love Allyson (Betty Chandler) spends a lot of her time trying to seduce half the men in the sanatorium Betty Chandler is a knockout and I'm shocked that this is his only film credit). <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $$ $$ (The story is well managed though the principle takes a lot of time in Hollywood.The script has the gift of creating a suspense and never fails to place poor Charlotte in a precarious situation). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$$ (Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson, capturing naive dementia in an ethereal form.) The judge was as splendid, weighing the facts before rendering a verdict while Rosie H olotik as Charlotte gives an authentic performance that you will feel for her character.
