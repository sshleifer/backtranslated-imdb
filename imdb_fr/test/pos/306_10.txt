Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) was sent on a classified mission to Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who became completely insane and took no further orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces, it is difficult for Captain Willard to understand how Colonel Kurtz could go as he did, killing without authorization and taking war between his hands. What could have pushed this great man to the top? During Willard's long journey into the jungle to find his target, he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds it? <br /> <br /> Any movie that starts with The Doors' The End is a very good movie from my book, especially if it can follow the mood and images shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does it perfectly. I can not think of anything better to deal with it, the Vietnam War and the madness created in the minds of soldiers. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through one of the most hairy forests in Vietnam, whose ultimate destination is murder. Using only music and scores, we are immersed in a dark world of mystery, violence and madness. This film is a perfect example of how to create an atmosphere through music only. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne, of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough gaming skills to spread in our film. I just do not like Fishburne. Since discovering that he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's cabin, my contempt and hatred for this man has been multiplied by ten. I realize the smallness of that but I just do not care. Gary Oldman must be sick. Brando is excellent as Colonel Kurtz and I do not see any other actor who could have played the brave man gone crazy and have such a presence on the screen. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questions about his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the film must be Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore of Robert Duvall. Before this film I had never imagined Duvall as a wartime cowboy, but honestly, that's what I've always liked from the beginning. He simply nailed his character, who is one of the best of the entire film, as the commander of Gung-ho Air Cavalry who loves surfing. Maybe a little exaggerated but always brilliant. I also like the smell of napalm in the morning. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple and it does not take a lot of brains to understand what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz, quite simply. But it's the film's journey that is really his heart and also the disastrous situations of the war itself. In the Redux version, we are forced to witness the scene of the extensive French plantations and the Playboy rabbit scene, which adds nothing to the entire film, except that it makes a trip more long. I do not think they take anything away, it's just a question of whether you want to watch a three-and-a-half-hour movie or the original. Through this trip, the film highlights the futility and irrelevance of the war for the Americans and the massive effect it has had on the soldiers who fought there ... in fact, that's the point. On top of that, the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped to make a character like Kurtz 'crazy. <br /> <br /> A great fan of war cinema, this one is among the great classics of Platoon and The Deer Hunter. I sometimes try to compare similar films to each other, but it has already caused me problems in my reviews, because I had to go back to what I said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War ... so really to say that one is better than the other is rather useless ... although, after watching recently AN, I think it's a little better. In the end, Apocalypse Now is a real classic in both versions and worthy of the status that has been assigned to it. As one critical colleague has already said, AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.
