Recently released on British DVD, it's a good movie (as long as you have attention ability and an IQ of more than one fruit fly). Not as depressing as it could have been, this kitchen sink is as dirty as possible. Terrance Stamp is awesome, the music is sweet, Carol White is very credible as a pie to the mother who can not stop loving criminals. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is one where Carol and her friend who works the pub with her (the one with the huge hive hairstyle that falls on one eye) sits chatting and chatting about all the men who pass in front of her. <br /> <br /> The only thing that tainted what happened in there was the shakey act Carol's first husband, but if you can go beyond, everything is fine. And Donovan provides some of the most languid, mellowing and sweet-bitter words of the 60's.
