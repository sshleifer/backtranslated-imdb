I just watched this move recently on the Encore channel. What a beautiful film, an excellent distribution too. Flatliners is very suspenseful and unpredictable. The film has a large opening scene at the edge of the ocean, then a series of scenes asking questions about life after death, which provide a very strong implication in the story. That's why Nelson played by Kiefer Sutherland was the first to pass the test to die and get back to life. It becomes very dramatic, bringing back to life the mistakes of the past. Then all the characters mentioned above experienced the same experience except for Randy Steckle played by Olliver platt. Then, history unfolds in a resolution and basic understanding of life and the presence and meaning of God. David Labraccio, played by atheist Kevin Bacon, ends up questioning his own belief in God. It's amazing to see Julia Roberts alongside Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland at a special moment in their careers. One may wonder why we no longer have such a film produced. This is one of Joel Schumacher's best productions. I really like this movie.
