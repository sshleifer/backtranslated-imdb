I had never seen Doctor Who before (at least not in a targeted way), so I did not know the concept. I must say that the new show is working very well. It's funny (we must also say "Comedy" in the description of the genre, many scenarios are acceptable only because they have a comic value), it's well written and it's a very small budget. The human dimension is very strong and attractive, which is very rare in current television series. <br /> <br /> I saw the first eight episodes and the numbers 6 to 8 were my favorite so far. Even the types of stories that are too easy to decode (traveling back in time, saving dead parents and things like that) work great here. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light but sometimes gloomy Doctor - if they can replace him, I will be very surprised. But I'm ready to give the new guy a chance. There is no doubt, however, that episodes of Eccleston will go down in history as classics. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the doctor and Rose is particularly refreshing. For her, Doc is much more a paternal figure than a romantic interest, and yet there are allusions to romantic insinuations between them, which, however, are much more emotional and human than sexual. <br /> <br /> A good show. The biggest drawback is the low budget - a show like this should have better special effects. And why do not they just use cheaper effects, I do not know. Nowadays, SFX does not have to be expensive - just watch the Star Wars: Revelations movie fan. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10.
