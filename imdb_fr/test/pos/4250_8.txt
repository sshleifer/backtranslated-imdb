"Putney Swope" is a unique, low-low-budget gem of the late 1960s that would probably have been forgotten in time if there had not been two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who named the character Don Cheadle in "Boogie Nights", Buck Swope, after the eponymous hero of this movie) and the limited release on DVD. Watching "Putney Swope" is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it may not make much sense (at least for me, it was not for the first time), but you have to respect the film for his passion and rebellious shameless message. I did not understand a lot about "Putney Swope", but most of the time I liked it. The more I think about the film, the more it weighs me. <br /> <br /> The film is presented as a travesty of Madison Avenue in New York, best known in the 1960s as the advertising capital of the world. Generation X and Y members may be lost with this concept, but fortunately "Mad Men" is on television to provide us with this piece of US history that was lost. What you need to know before watching this film is that these advertising agencies were mostly male and even more predominantly Caucasian. <br /> <br /> It is in this spirit that the film begins with a meeting of the board of directors. The members are predominantly white, with the exception of Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson, who strangely resembles Dick Gregory in this film), the African-American symbol on the blackboard. Council members are so absorbed in themselves and soulless that when their president is let down in front of them, their only concern is who will become the next president. Without even removing the body from the meeting room, they start a paper vote to elect the next president. <br /> <br /> Putney Swope is elected by a landslide, but not because other members think Swope is qualified. Voting for Swope was an unfortunate attempt for these board members to sabotage any other member's chances of being elected president. With their upset plans, Swope supports and "sinks the boat", dismissing all members except one of the original members and engaging all people of color in their place. <br /> <br /> After this moment, the film became (for me) very strange and difficult to follow in terms of intrigue. There may not even have been a plot. The very idea of ​​the film seems to be an "What if" scenario, with the result that the new "Truth and Soul Inc." business would be unconventional, but successful nonetheless. The company ends up making so much money that the members build a huge showcase to keep the money for unexplained purposes. This could be due to the fact that Swope does not trust the banks, although this point is neither discussed nor explained in the film. It could also be metaphorical, but who knows. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in the advertising agency, with occasional scenes at the White House with a president who, for some unknown reason, is a dwarf. My assumption here is that some political jokes have been made, but I can not understand what. Did the filmmakers say that the president is a small, insignificant part of American life? Were they saying that the last elected (Nixon at the time) were insignificant candidates? I do not know. I found it a little strange, though, that the man who plays the president looks suspiciously like the future president Ronald Reagan. It's funny to make this link 40 years after the creation of the film. <br /> <br /> The advantage of this film is to show how consumers outside the advertising agency have reacted to new ads. Of course, the commercial had a strange and funny appeal for its unconventional creativity, but did these ads convince people to buy the product? If so, how? The film alluded to the idea that the new ad campaign had been successful thanks to customer interaction and calls from the White House. However, it would have been revealing to see average people, since this demographic group has always been the most profitable for advertisers. <br /> <br /> Although the parodies and political messages that this film could have made are likely to have not stood the test of time, this film still had many unique qualities. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X-factor that was very beneficial to him in this film. Swope's hoarse voice was actually the director Robert Downey, the voice of Sr. dubbed, sometimes badly, but which fits the character so well to be an authoritative outsider. He hires and fires workers randomly, but he deserves the respect of all employees except one for revolutionizing the advertising agency and seeking new ideas. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film was, and remains, incredibly risky, especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey, Sr.). However, this film refuses to be the victim of negative black stereotypes that would lead to the rise and fall of the blaxploitation genre a few years later. While some sex scenes may seem a little off-putting for some viewers, the main message is that a black-owned and operated business can thrive through innovation and risk-taking. Many people may not get a positive message from this film, but I just did. <br /> <br /> "Putney Swope" remains a forgotten film of a strange era, and Downey, Sr. (even despite the recent return) has never had the recognition of a director he deserved. However, if you find a DVD of this movie, buy it and watch it. If it's on Netflix, ditto. It is a film that can sometimes be confusing, but deserves to be watched for its momentum, ambition and non-conformist status, even in relation to current cinematographic standards.
