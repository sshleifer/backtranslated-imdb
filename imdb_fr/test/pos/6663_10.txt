This film moved me more than I expected and I was quite ready to cry. The actors mainly directed this film, with superb performances by Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the secondary distribution. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they spent the rest of the night with me and I struggled to shake this drama of war. The costumes and the cinematography were also magical, but did not let themselves be carried away. They did not concentrate, but added to the full effect. Cold Mountain could never become my favorite movie, as this title will always belong to The English Patient, but it is one of the top five. The story itself was well developed and remained quite unpredictable. I did not find myself guessing which line came next. A heartbreaking story about humanity and war. In fact, this film was so real that it was barely noticeable that it took place in the 19th century. It seemed to apply at all times.
