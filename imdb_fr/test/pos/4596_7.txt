Many things in this futuristic satire are theoretically funnier than actually funny (although it has a few laughing moments), but that's largely due to the fact that the studio seems to have cut the sound to better please the idiots. is mocking. Many situations are not allowed to develop, there is an obvious overdubbing of the presentation material, and the worst of all a narrator explains ALL (most of them do not require any explanation), probably because an audience preview did not understand what was happening. In other words, a movie about the abatement was ... you guessed it. <br /> <br /> It is hoped that a longer and better version of this comedy will eventually surface on DVD, and that it will become a cult. it deserves to be, but even in this mutilated and somewhat comical form - diminished in spirit, this is one of the most memorable films of the year - a cry of disgust against our culture and all the ways which he became trashified, stupidified and uglified in name to appeal to the yahoos. I watched it right after Land of the Dead, George Romero's last publication, which said that consumers = zombies, which the judge essentially defends; Yet, where Romero's counter-culture point of view (now zombies = subclass to rebel against the rich) seems desperately out of date, the judge's decision is new, flawless and far more disturbing. Just listen to the yahoos of your audience lamenting at President Camacho's state of union, just like their on-screen counterparts, and you'll know we're all doomed.
