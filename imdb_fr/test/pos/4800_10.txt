Nazarin is a kind of saint, he wants to live in life exactly as Christ taught him to do it. But it's too late: now the Catholic Church is in the hands of a rich bourgeoisie, bishops live in luxury and do not bother. That's why our hero can not follow the way his hierarchy asks him to follow. So he gets rid of everything, and on the way to purity, he is joined by a kind of Mary Magdelene and a woman who has sexually attracted her (the scene between this girl and her fiance tells it) .In Spain (c was in the late '50s), they thought Nazarin was a Christian movie! Knowing Luis Bunuel, it was downright incongruous: all his work is anti-clerical Compare Nazarin and his "holy women" to Jesus is nonsense. On Nazarin, only brambles and quackgrass grow. His attempt to help the workers on the road is a failure, he is hunted as a strikebreaker. All his words are worthless. At the end of the trip, he is stopped and offers a pineapple pin by a woman (bunuelian sexual symbol). Thanks to "Nazarin", Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the censors had no idea) and to lead "Viridiana".
