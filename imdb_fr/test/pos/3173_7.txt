I'm amazed that of all the reviews I've seen, no one seems to have noticed one of the main points of this movie, or at least the way I've seen it. It resembles a great homosexual fantasy, camp clothes, a glorified nudist Ferdinand, a sexual tension defined between Ariel and Prospero, and the ultimate asset to a group of men in tight sailor suits dancing on bagpipes. This whole approach, once you get used to it, offers you all kinds of scenes and fantastic images. The sight of an innocent Ariel attracted by a naked and disgusting Sycorax to execute "his earthy and abhorred orders" is one of the darkest of my life in a Shakespeare film. However, at the end of the movie, I got tired of the style and the last bagpipe dance was too hard to bear. Still overall, this is an interesting interpretation of the piece.
