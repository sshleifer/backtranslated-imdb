The commentator before me said that this film was the worst that was imposed on him in his childhood. I must say, however, that I loved this film when it was small and I still love it today. The film has the best current theme of family friendliness. Given the release period of the film, I think the film was well played. I only wish I could find a copy somewhere !! Of all the 80's movies I watched, it was one of my favorite movies. I know that I probably watched him at least once a week with my brother and my mother. I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know or do not know. So, if you find a copy, I suggest you watch it! It is wonderful and comforting.
