After the murder of the main actress of the opera in a car accident, her young lining, Betty, is put forward. It's a chance for her, with one problem: she has an admirer who has decided to kill all her friends and have her watched. What is his connection to opera and what is his fascination with Betty? <br /> <br /> I love Dario Argento with all parts of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan, I think. Many people, especially critics, praise his previous work ("Suspiria" and "Deep Red"), but really fear for the following movies, such as "Sleepless," which I liked. My favorite, "Phenomena", is usually largely underestimated. "Opera" tends to be somewhere in between. Some consider it one of his last great movies, others see it as part of his so-called decline. I loved. <br /> <br /> The image is clear, the music is excellent (unlike other critics, I like the metal soundtrack), the female lead is a person for whom I can feel (like Jennifer Connelly from Phenomena ") And the wonderful pictures ... Great cinematography and some amazing killer scenes The concept of sticking needles over a person's eyes so that she can not blink ... My assistant Tina thinks it sounds wrong, but even if it is, the idea is more than enough to bear fruit, and some good effects, like a knife blade rising in the mouth Impressive Jim Harper calls the film "stunning" and draws attention to "innovative cinematography, well-crafted shots and exceptionally violent murders." "I totally agree with that: a shot follows the camera through sinuous tunnels ux and the visual use of crows is very interesting throughout the story. Mike Mayo also calls it "fascinating visual seduction" and praises the "flawless editing and fluid work of the camera". It's really amazing that this is not one of the most rented works of Argento. <br /> <br /> Argento returns to the opera with "Phantom of the Opera", which fails a bit despite the casting of his daughter Asia and Julian Sands. More interestingly, that same year, we proposed the release of "Stagefright" by Michele Soavi, who (like "Opera") has a killer in freedom in a theater killing the people involved in the presentation. These are both excellent films, Soavi being rather slasher. (Soavi actually acted as director of the second unit in "Opera" ... you can draw your own conclusions.) <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this film is the length and cadence . Although the shooting is very beautiful and the killing scenes are glorious, they are not as frequent as they should be. The first takes more than half an hour, then we often meet each other. The lead actress should be constantly terrorized, but she is given time to calm down as if everything had become normal again. Not cool, Dario. We must keep the suspense low and the intensity high.
