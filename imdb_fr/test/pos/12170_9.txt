These three directors left for a good start. The three stories are remarkably well done for independent productions and capture these traumatic "outing" feelings when you're not really sure it's a good idea. I laugh at the veiled look around the dressing room of "Pool Days"; I smiled at the idea that fans of Bette Midler, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand are supposed to be homosexuals in "A Friend of Dorothy" (ie by browsing CD players); and I cracked on the "jock" in "The Disco Years" whose memory of sweet sex was now "scrambled" by the drink. Everything seemed so real. I look forward to seeing other offers from this trio of directors.
