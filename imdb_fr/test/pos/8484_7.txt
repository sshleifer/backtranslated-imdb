Ray is interesting in places, and technically he is very well done, but Ray is often slow and forgets important details about Ray's life. All that the film shows us are parts where it is at its peak, and the most successful, which is good, it's just that I wanted to see some excerpts from his old life too. Jamie Fox imitates Ray Charles to a point, it's sometimes quite strange. I must say that Jamie is the reason I went through this movie. The 1st half is better than the 2nd. It's more interesting, it has more Oomph, and it's not nearly as slow as the 2nd. To be honest, I was not a big fan of Ray Charles, so I really had no expectations for the movie. Ray's biggest problem was the excessive length. It could have been cut very easily, with more relevant scenes, other than the ones they used. I found the beginning of Ray's life very interesting, the beginning of his life. He was humble at the time and a little gentleman. And although the film may have exaggerated its actions, it has become a little too full for me to worry about. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox gives a performance for ages like Ray. He looks like Ray, speaks like Ray, acts like Ray. He even sings like Ray! It's much more than an impression, I really believed it, Ray Charles. He was the heart of the film and, without his presence, this film would have been a total and complete boredom. <br /> <br /> Final result. Ray is sometimes interesting, terribly boring in others. In the end, I was disappointed at how routine it seemed. It's not because it's a bibliographic film that it's automatically worthy of the Oscars. Jamie Fox deserved his Oscar, but the film is at best above average. Worth a visit, but if I were you, I would meet my expectations on a comfortable level. <br /> <br /> 7/10
