Running out of time is probably as close to a perfect movie you will never see in Hong Kong. All the elements click: a great scenario (French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) that even succeeds in subverting the strange clich√©, a reliable imaginative direction of Johnnie To and the remarkable performances of Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, the latter displaying his a good comic timing to a prodigious effect without ever getting into parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to the Abyssal bargaining abilities of his superior). The cast is also good, with Yo Yo Mung making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the histrionic Waise Lee (who looks remarkably and quite aptly at Andy Lau, bald) upset her wisely. It is better not to know too much about the plot going beyond the basic configuration ?? with only a few weeks to live, Lau engages in a criminal game with the Wan cop without any easily apparent motive ?? and sit back and enjoy the ride: it's well worth it. It also contains one of the most perfect love stories of recent movies and has been played in only three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of making a movie that I have seen for ages). There is also a good score from Raymond Wong. The most fun to play cat and mouse in the cinema for years.
