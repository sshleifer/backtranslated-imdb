I had intended to write a review of this movie for some time, but it's only now that I managed to make myself forget about reading others. <br /> <br /> I never had the pleasure of seeing him. filming on the "big screen", which is a shame, because it is often visually stunning, but I revisited it on video many times over the years, appreciating it immensely each time. It's certainly on my personal list of my favorite movies, and for more than just starring Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my "actors to watch". <br /> <br /> I appreciate so much this film because it is attractive. for my taste slightly shifted in the entertainment. I like my movies a little to the left of the center - unpredictable and cool. And whether you believe the story of the film or not, you have to admit it, it's different! <br /> <br /> Everyone has different tastes and opinions, but I have the impression to read some negative reviews about it. film is that viewers have never really seen beyond the surface of this film. They were caught in the technical details: "Why would there be green light in a subway?" or "Why would medical students make such a stupid move?" and failed to see the artistic and psychological depth of the play. <br /> <br /> Yes, some medical and technical aspects do not make logical sense, but if you're ready to suspend disbelief a little bit, it can be a very engaging movie. <br /> <br /> First, a note on the artistic quality of the film. Some have complained about the blurred lighting and the illogical nature of the sets - but for me, the use of innovative lighting techniques, plastic and draped decorations, unusual decorations in old and wet buildings, tunnels dripping, the use of statuary, rain and floating curtains - all add a poetic touch to this film, a mesmerizing beauty that suits the dark nature of the questions asked about life, death and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I will focus on just two examples. ; in an aisle scene, a change of lighting allows some elements of the device to focus dramatically, then fade when the lighting becomes normal again. It is an innovative way to translate a change into the "reality" of the moment and works perfectly. We are also allowed to see the interior of the character's apartments - a contrast between the warm wood, the bright colors, the golden lighting and the congested comfort of Labraccio's rooms with Nelson's white and white void. Both reflect the characters themselves. Nelson's lack of objects reflects our lack of knowledge of his past. and his carefully constructed mask that keeps his companions at bay. We learn that his past is one of chaos and conflict. He decided to leave this behind in favor of a clean vacuum. Unfortunately, the void is also a reflection of his relationships with others, a realization he achieves throughout his personal journey of self-discovery in this film. <br /> <br /> Flatliners is not your typical horror movie. Nor is it a typical drama or suspense film, it's a fusion of all, the best elements of all genres being intertwined in a complex and suspenseful plot. <br /> <br /> It's a piece for ensemble, and the cast does a great job of bringing their individual characters to life. Your immediate impression is that the characters are each representing a well-established "stereotype": the queen of feminine ice, the slightly neurotic "doctor", the playboy and the socially conscious "nice" characters are more elaborate, they take on dimensions and a multiple depth. <br /> <br /> The most interesting of all is the character of Sutherland, Nelson. Nelson is not an easy character to love - indeed, he is a bit late, a master manipulator who definitely puts his personal interest above all else. However, Sutherland plays it with a hint of insecurity that gives it some appeal. As events unfold, you realize that much of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen, a protective mask behind which hides a very uncertain and vulnerable young man overwhelmed by a terrible secret. . <br /> <br /> By revealing fragments Throughout the film, the scriptwriters, directors and actors of Nelson's complex personality gradually lead you to greater understanding and sympathy for him. The character who started out as a "fool" becomes important and valued in its own right - as you learn to "forgive" your previous behavior in the light of new information. Your journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the characters' journeys towards self-understanding, as they realize that everyone has value and that "everything we do is important." <br /> <br /> Which leads to my last comment. Although many posters here take up the theme of the death challenge, few seem to have addressed what I consider to be the main premise of the film - the importance of forgiveness and the need to be aware of everything you do, because it counts. <br /> <br />
