Black Rain is a great movie, but watch out for DVDs that are currently $ 300 each. I have the DVD and it's terrible. Very small non-anamorphic image that needs to be enlarged to a size that kills the resolution. Its acceptable. This is a primitive DVD that must be reissued. <br /> <br /> BTW, I also own the Black Rain laser disc player and VHS. VHS is a huge step forward compared to DVD! And the laserdisc has by far the best image of all - subtitles in the dark, a big picture, a simple but very good soundtrack. Buy the VHS and avoid the exorbitant prices that these scammers demand!
