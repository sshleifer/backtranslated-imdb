Let's be clear: this gives a 7 out of 10, not on a normal scale, but on a bad film scale. This is the kind of movie you rent on purpose, in which you intentionally enter knowing that it is a horrible imitation and that everyone else is fleeing it. <br /> <br /> I came in with a promise of the movie, that there will be snakes in a train, and that makes! <br /> <br /> The gore itself is really good and the characters have great roles. Come on, there's everything from stunned train pilots to teenage girls who smuggle drugs, to an electrical engineer who uses his pimp! You can see bare-breasted nudity, explosions, snakes, gore and a common Mexican main track heal her girlfriend by hitting her crack pipe and blowing smoke in her face !! As I mentioned and many others have done, the film's rhythm is a little off, but nevertheless respectable. <br /> <br /> Films like this one continue the tradition of our group of grouping and saving money to watch such masterpieces. There can be no better time than meeting to enjoy a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> He could learn one or two things from other films as refined as Alien Lock-down or Boa vs Python, but these are big shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> A solid 7 out of 10.
