What an incredible story and what a beautiful movie! Hat to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the Great Honore of Balzac. This captivating film expresses the passion of the characters so easily and yet so powerfully. I watched her hypnotized, almost holding my breath as the story unfolded toward her inexorable goal. The execution of this film was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in the understanding of the strange platonic, absolute and therefore possessive link between two creatures that are not supposed to be part of the world of the other. Both are capable of affection, but ironically, it is the most "evolved" who becomes dependent and possessive, unable to accept the freedom of the other. This is one of the most intriguing and intriguing looks about the many forms of love and an incredible study of how oppressive and destructive human love can sometimes be. <br /> <br /> Only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with any kind of bestiality.
