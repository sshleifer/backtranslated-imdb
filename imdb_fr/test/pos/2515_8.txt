In 1937, Darryl Zanuck, who had just left Warner Brothers' production management, was trying to set up his newly formed company, 20th Century Fox, on an equal footing with his former Warners bosses and the glitter palace from MGM. . "This Is My Affair" was an attempt to take advantage of the current success of the historic films shot at the turn of the century ("San Francisco" in "Old Chicago") and, in retrospect, he achieved it with rather great power. The plot is fascinating. President McKinley confided to a naval officer, but heroic (Robert Taylor), a secret mission to uncover a group of bank robbers paralyzing American finance. He discovers the gang but falls in love with their mascot (Barbara Stanwyck) and has to choose between love and duty. <br /> <br /> Everything does not go well in this vintage film, but overall, it's a good slice of studio achievement. Kurt Vonnegut borrowed the storyline from the plot for "Mother Night" (the main role of this film from the book was played brilliantly by Nick Nolte) and seems quite credible, at least in the studio's confidences. As a fan of old movies, I'm always thrilled when I come across a movie I've never seen and "This is my Affair" is no exception.
