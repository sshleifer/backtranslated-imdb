There are so many "Top 10" lists that could easily contain "The Dead" - Best Drunk Drunk, Best Literary Adaptation, Best Use of Music Not Specifically Written for the Movie, Best Use of Poetry, Best Screen Speech, Better overall distribution and finally, perhaps, best film ever made. It was John Huston's latest and greatest film, adapted by his son Tony from the news of James Joyce and taking place on the evening of the Epiphany Fest, in Dublin in 1904. It is confined, in much, in a unique place, the Morkan Sisters, and there is not much that happens in conventional "dramatic" terms. They entertain their guests; There are songs, dances, recitations and a lot of small talk, but watching this movie, you can not imagine a place where you would rather be than in this company. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is of course "a lot", a lot more. It is about love, loss and regret, these stable pillars of the great drama. In the final scenes of the film, the tenor Bartell D'Arcy (Frank Patterson) sings a song called 'The Lass of Aughrim' which evokes in the spirit of Gretta (Anjelica Huston), wife of Gabriel (Donal McCann), the ghost from his first and probably greatest love, a boy who died at seventeen in a broken heart, and suddenly Gabriel realizes that he never really knew his wife and that he was not the great love of his life, after all. On an emotional level, these scenes are incredibly powerful, first when Gretta recounts the circumstances of her lover's death, then when Gabriel's voice in his head sums up his own feelings. It's a very good cinema, monologues superbly delivered by Huston and McCann. <br /> <br /> But all the performances are extraordinary. This is a set of the highest quality and even if it would be insulting to choose one artist over another, the screen has never offered us a sound more friendly, more fun or more drunk that Donal Donnelly or if the poem was delivered with such a passion McClory (the man of the IRA in "The Quiet Man") brings to his reading of the translation by Lady Gregory of "Donal Og" here? Of course, the fact that Huston himself was about to die when he directed this film, which seems to me to be the culmination of his life's work, obviously has the effect of making it even more poignant. Death is perhaps its central theme, but watching this film is a rewarding experience.
