Born in 1946, I was about eight when I saw this film for the first time and it left a deep impression. Not only scary, for lack of a better word, this movie has been haunting me for over 50 years. The idiot played by John Larch was terrifying. The only scene that has crossed my mind for the past 50 years has been the murder of the little girl and the indifferent policeman who called her "little kid". These words were replaced when the film was recently shown on television, there may be two versions of the film, or someone felt compelled to change this heartbreaking scene a bit. Accurate or not, the film has contributed enormously to the formulation of my opinion on the South and still remains the closest today 'We came to visit a city in the south, El Paso.This booth may seem extreme, but the story is a bit more complicated.When the film was shown recently, it became clearer why he haunted me for years.With the beginning of the film, this film began gives the impression that what is shown is a made. The film is supposedly only one or two years after the incidents described, adding to its realistic credibility. The terror in the movie comes not from creatures or space aliens, but from people living in our society at the time. : The recent viewing allowed to better understand the impact that it had on my 8 year old mind. When this movie was released, the only school I've ever been to was attended mostly by African-Americans. The victim looked like a girl in my class. It was like seeing a real murder. He made a horrible scene much worse. Maybe no one will find this review helpful but it helped me.
