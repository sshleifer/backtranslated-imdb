Tipping the Velvet (2002) (TV) was directed by Geoffrey Sax for BBC television. The basic plot is a story of passage to adulthood for the protagonist, Nan Astley, well performed by Rachael Stirling. As a teenager, Nan works in her family oyster house. Everyone expects her to stay at home, then marry a suitable husband and move into family life. Nan expects it too. <br /> <br /> Everything changes when Nan meets Kitty Butler (Keeley Hawes), a beautiful and talented performer who dresses in men's clothing and captures the heart of her audience. The audience includes Nan, sexually attracted to Kitty, who does not attract him more than her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows Nan in London and through her ups and downs (horrific) as a lesbian and sometimes male imitator. <br /> <br /> As usual at the BBC, every role, no matter how small, is played by an excellent actor. The BBC has a depth and breadth of performing artists that is truly wonderful. None of the supporting actors stand out in my mind - they were consistently good. Stirling and Hawes are both wonderful and their acting takes away the film. <br /> <br /> It is always sad to remember how difficult life can be for someone who does not fit the normal pattern of society. I know it's not easy for lesbians, even in the United States, even today. Imagine the obstacles to the love and happiness of lesbians in Victorian England. We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.
