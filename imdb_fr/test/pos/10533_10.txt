I had so much hope that Teletoon Retro could broadcast that, but instead of having programs like this, which do not get the treatment they deserve, they broadcast things I may have seen several times before. <br /> <The Centurions were the highlight of my pre-teen years. I know it may sound a little clichÃ© but it's true. After Joe's Duke Joe, Jake Rockewell is another of those cartoon characters I really got a crush on. <br /> <br /> Too bad that Teletoon Retro does not see it in the same way as people of my generation. Otherwise, Teletoon Retro would be much better than it is.
