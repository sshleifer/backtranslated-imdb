Millions of gold travel by train to the US Treasury. Traveling, Lois Lane reports. On the way, the train is attacked by masked thieves. They detach the car with the armed guards and attack the remaining vehicles. This leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the robbers. The thieves control them, but Lois Lane intervenes. She pushes thieves out of the train (at some point with a pistol), but the train begins to lose control. Lois can not stop it and thieves will stop at nothing to get gold. Fortunately Superman is on the way! <br /> <br /> Fast action, exciting and non-stop. Probably one of the best of all cartoons. Just awesome.
