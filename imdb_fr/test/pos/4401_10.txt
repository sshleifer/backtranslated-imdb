I came out of a Coen movie before and I did not really know how to feel. The Big Lebowski and Fargo are the two best examples. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so full of strange humor that I had to appreciate it. On the other hand, there were useless daydreams with flying people and killer bowling balls that just did not seem to fit the mold of the movie. Still, I liked the movie and now have a copy. Fargo made me scream with hysteria, sometimes I did not know why I laughed so hard that it made me cry, but still I was. There were a lot of seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but after further investigation, they were actually real people talking about real situations. That's why the man with the shovel (or was it a broom) was so funny when he spoke to the police officer of a man looking funny at the bar the other night. And that's also why the theater burst out laughing when he later said there were some strange clouds coming in. (I also own a copy of this movie) The Coen have a way of hiding their movie and their characters as somewhat eccentric and maybe a little further from the wall. But if you take a closer look at some of those same characters that seem zany, you'll always find that in a strange way, they all sound like real ones. This is exceptional in O Brother Where Art Thou? It's a movie that is there. I mean, it's not even in the same situation as a traditional movie. I saw the movie Shaft last summer and I said that Shaft was a good movie I had seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Brother Coen movie, and you certainly can not say that about this one. <br /> <br /> This film has everything you need, from a prison, twisted South politicians, muses, references to What I can only assume, they are historical characters, baptisms bank robberies, animal abuse, religious fanatic groups, KKKs, lynchs, etc. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey here too, but I would not know because I never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew anything about it. All the other newspaper critics seem to know everything and think that this cynicism and this almost unthinking quality towards him make the film much better. Coming from a guy who knows nothing about it, I can tell you that it's still an entertaining film. From time to time, as usual in a Coen movie, I did not know why I was amused or laughed, but I was. <br /> <br /> Here is a picture of the road where three men are traveling along the way. to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he hid from his two other cellmates. He must take them away because they were also chained when they had the opportunity to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the main actors of the film and many of them are friends of Coen. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in all Coen films. It's a shame they did not find a place for Steve Buscemi but it's a different story all together. But let's go back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is also an actor and here he is not as crazy as the others but he even has his own peculiarities. His work here is quite impressive and I really hope it shows that he is able to play any character. <br /> <br /> Now, after all this praise for the film, let me say it too. At first, I did not really enjoy the movie. I found it rather tedious and a bit boring. There were too many ideas here and not enough attention to exploit them for all they were worth. But then the movie started to grow on me. It took a while, but it increased for me. I do not think it's their best film, but it's still a good movie and I give it a score of 8.5. But the reason I recommend this movie is for one reason. <br /> <br /> Every day you can look in the newspapers and watch the movies being read and tell you, you've seen them, have seen them, oh, seen last year, this is the same thing as this movie and it's the same thing as this movie. Most movies have been recycled in one form or another. Not Coen's movies. They have not been recycled and if they have been, I do not know. This is reason enough to see something that they publish. Originality counts a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And it's not common in today's cinema. Enjoy while they are allowed to make movies. Because many movies do not offer such a vision, so enjoy!
