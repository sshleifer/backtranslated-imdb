I love that movie! Evil Dead has NOTHING on this movie! Night of the Demons 2 and 3 are a total party, but this one is a classic. It's super cheesy and the acting is at best ok, but what do you want more than a horror movie of the 80s? Stooge has some of the best one-liners to hit the screen in this one. (He is my favorite character) Many people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my favorite is the end, sadly has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man is eating his leftover apples Halloween in a pie, and his throat is mutilated from the inside. The soundtrack is great. The scene where Angela is dancing is totally scary, especially after the strobe light is on, and you can see her jumping from one part of the floor to the other with each click of the camera clicking on the song during playback. The makeup effects in this movie are pretty cute. Angela had nightmares when I was a kid. If you are the type of person who demands perfection from your film, you may want to give it a pass. But, if you're like me and you really dig all Halloween, a haunted house with the clich√© of demons, this one is definitely a must.
