A charming film highlighted by the musical and vocal context, especially during the competition. I understand there was never a soundtrack, but could you, through your sources, tell me where I could get information about the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song that he sang. Your help would be appreciated. The song really touched us, as well as my wife, and we would like to get a copy whenever possible so we can play it as background music when we have our family and friends for our "Italian Nights". If you could provide us with this information, we would be forever grateful. Even if you can notify the studio contact so that we can go directly. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, <br /> <br /> John Payling
