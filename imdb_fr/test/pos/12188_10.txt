"Queen of the Damned" is one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen! The film had suspense, action and gore. The combination of the fierce and demanding attitude of the queen and the rock atmosphere of our star, very well interpreted by Stuart Townsend, makes it a wonderfully successful film that only this combination can create. I'm always the only one giving advice to my friends and family about movies that are worthy of praise and when they ask me if "Queen of the Damned" is worthy, I tell them it's worth worth to be bought. This film is a must for all lovers of horror movies!
