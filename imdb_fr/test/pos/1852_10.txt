My two daughters (aged 11 and 13) and I had the chance to watch the screening of this film last night. We were all pleasantly surprised at how fun and fun this movie was. David Duchovny was very attractive as a male leader and Minnie Driver gave him generally competent performances. Some scenes are very funny, especially a Minnie Driver scene with another "grafted" donee. I liked the fact that it was a movie that I could watch with my children and I was not bothered by any scene. Everyone in the cinema was laughing and having fun. Bonnie Hunt!
