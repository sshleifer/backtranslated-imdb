I do not watch a lot of "horror" movies, but one night I sat down and watched it with my cousins. Now we are teenagers, so we tend to make fun of a lot of things, but honestly, the cast of actors here was really not that good, especially at first. Scarlett told Jill and Tiffany, "It's so ... high school!" In the next scene, Jill passes a sign bearing the name of High School. Many early parts made me think of a cheesy, badly written and badly played episode. However, as the story progressed and the cast concentrated on Jill most of the time, I could enjoy the movie more. Camilla Belle played very well in this film and I think the other actors and actresses have ruined it. And I must admit it was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Well, no, there were no big monsters and white faces that appeared in dark corners and possessed dolls, but what made this movie more frightening than the ones containing these things is that it could really happen. And this movie really reminded me of what's really scary ... We all know that we do not risk falling on the undead at any point in our lives, but the idea of ​​having a killer at the Inside the house where you are babysitting could really happen. The only flaw of this film is that it is one of the most cliche films I have ever seen. It contains everything that any horror movie has ever had: turn the keys and the car starts, shadows in the corner, turn the corners of the stairs with suspense, turn around and see a dead body, put quickly end to a fatal scene with the awakening from a dream, etc. On the suspenseful scenes, it was very predictable, but overall I would give it a 7/10. It's really worth seeing. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is my first review, so I do not know if any of these things were a waste of time .. But just to be safe ...
