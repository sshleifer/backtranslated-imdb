I think this film is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who really care about each other. They may have flaws, but bitterness and belittles have no place for these girls. Try to find this on TV or in the usual movies. It's a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine: they wear beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Compare that with clothes in today's stores, that is, faded, faded jeans and jackets, and so on. The scenario is crossed by a black thread, but that's what makes it more realistic and more interesting. I know it's lively, but it still gives the feeling that families can stay together and come to an agreement. I would recommend this movie to boys and girls.
