John Cassavette decided, as the first film of his first film, not to write a script with dialogue, and proposes a 1959 equivalent of Curb Your Enthusiasm by Larry David. All actors know what to do and say. and even have the right look in their eyes when they speak. In other words, it is one of the most realistic looks on the generation of time, jazzed softly in its score and telling a story of racial tension. A group of black brothers and sisters is the center, one trying to get better concerts than the average strip club, and has a sister, much clearer than him, who mingles with a white man in a relationship, which breaks both sides. The film, however, is not limited to that; Cassavettes likes to see his characters roaming the city of New York (which few films did in 1959/1960) and his style of narration resembles that of the improvised jazz artists of the time. Dated, of course, but deserves a glance for moviegoers; Martin Scorsese named it one of his biggest influences.
