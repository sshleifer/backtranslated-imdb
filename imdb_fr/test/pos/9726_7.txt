I had no idea what I was going to experience watching this old 1940 film. However, I still like to see Laraine Day (Katie Lattimer) playing the younger sister role of Jean Muir (Helen Lattimer) and their mother, Billie Burke, (Mrs. Julia Lattimer). I thought I was going to get tired of the story of two sisters and a mother who were too protective of her daughters until they met Robert Cummings (Ridley Crane), who has the reputation of being a play- Millionaire boy who has a lot of is a heavy drinker who is partying all the time. One night, Helen Lattimer goes to a date with Ridley. He starts to get bombed and can not drive his car. It is at this stage of the film that it becomes a drama and changes the direction of the film, which will catch your attention until the end of the film.
