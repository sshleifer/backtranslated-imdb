... but I laughed. A lot. <br /> <br /> I saw 'Asterix and the Vikings' during a public screening at the World Cup. The sound was ugly, it was too bright to see the screen properly - but I always had a lot of fun. The names of certain characters made me roll on the ground: Smsix, Abba, Vikea ... Not all very spiritual, but in the good Asterix tradition. Some good jokes, but also some that everyone did not seem to have. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the voices of Asterix and Obelix, at least in German. Comedians are well known in the area, this is the only reason they were chosen. They do not match the characters at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good way to spend time (and if it's free, as in my case, so much the better) and to have some laughs. 8 out of 10
