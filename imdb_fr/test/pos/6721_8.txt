** and 1/2 stars on **** Lifeforce is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, so ridiculous that yet, at the time, it's strangely convincing and never the least boring . Be it because of the nudity nonstop, the large amount of violence and action, everything is together to make 2 hours of entertaining cinema. <br /> <br /> The Space Shuttle Churchill was sent to investigate Halley's comet when it detects something is hiding in the coma of the giant rock. A small team, led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback), was sent to search the area. What they discover includes hundreds of frozen creatures resembling bats and three naked and seemingly unconscious humanoid beings inside strange crystalline vessels, two men and a woman (Mathilda May). They decide to bring them back with them, which causes a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> When London receives no response from the crew, another crew is sent to find out what's going on. When they dock at Churchill, they discover the remains of the crew, all helpless. The humanoids are still in perfect condition and bring them back to London. <br /> <br /> After various tests, scientists still do not know what these beings really are. Then, late at night, a security guard in the compound feels obliged to enter the room where the woman is detained. He touches her shoulder and she wakes up, gets up and smiles in a seductive and nasty way. She approaches him and begins to kiss her when it becomes obvious that she takes his life force and sucks it with all his energy (the effect is slightly cheesy). <br /> <br /> She escapes from the complex and begins to leave a trail behind. Another man, Colonel Caine (Peter Firth), is brought to find her. Then, men discover that there is a tendency in the process of the life force. The body of the security guard wakes up after 2 hours and takes the life force of a doctor. It seems that every 2 hours, this process is repeated by a victim. With the help of Churchill's only survivor, Carlsen, they try to find the girl before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a good late night entertainment. It contains all the elements that one could look for in such a film, tons of nudity, blood / blood and many special effects. It's certainly better than a similar film, Species, largely thanks to a more captivating finale. <br /> <br /> The performances vary from decent to terrible. Steve Railsback, who is constantly overexploiting, is facing the worst. Much better are Peter Firth, who arrives and convincing, and the superb Mathilda May (as beautiful as the French actresses Sophie Marceau and Emmanuelle Seigner). May spends virtually the entire role without wearing clothes, and it was reported that it was difficult for her during filming. The fact that she is able to review all the scenes without moving and without seeming uncomfortable is impressive. There are times when she can be pretty scary, just seductive. Most of the film manages to work thanks to it. <br /> <br />
