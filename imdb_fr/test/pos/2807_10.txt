I played Sam (the bearer, Lou's boyfriend) in the movie "Dead Rail", which was later aired under the name "Alien Express". And, I must say that for my part, I loved watching this movie. As a troubled actor, it was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include in my film and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi (the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) were very kind in giving me this opportunity to participate in the production. I have made many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I consider myself very lucky to have worked with these incredibly talented people. There was not a day going by without me making fun of myself. The real tragedy is not so much special effects as the fact that not everyone who has watched this film has had the chance to see what has happened behind the scenes and all the talents that have been put on it. Decorative craftsmen, prop jaws, gaffers, wardrobes, make-up artists, framers, set designer, cinematographer, production assistants, extras, craft services, producers, directors and actors. It's a fact that Sci Fi did not spend a terrible amount of money on the movie (2 million euros). But there was a lot of time, energy, and manpower embedded in it. I now consider the film as a production that brought together many talented people for a fun project shot without complications in less than two months. It was a wonderful cast and team and I'm so happy to be apart! For those who do not know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges and Steven Brand. They are fantastic and incredibly funny people. Lou, I'm still working on my impression of Deniro and I can only thank you enough for introducing me to "Midnight Run". Todd, every time I hear an Elvis song, I can not forget the story you told me about going out with him for dinner. "Can you please pass me the hangers?" (A GREAT FAN ELVIS!) Steven, "Mr. Brand!" You are a real man and all the advice and encouragement I have received from you will always be appreciated. I miss you, and I hope you are well. Thank you for the good memories, the stories, the jokes and the friendship. Oh and miss Utah say hello! wink wink. <br /> <br /> joe-
