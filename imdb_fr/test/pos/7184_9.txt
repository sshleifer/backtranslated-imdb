I was a little scared when I went to the movies to see this movie. Indeed, it is always difficult to make a comic film and the first episode of the adventures of the two greatest French heroes was good but not fantastic. Finally, it is very fun from start to finish, with unexpected gags, cartoon scenes, no delay, super FX effects, superb distribution, beautiful scenery, all that is great !!! <br /> <br /> However, I wonder. how will they succeed in translating all French names into English or German, because it is certainly funny in French but how will it be in another language ???
