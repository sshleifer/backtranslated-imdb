It's a movie that will let you think, is it or is not it? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives the public an opportunity to reflect and interpret from the signs. That's my interpretation and my theory, and I think it's very solid. <br /> <br /> First of all, here's the plot. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the middle of a busy station. After attempting to help a woman of abuse, he was arrested and sent to Bellevue, then transferred to Dr. Mark Powell's hospital (Jeff Bridges). Prot speaks freely about his origin of the planet K-Pax and is here to report on the Earth. Naturally, it is classified in the category of banknotes and is locked in a service of low security level. He befriends other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he tells them he can bring someone back with him. Soon, Dr. Powell begins to doubt the folly of Prot and, as the plot progresses, it is increasingly difficult to prove that Prot is wrong. <br /> <br /> Finally, Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter, an intelligent man who worked in a slaughterhouse in New Mexico, when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot claims that he plans to leave for K-Pax at a specific time on the fifth anniversary of the murders. Time passes and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and never found. <br /> <br /> According to my theory, Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot's. During a previous visit of Prot on Earth, Robert was a child who discovered the constellations of his father. Prot and Robert have become best friends. After the death of his family and the assassination of Robert, he decides to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the time, but he rushes (by multiples of the speed of light) to stop Robert. So, Prot takes Robert's thought back, taking his body so to speak. A little later, Prot (who still lives in Robert's body) arrives in New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he has to leave Robert's body behind him. So now we have Catatonic Robert. <br /> <br /> Explanations or clues: <br /> <br /> KNOWLEDGE OF PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, every child knows his system. Only a few people on Earth had an idea of ​​the system and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, though intelligent and familiar with his constellations, was not an astro-physicist. <br /> <br /> DR POWELL FEEL CHOSEN BY PROT: That's right. Prot could have left the institute at any time, but chose not to overdo it. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are, "Now that you've found Robert, take care of him." Prot had probably stayed there to secure a place for Robert when he left. <br /> <br /> SUPER-HUMAN CAPABILITIES: It was proven that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual reason for K-Pax, but no earthly reason has been given. It has also been mentioned that Prot has received extremely high doses of drug, no effect. <br /> <br /> HELP PATIENTS: Throughout the film, you see Prot helping other patients (or patients discussing their suggestions) to better sane world. While the psychologist refuses Prot's help, Dr. Powell speaks at the end of the film about the new lives of the patients. <br /> <br /> SPRINKLER'S SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is she trying to protect Powell's daughter from this horrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) worries a lot for Robert. I think Prot associates danger with water, not with the sprinkler. He tries to protect the girl from the watery death, as he did with Robert. <br /> <br /> HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell thinks that under hypnosis he can discover the true identity of Prot, but although Prot gives a lot of information, he does not give up his Prot character and his claimed homeland of K -Pax. <br /> <br /> THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera give up for no apparent reason? <br /> <br /> MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared a few days after his trip north. It's funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most revealing disappearance is that of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at about the same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay. <br /> <br /> This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Mr. Powell's theory that Prot was simply a person taken over by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would give way to too much intrigue.
