I have never seen this at the theater. My second viewing was tonight on a big screen, unlike an old VHS tape from the rental store. <br /> <br /> Saucey for his time and I'm sure the Hayes code has been pushed to its limits. <br /> <br /> Hitch's palette is the "game" between two fighters. And yes, if Guy immediately calls the cops on Bruno, the film is 63 minutes shorter. HELLO, always make the choice the best or the most logical. How many times have you been in one person's place and made the right choice? For God's sake, this is called a poetic license. However, when Guy sees the situation in which he found himself, he takes the initiative to rectify it. He does not seek help and does not lie to his wife. In his defense, he has the impression that Bruno still has a card to play. <br /> <br /> For the policeman who kills an innocent person in the days of pre-camera and before the rules of engagement kind of thing has happened. After Rodney King, a presidential candidate backed the police by sending 43 bullets to an unarmed man. If you have not seen or seen outrageous police behavior on the part of the police or if you have a pending application from the academy. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie ... <br /> <br /> Look at it with. Try to wear a post-World War II filter and pretend you're seeing a big thriller like many did for the first time at the time, and of course it's been copied since, but you look at one of the sources of inspiration for many others who have followed.
