"Boy Next Door" is a hilarious adventure through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most feature films can not match. Excellent performance, excellent camera work and editing - this short film is a classic from start to finish. Congratulations to Travis Davis for his dual roles as director and star. He is the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a pleasure to see Richard Moll again. If you thought all he could do was play "Bull" at the bailiff on "Night Court", think again. This film gem showcases Stephen Garvey's brilliantly amusing writing. Remember that name. Forget Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is the real current king of offbeat comedy.
