This film was a huge surprise for me as I watched it at Cinequest, California's grand theater in San Jose. It's a musical, which I do not normally like, but I have to say it was different. Robert Peters, who directed the film and looked at it, did a remarkable job. During his questions and answers, he told the public that he only had two other people for his team! Most of the dialect was done on the fly and he actually shot the film while attending another film festival in Germany! I can not say enough good things about this film, the only drawback is that you really tend to notice that the camera works and that it moves a little. If you come across this film, take a look!
