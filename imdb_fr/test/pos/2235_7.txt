Is it a good movie? No, certainly not. But for lovers of Jolie, it's a must. His unpolished actor and semi-nude scene will delight his fans for centuries to come. The current rating however (3.2) is too low. The film may lack a good script, and it's not a great movie sf, but the acting is enough (and, as mentioned before, the game is pretty and pretty Jolie), the film is shot very directly, with a lot of end-ups. The landscape is weird. Finally, leaving van Damme outside was a very good choice. Presumably, none of Jolie's lovers would like to see her have sex with him. This film has the potential to become a cult film.
