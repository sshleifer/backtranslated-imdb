Ok, I know it's a clich√©. Taken on its surface, it's a bad movie - maybe in a category with "Plan 9 of Outer Space". The dialogue is suspicious (but the Singlish is quite nice ...), the plot is not quite credible, the character of Gavin is too exaggerated. While watching the movie, there's something going on that really makes you wonder ... Beautiful and Kim embarking on an aquarium, Gwen eating a banana in a bath, just about everything Gavin says and does (" pssssssssssssssycho !! ") These things taken separately may be faults. Taken together, however, they are just quirks. Watching this movie with an open mind (especially if you are not familiar with the Singaporean culture), and with a group of open-minded friends, is guaranteed to offer a lot of laughs and a memorable moment. You can not go into this movie hoping for a masterpiece, or even taking something serious. If you can take this film for what it is - an underdog film about the underdogs, filled to the brim with its own quirks - then you should have a good time watching this one! I have seen it three times and I would not hesitate to watch it three more times !!
