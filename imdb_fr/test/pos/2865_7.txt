I did not know much about this movie but I discovered that Kane was a wrestler, which did not really make me happy, but hey, I liked "Santa's Slay" and there was a wrestler in it. hell. The story begins very strangely and hopefully, but after a while, it's little more than your typical teenager terrorist slasher movie, although the tweaks have helped some. A group of young criminals gathered and taken to an old hotel that was once a luxury palace, but is now a garbage dump, to clean it up and prepare it as a shelter for the homeless. The driver is a man with a prosthetic arm, a veteran of the opening scene of this film in which he meets this great galoot who had just killed his partner and blind another woman. Adolescents, who are all evil punk minds, are of course opposed to having to do real work, but they are part of a unique mixed work program, yeah, what a good idea, of course. Nobody suspects someone who prowls around this hotel to save money, in his own way, from taxpayers. Of course, he's the guy who likes to collect eyeballs, and he has a whole collection of them. There will not be much here that horror fans have never seen before, but there are some brutal scenes and enough gore to satisfy the hardcore fan. The setting of the old hotel is also the perfect place for a slasher movie. There are few sub-stories, such as looking for a so-called safe full of money and looking for babes, since this mixed work team is tied. Most teenagers can also be killed so it works well. Not great, but much better than Silent Hill or When A Stranger, and maybe better than other bullshit I would not have bothered to see. 7 out of 10
