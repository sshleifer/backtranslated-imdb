When Inspector Carrella goes to the city to investigate the murder of her cousin, Patricia Newell is attacked. Identifying the murderer after an intense manhunt, Patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country.The case is closed ... or is "Blood Relatives" is a neglected masterpiece. Donald Sutherland plays the role of a cop and it is nice to see Donald Pleasance play a small role as a pedophile. The conclusion is quite disturbing.
