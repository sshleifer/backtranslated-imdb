Goldrush: a real life Alaskan Adventure is an excellent TV movie for all ages. The film focuses on "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on a trip for gold in Alaska. The only person who hires him is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This TV movie was just great. The acting game is No. 1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV movie to all without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
