I am surprised to have a real affection for this one, insofar as I am not an amateur of action or adventure. But hey ... It's pretty hard to be wrong with a Robert Carlyle movie. I've read several mediocre or moderate reviews about this film, distinguishing it for its period errors or its improbable development, but no one seems to be talking about the rather intriguing character transition that staged a hard and courageous hoax. (Carlyle) turns into a rather noble and altruistic hero and how the handsome, cowardly vagabond (Miller) develops a true taste for the life of a man of the road once he "feels it". Filled with a lot of bad boy humor, sumptuous scenes (especially the use of "fireworks" from the former apothacary Plunkett) and a charming and eclectic musical score, Plunkett & Macleane is a cinematic piece fast and extremely pleasant. THAT ONLY THE CLIMAX SCENE Shoot 'em up, boys!
