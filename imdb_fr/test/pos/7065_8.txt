I can hardly call it a great movie but it's fun. In my case, at the time of the release of this film, I was the same age as some junior campers of the film. For me, watching this movie reminds me of the memories of my years of camp. Some of the pranks of this film, such as wearing the camp director in his bed and leaving him at the edge of a road, hanging in the trees or at the edge of a lake, are a little above the other pranks are not not. When I went camping, campers and instructors performed similar stunts, like running under the undergarments, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls' hut. As I grew older, I realized that these night raids in the cabin I attended were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we would not find the girls in embarrassing situations, but at the time I thought that was real and fun. This is what MEATBALLS (MB) is. <br /> <br /> MB captures not only the beauty of the camp's landscapes but also the beauty of being young and carefree. MB gives a good example of teenagers, teens and adults who live their summer without worries, except boys and girls who exchange sex and have fun before returning to high school. high school and college. The opening title titled "Are you ready for the summer? ... no more homework, more books, more teachers looking dirty ..." describes exactly how summer is is perceived by schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed both Spaz and Fink campers. What boy, nerd or jock, did not spend the whole camp trying to get comfortable with a pretty camper? Which guy did not want to be accepted by other campers and counselors? Although these two characters are a little exaggerated, I bet that all those who watch the film can not help but love these two types. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from THREE'S COMPANY. I would bet that most viewers even support Spaz in the egg-carrying competition and Fink who is trying to "beat the stomach" as part of the hot dog contest. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film had children and normal counselors. No great templates for counselors or campers who wore fashionable clothes. It's fun to watch this movie and remember when life was as fun as this movie.
