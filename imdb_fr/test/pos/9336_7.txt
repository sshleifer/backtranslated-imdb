In 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a $ 1 million horror clip with the "American Werewolf" team and interpret Vincent Price's voice, that was exactly what he was going to do it. And never before has a music video made such a sensation or since ... when it was released in VHS, this 13-minute short film has become the best-selling musical in the world of all time. But it's a safe bet that you already know everything about it, because whenever there is a list of the greatest video clips of all time, it almost always takes first place. <br /> <br /> It starts with Michael Jackson coming down in the dark street with his date after their car breaks down. He explains that he "does not look like other men" (damn true), then the full moon appears behind the clouds. His girlfriend is standing there screaming, shouting, and screaming again, during a lavish transformation sequence as Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He chases her through the forest, catches up with her and we ... go to the movies. Ah, all this is happening in a horror movie that Michael Jackson and his date are watching. <br /> <br /> We are therefore at five minutes and we still have no sign of the song "Thriller". Extravagant, a lot? Anyway, you have to know how it's going from here ... to dance, to sing ... to the cemetery ... Vincent Price ... zombies ... "What's the problem?" ... then end of credits. End credits for a friggin music video. "Thriller" is not one of Michael Jackon's most memorable songs, but even by today's standards, it's definitely a bit of a visual experience. If you still have not seen it in full, you should do it soon.
