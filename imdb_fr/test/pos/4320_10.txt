* May contain spoilers, to read only after watching the last episode of season 2 * Think about it. The guys from the North Pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: "Have we missed again?" So, there was another anomaly? Of course it was when the plain crashed! I think this whole island is an installation. Set up by his dad. She discovered it and looks for Desmond. If not, how can she know what to look for. <br /> <br /> So, basically, it's an island in a magnetic shield. Everything is false. All the signs are there. False beards, false doors, fake medicines, false observation stations, with false air-wells that lead to nothing. It's a project, and because of the final scene of season 2, I know it has to do something with Desmond, her chick and her dad (and probably Libby, she's weird, maybe she's really something to do with the crash of the plane, OK, now I'm moving away). <br /> <br /> Also in this episode, Henry Gail tells Michael to go to certain coordinates, and he will find their help. It's probably a kind of door in the magnetic shield. "Once you are gone, you can not go back." <br /> <br /> I think it's pretty obvious, despite the many questions I still have and hoping to get answers for next season. If you think back to what we learned in seasons 1 and 2, I'm sure we'll have a lot of answers during season 3. <br /> <br /> You can not wait. <br /> <br /> Can anyone agree on this theory? I hope hearing from you...
