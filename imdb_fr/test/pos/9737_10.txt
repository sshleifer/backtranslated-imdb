I loved "Flash Gordon" when I was a child and watching the series again on DVD reminds me of such good memories. Each 15-minute episode features the adventures of our Flash hero, the beautiful Dale Arden and the intrepid Dr. Zarkov on Planet Mongo. Flash escapes death at every turn: The Shark Men almost drowns him, he faces the fire monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and he is in danger of death in the static room! <br /> <br /> The characters are always fun: Buster Crabbe is the blond hero of dreamboat and Jean Rogers is a delicate and handsome Dale Arden. Princess Aura is still looking to steal Flash for herself, the King Vultan of the Hawk Men still has her bright laugh and angel wings, and Ming the ruthless, emperor of the universe, continues to give everyone the bad eye and the creeps. <br /> <br /> This series probably would not interest today's kids with its hokey effects - oh, this spaceship! - but it's a bit of fun nostalgia for those who loved it the first time. The actors play directly and do not minimize the children. I appreciate the fact that the young viewers were supposed to read the synopses of the chapters that contained big words. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it was released on DVD. It's very funny to come back to this classic science fiction series.
