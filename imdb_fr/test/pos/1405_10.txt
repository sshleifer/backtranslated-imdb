An impetuous and egocentric army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a wise and dangerous attitude towards the body. <br /> <br /> William Haines perfectly embodies his tailor-made role in this entertaining tale of honor. & friendship. A Grade A thief, Haines during the first half of the film lives up to his usual Silly Billy behavior, which, under normal circumstances, should have kept him confined to the guard post. The last half, however, becomes very serious, leading to the moral redemption of Haines and giving him a great opportunity to show his acting skills. If WEST POINT does not quite reach the caliber of Haines's TELL IT TO THE MARINES (1926), it is probably because of the lack of a costar of the charisma and the quality of Lon Chaney with which Haines could interact. However, this tribute to the military is a very effective entertainment and must be appreciated individually. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford appears as Haines' love interest, playing the role of the local innkeeper's virgin. Joan is flirtatious and pretty and shines especially in her first scenes, when she meets Haines on a ferry from the Hudson River and is subjected to her usual immature antics. Haines & Crawford have shot five silent feature films together and have been great friends for life. He was much bigger celebrity at this time and gave him many hints to move on to Hollywood. A superstar herself in the early 1930s, she reciprocated after her ousting of MGM in 1932 by encouraging her career change in interior design. <br /> <br /> Little William Bakewell is actually interpreted as a Plebe who idolizes Haines; their relationship is actually more emotionally treated than that of Haines & Crawford. <br /> <br /> The film was shot with the full cooperation of the War Department. The many filming filmed at the Academy contribute enormously to the atmosphere of the production, which was magnificently valorized by MGM. <br /> <br /> WEST POINT has recently been restored and receives a new catchy score from David Davidson.
