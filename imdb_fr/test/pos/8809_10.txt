If you "went" and "did that", you'll love this movie. I mean, I mean underground clubs and house parties where it's much more rare to find people who are just drunk than to find those who are up to their abilities in ecstasy, speed or LSD. <br /> <br /> By "that", I mean dancing and sweating like crazy for about eight hours in a row without even a brake and followed by a long way to a long morning of sleep wanting to die , then wait a week next weekend to redo everything. <br /> <br /> Even though this movie is one of my favorites, I can certainly understand why some people, or most people even would not like it.
