So unique and entertaining! Another great Canadian invention. A regular "Joe" (Dan) and a group of unsuitable offenders (aka Puppets) share the same residence in a halfway house. It is up to Dan to monitor four "threats to society" and help them rehabilitate themselves. Bill, the deadly model, Rocko, the cigarette-smoking dog, Buttons, the nympho, and Cuddles, the comfort doll. The five of them find themselves in all kinds of difficult situations. Despite their homicidal and often overtly perverse sexual tendencies, it is hard not to find them friendly. <br /> <br /> I give this show a 10/10 simply because it offers good entertainment, without requiring a huge budget, a Canadian flair that makes me proud.
