I come from Phoenix city and the first time I saw this movie and read the book, it only confirmed the stories I had heard all my life. I asked my grandfather about the crowd and he told me that when he returned from the fight in the Pacific Theater, he created a CPA company that is the largest in the Columbus area. In the early days, the crowd asked him to do some financial work for them, but he said he had kindly refused. even when the FBI and the army passed through the city of Phoenix and cleaned up everything, my grandfather did not take it lightly when my mother, aunt or uncle crossed the river, but I assure you that everything is finished now. downtown Phoenix needs to be restored and there are slums near the courthouse where all shootings take place OCCASIONALLY on angry, uneducated and low-socio-economic people, and the Phoenix Bridge -Eagle at 14th Street has been closed for 15 years and replaced by a newer bridge on 13th Street, but on the fairest side of the city of Phoenix on Summerville e. It is very scenic and the scenery depressing. <br /> <br /> Another incident was told to me by the family of my best friend from high school who lives in a secluded location on Route 165, Holy Trinity, Alabama, who is about 28 years old. a few minutes outside of Columbus, Georgia. my best friend in the high school uncle was a man named Old Man Davis. No matter how the movie happens, the fact is that there were 3 bosses and Old Man Davis was one of them ... you can even learn more about him in the original book. Legend has it that he was so cool that he went to downtown Phoenix to close a deal with a man, but apparently the man gave up the deal right in front of Old Man Davis . The Old Man Davis then decided to take a sawed-off shotgun from his coat and shot the man in the chest in the middle of the city near the courthouse. they even say that he left nonchalantly because the crowd had paid all the law enforcement officials in the city, so he did not have to worry. <br /> <br /> another incident involves a bridge for which another of my friends owns a rental house next to downtown Phoenix. it's the same bridge that the crowd killed and threw a black man, and you can even read that part of the book. I would also like to see many civilians in Columbus and the City of Phoenix invited to make extras in the film. when the friend of the patterson is murdered and brought to justice and found guilty before the judge, but still released, the judge is my father's partner in his law firm in Columbus, which unfortunately passed away.
