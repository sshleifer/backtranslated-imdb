"Challenge to be free" is one of the first films I saw in my childhood. It was also one of the first VHS tapes I had. I had not seen the film for years, so yesterday I decided to stick the tape and watch it. Sensational. The story is as powerful now as it was the first time I saw it. I think now that I'm older, I can better appreciate the values ​​that are implanted in the film. (Self-sufficiency, The value of freedom and the love of nature) It's a movie "B", that's for sure, but it's a movie you'll remember for years, especially if you see it as a child.
