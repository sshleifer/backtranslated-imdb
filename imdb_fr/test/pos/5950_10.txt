This is the last entry in the long series of films with the French agent, O.S.S. 117 (French answer to James Bond). The series was launched in the early 1950s and spawned at least eight films (none of which were released in the United States). 'O.S.S.117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies' is a little light comedy that should not ... repeat NO, be taken too seriously. Our protagonist is in the middle of a spy chase in Egypt (with Morocco replacing Egypt) to discover a friend long lost. What follows is the type of antics typical of James Bond / Inspector Cloussou. Although our man is a little xenophobic, sexist or homophobic, it is treated as a sheer joke (as I said, do not take it too seriously). Although there is a bit of brutal language and violence on the part of comics, it is acceptable for children 12 and older. As previously stated in the subject, relax, skip the popcorn and enjoy.
