It's a good movie, no doubt, but with strange aspects. Without spoiling anything, it takes place in only 3 places: a Sicilian farm, the boat and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close together, so we never see a wide scan. I wonder if it was to save money? No street scenes, and we do not even see the boat except by close-ups. And the music ... what happened when we played Nina Simone's songs, decades before their release? I could have done without the Milk River affair ...... But, before you think of me as a pure misanthrope, let me repeat, it's a very good movie more precision than usual efforts (US) to the immigration experience.
