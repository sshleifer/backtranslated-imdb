In many ways, the film career of independent film legend John Cassavetes is the opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock, the accomplished studio director. Where Hitchcock sadly treated his actors as cattle, Cassavetes sought to work with them in an improvised manner. Where each element of the Hitchcock plan is impeccably composed, Cassavetes cared less about the way a scene was composed figuratively than about how it felt, or what it transmitted, with emotion. Hitchcock's stories were always stories of intrigue, with the human element in the background. Cassavetes put human experience at the forefront of each of his films. If some things do not logically make much sense, so be it. <br /> <br /> We even see him since his very first film, 1959's Shadows, filmed with a 16mm portable camera, with a budget of about $ 40,000 in Manhattan, with the company of Cassavetes' workshop directories, and presented as an improvisational film. The story is rather simple because it follows the lives of three black Manhattanite brothers - Benny (Ben Carruthers) - an unaccounted trumpet player, Hugh (Hugh Hurd) - a lost singer and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni) - the younger sister. both. The three main arcs of the film deal with Hugh's failures as disco disciple and his friendship with his manager, Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny tours in Manhattan with his two friends without accounts; and Lelia's love life - first with a white boy, Tony (Anthony Ray), who does not realize the light-skinned Lelia breed, even after lying down; then with Davey (Davey Jones), a stiff and decent man, who could be a misogynist. <br /> <br /> In the first bow, not much happens, except that Hugh dark complexion has the right to pontificate how it feels like being sung in the discotheques of the class lower and opening shows for girly acts. He dreams of doing things big in New York, or even in Paris, but we can say that he is the kind of man who will continue to delude himself about his meager competence. For the only time we actually hear him singing, he shows that he is a marginal talent, at best. That Rupert continues to encourage him gives us a glimpse of how destructive friendships work. But, it's the least important of the three arcs. Although this film is overall better than, say, Martin Scorsese's first film, another story of failed and frustrated New Yorker romance, a decade later, he has none of the brilliant moments - either actor or cinematic. - that this movie has. Nor is it naturalistic, because naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve, especially in the cinema, although the Manhattan exteriors of the 1950s, on the ground floor, are a gem to relive. If Shadows is indeed an important film for the history of the independent film circuit, it is certainly not a big film. Some parts are preached, misinterpreted, the scenes end gracefully, almost like darkening sketches, and are sometimes cut off in the middle. All in all, it's a very sloppy job - especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of sync with the rest of the film, as Cassavetes proved it as a director, at least in his first film. The only reason anyone can see Shadows is that Cassavetes has finally improved with subsequent movies, which gives a clue as to his later style of work. <br /> <br /> The National Film Registry rightly declared that this film was worthy of being preserved as "culturally significant". All this is in keeping with the creed of art that Cassavetes has long defended, as illustrated by this quote: "I have never seen a helicopter explode. I have never seen anyone leave and blow up someone's head. So, why should I make movies about them? But I have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way. I saw people withdraw. I've seen people hide behind political ideas, behind drugs, behind the sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and I've done all these things myself. So I can understand them. What we say is so sweet. It's sweetness. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems. 'That this film is' culturally significant' is true, but this truth is not synonymous with 'artistically meaningful'. It is in the difference between these two definitions that great art truly thrives.
