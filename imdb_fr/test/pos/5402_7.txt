so. I was completely in love with this movie. Gaga for that, even with all his twists ... but the only thing that really bothered me was the connection between Tim's two best friends and Kyle. While the author of the film has left us such a poignant moment between the two and their experiences / sexual confusions, he then gives us a plot plot that makes them half-brothers?!?! (Although the subject is not covered in the film ... and remains unexplained and unexplained), I just thought it was in bad taste and that not discussing it was even worse. (Oops, we've created a taboo ... now let's not fix the situation, because it would not really be P.C.) Otherwise, a spectacular movie
