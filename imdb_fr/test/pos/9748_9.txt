After 66 years, "Flash Gordon" still has an appealing sci-fi / adventure / epic feel to which many current science fiction adventures aspire and fail. The only way to take full advantage of this series is simply to do nothing (hokey effects, dialogues, why Flash does not go for Princess Aura, etc.). And as for you, the elderly who have seen "Flash Gordon" back on the screen of the series or on television "in the daytime", if you want this beautiful series to remain attractive for future generations, ask your children / grandchildren to watch them are young. It worked for me (man aged 18 or under). 9 out of 10
