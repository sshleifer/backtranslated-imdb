The acting was excellent - the main woman was so HOT - the guy playing Darwyn was a smoldering, thoughtful character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering (the death of the truck driver is an example) excellently. The story was believable and the length of the show was just right (ie I love Lost, but will it end?). As a Brit, I tend to think Yanks are gung ho. The LAPD was trying to stop it badly, but the other agencies were positively portrayed. My main thought about programs like this (and excellent 24 as well) is: is it possible? Would this happen? Is it happening now? Probably, probably. <br /> <br /> I hope they will do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it seems like no. <br /> <br /> To summarize, if you have not seen that, make sure to do it.
