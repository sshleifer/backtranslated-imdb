"The Merchant of Venice" was one of Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime, but he had a difficult time in the 20th century because of its undeniably anti-Semitic content. The play has also been called a schizoid, moving from a comic scene to a tragic scene, which leads some to say that it is about two pieces that try to coexist in one. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in "Shakespeare in Love") is in love with Portia (Lynn Collins, superb), but must borrow a considerable amount of money to seduce her. He goes to his gay lover, Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who does not have the necessary funds, but contracts a loan from the Jewish loan shark Shylock (Al Pacino). Shylock is amused and offended that Antonio, who insults him for his religion, now comes to him for money, but he offers it, provided the penalty for non-payment of the loan is a pound of money. Antonio's flesh. Which is of course what happens. Bassanio and Portia offer Shylock much more than the initial loan instead of the pound of flesh, but Shylock, distraught after his daughter has left him and married a Christian, refuses to take him. Portia, in a scene where the public never knows exactly where to place their sympathies, deprives Shylock of what should legally be his, and then strips him of his wealth and religion. Shylock was originally considered a nasty cartoonist, but modern actors and directors turned him into a tragic figure, fighting against the injustices of the 16th century in Venice. Al Pacino does a great job as Shylock and Jeremy Irons is good at Antonio, but I think Lynn Collins' work as Portia is the best part of the play. Portia is one of the few remarkable female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is magnificent in this role. Joseph Fiennes is more than a little dull, however; I have never particularly appreciated his actor style, which is often overwhelmed. I give "The Merchant of Venice" an 8/10.
