Goldie Hawn, in 1969, was best known for playing humorous TV shows - especially ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN, where she was the blonde with big cookies. She has already made films before CACTUS FLOWER, the most notable being a Walt Disney film THE ONE AND ONLY ORIGINAL FAMILY BAND. But CACTUS FLOWER has taken over her character from LAUGH-IN, and (thanks to a good screenplay by IAL Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on a piece by Abe Burrows), she has been able to develop the extended TV character. . As a result, Hawn won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1969, and her career has seen future successes such as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although other LAUGH-IN stars played well on television (Henry Gibson played a recurring role as a judge in BOSTON LEGAL), only Goldie was able to lead a career as a bona fide movie star. <br /> <br /> On LAUGH- Goldie's personality would show embarrassing naïveté. From time to time, she realized it and laughed hard to cover, but sometimes she just did not see her mistake (eg Goldie is introduced to the host of a 1950s variety show, Gary Moore, and he is told, "Goldie, it's Mr. Gary Moore." She shakes his hand and says (to his dismay), "I've always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore!"). But like Toni Simmons, it's pretty different. She is desperately in love with Dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), a famous dentist who can never marry her. Julian told him that his wife (with whom he had two sons and one daughter) will never give him a divorce. Thus, at the beginning of the film, Toni tries to commit suicide to the gas of her cook. But she is saved by her neighbor, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz), a troubled playwright, who burst into his apartment and cut gas. <br /> <br /> Toni is resigned to live, but she sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to send a message to ignore the note, but Julian's receptionist / nurse / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) will not stop Julian's work schedule to give him the phone when Igor calls. Instead, Julian finds the letter and goes to Toni's apartment to find her alive. When Igor supports her story that she tried to commit suicide, Julian realizes the depth of his love and decides that he must marry such a woman. Unfortunately, Toni has swallowed Julian's lies and believes in his wife and children. You see, Julian does not have a wife and children. Since Toni firmly believes that she can not marry a man who lies to her, Julian is stuck on a weakening tree limb. <br /> <br /> Julian comes to solve it by making sure that Stephanie pretends to be madam. Winston. Stephanie opposes it at first, but alone, on her first free Saturday, she confronts Toni at the record shop where she is. They argue and Toni notices all the strengths of Stephanie's character and personality (and since Stephanie has her two nephews with her, Toni thinks they are Julian's kids). Toni tells Julian that they must see who the man Stephanie is supposed to marry. Then the lie begins to skyrocket for Julian, Stephanie and Toni. Soon a lover is given to Stephanie in the form of Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston), a friend of Julian and patient on his own. Greenfield is so disgusting (Stephanie hates him) that Toni feels unworthy of Stephanie. <br /> <br /> And so on, with a complication (caused largely by Toni, well-intentioned and misinformed), following another until the conclusion. The scenario is full of first-rate situations and one-liners (for example, Julian rewarding Stephanie for lying about her marriage, buying two record albums in Toni's shop, and giving Toni a mink steal). decided to send it to Stephanie with Julian's card Stephanie is quite happy to have the mink, but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she received - when she warmly thanks Matthau, he says that she would like Horowitz - which means Vladomir Horowitz - Stephanie thinks that Horowitz is the furrier's name!). <br /> <br /> Bergman must have enjoyed the filming, as several scenes show this burst of earth that was a trademark for her in the movies of the late 1940s. But there was also the resemblance to her 1958 movie comedy success, INDISCREET. There, Cary Grant lied to make sure that the two men would focus on the romance of their story without having to think about marriage. When Grant's lie is revealed to Bergman, she decides to convince her to convince her that she is making him cuckold. Here, instead of being the passive lover who believes that Matthau is telling the truth, Bergman carefully tries to get Matthau out of his traps with little white lies, to find one that leads to another, which complicates the everyone's life. Bergman is perceived as a sympathetic woman who fits into the problem, although she tries to be part of the solution. <br /> <br /> All tracks behave well, especially Bergman, all his attention to business in the beginning, but gradually resumed sexuality. Matthau is delighted as a man who finds that a useful lie is an impediment that simply can not be dismissed. The secondary cast, especially Weston in the role of Harvey, very sexy and viscous, and Vito Scotti, as ambassador of the United States, who loves Bergman a lot. It was a smart comedy and a great way for Goldie Hawn's film career to progress.
