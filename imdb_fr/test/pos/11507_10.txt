This film by Friðrik Þór, director of Children of Nature, is powerful. He has an excellent Sigurrós music and a good performance. This shows how madness can be sad. There are many good jokes but the humor is dark. If it's not a problem, then you should see this movie. Note that this is not a comedy but a drama.
