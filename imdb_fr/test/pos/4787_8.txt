A few years ago, I was surprised by community television and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> A little silly in some ways, its main function is to be a mysterious thriller. superbly, thanks to a scenario that concocts an ingenious plot; That let me guess and the resolution is inspired. <br /> <br /> The cast is a star cast, containing a mix of those at the end of their career (indeed Richard Long died the same year, this was done), or those who were on the point to become stars in successful television series (Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley). They all do good work, with the exception of Cesare Danova who has fallen asleep through his role. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
