Two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi film, which makes a strange nod to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick and the anime. The robots are actually called "replicants", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner (we can also find several visual allusions to the film) and the villain is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with the limitation of procreation through the use of 'a compulsory medicine for' heterosexual '. love is fleeting and homosexual love is everlasting ".... martial arts fights ensue, a first for dead or alive films.The hilarious climax implies that the two sons turn into a robot winged with a gigantic phallus for a head, which personifies the "destruction", a path taken so far by the two characters, their individual minds and their literal heads functioning like testicles.The film ends with the mayor playing his free jazz with the boy, while the robot apparently shoots a wall around him, the last words of the mayor "Oh f * &%", followed by a quick fade to the black part of me felt cheated, part confused, but most of the time I was joking A lot of the movie is pretty boring, the best scenes close it off, while the rest is way too slow Takashi Miike has always exploited sexual patterns under male violence in movies Action. This film, with the exception of "Gozu", reinforces this theme more than any other. Sex and violence are two fairly basic themes, but like Cronerberg (whose jazz interludes may be a homage to Ala Naked Lunch), Miike is able to show where the two are connecting, to create a hilarious effect and strangely cohesive.
