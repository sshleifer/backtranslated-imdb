It's a kind of very black episode. It all starts with the return of Jim, who has just spent a weekend with his new girlfriend, Karen Mills, recently divorced (Pat Delaney - daughter-in-law of John Huston, who knew a little film noir) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen enters the house while Jim takes his daughter in the back seat and transports her to her room. He then discovers that Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course, he calls Dennis and when the police arrive, she sees no trace of Karen, but finds her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes. So of course, that makes Jim an immediate suspect. <br /> <br /> It's a big little mystery and the first part of the story is shown by Rocky, asking him to re-read the story again. Rocky suggests that by telling Jim the story, he may remember a detail he did not think was important at the time, but could now help us understand what happened. It's a really well written scene and completes the Rocky character's transition from a grifter to a concerned parent. It also proves that Rocky is not just a helpless old man. As he says, "You come to me because I am your father, and I am smarter than you!" It's one of those moments where we see where Jim got his intelligence. <br /> <br /> This episode also features an appearance of the hottie Lara Parker, who played Ang√©lique in the series "Dark Shadows" and then played Laura Banner, Bruce's wife in the series "Incredible Hulk" several years later. She looks great here. <br /> <br /> This episode also marks the first mention of the family of criminals Minette, a name that would come back repeatedly in the Rockford Files almost every time they needed a family of gangsters. This time, it is Vincent Minette that Rockford helps to apprehend. <br /> <br /> Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance in the series and Dennis is discreetly demoted to a police lieutenant while he was on the episodes of the first season of Sargent. I guess they thought it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add a conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly, they were right, although I prefer the last Lieutenant Chapman to Lieutenant Diehl. <br /> <br /> Not much of the typical humor of "Rockford" in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.
