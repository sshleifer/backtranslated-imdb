BIG, Chris Diamantopoulos must be the best Robim Williams I've ever seen. He's acting, perfectly. It was like watching Robim Williams as he was and he really is ... It almost made me cry to watch him. <br /> <br /> I did not know Robin was such a close friend as John Belushi. The representation of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on its own merits. Very sad, what they went through both. <br /> <br /> I felt really good for Val and Robin in these difficult times. I'm glad they finished the evening in style! <br /> <br /> I hope Robin will put a 100 dollar bill in this guy's hat !! <br /> <br /> And it was great that he was filmed Vancouver!
