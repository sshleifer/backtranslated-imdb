I can not say that it was not done well. At a recent film festival, the director admitted that some scenes took 30 shots. And nothing indicates that he did not get exactly what he wanted. But it's a strangely non-Hispanic movie just like West Side Story many years ago. The two leaders, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their games. The setting, a kind of underground car repair district in Queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself. But there is something unsatisfactory in the film's main issue, namely, what the sister feels she needs to do to get by. I can understand the brother's reaction, but it seems a little too easy. The film seems to suggest that such people do not need our help, that they will find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I would not encourage anyone to believe it. There would be much more resistance to the choices made here than to what is described. Other than that as entertainment it works well. As an exact representation of a culture, not so good, I think.
