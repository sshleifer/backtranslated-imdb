One of the biggest French successes of the year 2002, "the Spanish hostel" was also very well received abroad, which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons for this success. This film directed by one of the most interesting French filmmakers of recent years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students from all over Europe and gathered under one roof in Barcelona. These students are described as those you imagine or see in everyday life: disordered, serious or with a sense of humor. I guess if the film worked so well, it's because a lot of students had to recognize themselves in the portraits of the main characters and in particular that of Xavier. <br /> <br /> We follow the film and his experience abroad as an Erasmus Student through his eyes. Xavier is really an ordinary student with his qualities, his faults. Intelligent manufacturing with many ingenious ideas perfectly expresses his lost spirit and his concern for the world and his status as an Erasmus student. On this subject, the best examples can be found in two sequences. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at the university for the papers he has to send to prepare his DEA. When the same woman informs him of the various necessary procedures, all the papers appear on the screen when he names them! In the following sequence, Xavier's voiceover gives the viewer his vision of the modern world. Now where to find the second example? Well, the scene where Xavier undergoes a thorough medical examination in which Klapisch films his visions is largely enough to speak for itself. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director has not really interested in the studies of his main character. He left this discreet point. Instead, he put a lot of effort into Xavier's private life, of course, in his love affair with Anne Sophie but also and especially in his relationships with his roommates. It is a true story of friendship that Klapisch shows us with his moments of happiness but also his arguments and his tensions. Through the adventure of Xavier and at the end of his stay, he will have been initiated into life, which will make him more mature. The message the author wanted to convey is not difficult to guess. You naively believe that you live in a messy and complicated world. Do not give up, search intensely for what you want, even if it is difficult. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, we could also fear that with the subject, Cédric Klapisch does not avoid a trap: clichés. Let's be honest: they are included in the screenplay, but the director does his best not to broadcast too much in his film. Then, the scenario contains practical and predictable moments: at the airport and before boarding, we see Xavier shed a tear after he left his family. But fortunately, the weaknesses of the script stop there. Fun dialogues and cool young actors who are at ease in their roles are all there. <br /> <br /> Despite its weaknesses, "the Spanish hostel" is to be taken for a success in the film of young people. In addition, the whole atmosphere it releases suggests that this film is primarily for a young audience. In the end, the end of the film and its great success suggest to Klapisch to succumb to a fashion that goes well to American cinema: the development of sequels. And indeed, the filmmaker is currently working on a sequel titled "Russian Dolls". Hope it will be as good as "the Spanish inn".
