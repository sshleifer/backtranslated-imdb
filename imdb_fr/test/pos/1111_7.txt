John and his wife Emily, along with their child Edward, leave the comfortable outskirts of the suburbs to get to the village where the husband spent part of his childhood. There was a death in the family and John had to take steps to take control of an old dilapidated seaside cottage, once inhabited by an old man who apparently committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Skeptical about the In the circumstances of death, John separates from his family and reality, puts his own life in danger and puts on the clothes of the old man who is now dead. <br /> <br /> The film changes now - nothing That's what it seems - people from his past appear, in full Gothic glory / hillbilly - his wife worries about his mental state - and his son disappears in the reeds. <br /> <br /> John discovers that the old man does not commit suicide, that his death is much more mysterious and strange. In a frightening finale, we learn that the events of the film have in fact never happened and that the whole story was imagined by the little boy, Edward, who has trouble accepting the divorce proceedings of his parents. <br /> <Modern Love is a macabre piece of high-end art cinema, a confusing and perverse pretentious, full of vague suggestions and unexplored red herrings. He is devoid of humor and apparently indifferent to the current trends in independent cinema that validates his creators, but also makes him obsolete. <br /> <br /> But the weaknesses of this Australian film are fully offset by its muscular cinematographic vision, its bloody careful and uncompromising precision and horror euro horror. The bastard of scripting norms and the lack of slender dialogue are only insignificant vis-Ã -vis a black background and a performance that must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressive Australian films in years.
