I have never seen any work from The League before the beginning of last year - although, when I was lucky enough to switch channels, I caught the end of one of the three episodes of the series . But last winter, I fell in love with the show and its dark characters, eccentric and sometimes quite sinister. So when I learned that they had made a film in which the adorable creators of the series met their own characters, I could not order the DVD fast enough and tore it from the hands of the postman when he delivered it . I was so excited to see what the men had done and how they had done it. <br /> <br /> And it was excellent! From the beginning when Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is frightened by Edward, Tubbs and Daddy (Dyson, why do not you play yourself, he is perfectly capable as a spectator of the infamous Highgate House of Horrors!), In Bernice by repressing another of his flock, to Geoff, Herr Lipp and Hilary discovering that they are characters, which is a fantastic scene. The scenes taking place in 1690 are very pleasant. The men then turn to new characters and a whole new plot. The role of David Warner as Dr. Pea is fantastic, a little camping and a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The League has always brilliantly managed to marry humor, sadness and emotion - and the climax of this film, where Mr. Lipp wrestles with the idea that he and the other residents of Vasey are just fictitious characters who will never be able to change anyone or who is their goal - and witness how it tears, is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the talent of men - something for which they are terribly neglected to this day. <br /> <br /> And then you have that smart end - where you sit wonderfully - with the wonderful music theme of Joby Talbot. And you know you enjoyed a very smart and fun movie.
