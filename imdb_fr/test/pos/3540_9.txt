I must say that in terms of book-to-film adaptations, the BBC rarely lets me down. Now about this mini-series. I love Starling Novel, it's by far the best murder / mystery I've ever read. The Mini series, she made my day with challenge. The main story was kept almost perfectly intact. The characters correspond very well to those of the novel, the personalities and manners were perfect for Red and Jez. I thought Duncan played very well, just like Kate. Eric was a too simplistic character, he had a little more depth in the book, but they also changed his sub-story so that he may have to manage it. Of course, there are changes, but most are aesthetic, but some disappoint me, the sub-story with Eric murder charge was changed and it changed the whole dynamic between Red and Eric for the movie, and they have cut off the Jez training from Triathalon was doing. Some of the other events in the book have been modified to be user-friendly for viewers. Overall, if you like the book, you'll like this, if you like the mini-series, then you'll love the book. I must say that this adaptation of the book to the film is the most accurate I have ever seen.
