Much better than expected. Good family film - catch it in reruns. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti describes the landscape - he has a lot more talent than the role deserves. A treat to watch Inspector Uhl of "The Illusionist" go above. The scenes of the blue man were my 11 years in stitches. The cameos were especially fun for the parents - good to see Lee Majors and Urkel (umm, Jaleel). It will be difficult to imagine 10 lines for this film, but let's listen to it for a film that promotes honesty between a child and his parents! Amanda Bynes does a great job when she gets to be part of the sting. Normally, I can not stand Frankie Muniz but he is fine here. Hat to the casting director - if only to hire Giamatti!
