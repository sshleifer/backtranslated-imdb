John Leguizamo's one man shows are successes or failures: Mambo Mouth showed his intense characterizations and superb timing, but the material was average, Spic-o-Rama achieved the first too, but this time the material was Fun, Freak is a classic followed by his disappointing Sex-o-holic. But his work in Freak shows his genius and when he's in the limelight, he's unparalleled. <br /> <br /> Freak's semi-autobiographical look at a young man's journey has power and resonance, I do not even think it was his creator knew about. By allowing us to see his soul, Mr. Leguizamo gives us the opportunity to project our own life on his own and there can be no greater gift that an artist can do. The willingness to drop the "wall", to expose and share is too terrifying for most actors - they use characters to hide behind - but JL is fully engaged and blithely clears all pretense. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best observers / actors / cultural actors, because they spoke wholeheartedly about everything they noticed in society and the truth provoked a sharp humor. Combine this with the imitation gift of the great actor and being in the moment (not to mention the meaning of humanity) and you will see that John Leguizamo has the power to do the same. At least in Freak, he does it. <br /> <br /> From birth to its first big break and every change of life between the two, a spectator sees our host and the other characters in their most private moments while feeling the pain, the hope and the humor that comes with it. In search of the tired, skinny, muscular air, JL resonates with sweat at the end of the evening after giving her crazy life to an audience; Spike Lee's fluid photographic work captures the actor's nuances until the last loop and a slow flicker. The scenarios range from drinking with his father (at the age of 9) to machismo, to see A Chorus Line with his gay uncle and deaf; the vicious humiliation of his first girlfriend when undressing, hungry for sex. A first nightmarish sexual encounter with a tall German woman in the back of a fried chicken in Kentucky follows an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a "drunken Catholic drunk" in a bar on St.Patty's day. Climaxing in a serious confrontation with his mother and father, this is where he shows his real genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and his brother and him with such a dramatic intensity / humorous, you forget that you 'look at that one. the person. There is no change of costume, bad wig, lighting trick or make-up. Just an actor who gives everything. It's just amazing. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock stand out today, but they do not dive as deeply as John Leguizamo; it's not a criticism, not far away. I like their job but Freak is different. It moves in a non-b ******* way. It's the best show of a man and no one will be able to touch it for a long time.
