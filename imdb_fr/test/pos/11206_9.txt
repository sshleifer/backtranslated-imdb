When you watch Distant, you know that you do not watch a French film, there is little sexuality, it is mainly elliptical and people do not speak much here, a few lines are scattered here and there and some important conversations. just to make sense of what's going on. It does not look like American either, there are no car chases, shootings or violence, unless you consider the murder of a mouse as a bloody act or the daily tension at which manages a controlled disaster. Sometimes, the relatively long shots on the medium are reminiscent of Asian "contemplative" cinema, but the director does not push things towards the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers, but again, it is not a Taiwanese film, it's a Turkish film. I do not know what that means, I do not even know if that's supposed to mean anything. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a plot of its own and yet, these few lines, the ones that are a little long-shots stopped and that often attenuate the tension, gradually create the feeling of something pass, a feeling of "conspiracy", for want of a better word, that pushes on you. At the end of the film, you may feel that these two cousins, who have many things in common but are far apart, will be missed.
