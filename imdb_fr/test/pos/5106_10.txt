I loved the movie and the story! I saw the original (1939 I think) and enjoyed both of them. To truly appreciate history, you need to know English culture and customs. The teacher (Peter O'Toole) was dedicated to his school and the "boys" of this school. It was an English "public" school, which we call in the United States a private school (E.G. Andover). He is a very ascetic person and on the surface he seems to be stiff, stifling, indifferent and weak to the point of being effeminate. He is strict in his teaching standards because he takes care of "his guys", that is to say, he does not want them to get an inexpensive or weak education. He meets (by introduction) a "dancing girl" (Petula Clark) and is totally in love. In England at the time, the reference to "dance hall" bore the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was clearly "lower class". We find that the teacher is actually a very hard and courageous person, as well as loyal to the people and institutions that he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes more than a lover and a woman ... she "throws" her personality and allows her to grow as a man and as a person, for the benefit of her beloved school and her own happiness. The first film was shot BEFORE the Second World War, this one goes through the Second World War. We are also in 1969 (we had the "British Invasion" ... Beetles, etc. for me), the music is excellent, the colors and the photography excellent. I think O'Toole perfectly interpreted the character! There are dedicated people like "Chips" ... all around us but many do not receive recognition. Film and history very pleasant!
