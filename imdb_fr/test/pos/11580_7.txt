It is a soap opera inspired by an idea of ​​applied ethics. A film about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie. It did not give me emotion, the ideas are not new at all, the tension is missing, it becomes tedious towards the second period but towards the end, I think that it becomes rather interesting in a burlesque way. I mean you have that bald, middle-aged, paralyzed guy, who has more women than Don Juan. He does not seem to suffer as much as one would expect from someone who has been completely paralyzed for more than 28 years, he has no problem with God (and we would probably expect that too), his entourage seems to be the ideal slave (I can not get out of my mind Bergman's Cries and Whispers, similar to this one in many ways, which is simply full of emotions, but not all of humanity), etc. This movie is the perfect recipe for housewives looking for thrills but do not expect to be blown away. The film deserves to be seen by all the cynicism we receive today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to awaken the viewer. Amenabar does not rub your face and does not take sides, he does not want to make us fanatics for a particular idea. I still do not understand why this movie was so appreciated.
