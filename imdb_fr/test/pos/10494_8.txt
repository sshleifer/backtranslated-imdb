I must admit that when I started watching this movie, I had no idea what was going on. So, the beginning was a bit confusing for me. However, it did not diminish my pleasure for the film. The characters are more complex than they are at the beginning, which makes this movie a memorable event. At first, I heard that it was a true Hollywood movie. Although it lacks the stereotypical "gun and fist" element, the compelling performances of talented comedians such as Martin Sheen and Sam Neill more than make up for it. I prefer to see a movie with more substance than to shoot every day.
