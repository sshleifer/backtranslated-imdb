I know this film has been badly criticized, but I must say that I really enjoyed it. The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. He never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all his disguises. He also manages to emit a sweet charm that conceals his scandalous practices. A special mention should also go to Michael Gambon who plays for laughs with a bright and precise, but comical, focus of Dublin's downtown. The only weak link is Caine who, while obviously having a lot of laughter, plays the least interesting and the least unfriendly character. It probably will not be played abroad as well, but it's worth watching all the same.
