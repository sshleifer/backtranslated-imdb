I suppose revisionist history is going on here, but we really feel that Patrice Lumumba was a troublemaker who incited his people to violence from the moment the Congo declared independence. To bring in Soviet aid to put his forces back into service was obviously what had involved the United States and led to his assassination. However, by replacing it with Mobutu, the United States has not solved anything. Well done with excellent cinematography and a catchy score. A must see.
