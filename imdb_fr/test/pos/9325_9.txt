When it was announced that the "King of Pop" had died at the age of 50, a month before he was going to start a series of live back-to-back concerts at London's O2 Arena, it was a shock huge for millions of people around the world. He has been and always will be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and we will miss him terribly. I decided to remember how wonderful it was to see what is considered by many to be not only Jackson's best video, but also the greatest music video ever made, from director John Landis (A Werewolf). American in London). The film begins with Michael and his daughter (Ola Ray) out of car, and after giving him a ring, the moon appears and he turns into a werewolf. We then see Michael and his daughter watching this horror movie at the movies, she's scared and out, and Michael follows her soon, singing the iconic song. Soon, Vincent Price's voice begins to speak and the zombies begin to explore the earth and open the coffins of the cemetery. Michael and the girl are obviously surrounded. She turns away and Michael has become a zombie himself. With all the other creatures, they perform the iconic dance before returning to their normal state, at least for the chorus. The girl runs into the house almost scary, blocks the door, but the zombie Michael still manages to break through and when he touches her, she screams to see Michael normal say "what's the problem?" The film ends with the fact that he takes her home and looks at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons and number 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star, the album Thriller was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Albums and this video was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. it was number 1 on the 100 best pop videos. Very well!
