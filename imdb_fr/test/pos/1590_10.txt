Enjoy every moment of this languorous show with music (Mahler's fifth is beautiful, but listen to the vocal part of the third symphony so beautifully used in this film). This film has many aspects, but the main subject is the irresistible force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, the absence of logic for love and adoration. I am also a big fan of Bogarde and think he was rarely so wonderful (try it in "The Servant" though). Note: I recommend multiple visualizations.
