Is it a perfect movie? It's a strange adaptation of a science fiction book featuring space vampires, naked beauties and the efficiency of the British army. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie, I was pretty young and all I could remember the movie's fear and Mathilda May. In fact, if this beautiful woman was not naked throughout the film, I probably would not have qualified so high, but given its magnificence, I now plan to vote! <br /> <br /> Fortunately for me, I remembered the movie and watched it again now. Imagine the special effects of Raider of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist to create a rather decent sci-fi story, but with far superior performances. I've always loved the movie (and Mathilda May), but it was a mix of nostalgia, compared to the shitty movies they're doing today and wanting more at the end. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: if you are a fan of science fiction, you can not miss this movie. Oh, and did I mention that Mathilda May is young, beautiful and naked?
