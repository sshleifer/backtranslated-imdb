I agree with "johnlewis", who said there were a lot of things between the lines in this movie. Although I think that the rhythm of this film could be improved, I think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating. <br /> <br /> Examples: <br /> <br /> Pierre will marry his cousin, even if his love for her seems very cousin-y? <br /> <br /> Peter and his mother-in-law have a rather ... curious relationship. <br /> <br /> Pierre, Lucie and Thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the real points of the triangle are not quite certain ... <br /> <br /> Lucie's brother is a little eunuch , where is it? <br /> <br /> And Isabelle, who is she really ?? <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it was worth it. An interesting film that makes me want to read Melville.
