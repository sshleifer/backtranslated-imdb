Assy McGee is an uncontrollable and uncompromising detective, inspired by innumerable examples drawn from police dramas made in the late twentieth century. The problem is that Assy is literally a traveling butt. <br /> <br /> The inexpensive and low frontage of the show conceals his intelligence and his hidden satire. This is not to say that Assy is devoid of jokes about farts, but that toilet humor is used sparingly to create consistent laughter, not moans and glances. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the intelligent and subtle humor used throughout. The sequence consists of panoramic photos of the city on a 1970s jazzy cop theme. In one photo, a police car is shown and the "camera" zooms in on the front license plate holder, which is vacant. The senseless zoom makes the production of the police drama typical of the years 70-1980 and makes me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> All typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who can not control Assy; the loyal minority partner who defeats Assy's imprudence; the regular cops who hate Assy's means ... are all counted and are all hilarious satires of the typical crime drama. <br /> <br /> The dubbing, played mainly by Larry Murphy, is nothing short of spectacular. Assy's voice - breathing and gruff with a hint of drunk driving - is so smart and so unique that she sits alongside big names like Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Although the voice is blurred, the diction is clear and easy to understand. This is an interesting change from other Adult Swim voices that often require closed captioning to be understood. <br /> <br /> In addition to fantastic production and dubbing, the scenario is also hilarious. Assy's direct frankness fuels most of the humor, especially in his interactions with citizens outside the police. <br /> <br /> If you have access to Adult Swim comedies, Assy McGee is definitely worth watching. Each episode lasts only 8 to 9 minutes, so you have little to lose.
