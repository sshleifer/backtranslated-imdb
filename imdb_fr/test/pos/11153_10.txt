I was five when the series debuted in 1958 and later was a regular spectator. I remember that I really enjoyed the show, with "Leave It To Beaver", "My Three Sons", "Ozzie and Harriet", "Dick Van Dyke", reruns of "I Love Lucy", "The Real McCoys ", etc. I now enjoy the first season of "Donna Reed" on DVD and watched the first two episodes. Donna Stone turns out to be a smart, well-behaved, problem-solving, quiet and home-loving mother, similar to June Cleaver and unlike Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I particularly like the fact that Mrs. Reed becomes a surrogate father, exchanging her dress for sweats and boxing gloves, while teaching her son how to physically defend himself against a much bigger assailant. Although none of the mothers in my growing neighborhood, including mine, meet exactly the idealistic standards embodied by Ms. Reed, it's refreshing to see good manners and smart decision-making prevail at the end of the day. , on the other hand. today accepted standards of vulgarity, selfishness and indifference among its neighbors. I can not imagine their parents telling Jeff and Mary Stone that intrusions into their neighbors' yards are okay, letting a dog bark all day is okay, or telling their mom to shut up in a supermarket in front of everybody.
