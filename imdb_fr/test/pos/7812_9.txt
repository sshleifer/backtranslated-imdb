In a minute to pray, a second to die, Clay McCord (Alex Cord) is an unfortunate outlaw with a $ 10,000 bonus on his head and degenerative epilepsy. <br /> <br /> He realizes his days as an outlaw, he desperately wants (albeit somewhat reluctantly) to enjoy an amnesty granted by the governor of the region, Robert Ryan, (excellent performance Who wants McCord to give up his habit and accept amnesty as an example for others Escondito's bandit gangster, outlaw Mario Brega, plans to kill McCord to prevent this from happening. <br /> <br /> The film is also performed by Arthur Kennedy, Aldo Sambrell and other well-known European faces. The Western spaghetti pioneer (American) Albert Band, also responsible for the pre-Leone Gunfight At Red Sands movie. <br /> <br /> Even if the solution to "epilepsy" of the main character was raised straight out of El Dorado, the script is solid, quite fresh and unpretentious us. It has a good balance between action and story and Alex Cord is excellent. He really should have been a bigger star. <br /> <br /> In defense of the shorter English version (well doubled): Personally, I passed that age where the longest version is still the best version and the end where McCord is ironically shot down by Bounty hunters worse after his pardon, is unnecessarily nihilistic and completely destroys the message of the movie about hope and redemption. <br /> <br /> Call me old-fashioned, but I rooted for McCord and felt he deserved it happy ending!
