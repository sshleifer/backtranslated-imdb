Followed in 1965 "My Name Is Barbra", shot in a brilliant color, "Color Me Barbra" offers La Streisand alternating nostalgia, comedy of clowns, feminine romantic anguish and serious haunting for an hour of breathtaking madness show-biz dazzle. She is a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. With her Egyptian eye makeup and her ever-changing hairstyles, she is also a chameleon. His voice is rich and touching, though some of his songs are not ("One Kiss", "Yesterdays"). The circus sequence is not as intriguing as the museum tour (with Barbra's claim to become the images in the paintings, an idea that works better than you think). The circus-medley (built around songs featuring the word "face"!) Is beautifully cute without ever truly becoming enchanting. Still, this is a lively, jazzy special that is not as emotionally tempting as "My Name Is Barbra", but is certainly a great effort for the second year.
