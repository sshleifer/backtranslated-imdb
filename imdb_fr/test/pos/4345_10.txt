This film is really a classic film of the 80s! A must in any 80's movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS !!!! <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's the best movie of Death Wish. Tons of non-stop action! <br /> <br /> And as in the case of the classic film "villain contre bon" of the 80s, this film deals with everything except the norm, firearms and CREEPS! We see Bronson slaughter thugs and CREEPS with a 30-gauge Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE PISTOL TO HIGHLY CRIVE! When Charlie lacks ammunition for the heavy machine gun, he returns to his cradle and takes up arms with his long-range high-range gun! This gun can stop a damn ELEPHANT and Charlie puts holes the size of a hubcap in the bad guys with! And as if that was not enough, Charlie is also preparing an anti-tank grenade launcher, which is only good if he manages to gather the CREEPS. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is "ha ha" big and a lot of actors out of the wall (playing mainly CREEPS) appear throughout the movie! The film is loaded with liners and memorable scenes! Heck, my favorite scene / line is where the CREEP leader confronts Broson in jail and calmly explains to him: "Tell me what I'm going to do ... I'm going to kill a little old woman ... just for you! .. catch him at six o'clock news. " <br /> <br /> Is this film violent? Heck yes! But, you will laugh and cringe all the way !!!!
