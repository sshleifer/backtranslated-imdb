This multi-level thriller caught my attention. It is troubling and instructive to see how perverse human behavior can be. It is also instructive to know what past injuries can motivate the present behavior. No one except Sandra Bullock's partner is very friendly. However, all are credible. Sandra did a great job. Her character, Cassie, comes alive with all her pain, fear and defenses. She is a survivor and her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment. I really enjoyed this film. Tom Landers
