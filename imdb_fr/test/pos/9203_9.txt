I was shocked to hear that Jimmy Caan left this series, does anyone know why? I consider James one of the greatest players of all time and I was not surprised that he ended up on television, which may be better than the shit you see on the big screen. The stories are slippery and the camera faster than a fast ball! Do not forget the rest of the cast: James, Vanessa (yum!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch .. Can anyone tell me why there's a shitty air on the DVDs, but the JXL remix of A little less conversation is used during initial broadcasts on NBC ?? Is not it logical to use a melody that you would associate with the Mecca of America's game for DVD releases?
