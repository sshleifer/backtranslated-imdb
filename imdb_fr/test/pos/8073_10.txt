For those who appreciate the intersection between silent cinema and social commentary, this is a unique film. At once a tribute to German Expressionism and allegory, the film is full of visual symbolism and artistic style that rivals anything that has been seen since the 1920s. In addition, the attention paid to the details of the era and the visual composition of the scenes as an instrument to advance the story is astounding. Apart from this, the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on voice, perception and social opinion. In truth, it is not so much the silence that permeates the film as the loss of voices and words to communicate and express a thought that inevitably follows. In a nutshell, this film is something not seen and, as the producer of the film said in the Q & A session that followed, will let you think about its meaning until the next day.
