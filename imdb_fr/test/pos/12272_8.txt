This film is good, but not the best of Schaffner. My favorite is Papillon and Patton, but it's a sad and very beautiful film. Kris Kristoffersen is good at this movie and really makes a difference. Schaffner will miss me and this is his last film. <br /> <br /> A good movie from a great director! 7.5 / 10
