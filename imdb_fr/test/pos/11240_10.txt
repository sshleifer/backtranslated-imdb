There are too many people on this forum who have obviously missed the subtle spirit of this series. <br /> <br /> This show is great because it's a hilarious parody in itself. The guys who are self-proclaimed stallions have a chance to convince us of their seduction abilities until they "land" just to reveal their total lack of "play" on national television ?? it's absolutely hilarious and the guys who are really qualified are extremely compelling to watch as they effortlessly seduce the pretentious women who frequent these trendy nightclubs! <br /> <br /> He celebrates the unique charisma when he is deserved and makes fun of delusional doubags when he is deserved. Anyway, it's always fun because, unlike other dating shows, it perfectly captures the clumsiness and excitement of a genuine "pick-up". I highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor.
