"Nazarin" directed by Luis Bunuel presents an extraordinary vision of religion in Mexico. As the director and Julio Alejandro, his notable collaborator, wrote, this is a film that put Mexican cinema on the international map after receiving the Grand Prix at Cannes that year. This is a troubling film because Mr. Bunuel is very interested in what is wrong with the church. <br /> <br /> Nazarin, after all, is a saint. We see this young priest living a life of poverty in a shabby pension of a city. He does not have enough for himself, but it does not bother him to part with a coin when a beggar appears at his window asking for help. At the same time, he takes a prostitute injured in a fight with another woman to his small room. Andara, the woman makes her kindness by burning the room and the whole building! We see Nazarin take to the countryside to beg for food. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes in his old town follow him. The life of Nazarino is parallel to that of Jesus. In fact, this holy figure pleads for humility. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr. Alejandro took the initiative to create this film. It is ironic to see how Spain welcomed him after the release of this film, because they saw Christian qualities there. In reality, it is a bitter satire on the Catholic Church and its ministers. <br /> <br /> Francisco Rabal, the Spanish actor, makes a wonderful Nazarin. It was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal has worked extensively in his home country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, like Andara, is also excellent. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her interpretation of Beatriz. <br /> <br /> A great film of the director of the cinema: Luis Bunuel.
