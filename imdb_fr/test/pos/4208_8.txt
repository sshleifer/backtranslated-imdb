The young John Garfield had a great performance in 1939: "They made me a criminal". Boxer Johnnie Bradfield, who celebrates a win in the ring in a cluttered locker room, tells of his love for his mother, his rejection of the drink and his sleek lifestyle to fans, including cops, who eat it. Later in the evening, he works and struggles with his daughter bimbo while his supervisor shares the evening. And the whiskey. <br /> <br /> A problem arises when another couple arrives. The guy is a journalist and he says he's going to expose Bradfield's fake life on the front page. The manager kills the journalist and he and the floozy leave. The murder discovered, the cops, later, are looking for the now sleepy boxer whose car is driven by the director with the ex-instant moment of his new girlfriend, Johnny. A lawsuit by the police ends with a violent car accident. The manager and the girl are dead and are unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> Johnny discovers he's supposed to be a killer. But he is also presumed dead. Seeking advice from a lawyer, he gives the advisor the key to a safe in a bank box containing his only savings, $ 10,000. The lawyer later gives Johnny $ 250 and tells him that the balance represents his fees to give him professional advice: leave the city quickly and go far. (I would never pay more than $ 5,000 to a client for such concise, succinct and wise direction.) <br /> <br /> Johnny, who is now a freight train tramp, ends up losing consciousness in a ranch in Arizona where he is looked after. Back to health by beautiful Goldie West, Ann Sheridan, a beautiful actress whose career was in the ascendant. Taking Jack Dorney as his nickname, the pugilist loses some of its roughness when he falls in love with Goldie. He becomes a mentor and friend of - The Dead End Kids. Familiar screen characters for pre-war movie buffs. <br /> <br /> The opportunity to make money comes when an exhibition boxer shows up to challenge drugged fans to hold several rounds in the ring with him. Bradfield / Dorney is a natural temptation, but there is a fly in the ointment. Who should be present except New York detective Monty Phelan, the laughing stock of the department? It's been a long time since he was in the morgue because of a small mistake early in his career that sent an innocent man to Old Sparky (we all make mistakes, right?). Phelan recognized Bradfield from a news photo and is there to watch the fight and pinch. Claude Rains is the cop who has endured slights and insults from fellow officers for years. <br /> <br /> The following is predictable, but the behavior is good. I hope it was a main feature when it came out - it's too good to be in second position "B" on a big top. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley, best known for his outstanding choreographer, directed "They Made Me a Criminal" and Max Steiner, one of Hollywood's most prolific composers, wrote nice but not extraordinary music For the movie. <br /> <br /> Now available on DVD at Alpha Video, the film m $ 4.99 and gave me great pleasure. I will watch it again. <br /> <br /> 8/10
