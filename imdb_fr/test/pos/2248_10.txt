Before watching this movie, clean your ears, remove makeup and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She does not have to do it. This image will give you enough heat so that your relationship stays long enough in life. If you are Jewish / Russian / Ukrainian / immigrant - yes, what a popular minority of films, laugh at your memories. Anyway, if you are something else or something else - laugh at the bittersweet memory of the importance of friendship and family. In this film, nothing will seem strange, as strange as it may seem. Nevertheless, I'm afraid that few people see this film because it's not the type of image that people watch when they go to the movies. But please, do it for humanity, and do not forget to get the soundtrack for fun.
