We just got back to see this brilliantly funny movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it, it's partly because I could point out the people and places I knew (I walk around every day! I work there! ',' J drank drinks there! ',' hey it's our factor! 'etc ...). but, still, if you are looking for "well-being" with a little spice (excuse the pun), that's the right answer. relationships, culture and, most importantly, love are all woven into the plot. <br /> <br /> with preston (where the film is shot) recently became a city, it is good to see this work staging the place and adding to the feeling of surprise. it is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures of this part of the north. <br /> <br /> fabulous!
