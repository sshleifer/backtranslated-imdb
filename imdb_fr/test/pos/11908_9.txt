This movie is really great. I do not know why. I always have a soft spot for Damian Chapa. It's not Scarface, but I still really enjoyed my car. It's a movie that I can see more than ten times. He's really trying to make a good movie, but he can not do it. I pity him, so maybe it's a sympathy vote. I can not help it, but I just can not give it less than 9 stars. Everyone should have seen this once in their life. To see how to make a cheap movie work. I live in Holland and I bought this film for one euro only! It's $ 1.50. I would have bought ten euros too. Great awesome. On a small Dutch film site, this film gets 101 votes. Here only a 260. It's not much more. So, people all over the world. Buy this movie!
