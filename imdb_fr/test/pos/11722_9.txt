This is "Citizen Kane" by Burt Reynolds. Unfortunately, nothing that he was involved with nearly came close to "Sharkey's Machine". It seemed to me that he had put everything at his disposal. It's a film that loves movies The opening sequence where Detective Sharkey alone saves a bunch of buses as hostages is an extremely exciting film. Once everything has started, everything moves so fast that everything looks fine, a brilliantly successful effect. It's cold, tense, and dangerous in Mr. Reynolds' streets. The compound looks dirty and tired, filled with desperate people on both sides of the law, shouting, swearing, trying to do business or just staying alive. In this hell, the recently demoted Sharkey descends - a reward for a botched drug bust (caused by a corrupt policeman) - he and his team are part of the Vice Presidents' Brigade. The information gathered about a dishonest politician leads them into the world of luxury call girls and ruthless drug barons. Looking at the apartment of one of these call girls (Rachel Ward), Sharkey falls in love with her portrait hanging on the wall (I know, I know) and when a woman's body is found with her face shot down in the air. one of the rooms, he says to himself it's her. (Well, I said it was a film that loved movies). The scene where she shows up works perfectly, even if you saw the original. The film is full of good looks, and I particularly like Charles Durning's war story, his subtle playing, and his filming that contrasts sharply with Sharkey's kidnapping and torture, which are brutally brutal. I must mention Vittorio Gassman and Henry Silva as two disparate but equally perverse brothers who have absolutely no redemptive characteristics. They are "full" every time they are on the screen and are not a loss to society when their time comes, the end of Mr. Silva being really special. As mentioned, this is a Clint Eastwood film that Clint never did. The biggest compliment I can make to Sharkey's Machine is that I think Clint Eastwood could not have done a better job. The soundtrack is equally high, with Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other leading artists. Randy Crawford's "Street Life" plays behind the title sequence, and I can never hear it without, in my mind, seeing Sharkey walk on the sidewalk. Like other correspondents, I never understood why this film was a bit of a fiasco. I hope it deserves a critical review, especially at a time when many movies and police shows without a quarter of its energy, freshness and pure joy. live are rented roofs. If you are ever tempted to think of Burt Reynolds as a burned pony, put "Sharkey's Machine" in your video machine. I promise you that you will not be disappointed.
