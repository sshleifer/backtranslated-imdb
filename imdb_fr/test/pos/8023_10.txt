Imagine the scene: a bored student in front of an empty day, a video store with a special offer of 5 videos for a rental week. In general, this ex-student has just grabbed a pile of videos of dubious quality for very arbitrary reasons (The Turning anybody?). From time to time, an unknown jewel to discover has entered his VCR - this is the case of this film. Everything is good in the film, but much more than that, all parties entangle to provide something too rare - a good film that cracks. I do not understand why this has never been released in the UK, especially if you consider the shit that you have to cross during the week of the multiplex week after week. I will gladly accept that it is not an Oscar movie (but Titanic was not seduced either - schmaltzy cgi tinted bollocks), it's an extremely enjoyable movie. I was trying to find a way to describe the best way this film should be appreciated / accepted - The perfect movie to watch while staying in touch with your dad, after returning home for the holidays, after a hearty lunch on Sunday.
