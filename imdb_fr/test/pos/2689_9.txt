I'm not really a Watcher TV - except between 6 and 8 years old and "General Hospital" always had Luke and Laura - but there are some exceptions and I really think that "King of Queens" is one of them. Every decade has its classics and I think this show will be (or should be) among the best of this decade. His comic timing is awesome and can sometimes be very weird. On a more "serious" note, actors are more than easily able to convey subtle - and not so subtle - complexities into their characters without becoming too hokey. One speaker wrote that it may take a few episodes to get there, and I agree; it's definitely a problem that weighs you down, but once you're there, you're pretty addicted. And for good reason!
