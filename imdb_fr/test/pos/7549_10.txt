I rented this movie, not knowing what to expect, but WHOA attracted me! <br /> <br /> For all those who, like me, were waiting for a good movie mixing horror and science fiction, it's time to rejoice because the wait is finally over. Write, play, film and direct - all at the top. I hate to admit it, but I actually cried at some point (when Dracula was talking to the disabled man). Really an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. The corridors of the ship provided the perfect phantasmagorical setting for this story and the actors were really able to make their fear more vivid for me. And Coolio as a vampire ... very nice! <br /> <br /> And believe me ... as great as most of the film was ... the end will blow you! I know this movie has a lot of fuss on this site for some reason, but I know that none of you have seen the end come. Brilliant!
