Well, I do not know much about anything, but I liked this movie. In short, it was creative, fun, simple and comforting. In other words, that was all she was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds around a girl's first love (as the title suggests) and I should certainly warn you: do not expect anything provocative or provocative. terms of the material here. I mean, it's a cartoon for kids. This is really a simple story, but it is well told and holds your attention. <br /> <br /> In the end: it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.
