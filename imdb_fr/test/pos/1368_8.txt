Man, I can not believe the largely hard and negative comments for this movie. Okay, it's certainly not a sophisticated piece of cinematic art. But that's a good part of the entertaining fun fun. For starters, the supernatural killer guy with the pumpkin head must be one of the most ridiculously ridiculous and scary stuff ever to stumble in front of a camera; it looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival spookhouse. Second, moderate blood is ridiculously false and unconvincing, the highlight being when this ultra-conservative grid is electrocuted by a toaster. Then there is the always-welcome presence of the ever-charming Linnea Quigley, who was introduced in a memorable way by taking a beautiful, long and totally free shower that lasts two minutes. Surprisingly, we also have appearances of deceased legends of schlock, John Carradine, as an evil warlock and Cameron Mitchell, as the host of a horror show. In addition, scream queens Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith have ephemeral cameos. The lead actor, Ryan Latshaw, projects all the charm and acting ability of an old, moldy strain. The pretty brunette Rachel Carter opens her top and discovers her pretty little breasts. The cruddy special effects are significantly less than special. The score is properly overworked. Yet this film as a whole has some endearing appeal that makes this honey a real cheese delight to watch.
