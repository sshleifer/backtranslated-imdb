It's a really cute movie. I had a massive pajama party (girls 10-11) and they really loved this movie. They watched it twice! Do not let the note fool you. You must be 13 years old or older to rate a movie on IMDb, which eliminates the target audience of the movie. If you have a girl (or a boy) between 7 and 13 years old, I guarantee you that they will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> A sort of kind of "Notting Hill" inverted taking place in high school. Aaron Carter plays a famous pop star who fails in his private lessons. His mother sends him to an "ordinary" high school with the ultimatum, "pass high school or no summer tour". Following the advice of his manager (former pop star David Cassidy), he befriends the smartest girl in the school (Alana Austin) in order to deceive her. Look for the humorous and insightful conciliator (another former pop star, Lief Garrett).
