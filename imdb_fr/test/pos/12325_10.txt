I have watched thousands of movies in my life and I believe this film is the most "perfect" film ever made. By perfect, I mean narration, intrigue, acting, staging, cameraman work, etc. filing a report with the police officer in the film Fargo. (Indeed, this scene may well be brief.) In The Dead, each scene is performed to perfection, making the entire movie perfect. Maybe John Huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie. Let's hope that Daniel Webster took him out of the contract!
