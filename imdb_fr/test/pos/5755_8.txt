It's a movie gem, Slapstick Violence, Simon Pegg and Green Spew. <br /> <br /> A shady central and an uncontrollable motorcycle are added to this success. <br /> <br /> If you have not already seen it, I highly recommend it. Maybe not as good as the bottom but not too short. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen a man impale his nose on two hooks, then what are you waiting to buy this movie? <br /> <br /> I did not even see the twist in the end when it turns out that Ritchie and Eddie are both ghosts. <br /> <br /> Feeb - 1 boiled egg.
