In the tradition of "neo" black films such as "Chinatown", this film focuses on a mystery of crime in a dark realm where a little insight mingles. Typical black characters, including the policeman to prove his worth, damsel in distress and a villain, villain. Sharky's Machine gets a first 9 out of 10 for its cinematography, as well as for its direction, its history, its strong character game and its superb score of jazz. Available on DVD, although the soundtrack itself is out of print (but available "used" on some auction sites). Filmed in the beautiful downtown Atlanta (hometown of novelist Diehl) and its sleek style dating back to around 1979, a citizen or visitor from Atlanta would have long dreamed before the 12-lane highways crisscross the city, the dream of a director of photography this moment. This was Rachel Ward's first American feature film.
