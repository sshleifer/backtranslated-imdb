If we could have "separate tables", why not "separate lies". <br /> <br /> This becomes somewhat complex. The husband of a housekeeper is killed when he is hit by a car while riding a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman for whom she cleans. The latter had an affair with a friend and drove the car with his lover when the accident occurred. To further complicate matters, the housekeeper has already worked for the guy's parents and imprisoned him for stealing. As a result, people will be reluctant to believe that it was his car that caused the accident. Looks like she wants revenge. <br /> <br /> All this becomes complicated. When our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car, she reiterates her testimony to the chagrin of the officer who is working on the case. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, several months later, our lover (Rupert Everett) becomes terminally ill and our lady (Emily Watson) lets her husband (Tom Wilkinson) take care of him . <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good here, despite the infinite "Peyton Place" "as a theme, and Tom Wilkinson, a lawyer, tries to protect his wife. <br /> <br /> The film is good, but we could have done without it, well the wedding ended anyway.
