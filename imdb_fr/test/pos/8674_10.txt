I think it's the best Norwegian movie I've ever seen. Andreas, 40, is hit by a subway train and suddenly finds himself in an unknown city. However, everything here has been prepared for him. He has a job, a house and clothes. At first, this city seems perfect, no death, no pain and no problems. Everywhere there are men in gray suits who clean and correct everything that does not correspond to their definition of the perfect. However, Andreas fails to integrate and begins to return to his old world. He tries by all means to return. <br /> <br /> What impresses the most in this film is the way they make the city so surreal, even though I have often seen these places so far away in real life. Another thing that contributes greatly to the performance is that of the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is simply the ideal type to play against Andreas, confused and embarrassing. And all the other characters also do a good job playing with apathy (it sounds like a difficult job, does not it?). The strong difference between Andreas and the others also leads to very funny situations. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fabulous movie. The plot may be a bit confusing, but the movie has such an atmosphere that I would recommend everyone to go see it. <br /> <br /> And I would not recommend listening to "ccscd212" because it seems that he has seen too many American commercial movies and seems to have become too used to being served morals on a platter money. From what I see, there is not much in this film that tries to tell us that suicide is right or wrong. I see this more as a warning of a direction that seems to be taking our society. But of course, everyone can see a movie in their own way.
