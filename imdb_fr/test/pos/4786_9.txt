It's time "Kate Jackson" had the credit for this movie .., I remember watching her & trying to figure it out on TV .., my grandmother was in bed dying from cancer and I was barely 15 years old. I did not find Years later, Richard is long dead .., I miss him in other shows / movies in which he was. <br /> <br /> I always have a copy of the VHS tape, but it's not "CC'd" or subtitled for the hearing impaired & it's the only flaw of the movie I remember or that I know so far .., I have not been able to find a DVD or VHS copy with English subtitles. If anyone knows that there is a copy on VHS or DVD under CC'd or English subtitles, thank you to let me know. <br /> <br /> thanks - thanks.
