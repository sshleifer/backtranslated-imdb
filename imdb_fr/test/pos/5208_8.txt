The film is about the Battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who know nothing about it, it was the worst battle of the Second World War. More than a million people died during the battle. This is the only film I have seen that seems to have really shown how bad the war between Russia and Germany was. What I really liked was that both ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were nowhere in the film. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not perceived as bloodthirsty murderers but as an average German infantryman. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try to take the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 to early 1943. During this time, they discover the horrors of war and try to get out of the battle. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we feel the desperation of the whole battle. Unlike "Enemy at the Gates," the filmmakers did not attempt to tell an unhealthy love story or dress the events of the battle. This film may be a fiction, but it tells what happened during the bloodiest battle of the Second World War.
