For a long time, I, a fan of the television series "The Monkees", I refused to watch "Head" because it was not about the characters of the TV show, which were warm and wonderful. "Head", instead, would be a dark and cynical film. Finally, curiosity pushed me to give way. Of course, I did not find a new episode in the TV show, but a fascinating film that seduces my dark side. <br /> <br /> I've always been fascinated "Head" looked a lot like watching someone else's dream, with incomplete allusions to stories and a little detail at the end of a scene that made the film part in a new direction, much in a dreamlike flow of consciousness. The unfinished stories make my imagination crazy again and again! <br /> <br /> The film also features a stunning cinematography, the quintessence being the black-on-white, white-on-black look of "Dad's Song". The music is haunting, especially the lush setting of "The Porpoise Song". ("The Porpoise Song" is the favorite song of my dark side, while my shiny side prefers "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah".) <br /> <br /> Finally, I think the TV series could have used some of the drama, intrigue and intensity of "Head". But "Head" could have used some of the show's warmth, humor and friendship.
