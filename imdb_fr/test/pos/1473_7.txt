It must be said that this movie is certainly one of the best movies "bargain" - I would feel a little cheated if I had paid £ 15 for that, but at around £ 1.50, I feel like I I really got more. that my money is worth. <br /> <br /> The film can not really decide if it wants to be "Mad Max" or one of the "Unnamed Men of Clint Eastwood", spaghetti westerns, and as such is stacked of snapshots of both. Even the crazy maniac who hangs out with the bad guys in "Mad Max" is there. <br /> <br /> This guy from "Blade Runner" also looks good, although he's only present at the beginning and end of the month. End of the movie. <br /> <br /> Coup de coeur - for me, the punch at the top of the oil refinery - looking closer, you can see the "post-apocalyptic" traffic that goes off far then that the two protagonists strike each other with seven blows of the bell. <br /> <br /> Put a couple of beers in it, some pizzas and get comfortable to enjoy a drivelité both light and fun.
