I was surprised to love this movie since I come from school "look at your brain at the door and have fun". However, this film touched my heart. I have friends like Emily's mental retardation. I have friends like non socialized Evie. And I was in Evie's place, chasing the occasion out of fear and dedication to others. <br /> <br /> Amy Madigan's disappointment with her daughters was almost palpable on the screen and the hard times she was trying to bridge the gap The gap with Evie was raw and painful to watch. And maybe I'm denser than most, but I've never seen the flaw with Evie's father coming. Usually, I deal with these things fairly quickly. <br /> <br /> My reservations are similar to others posted here. I thought that the wonderful and likeable character of Christopher Lloyd (a very different role for him, I thought) was underutilized. What happened to him once he understood what was happening with poetry? Would he want, like James, to try again ??? Second, the end, as it was, seemed to solve nothing or accomplish. I did not expect the pieces to be picked up and all the ends tightly knotted, but I felt I was at odds with the characters, that there was no real healing or real efforts. <br /> Otherwise, exquisite and lyrical and disturbing and, for some, very, very true.
