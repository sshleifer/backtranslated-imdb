I was in the mood for a French movie and I saw it at Blockbuster. What a gem it turned out to be! I do not know how I missed Gregori Derangere all these years, but he is fantastic. Such innocence and grace! I like his face and the way he moves. Isabelle Adjani was hilarious - it reminded me of the outstanding performance of Nicole Kidman at the Moulin Rouge. It looks the same as it was 20 years ago ... really remarkable. Gerard Depardieu has not resisted as well, but his acting continues to amaze. He is perfect in this movie. I will probably buy this one, I liked it so much. If you want to see another good French movie, rent Joyeux Noel. Stunning.
