I have the logical sense of knowing that oil can not last forever and I am perfectly aware that my life in the suburbs is focused on petrochemicals. I am an avid consumer of new technologies and I always run out of space on power boards. So I know that even the lack of energy associated with Peak Oil will significantly change my life. <br /> <br /> The End Of Suburbia shows, in a rational and entertaining way, how much the lifestyle of my whole family will change in my life. I am particularly concerned for future generations, who will have to take responsibility for our excesses, but filmmakers offer a glimmer of hope by recognizing the dynamism and determination of man - and the sense of community that tends to be created by shared difficulties. <br /> <br /> It is useless to try to claim that Peak Oil is unfounded propaganda - or treat it as an imminent radioactive cloud in "On the Beach". Even with all our efforts, times will get tougher and I hope there will be enough compassion and humanity for everyone.
