Featuring amazing and wonderful characters, a new mythology, beautifully designed and executed sets, Nightbreed is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the absence of a known lead has led the film to find the shadow. Perhaps the director's homosexuality has led to the film's unwitting censorship by the white public, whom the film condemns. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film is a treasure of the film / superhero genre. <br /> <br /> A sequel featuring highlander style flashbacks at different times in history would be interesting. <br /> <br /> Another idea would be the basis of the new Midian. Maybe in Texas somewhere or in the Lousiana swamps with crocodiles and a traveling circus.
