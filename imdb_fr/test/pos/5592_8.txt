I really felt that the movie was ahead of its time. The potential daughter-in-law was such a strong, career-oriented woman. She knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the future mother-in-law. The role of the mother was extremely well played (you just hate her). His need to control his son's life was diabolically evil. If you have already had a relationship where you have been judged and found to be deficient (and everyone involved was well aware), it may be too close to home. I've seen this movie for years, and I remember thinking that this plot and dialogue would work in a film from the '50s or' 60s. It's hard to look at because of the dynamics of the mother and some threads, but I'd like to see him again. I hope to continue to find it on one of the old movie channels, but so far, no luck. The purchase attempts were also futile (I do not think it's on tape or DVD).
