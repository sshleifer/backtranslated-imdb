Whoever says Lucio Fulci is not one of the most important names in Splatter's story is probably crazy. The Italian director is a legend among fans of hardcore horror, and his work goes beyond the barriers of the genre (who can forget This film is probably his most glorious film and, unfortunately, the last one.) A horror director (Fulci like him himself) begins to have hallucinations about horrible murders.At this time, the doctor begins a long series of serial crimes.With such a plot, the film should have been filled with something of boredom sometimes the movie is saved by the excessive violence that will certainly please gore addicts.
