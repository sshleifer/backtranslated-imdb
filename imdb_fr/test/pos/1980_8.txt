This film is breathtaking and breathtaking. But I think maybe it can only be appreciated by rigorous role plays. It's like a game. One of the problems is that the plot is too much like a game and has too many twists. The twists are excessive. Jude Law gives a very good performance. I really like it a lot in this movie, just like Jerome in Gattaca and Gigglo Joe in A.I.
