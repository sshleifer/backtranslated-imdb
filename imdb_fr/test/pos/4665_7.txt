As a film, THE ITALIAN JOB is at best acceptable; good (not great), <br /> <br /> beautiful visual and rhythmic, a mediocre plot, but nothing serious enough <br /> <br /> to go out. But as a car advertisement for the new MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers race, this film is spectacular! <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Ok, it's a typical movie film movie with a strange twist (the underwater creak was nice, if not improbable), and the cast was pretty solid <br /> <br /> (with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg), but when everything happened <At bottom, the real "stars" of this photo were the three MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, in all their high flying activities, speed racing, jumping on ramp, <br /> <br /> new shiny, shiny and brilliant ball. The audience I was <br /> <br /> sat among the "ooed" and "aahed" when Theron's little red number hit <br /> for the first time on the screen (oddly enough, neither she neither <br /> <br /> Wahlberg provoked the same reaction). <br /> <br /> The film starts promising. Mos Def, Seth Green, Donald <br /> <br /> Sutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham all start with <br /> <br /> as an interesting and humorous group of characters, with the unique <br /> <br /> Uninspired performance being that of Mark, usually good <br /> <br /> Wahlberg. Why he claims it's his best film I can not imagine; His character <br /> <br /> corresponds to a single note, and he plays it so blandly <br /> <br /> that it was as if Mr. Rogers was coming back from the dead and was living. > His body. Charlize is doing well as Sutherland's daughter, though <br /> <br /> nothing magical. Seth Green's character is perfect and the jokes on Napster (including a cameo from Napster's founder, <br /> Shaw / Fanning) are hilarious; He and some of the first lines of Mos Def <br /> <br /> add some much needed sparks of humor. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland do not get close enough to <br /> <br /> the duration of the screen. <br /> <br /> You can see most of the plot coming from <br /> <br /> the dialogue is riddled with unpleasant surprises and gifts, but I doubt that the <br /> <br /> > Filmmakers wanted to reinvent the wheel here, so taken as a typical <br /> <br /> action / suspense, it's going well. To see absolutely during the night cheap <br /> <br /> I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> 7/10. Not worth its weight in gold, but pretty trimmings.
