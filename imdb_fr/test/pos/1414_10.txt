An introspective look at the relationship between Hawking and the space / time contingent. This film exposes the Gallilian and Newtonian laws and its relation to Einstein's theory of general relativity. <br /> <br /> The film is directed methodically, exposing the details of the man (Hawking) as well as his work (Black Holes). The interviews with his family are a little too long. Unfortunately, his theories and ideas are less developed. <br /> <br /> A Philip Glass soundtrack superbly complements the movie. Only one other man could compose such instellar melodies that haunt you (Jean Michel Jarre). <br /> <br /> Overall, I would highly recommend this film based on Hawking's "wisdom nuggets" and his proper explanation of an event horizon!
