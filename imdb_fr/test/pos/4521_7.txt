This film is about a deadly poison contained in small glass globes used to kill. This is apparently done to hide a spy ring that intends to steal the plans of a new American bomber. Now, much of this plot has been taken up in other films by Chan, THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS. In addition, it was used for the first time in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE - all had explosive glass globes - an element of the plot that obviously has been overused. MURDER OVER NEW YORK was interesting, but it was rather outdated for these last films. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the rest of the movie was cool and the plot was going very well - with a clever conclusion where, of course, the culprit is revealed. However, no plane could fly like this - especially in 1940. Such extreme dives and rapid climbs were ridiculous enough to get out of this already obsolete plane. <br /> <br /> By the way, in a small role as a doorman, you'll see Frank Coghlan Jr.-- the same actor who played Billy Batson in the CAPTAIN MARVEL series. According to IMDb, Coughlan is 93 and retired from the film industry.
