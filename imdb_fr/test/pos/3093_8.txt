Undoubtedly one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog may have pushed the boundaries of cinema perhaps more than any other commercial filmmaker. I have known Herzog for a few decades and I have never been impressed by both man and his work. Last year, I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at the relative dominance of the film, but I could not help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and his team into the jungle to not only do the film, but also to live it. No other filmmaker is so crazy about the purity of the filming process. The film legend of Fitzcarraldo has been transformed into a cinematographic legend. <br /> <br /> Today, I sat in front of Fata Morgana, a 1969 Herzog film that could be described as an allegorical filmic postcard. Without looking for real places, I suppose it was shot somewhere in Africa, coastal and desert, a region that might once have been the cradle of man, civilization and life on Earth. It is these origins, the biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse that interest Herzog, as the story told throughout the 79 minutes of reading. <br /> Watching FM, I could not help but feel that I was a passenger in a deep journey. In the opening sequence, the title is translated "Mirage" and Herzog juxtaposes this translation to multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on an airstrip. These images are perverted, their three-dimensionality is crushed by a long lens, forming layers of escape, heat waves and luminous aberrations on each other. The effect let me conclude: things are not what they seem to be. <br /> <br /> FM is divided into 3 very distinct chapters: 1) Creation, 2) Paradise and 3) The Golden Age. The first chapter opens with countless languorous images of dark, barren landscapes, rotten dead animals, broken shells and abandoned cars slowly falling apart under the desert sun. The people inhabiting this inhospitable landscape are tattered, unsmiling and seemingly desert prisoners. The narration speaks of a time before life, a time when the web of the earth was white and where only the heavens existed. While the narrative evokes a simpler and purer epoch, the portrait of a young boy holding a fox-like animal in his throat evokes a frightening depiction of man's cruel and ruthless attempt to impose power on nature. <br /> <br /> In the next chapter, we will present a little more of the same, but the images and characters are more animated and seem infused with a minimum of life and vitality. We listen to a stunned biologist talking about the difficulty with which a surveillance lizard hunts prey in a lifeless environment. As he holds the wiggling monitor, his tongue flicking the flies, he also describes how difficult it is to capture these creatures in a burning heat of 140 degrees. The parallel is duly noted and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated and candid portraits of individuals struck by the sun, the desert and the laborious efforts necessary to exist in this difficult realm. He also advances the following theme: if this is not the case, the man claims control of his environment and not always in the most pleasant way. <br /> <br /> The last chapter brings us out of the desert blast furnace the more familiar Herzog territory populated with eccentrics and absurd behavior. Nobody seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the world's singulars than Herzog - maybe that's where he feels most at home. Like Errol Morris, Herzog chooses to place his camera as objectively as possible before letting the film roll. Herzog's subsequent flirtation with his subject is the result of his ability to keep going well beyond the point where most directors would have shouted cuts. Like Morris, this long list goes beyond the moment when subjects feel compelled to offer themselves and, because of the inconvenience caused by overtime, their facade gives way to something real. The most humorous portrait of this chapter is that of the group of two people playing a strange, polka-like song that Herzog recycles throughout this chapter. The drummer in the group wears the same glasses as the biologist, like another guy who does a magic trick and asks the following question: what do we do with the glasses? They add a bit of lightness to the film, but you have to wonder if they have a deeper meaning or meaning, or is it another example of Herzog's madness. <br /> <br /> The narrative aside, Herzog uses folk and blues music as the soundtrack to the experimental documentary. Leonard Cohen spends the most time on screen, with two of his beautifully melancholic songs, "So Long Marianne" and "Suzanne". perfectly accompanies the moving landscapes, adding to the convincing sensation that we are really along the ride. At the end of the trip, Herzog returns to one of the many clich√©s that recur throughout the film: the distant framing of an isolated vehicle crossing the endless desert, engulfed by a mirage of water that fills the horizon. In spite of FM's general moroseness, the film's crescendo and mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit, convinced that, despite everything, life will persevere and perhaps even flourish. <br /> <br /> After writing this post I referred to FM to discover that Herzog had shot in Saharan Cameroon just weeks after a bloody coup d'etat. True to his legend, Herzog and his team were arrested, beaten and imprisoned. During his incarceration, Herzog fell ill with schistosomiasis, a parasite of blood. It's really hard not to love a film as hypnotic and austere as Fata Morgana. Knowing that the filmmaker was ready to die to make him do so is all the more respect. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
