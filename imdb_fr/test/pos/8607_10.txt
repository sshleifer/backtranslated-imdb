It makes me furious that, now and forever, I will have to identify this film (which I consider a masterpiece and that I do not use this word lightly) with the qualifier "Not the film of Michael Douglas " Not only are the titles identical, but they also refer to the same thing: the fallout that rained down on the survivors of the first nuclear attacks. In Imamura's film, it's not a cheap metaphor; the entire film talks about the physical and emotional fallout from Hiroshima and the war itself. As the deterioration of a couple and their niece becoming clearer becomes clearer, the ironic image becomes more powerful, from the old clock that is reset each night to the stone gods that gradually accumulate in front of the door. heroin. (These, in turn, are carved by a veteran with clogged shocks who is forced, in a series of tragicomic episodes, to attack anything that has an engine approaching the city.) Yet "Black Rain" ("NtMDm!") Can be watched, even many times, because of Imamura's compassion for his characters. I repeat: a masterpiece.
