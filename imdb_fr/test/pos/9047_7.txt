Dexter (Kurt Russell) returns from The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes for a new standalone adventure. Dexter, always a mischievous student, has an idea for a formula to make things invisible. Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is not very impressed and hopes to win a lucrative scientific prize with the student studying bees. However, bees sting the student and he is allergic. There is this chance for a prize. But wait, Dexter does it! He actually concocts a liquid that makes him invisible. The problem is that an unscrupulous businessman (Cesar Romero) learns it and decides that he can use this formula, thank you, for something illegal. Can he manage to steal the bottle under Dexter's nose? It's a TCWT movie, but you do not have to watch the first movie to enjoy it. Russell is a great nonsense leader who comes when it really matters. The rest of the cast is also a dream: Flynn, Romero, Jim Bacchus and others show how much their comic skills are always appreciated. The script is just an innocent fun that is charming, with special effects somewhat simple, by today's standards, but effective anyway. If you want to sit back and relive a bygone era or just want to share a quality G-rated movie with your family, it's a great choice. Even if he is over 30, it is likely that even now, you will see your loved ones laughing in blues by showing this movie.
