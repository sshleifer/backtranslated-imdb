Yes, maybe some parts of this movie need to hang on a bit, but that does not detract from the charm and wonder of the movie. It was presented as part of the Youth Film Festival of our city and was the favorite of the organizing committee. Which is not surprising. The subject - coming together in a torn race, although post-apartheid South Africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspiring. Of course, as the previous comment mentions, the film has its flaws, but the realism of the scenery and the way the director treats his subject refute these flaws. I saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children. A movie to watch, meditate, discuss and act.
