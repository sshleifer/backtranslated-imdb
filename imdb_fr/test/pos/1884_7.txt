It was a funny movie. After seeing the Evil Dead trilogy not a week ago (and I wanted to have more), I had as many Bruce Campbell films as possible, including some very bad movies. This one is funny, without being exceptional, but original. <br /> <br /> I mean, you have crazy scientists, superhuman cyborgs, brain monsters, gypsies, old KGB taxi drivers, jealousy, murder of passion, love, romance, sex, action and what else, all with the same 6 actors :) <br /> <br /> You really have to see and appreciate it, I can not explain it in a field of text. I guess it's not really a cult movie like Evil Dead, but it's certainly the key I love, Bruce Campbell. Ted Raimi gives a hand, Tamara Gorski is both beautiful and interesting (she moved away from the prostitute on Friday 13th) and Vladimir Kolev is also very promising as an actor, although he will probably be interpreted as a secondary character. in Hollywood movies his entire career. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: funny movie. If you liked Evil Dead, you will also like that.
