It was an excellent movie in every sense of the word. He approaches the subject of tribadism in a society that does not tolerate any deviation from the norm. It criticizes many of the Indian customs that many find oppressive - such as the organization of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, valuing women in terms of their ability to create a baby, the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that transcends the boundaries of the society in which the two protagonists find themselves. The film is well played and authentic, totally believable from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood movies. The main defects of the film, as I have seen them first, are that the two lovers seem to be attracted to each other by a natural affinity to each other, but also by the fact that they are stuck in dead end marriages, without passion and without conviction. rewards. This may play a role in the characters' sexual awakening, but most people stuck in the same situation will not "become homosexual". It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are rather heterosexual - when Radha makes her scene at the end of the film with Aashok, she says that "without desire, she was dead," and the implication was that if he had wanted it so, he could have realized it completely, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband did not seem to like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals - they can seek the comfort of people in the same situation, but in the film, it is not at all clear that they are lesbians from the beginning - well opposite. It is true that some people are bisexual, but most tend to be heterosexual or heterosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive twitches for the husbands. . . If this had not been the case, would they naturally have found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they might not have considered otherwise? The film ignores that. The other fault is the denomination of the characters. . . the names Sita and Radha seem deliberately shocked and scandalized (imagine a movie in America describing a gay relationship between a man named "Jesus" and another named "Paul"!) using names associated with various Hindu scriptures. The film is strong enough to be autonomous and does not need such devices in my opinion. In any case, the faults do not prevent much the power of the film. This is indeed a very touching and powerful story - the pictures and characters will remain long after you leave the theater.
