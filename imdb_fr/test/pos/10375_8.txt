David Suchet is Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot in "After the Funeral", directed in 2005. Anyone who has heard David Suchet speak with his own British accent knows how shocking it is, because his accent as Poirot is so perfect the character. Suchet is the poirot of Agatha Christie's books, and although I confess to love Peter Ustinov in the role, his portrayal has little to do with what Christie has written. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Poirot is solicited by a lawyer friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. En route on the train, the lawyer recounts the events that occurred after the death - a strange testament that will disinherit the expected heir and the statement of that man's sister that he was murdered. When Poirot meets the family, he discovers an adultery, many secrets, another will and a murder. <br /> <br /> The story is excellent with rich production values ​​and a wonderful and detailed description of the period. All the acting is superb, especially Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Poirot is here without Hastings, his beautiful office or Miss Lemon but it is nevertheless effective. <br /> <br /> I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway in "Amadeus". Amazing. What actor - when he plays Poirot, all I see is IS Poirot.
