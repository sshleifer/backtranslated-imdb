We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and out of time ... It's not your usual Hollywood behavior. <br /> <br /> My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and forwarded a series of new versions of Hollywood blockbuster movies. He was about to go out when he saw this and decided to try his luck. There was only one copy - and with some problems on the DVD, we finally had to switch to the widescreen version, and then again to the full screen version to stop it stagnating. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role. And she can sing too! <br /> <br /> If only Hollywood would learn from independent filmmakers! Maybe we could go back to the real movies. But for now, we stick to staggering and really entertaining movies like this one! Other examples we enjoyed include: a box full of moonlight, pieces of April, Delivering Milo, The Celestine Prophesy. Most of Christopher Guest's, such as: Best in Show, For Your Consideration, A Powerful Wind and Waiting for Guffman
