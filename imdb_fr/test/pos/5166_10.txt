It's a great movie and I hope they put it on DVD so that people can buy it. It's hard to try to catch it all the time on TV. As you do not know when one of the stations will decide to broadcast it. Can anyone tell me which company of files created it so that I can write to him and see if it will broadcast it to the public? I only took the last hour and a half yesterday and I saw it only once last year. My sisters and I are looking for it in every store that sells videos. John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot is awesome. They have released much older films and I think that's fine, but there are a lot they have not released and I think if we could contact the producers and make our requests heard, we could to turn some DVDs.
