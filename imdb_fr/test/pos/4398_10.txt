I was in the film right away. I saw Coen's other films, except for Raising Arizona, and noticed that each of their movies had a color. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is bright orange and this film is nice yellow. <br /> <br /> The pleasant and brilliant qualities of this film start right away. Soon, the look is accompanied by great, good music. This is the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written at a time when music was appreciated as part of everyday life. Everyone appreciates chain gangs, church choirs and even prison escapees. <br /> <br /> Now, let's talk about prison escapees. I do not know what crime their characters could have committed, because they are a very very nice group. Clooney is fantastic, he plays his role fully. <br /> <br /> Go see this as soon as possible. I think everyone can enjoy it. For some reason, the theater I was in was filled with old ladies and old men, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You will like it too, I promise. I had to get my hands on the soundtrack right away.
