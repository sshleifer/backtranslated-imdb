"Kramer vs. Kramer" is a dreadful drama about an unhappy woman coming out of her husband and young son. The husband must now assume the responsibility of taking care of the boy. In doing so, they know each other better. But then the mother and the wife come back and she wants the boy's guard. "Kramer vs. Kramer" contains many dramas and wonderful comedies. Dustin Hoffman won his first Oscar for Best Actor for his brilliant performance here. Most people say that his performance in "Rainman", which earned him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in this movie, but I do not agree that it's his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this film. Scene after scene, shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He is also sometimes funny. Meryl Streep, who was not as well known when she made this film, is also very successful. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Actress in a Supporting Role) for her work in "Kramer vs. Kramer" as a wife and mother trying to get together after leaving her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the movie was released, is wonderful as a son of Hoffman and Streep. He has won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and is still the youngest performer ever to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also a friend of the family. She also had an Oscar nomination (for the support actress she lost to co-star Streep). "Kramer vs. Kramer" is an excellent film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton made an absolutely unforgettable film. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
