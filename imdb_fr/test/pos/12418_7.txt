I had Monster Man in a box set of three movies where I especially wanted the other two, but I still had a very pleasant time. He combines horror and comedy to a reasonable effect, greatly aided by the decent performances of Eric Jungman as lead geek, Justin Urich for his hole friend and Aimee Brooks for his love. The film is quite predictable and exploits the ideas of many other movies, but remains fun throughout the day, with some good gore horrors. Of course, it does not correspond to classic goric comedies, but that is not a problem. Director Michael Davis even manages one or two scary scenes, like in the bathroom or at the bar. The film can be viewed from end to end if it is a little complicated and written. For me, it loses a little towards the end when the title Monster Man starts to look like a member of Slipknot and the film tries to make more horror style, but it is not. Not crooked or convincing enough. The last moments are also a bit weak. Still, despite lack of suspense and general foolishness, this is a good example of unpretentious, often disgusting comedy that should please all fans.
