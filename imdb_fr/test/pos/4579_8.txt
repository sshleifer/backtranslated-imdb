This film is quite funny and sad enough, I think it's a bit true. If you like Office Space, you'll love this movie because it's another Mike Judge hit, but it does not look like Office Space. I told everyone to watch this movie. I just hope it would have been in more theaters to get the recognition he deserved. I love this movie and I would like to see more of Mike Judge. Luke Wilson is also what makes this movie what it is. I am so happy not to be alive in the year 2505. If this film proves to be true, we will all have a lot of problems. I just hope that more people will see this movie because I know they will fall in love too.
