The frightening demons "The Gentlemen" capture the voice of the people of Sunnydale, to steal human hearts without screaming. Giles finds that, according to a legend, if a woman screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, must fight without a voice. best episode of the fourth season of Buffy at this time. Having a lot of humor and funny situations, I really liked. Spike is hilarious, the romance between Alex and Anya is cool, but I loved the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley. The gothic scenario of the final battle against "The Gentlemen" recalls the environment of "Dark City". My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Silencio" ("Silence")
