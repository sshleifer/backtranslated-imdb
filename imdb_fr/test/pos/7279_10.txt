Wow, I loved this movie, this movie was full of twists, good acting, beautiful story and a surprising end. To be quite honest, this film was not overly gore, it certainly contains a little gore, but was rather psychological. I read it on the Internet: the film cost $ 3,000 and was shot in 8 days. Unbelievable!!! This is for someone who wants to think and loves great movies. What begins as a terror thriller slowly turns into something a little more twisted, even a little more sinister. I can not say much without giving plot points, but only that this film exceeded my expectations.
