Great 1980s cartoon comedy in southwestern England. It's a story of sex, drugs, cream teas, and murders by the sea. Adrian Edmondson, the French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (hilarious in drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a role. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress his girlfriend by bragging about being involved in a multi-million pound transaction. This leads to complications with hilarious results. I am trying to know the original image format for this movie, but it does not appear in the "Technical aspects" section of the IMDb website. I spotted the DVD in the shop and it seems to be in the format 1.33: 1 (full screen). Was the film shot in this report or was it originally a widescreen movie with panoramic DVD? It would be useful to know that I hate panoramic movies and digitized movies. So come on IMDb. Could you find out for us?
