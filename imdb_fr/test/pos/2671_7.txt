It is sometimes difficult to look at such self-styled "message films" from an earlier, seemingly simpler time without some degree of cynicism. The issue of racism and religious tolerance has been addressed from an early age and, as we grow up, teachers and authorities have sought less obvious, but equally effective, ways to get the message across. . "The house I live in (1945)" is about as subtle as "movie messages", and Frank Sinatra seems to treat his audience like a child ?? In fact, this was perhaps the goal, because the short film was probably intended primarily to influence young moviegoers. Still, I found myself curiously affected when Sinatra launched this heartfelt patriotic speech about what it really means to be an American? and I'm not even an American! Published only two months after the end of the Second World War, director Mervyn LeRoy sent a message of tolerance, solidarity and, above all, hope to war-weary spectators. The music is not bad either. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra with a fresh face ?? already a star, but not yet the superstar he had become ?? opens the film in a recording studio, entitled "If you're just a dream" with full orchestral accompaniment. When, between two songs, Frank goes out for a smoko, he observes a large group of children harassing a young Jewish boy, whose taunts are provoked by his different religion. Ol 'Blue Eyes quickly puts an end to this childish behavior, delicately marking the bullies "Nazi werewolves" and reprimanding their irrational prejudices. He then gives sincere and good faith lectures to the group on the foolishness of racial and religious discrimination, assuring them that every American culture, even if it differs from ours, still has the American heart. unless, of course, you are one of those accursed "Japs". There is a hint of hypocrisy in advocating for racial tolerance while portraying a nation as the collective enemy, though it is hard to blame Hollywood for not being so enthusiastic about the fate of the Japanese in 1945. <br /> <br /> Sinatra directs her point home with a wonderfully comforting rendition of "The House I Live In", written in 1943 by Abel Meeropol. When the composer heard the song for the first time at the movies, he was furious that the filmmakers had completely excluded three of his verses, which he considered crucial for the message. These omissions were probably due to time constraints, but it is understandable that Meeropol was not too kind to them and should have been expelled from the cinema. Upon release, "The House I Live In" was considered a short film so important that it won the Golden Globe "Best Film for the Promotion of International Goodwill" and an Honorary Oscar for all involved. In 2007, it was deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically important" and was added to the National Library of the Library of Congress. That's how I heard about it. Although his approach may seem a little hokey sixty years later, this film remains quite watchable thanks to a young guy named Frank Sinatra.
