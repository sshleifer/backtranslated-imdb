Clearly, my note for this is not to suggest that it compares with the classic horrors of Agento, but with the other small budgets of the 70s, the car fare and in this department, it's really a classic . Lack of money shows well ((Does anyone care too much about this?) The acting is adequate rather than professional (does this make it more realistic?) But unlike so many other movies, and Not only to those on a budget, it does not drag out for a moment, maybe it's just nonsense shit, in your shitty face and even if inevitably a little campy, it's a must for Anyone who has the slightest idea what I'm talking about ... Sometimes very crazy, this crazy little movie filled with crazy characters is clearly made for pleasure and pleasure, indeed, it is to watch.
