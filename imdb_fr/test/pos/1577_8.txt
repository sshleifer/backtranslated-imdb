If they awarded awards to the most depraved and the most messed up films in the world, Japanese cinema was going to clean up: their exploitation cinema clears the ground with most of the contenders, the most extreme examples being exercises absolutely to cut the breath, bad taste, weird, weird and weird smells, and misogynistic sex. <br /> <br /> Guts of a Beauty is an excellent example of this horror, offering savvy viewers a little over an hour of total debauchery and gratuitous violence enhanced by J.'s Very Crazy Splashing Goodness. /> <br /> The film begins with a young woman named Yoshimi, looking for her missing sister who took her to the hands of wicked yakuza, who raped her and then shot her. full of strong dope called Angel Rain. Once the gangsters have finished having fun with the poor woman, she manages to escape and takes refuge in a nearby hospital where the sexy psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) tries to help her. However, Yoshimi, helpless and confused, finally jumped from the roof of the hospital, turning into a watermelon when it hit the ground (at least, what it looked like for me!). <br /> <br /> Seeking revenge After Yoshimi's death, Hiromi attracts Higashi, a yakuza member, to his office and, while pushing him away, hypnotizes him to attack his comrades. After Higashi made himself happy with a knife in the yakuza headquarters, he was severely beaten and stabbed, forced to tell about his meeting with Hiromi, and then hacked huge coins. <br /> <br /> The psychologist is then captured. by the gang, subjected to a spot of forced sodomy (while being forced to give head to a yakuza slut), and injected with Angel Rain, after which she carks it quickly. The gangsters then place his body in the trunk of their car, as well as the remains of Higashi, ready to use. <br /> <br /> Before she can leave the dead, the super drug has an unexpected effect on Hiromi: she returns from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a full-bodied penis and a ravenous hack, and, leaning against revenge, however, she undertakes to kill the yakuza one by one; This gives rise to memorable scenes of scandalously bloody splashing, including a messy squish, a man suffocated by the monster's oozing vagina, and a woman screwed to death by her giant, squeaky phallus. <br /> <br /> As The above synopsis most likely indicates that these are crazy and dubious stuff, which probably will not be to the taste of most sane people, but to those who have long been tired of mainstream cinema and are already well acquainted with Asian excesses. Guts Of A Beauty should prove to be a delirious and deviant entertainment. 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
