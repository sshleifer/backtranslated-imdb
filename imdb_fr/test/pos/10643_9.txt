After reading a biography of the last Russian tsar (Nicholas II) and his failure to get support from the army, I decided to try this film. <br /> <br /> I watched him with a totally open mind, not knowing anything about him (except his reputation). <br /> <br /> These are the things that impressed me the most. <br /> <br /> 1) Plans of battleships and soldiers used as extras. More than once, I stopped to think "if it had been done at that time and in this place, 80% of that would have been generated by computer". <br /> <br /> 2) The realism that is there. From meat infested with maggots to the sailor's shot with his candle and to the legend "killed for a bowl of soup", this film makes no concession to the cause of the PC (which, fortunately, had not yet been invented ). 3) The slow descent into the madness of the Odessa sequence of stages. From the first shot, when the member without a member appears, you have the idea that something is wrong; as the overall plans are composed, you feel comfortable in your environment. Then an amputee appears and people start falling into dramatic poses. However, the plans are composed ... until the Cossacks appear and the juxtapositions of incredible plans appear. This scene is well worth the price of entry. <br /> <br /> 4) The fact that this film is a propaganda 100% pure and simple. On the other hand, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan, he also had a connection with "propaganda"; only a different kind. <br /> <br /> Overall: a film tainted by a little slow story. Nevertheless, Metropolis, Dr. Caligari's Cabinet and this film are perfect examples of inventive and edgy films that are still remembered today for their merits. They really make modern movies boring and repetitive.
