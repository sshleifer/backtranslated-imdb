It is very revealing to see this today and to appreciate how much we expect what we expect from cinema, and at the same time to appreciate the number of basic notions that have been established. <br /> <br /> Here we have a narrative narrative film in its own right - the audio and visual elements are pushed to the limit of their period. The framing is limited at about waist height and above - no close-ups of the face. <br /> <br /> The compositions are remarkable; there is an early cross-sectional scene over the shoulder to present the dialogue; there is a dangerous descent into a canyon with harrowing perspective angles; a sun-bleached skeleton lies in the dust as the wheels and legs move in the upper part of the frame; the tension in the confrontation between the hero and the villain is visually captured by filming above the big axis of a large tree that separates them; and again and again - visual treats abound. <br /> <br /> Today, it is disturbing to see young Wayne wearing a movie, without being embarrassed either by his ego or by his manners. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Walsh has recognized self-reference: the subject is the journey of a group of disparate pilgrims; those who appear on the screen are a disparate group of theater actors, vaudeville comedians, video game artists, and probably carny barkers and veterans of the ten-in-one show. They all agree to chart a course for the making of films. <br /> <br /> This is worth at least a viewing to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed from the following movies.
