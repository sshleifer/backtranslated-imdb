PINK FLAMINGOS, which boasts the title of the sickest film ever made, is an undisputed classic. Of course, the filming is fragile and offbeat, the story is confused and slow, and every character in the film is disgusting and despicable, but PINK FLAMINGOS has a certain playful charm and a brilliant satirical spirit that no other film can match. <br /> <br /> This film is offensive, but reading descriptions of what is happening in the film is far worse than actually seeing it. Only John Waters can succeed in violating, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagia and just about every other form of human debauchery known to man seems absolutely hilarious. This film must be seen to be believed.
