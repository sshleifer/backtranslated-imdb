Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political, government and well-written television dramas of the last 25 years. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb, the writing is spectacular. <br /> <br /> Diry War reveals the real reason why we are not ready to react to a nuclear, biological and radiological terrorist attack here on American soil. <br /> <br /> Dirty War should be turned into a major movie - It's as good as that! I highly recommend this great drama to anyone who wants to know the truth. <br /> <br /> This TV drama reveals how British intelligence services (MI5 and MI6) are trying to reveal a terrorist plot and the plot to destroy innocent victims - because of Britain's participation in the war. war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> The scenes from different parts of London, England, are also spectacular. <br /> <br /> The dirty war is to see absolutely !!!
