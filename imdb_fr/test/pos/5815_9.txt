Although this is not Cassavetes' best work, Minnie and Moskowitz are almost perfect in all their projects. The plot is whimsical and charming, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotions - far more dramatic than comic, unlike the IMDb profile. Yes, the story is whimsical, but not arbitrary. he succeeds as credible, though a little forced - on which I will return. All artistic aspects are true Cassavetes forms: cinematography and camera work are delights, and the soundtrack - although hardly there - is complementary. In addition, I think I noticed Godard's headlines and editing - as in some other Cassavetes films - (including the abrupt cut of a song in a scene), which are interesting. <br /> <br /> I think the plot is well built, the first half being particularly nice. Seymour's conversation with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) in the restaurant, for example, is wonderfully funny and fascinating and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary presented throughout the film. This philosophagus - a tradition in Cassavetes' films - is what made the film for me. Seymour's deep and amusing monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions of him as an hippie simp - although his character is strangely similar to Faces (1968). This, however, made me think (at second reading) that she is opposed to Cassavetes' best work. I won the affection of this film that I missed at the first viewing. <br /> <br /> Several aspects unfortunately make this film imperfect. I find the plot unbalanced. As I said before, it goes up well, but it goes down a bit here and there, especially towards the end. Due to the spontaneous style in which Cassavetes worked, and in particular the freedom with which he let his actors improvise, the quality of his product can easily go both ways. In this case, it is inconsistent. I appreciate that most of this film was improvised and most beautifully. But one or two scenes, unfortunately, just do not work. In particular, the scene after Seymour fights with Minnie's work associate outside her home. In what is supposed to be the most intense scene in the film, Cassavetes let his actors emancipate themselves with dialogue - assuming some have been planned in advance. This, I believe, was a mistake. One has the impression that Cassel does not really know what to do, while he fumbles several times in his speech, often meaningless, and overwrites; all this harms the scene and the development of the character. I understand that Seymour is a bit crazy, but Cassel's attempts here are poorly implemented. Why did he cut his mustache? These defects result from: a lack of direction on the part of Cassavetes; a lack of understanding and foresight on the part of Cassel; a lack of repetition and preparation; etc. Obviously, Cassavetes did not learn the lessons from his mistakes, because he let the same thing happen in his next film, A Woman Under Influence (1974) - The commission scene and the end. <br /> <br /> The defects I mention are not minor, but they do not ruin the film. They simply render some scenes cruel and unrealistic, spoiling the film's flow and compromising its potential. However, I really like Cassavetes and all his actors, especially Cassel, despite the mistakes I mentioned. It is a very pleasant film, although it proves the precarious style of Cassavetes.
