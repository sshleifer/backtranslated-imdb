Compared to that, Tarkovsky is a speed maniac. <br /> <br /> Compared to that, Bela Tarr is MTV. <br /> <br /> In comparison, the movie "Russian Ark" is a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I just described 3 experiences sllllowwwwwesssstttt that I know, and this one surpasses them all. But that does not mean it's bad. On the contrary, I really liked. But it was a chore. <br /> <br /> I will not describe the plot because it can easily be found elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the plot is INSANE. This is one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since "Becoming John Malkovich". I think the interesting plot is the main reason why I kept sleepy (besides, the humor was nice, it's something we rarely see in slow, artistic films). <br /> standard. Most movies have little conspiracy and little substance; yet they fill 90 minutes with a lot of striking images to keep us captivated. But "The Hole" has 100% plot / theme without much to please the eyes. In this respect, I suppose it's a truly intellectual experience, much like reading a painfully verbose novel such as Thackaray's "Vanity Fair" (which I have never been able to finish!). <br /> <br /> If you have considerable attention, I think you will really like this movie. Despite his softness, he is very creative and imaginative. It's like Jean-Pierre Jeunet on quaaludes and with a camera lens dull and dusty. Good luck.
