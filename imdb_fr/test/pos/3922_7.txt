Carly Jones (Elisha Curtberth), her bad brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and her friends Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams) surrender another city to watch an important game. They decide to camp in a field halfway and continue their journey the next day. However, the fan belt of Wade's car breaks and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in a nearby town, where there is a wax house. When they arrive in the square, they realize that the place is a ghost town and two former Siamese brothers disturbed turned people into wax statues. <br /> <br /> I liked this "Wax House", which is well worth it horror movie for teens. The story follows the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other slash-type movies. It is well done and has a good team of actors and actresses, as well as special effects and incredible scenes of death. Even if the movie is not good, watching the sexy and delicious Paris Hilton is worth it. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa de Cera" ("The House of Wax")
