Mikio Naruse's review of the lives of three ex-single geishas in Japan after the war, who are constantly complaining and constantly complaining, is a wonderful person. In the past, they were friends, but their relationship is tense at the moment, as one of the women has become a successful lender and the other two owe him everything. Although the creditor is the only one to succeed in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three who does not have children. The other two each have a child they depend on to earn an income because none of them work. Complications occur when the children decide to get married (but not with each other) and leave the house. This causes the bitter and bitter old women to become even more bitter and grumbling, to become drunk and to complain about their rotten children and their inconsiderate friend, the lender. Meanwhile, the lender is herself unhappy, despite her fortune. She has no one but her deaf deaf daughter to keep her company, and the chance encounters with two former lovers of her geisha era are nowhere to go - all they really want is to borrow from her. money. The three characters are deeply rooted in the quicksand of their own bored life and are too tired to struggle much, opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of all this or, at most, to complain to each other. <br /> <br /> "The last chrysanthemums" are very slow and do not really get much, but Naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do a lot with very little. I have not seen much of his work but I suspect it is not his best, even if he is very good. The problem, I think, is that it does not seem to be a lot of things. But the film is full of good points. Although cynical, it's not excessive. Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paints vivid portraits that give the impression that the characters even seem somewhat noble in the misery of their own misery. Although the film is not a must-see show, it is important as a fragment of the work of a little-known (outside his country) director, a valuable part of which is available on video here in the United States.
