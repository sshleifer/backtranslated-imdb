If you're looking for a fake Hollywood action film, it will not be a movie for you. If you are looking for the truth, rent or buy this. From a true story, the film tries to capture the heart of what was happening / happening in South Africa (and in other places). <br /> <br /> As for historical knowledge, this is the case of stories such as "The Pianist", "Schindler's List" or "Nuremberg". Millions of people today have no idea what apartheid is or its existence. This film can help them learn and can even help them go further.
