This slice of bittersweet magical realism had a history of sawtooth production (replacing the director / screenwriter) and found itself at the box office, but it's a hellish movie. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are pre-teen brothers whose mother-in-law (Lorraine Bracco) rubs shoulders with a mean-spirited alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). During his drinking, Baldwin physically abuses Mazzello and forces him to remain silent about his situation. But when Wood realizes what's going on, the boys give themselves their heads and create a fantastic solution to Mazzello's devastating dilemma. <br /> <br /> I like movies mixing fantasy and dark reality. They rarely succeed financially ("Lawn Dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and intriguing. <br /> <br /> Baldwin, drunk, has a childish perspective and his head is deliberately cut off. under the top of the frame. This apparatus allows us to judge it only by its actions and as a totally materialized beast. Wood and Mazzello are both excellent and effortlessly train us in their dark and scary world. <br /> <br /> The "radio leaflet" of the title is a small red wagon that carries his belongings here. dream. <br /> <br /> Really interesting things.
