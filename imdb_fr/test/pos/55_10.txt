No blood, no sex (even if it's passionate), no special effects, but just one of those pearls that falls on your screen when you're not watching and catches your eye. <br /> <br /> A great action game, great scenery, good music, a beautiful story. If only there were many more movies like this one! <br /> <br /> The decorations transport us in time and make us feel as if we were there. <br /> <br /> The acting game appears as a real life, and raises us to the level of consciousness of "Nanny", to whom no one is a lost cause, least of all the inhabitants of his own home " half-way". <br /> <br /> Best of all is a true story of maladjusted learning to "fit in". I was a little jealous of the good times everyone seemed to have in the movie! Could we all spend time with Nanny?
