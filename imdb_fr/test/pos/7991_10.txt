I really remember having loved BATMAN RETURNS when it came out in 1992, but now I think it's the best of all Batman movies (even after Christopher Nolan's amazing BATMAN BEGINS in 2005 and definitely the oversized movie 2008 THE DARK KNIGHT!). I originally remembered that I thought the 1st BATMAN with Jack Nicholson was the best (and I still love him). But I think this film really hits the nail. The 4 main characters (Batman, Penguin, Catwoman and Max Shreck) are all alive and memorable. You really have the chance to see what Batman / Bruce Wayne represents in Keaton's great description. Keaton is the best Batman, not Kilmer, Clooney, or even the future Bale, who was exceptional in BB and could have stolen the highest honors from him if the character had not been destroyed by the Nolan movie shot in TDK !. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito like The Penguin is disturbing, scary, hilarious and deadly. DeVito is great and does not need to depend on the set to give great performances like Nicholson's Joker. The viewer can really sympathize with this disfigured pariah and its difficult situation to integrate into normal society. I've never really been a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer until this movie, but it's really my favorite performance. Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle is awkward and weird at first, and when she's turned into Catwoman, she's both sexy and scary, a deadly sexpot! Plus, I think Keaton and Pfeiffer have more chemistry than Keaton and Basinger from BATMAN; they form a tragic love story. And Christopher Walken as Shreck is, well, as always, Christopher Walken! <br /> <br /> BATMAN, even more than BATMAN, is more confident and focused. It is guaranteed to make cinema from the beginning to the end. The way Burton presents the sad story of Penguin grabs you from the beginning. The first 5 minutes are among my favorite debut for all films: Danny Elfman's music gives a disturbing and disturbing tone that defines the rest of the film. This is a modification of the original BATMAN and an excellent! <br /> <br /> Then, Gotham turns 33 today, and we are introduced to the powerful businessman Shreck, who wants to build a new power plant in Gotham. During the same scene, we meet the discreet and shy secretary, Shreck, Selina Kyle. And soon after all this is the film's exciting opening action sequence as Batman battles the Penguin Red Triangle Gang, a fun but lethal group of pariahs and circus performers. Penguin sets up a plan to attack Gotham's Christmas celebration, kidnap Shreck into chaos and force him to help him reintroduce him into society. Meanwhile, Selina discovers Shreck's criminal plans and "kills" her by pushing her to the top of her desk, then she is rekindled by cats. <br /> <br /> Its convoluted? Yes, but Burton never claimed to put a realistic story. He has created a world where the viewer can accept that such things can happen, a dark, dark world of maligned and distorted pariahs who basically only want to be accepted and integrated. Confident story if you ask me! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are rare, but they are all exciting, entertaining and breathtaking. They are not there just for the show, like some in BATMAN. And they all have a meaning. The culminating scene with Penguin's "Army" marching into Gotham's center with Batman zoning off the stamp of Alfred Penguin (Michael Gough in a welcome return from the original!) Helping Batman is a succinct, solid and thrilling pleasure ! I also love the winter Christmas decor, which adds to the feeling of darkness and extreme darkness of the Batman world of Burton. I also like how Burton slowly introduces us to Batman "toys" without pushing them in the throat. Each "toy" is appropriate for this moment in the film and we are obliged to accept them for their purpose. And although dark, RETURNS is still a fun movie. The DeVito Penguin has a lot of funny lines. The same goes for Walken's Shreck. The exchanges between Batman and Catwoman are also extremely stimulating and full of humor! A great set! All in all, BATMAN RETURNS is a story closely related to the dark forces at play in the fun and humorous world of Tim Burton's comics.
