20 years later, and this film still has echoes of its grandeur. Never has a movie gone beyond the incredible soundtrack of Valley Girl. The film completely sums up the 80s to such a degree that it can only be realized several years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A film that has so much character that it makes you understand how Hollywood has become sad (in terms of quality). The DVD Special Edition is full of many extras and worth buying, as you will have plenty of equipment to go through. For sure.
