"The Phenix City Story" is a brutal and hard-hitting docudrama about what was once dubbed the "craziest city in America". The film documents the events that led to the murder of Albert Patterson, a criminal syndicate in the city of Phenix, an Alabama lawyer who had applied to the Attorney General's Office to remedy the vice and corruption that was raging in his hometown. His son, John Patterson, took over the reins of his father after his death and won the job, making cleaning the city of Phenix a major part of his agenda. <br /> <br /> Director Phil Karlson has created a film that has the ability to shock even today. The sadness is so implacable that the film is hard to watch. We see the crime syndicate hit and killed to get what it wants - the beatings and murders involve women and children, and one scene in particular, which revolves around the death of a little black girl, is particularly troubling. It's not really a nice movie, because there's very little reward at the end to reward the viewer for attending the annoying events that preceded it, but it's a well done movie, full of an intense and angry energy. <br /> <A 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with current inhabitants of the city of Phenix, some of which are then described by actors in the fictional part of the film. This gives the film a quality of urgency that is reflected in the narration, so that we feel like watching a documentary all the time, a feeling that is helped by Karlson's choice to shoot in real places. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to have seen this movie, but it's one of those movies that outrages you with just indignation and then makes you feel helpless because you can not do anything about it . <br /> <br />: ONE
