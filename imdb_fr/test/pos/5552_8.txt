The Pickle was the most underrated film of the decade. Despite all my efforts at home, it's still considered a bad movie. I say to the devil with everyone about it. Everyone does not understand that it's partly a comedy with a dramatic twist in the end. Danny Aiello plays a director exhausted with perfection and transmits a sad and depressed man. the scene when he tries to record a last message is pretty good. The interludes of the movie Stones are absolutely funny. "It's Harry Stone and today I'm becoming a man!" In short, a thin film and unfortunately misunderstood. Plus a good cameo from Little Richard. Hilarious! I hope more people will see this film because 202 people are not enough for a consensus. <br /> <br /> -Silence Dogood
