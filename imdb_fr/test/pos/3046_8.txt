Martin Ritt seems to be a director who has always been interested in social issues (as a son of immigrants, he had every interest to be, especially since he was blacklisted in the 1950s. ). "Conrack" is based on Pat Conroy's novel "The Water is Wide", which recounts his own experience of 1969: teaching the outside world to a school of impoverished black children, much to the chagrin of the right-wing superintendent (Hume Cronyn) . The cultural and historical context is also the strength of the film: Conroy (Jon Voight) explains to another teacher in frustration that many children do not know Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War or even where find Vietnam. He then proceeds to enlighten them on all these factors. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, I read a complaint that when Conroy was playing music for children, he was only playing white music. The truth is that you can not blame the movie for that; it was based on Conroy's actual experience. Anyway, the movie is a real gem.
