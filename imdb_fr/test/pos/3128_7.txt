The western can be divided into several subgenres. One of the largest divisions is that between Town Westerns and Plains Westerns. Most westerns are a mix of both, but at one end of the spectrum, you have images like High Noon and Rio Bravo that take place almost entirely in a colony, rarely venturing outside. At the other end, you have scenes such as Wagon Master, where there is hardly a house on sight in the middle of nature. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford normally blossomed into the "little end of both" westerns, shooting at the interiors with an emphasis on their small size and confinement, then on a contrast with the wide and open exteriors, which seemed both exciting and dangerous. Wagon Master has a typical scenario of Frank Nugent, with some interaction between old and young green kids, but nevertheless presents Ford with new challenges. In this picture, the dangers do not come from the hardness of the landscape, they come from within the group in the form of Cleggses. In addition, the absence of real indoor scenes means that the outdoors can lose its impact over time. <br /> <br /> However, Ford was a true master of space manipulation. He turns scenes of the camp or carts so that the frame is surrounded and we get the same feeling of closure as in a real interior. Moreover, compared to his other Westerners, he does not open much space, the trail of cars crossing canyons and passages rather than crossing dark and empty plains. One of the few times when he throws the landscape wide open is where the Indians are seen and where there is a possibility of a threat coming from outside. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master presents surprisingly effective moments of comic relief some great contributions from the weird cast. Harry Carey Jr. was becoming an excellent actor like his father, and this is one of his best roles at the beginning. Joanne Dru was disappointing in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, but she seems more comfortable as a character with a little composure and is actually pretty good here. Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar in the film Grapes of Wrath directed by John Ford ten years earlier, appears here with the sole function of making a race gag in which it sounds like an old horn. Nevertheless, thanks to its excellent timing and its movements, it makes work work by the piece. Francis Ford, in one of the many silent drunken roles he played in his little brother's pictures, is at his best cheeky. <br /> <br /> And now we are going to lead the man Ben Johnson. Although he was not a bad actor, he could never become a big star like John Wayne. And yet, with his effortless riding and his drawling voice, he was one of the most authentic players in the West. And that brings me to my last point. It was apparently one of Ford's personal favorites, although it seemed rather modest. Wagon Master does not have a big theme or dramatic intensity, it's just the kind that plays out. I think that's what Ford liked about it. It's a picture for Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Junior, not for John Waynes or Henry Fondas. Small, but worthy of his class.
