I absolutely hate the idea of ​​doing for television movies. For me, TVMs usually associate Jane Seymour or Jaclyn Smith as the mother of a sick child who dies from a hard-to-treat disease, all so sweet that the public does not need tissues, but also insulin. So, when DEADLY VOYAGE is a film made for television by the BBC and HBO and based on a true story that I vaguely remembered, a few years ago, appeared on television schedules, I sat down waiting for to be bored. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> No strike this last sentence, I was not surprised to be shocked. Here is a movie that squeezes you harder than a great white shark. In fact, DEADLY VOYAGE does not deserve to be relegated to the TV program that should have been produced and distributed by a major Hollywood film company because of its absolutely terrifying principle and what's more - unlike BUTTERFLY and SLEEPERS - completely true <br /> <br /> For those who do not know the story !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS TO THE FIELD !!!!! In the early 1990s, a group of Africans embarked on a Ukrainian cargo ship bound for France to work there. Of course, it was an attempt at illegal immigration, but the cargo crew had already been convicted for allowing illegal immigrants to board their ship on a previous trip and no longer have problems with the maritime and immigration authorities, the crew assassinating the Africans after discovering hiding them in the hold. All but an African, Kingsley Ofusu, who manages to escape the firing squad but have to try to survive aboard the ship, but the problem is that the crew is pursuing him and that France is still several days away from home. trip. <br /> <br /> Simply type the paragraph above to remind you how good DEADLY VOYAGE is. What a remarkable story, and again - unlike many stories that claim to be - totally true. It's very well written, directed and performed, especially by Sean Pertwee (Why is this guy not a big star?), And above all, it's a disturbing and claustrophobic thriller that I still remember very well six years after seeing for the one and only time. I can not wait to see you again. <br /> <br /> But you have to ask yourself, how can a TVM be better than most Hollywood blockbusters released around the same time? Oh, wait, I just had a disturbing thought about Jerry Bruickhiemer doing a remake with Tony Scott and Denzil Washington playing Kingsley, Brad Pitt playing the role of Pertwee, a huge artistic license accompanying events, etc. Let's keep DEATH VOYAGE a superlative TVM rather than a poor blockbuster
