Like most of the sports movies that have come out in the past, this movie has similarities, it's based on facts. This film is distinguished by the fact that it is a rugby team, a sport that few Americans know. Aside from that, this movie is a very rewarding piece of black film. It reminds me of "We Are Marshall", but with a reduced budget and an independent movie atmosphere. It's a great effort by director Ryan Little to tell us the story of a rebellious teenager played by Sean Farris (Never Back Down), in the role of Rick Penning, who finds himself in a strange place, both on the field and outside. Despite some holes in the plot, this film has heart, rewarding each of its viewers good characters to whom we can identify. Supporting actors Gary Cole as coach Larry Gelwix and Neal McDonough as Coach Penning (Dad Ricks) also performed well. I felt through many different emotions while watching a movie. In the end, I still had a sense of confidence in humanity and hope for the future of my children, especially if there are coaches like Gelwix.
