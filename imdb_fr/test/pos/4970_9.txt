Deep Blood ... This is one of those movies you're talking about and you're not saying another Italian Jaws scam! Well, Deep Blood is far from that. It's a cheap one, but making a movie is a little less creative. In Jaws and all the other shark movies we've all seen or heard of, they all use fake sharks. In Joe D'Amato's film, he takes a new approach using all the archive footage for his shark scenes. That's one of the many reasons I love Deep Blood so much because it did not use footage footage. <br /> <br /> In Deep Blood, an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a seaside town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark, Deep Blood, the classic Joe D'Amato, Shark. <br /> <br /> It seems that a former American elder had once warned a group of young people of this great evil at sea and, a few years later, friends fears when one of them is killed by a shark during a series of attacks along its coasts. It is now up to the few remaining people to make sure this monster is killed, even if it means going to sea to do it. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato directed and produced this film under his company, Filmirage. Released in 1989 and later used in Cruel Jaws: Jaws 5 by Bruno Mattei, with many other shark movies. Joe D'Amato's entry into Shark is an excellent film and any fan of Joe D'Amato as a shark spectator should try it.
