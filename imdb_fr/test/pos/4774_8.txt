No doubt about it. It's the animated short film that has propelled Uncle Walt on the map of success. When Walt's older brother Roy suggested that Mickey Mouse's next short film should include sound, Walt jumped at the chance. The result: Steamboat Willie was a resounding success in 1928. After all, it was the first animated short subject with a synchronized sound track (mostly music and sound effects, the dialogue being minimal). Do not look like a wet blanket, but the short film is far from perfect. Before 1935, the animation was sizzling and rather heretical (but once the equipment was improved and better artistic techniques were developed, the rest of the navigation was fluid), and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the famous RCA Sound System, or the Western Electric Noiseless audio system, but was rejected by both companies, which prompted Disney to use PA Powers' experienced PA system at the time. there's a plot here?) Relates to Mickey (like Willie), who is the pilot of a steamboat terrorized by Black Pete (Captain Pete for you) and who decides to hold a bottling session aboard the the different animals on board as musical instruments (ASPCA, remark) If you do not think too much about the technical shortcomings, Steamboat Willie can last eight minutes (and a piece of history).
