I loved this film. It's a lot of laughing. The acting is good and the writing is really strong. I would rather see a hundred films like this one than THREE LORD OF THE RINGS repeats and repeats. <br /> <br /> It's a low-budget affair that seems to have been shot in DV, but it looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are great together. Why do you have a minimum of ten lines? I am not a critic, but a patron. <br /> <br /> I doubt that Quentin Tarantino could write such a funny picture without filling it with free masturbation violence. This film should be seen on more screens than one. I laughed from beginning to end. >
