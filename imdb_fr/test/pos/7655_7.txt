Latcho Drom, or Safe Journey, is the second film in the trilogy of the Romani people by Tony Gatlif. The film is a visual and historical representation of the lives of the Roma in the countries of Europe and the Middle East. Although the scenes are mostly planned, rehearsed and staged, there is no conventional plot and the dialogue does not explain the activities from one scene to another. The film allows the viewer to sometimes have a glimpse, sometimes a more detailed vision of these people at different times and in different countries, ranging from India to Egypt via Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain. <Br/> <br /> The importance of music in Roma culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. It is a vital part of every event and an important means of communication. All they do is voiced with music. Dance is another important activity. Like Roma music, she is specialized and deeply personal, which they can do on their own. We have a glimpse of their daily activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. It's more a testament to their culture, emphasizing the music and dance they created and made them unique. <br /> <br /> Mr. Gatlif describes the groups of nomads in a positive way. However, we are also witnessing the rejection, mistrust and alienation they receive from the non-Roma population. It seems that the culture they have developed over countless generations and inspired by various countries has disappeared into oblivion because conventional society has no place for nomadic fashions. 1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).
