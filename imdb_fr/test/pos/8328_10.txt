It's as good as possible. <br /> <br /> It's six episodes retracing (briefly) what life could have been when the dinosaurs ruled the Earth. Made in the style of a documentary on nature, this show removes the talking heads. It just gives us what's best with dinosaurs trying to survive. seeing on the screen can be attested with certainty, but it's a better guess and entertainment. Here is a show that gives life to dinosaurs in a realistic way, without forcing them to eat. It's a show that should be shown to all kids who love dinosaurs because it will teach them the OH WOW factor to go out and find out more. It will also entertain them, and you. <br /> <br /> See this. If you love wildlife shows or nature or science or Disney True Life Adventures (unless no one is really killed), or just have a great trip to another country, go out and get yourself a copy. Your brain will thank you.
