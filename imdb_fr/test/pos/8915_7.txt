Why do I give 7 points to this 1974 porn movie? Because I watched it. And I found it hilarious! The aliens, their strange spaceship, their strange helmets ... my God, was it a show? And all these desperate alien women need is sperm from the earth. <br /> <br /> And where are they looking for him? In Upper Bavaria, Germany. And that's where the main pleasure comes from: in Europe (and even more so in German-speaking countries), Bavaria is considered a traditional and backward region. And then the actors are so helpless with foreign women. Well, there have been movies about people unable to deal with women like the "American Pie" series. <br /> <br /> But what this film has done is a real and strange funny. You are constantly wondering how they got these bribe ideas. But we were in 1974 and the last 35 years fill us with a kind of nostalgia. You have never seen such a movie. <br /> <br /> And if you do not mind seeing pubic hair and relaxed breasts, look at it once. It's basically a comedy, not a porn movie.
