It's a hard sight to watch. It's not something to sit and relax. This kept me on the edge of my seat for several seasons. People are being beaten, raped, tortured and dying like flies. There are male organs everywhere, excrement, vomiting and blood. Oz is a brave show. It raises issues such as racism, homosexuality, the reality of prisoners and especially; -Capital punishment. In my opinion, he also succeeds in doing so, unlike for example the "Medium" to a track. <br /> <br /> It bothered me sometimes. There were strange stories and they spent a lot of time on characters that did not interest me. Curiously, I found Season 1 quite boring. If I had watched it while it was playing, I think I would not have continued to watch it. I love seasons 2 to 4. Seasons 5 and 6 are observable (although I do not think it's permissible to pronounce the words "Cyril" and "Death Row" in the same sentence) > <br /> are so many wonderful characters to root. The old Bob and Busmalis, whom I absolutely fell in love with from day one. Said, Adebesi, Pancamo and Schillinger, four very powerful and charismatic leaders in their own way. Augustus Hill, who is monologue linked the episodes together so effective. Staff with people like Sister Pete and Ray Mukada are also brilliant. Also minor characters that were only for a few episodes or seasons, but also left a good impression. <br /> <br /> My favorites are the O'Reily brothers. Their relationship was the most heartbreaking and the hottest I saw on TV. If there is anything I will always remember about this show, it's them. There will never be another "twinning" or how to call it, it will hurt me so much. That's why, when goals are also achieved, it's almost painful. I wish that would never have happened. I wish I had never looked at her. <br /> <br /> But a good Fontana. I recommand it
