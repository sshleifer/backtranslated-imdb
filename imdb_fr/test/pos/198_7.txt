The Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of the young Audrey Hepburn and the camera in THE CRANES IS VOLANT seems to love him just as much. She is at the center of a bitter-sweet war romance in the context of the Second World War in Moscow. <br /> <br /> The film is almost poetic in its beautiful black and white cinematography, which was the main reason to watch the film in the beginning As I had never heard about it and I decided to do a test when it was switched to TCM. <br /> <br /> This is a very touching love story about a girl's deep love for a man who suddenly lost his wartime role as a soldier in Russia. She is unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him, but inexplicably marries another person who has imposed herself by force, a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to have from her new. Their marriage is troubled because she can not let go of her memory of a happier time with her soldier friend. <br /> <br /> At the end of the story, she accepts the idea that he will never come back. and is able to face the reality and deal with the situation. A very poignant final scene takes place in a station where arriving soldiers greet their loved ones and the weeping girl who shares the joy of the returning soldiers by handing flowers from her bouquet to the happy families. <br /> <br /> The film is accompanied by an elegant and striking camera work, as well as honestly played history. <br /> <br /> Made with taste, but maybe the English subtitles do not tell the whole story, some elements of the plot seem a little vague for me as if they had been passed over . <br /> <br /> In summary: it is easy to understand why he won awards at the Cannes Film Festival. It reminded me, in style, of another great Russian film, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.
