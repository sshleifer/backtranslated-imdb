After the success of GHAYAL, RKS began working on this film which was a comedy. The film lasted for 3 years and was finally released in 1994, but did not work for any reason. Before this movie, DAMINI (93) came out and did well. <br /> <br /> The movie is a crazy comic movie like most Priyadarshan movies nowadays, but it's funny and well manipulated. The film has an appropriate plot unlike today's movies and makes you laugh. Most of the characters have become famous, be it the master of gogo crime (Shakti Kapoor), Paresh Rawal and others <br /> <br /> The movie makes you laugh all through its execution, even if it is Too tedious and excessive, but it's one of the funniest films <br /> <br /> The realization of RKS is very Good music is good <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Aamir steals the star and his most entertaining performance is his first comedy that Salman does well, but he looks amateurish to Aamir, but does a good job and his chemistry. Karisma is annoying and sounds like a child Raveena is enough Paresh Rawal is too funny in both roles, Shakti Kapoor is hilarious in his act number one, Shehzad Khan (nicknamed by Ajit) is very good and Viju Khote is too funny, but all are good too
