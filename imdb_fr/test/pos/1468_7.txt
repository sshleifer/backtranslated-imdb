This British documentary was recently aired on Comedy Central during their movie "Best of ??" week and can also be seen on the DVD of the second season of South Park. I remember seeing a lot of commercials for the DVD showing excerpts from this documentary, most of which took place with Matt Stone, Trey Parker and another guy in a spa. It was funny when I saw it in the commercials, but I was used to seeing it when I saw the documentary itself. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Goin 'Down to South Park" is quite fun and looks interesting about how the episodes of South Park are made and about the history of the series going back to the when Matt and Trey had the idea in college. However, the tone of this documentary was really depressing. It's not as fast, fast, and as animated as the episodes of South Park. Instead, it has a kind of slow, dry style, which can sometimes be funny, but most of the time, you just wait for something to happen. If you have the chance to watch it, go ahead, but I do not think you miss it a lot if you never see it. <br /> <br /> Score from my IMDb: 7/10
