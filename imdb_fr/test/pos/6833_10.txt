Surprised to know that the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuelan (28 years old) and bored by so many predictable films, I was delighted to see the story telling so many little stories and landmarks spread here and there. Directed with black humor and taste, I liked the tension between the very Boggart Rickman and the very natural but beautiful Thompson. Every member of the band deserves our attention, Gil Bellows at its best. The pugino is remarkable.
