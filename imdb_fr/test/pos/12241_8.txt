Or maybe not. Whatever you think of "Broadcast News", good or bad, almost all the credit for this "thought" belongs to the writer-producer-director-director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (of which he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to rob an entire company - in this case, "the deal" being television - but to do it with a smile, a wink, a scholarly nod and a laugh practically every step of the way. To do anything that requires real talent, something that Mr. J. Brooks has in abundance. <br /> <br /> In his summary, a user of this website asked the following musical question: "Did Walter Cronkite do this?" Answer: no! Of course not! And the reason is the day of Walter - uh, Mr. Cronkite - the only thing that mattered was to make the news known to the people. Same for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Of course, they had to pay attention to their notes, if only to please their bosses. But all that really interested them was THE NEWSELF. <br /> <br /> Now, of course, all that has changed. In the last 25 to 30 years in the network information sector, the only thing that has really counted is the classification, the rankings, the rankings. The bottom line. How many dollars will our News division offer for the network? Do not believe that? <br /> <br /> Consider the "Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings (aka "Stanley Stunning"). All three are now working at their respective anchor offices for 15 or 20 years (Peter actually had his first shot at the National Anchor Office in the 1960s, but he was absolutely unprepared for this job). Of the three, Dan is the one with the most extensive field journalist training. Personally, I think all three are doing a great job as news presenters and deserve to be assigned their positions. All of this has nothing to do with why the three are actually doing these jobs. All three are now 60 (Dan pushes the big 7-0) and they are still very beautiful. And if you think they're still pretty now, imagine how beautiful they were in their forties, when all three were hired for (say, "put on") their current jobs. But do you honestly believe that any of these three men would have been "integrated" if he had looked like, for example, Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster"). Or like - paradise forfend - ME !!! In addition, if Dan retired tomorrow, Walter Cronkite, a younger (than today), could not find his old job. Why? Not pretty enough. And it matters little whether he is, or has been, "the most trustworthy man in America." <br /> <br /> And here is what "Broadcast News" is. Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next next national news presenter who will have problems with a few things, such as thinking for himself, being able to write and know things. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant producer of business-related news and ethics in the news world, faces all the hardships that lie ahead when she falls in love with Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relation to James L.), a leading journalist and field journalist who has no hope of finding a national job because he "sweats" behind the presenter's desk. And many other imperfect characters that you KNOW really exist in the press divisions of the different networks. <br /> <br /> "The network" has paved the way. Eleven years later, "Broadcast News" carries the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next film to denigrate the network business "you can use" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.
