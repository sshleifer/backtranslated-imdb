Bottom is my favorite sitcom since I see it on tv and the film is even better if you are a fan of the bottom, I tell you it's a must buy! The plot is that Eddie and Ritchie run a hotel called Paradise Guest House, but the guests are not going as planned. Customers leave until the famous actress comes here. the cinema so buy this and you will get wet laughing. also featuring Simon Peggi (Shaun of the Dead) and Bill Neigh (love in fact), it may not be well done at the box office or the appearance of it on this website but do not listen to it, buy it and I swear I'll like it
