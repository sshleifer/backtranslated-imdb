For those who have access to the BBC or the CBC, it has been spectacular. Like Battlestar Gallactica, it is a reconstructed show from scratch. But in the case of Dr. Who, they saved the best parties. I can not believe I'm saying that but ... it's by far the best Dr Who. This has none of the cheap production values ​​and sometimes a slow progression of the old show. The acting is good enough and there is a real sense of continuity and history. The new Doctor is easily equal to the great Tom Baker, and the writer (former QAF leader) seems to have revived even the minor characters. <br /> <br /> I know ... I started thoroughly. .but this should be on the list of science fiction geeks. I just do not know why he has not arrived here yet. Whatever you do ... if you've ever liked Dr. Who or science fiction, see it !!!
