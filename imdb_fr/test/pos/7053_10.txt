Imagine spending the summer without your family or friends at school and meeting new people. Or, this is your first time that you are nobody and you can only rely on someone from the camp. "Meatballs" is full of comedy in this movie. In the camp, an eccentric counselor (Bill Murray) knows how boys and girls can have fun. Enter a child named Rudy (Chris Makepeace) who has no one to watch. He does not correspond to anyone, only Tripper can make him happy. The rest of the box is as crazy as Tripper. Northstar Camp is an average camp with an above-average team. Camp Mohawk is an elite camp that makes them run for their money. In the basketball game, the Mohawks are out of breath! And at the Olympiad, the Northstar teal got the revenge they needed when one of the members came out the saboteur. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can never get down to work if he tries. A very funny comedy, and I would say it's a great caretaker. This movie shows that camp can be fun if you want to be! 5 stars!
