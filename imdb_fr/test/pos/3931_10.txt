I do not think I'm alone when I say that 2005 was not particularly kind to the horror genre. Although "Cursed", "Hide and Seek", "The Ring Two" and "The Amityville Horror" all showed a glimpse of interest and potential, there were more failures than successes. For proof, see: "White Noise", "Boogeyman", "The Jacket", "Mindhunters" and "Alone in the Dark". Imagine my surprise when "House of Wax", closely related to Chad and Carey Hayes, turned out to be ... a surprise. <br /> <br /> Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a young woman traveling with her brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki). They are, with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams), hoping to win tickets for the last football game of the season. Along the way, they encounter car problems and are forced to enter a deserted city where nothing seems to be what it seems to be. <br /> <br /> After hearing this, a remake of the classic Vincent Price B-movie, I rolled my eyes. I did not even want to think about what the first-year disaster director Jaume Serra had prepared for his audience. At a time when most major horror movies are disappointments, latent with bad writing, static direction, and amateur acting, I consider myself lucky that Serra and the Hayes have taken on them to have a good old-fashioned festival. . Unlike the disappointments I've named before, this movie does not pull the fist and uses all the cinematic stuff in the book to give everyone exactly what they came for. <br /> <br /> I'm glad the Hayes took the time and effort to create friendly and credible characters, making the events all the more urgent. It also gives the young actors who describe them something to hang on to. As in "The Girl Next Door", Elisha Cuthbert proves to the audience how talented she is. In 2003, in the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", Jessica Biel silenced the naysayers by delivering a raw performance and emotion, a performance that brought the viewer to his side. Here, Cuthbert does the same thing. Chad Michael Murray ("A Cinderella Story"), in one of his earlier, more mature roles, is not a slacker like Nick. Murray exudes charisma and a hard side, as well as an impressive athleticism. Murray and Cuthbert get along very well and have tangible family chemistry. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the press and the American public have done their best to make the day a busy first day for Paris Hilton's leading role. As I expected, Hilton does not bother. In fact, she is as good as anyone in the movie (do with what you want). Like Cuthbert and Murray, Hilton is on the screen. She is sexy and playful. I can not think of one of the reasons she received the worst of the film's harsh reception, other than the fact that they are just blaming her. Jared Padalecki ("Gilmore Girls" of television) manages to memorable way to overcome his underwritten role. Robert Ri'chard ("Cousin Skeeter" on television) and Jon Abrahams ("Meet the Parents") do not have much to do, but do their work. With one scene, Damon Herriman ("Soar") makes an unforgettable impression, and his presence hangs over the rest of the film. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is superb and threatening in a dual role. <br /> <br /> Once again, congratulations should go to the screenwriters to avoid clich√©s as much as possible. Despite popular opinion, "House of Wax" is quite unpredictable for the majority of its running time. Take the following example: it seems that the killer is down and that Carly is leaning over to get something in her pockets. What do you hope it happens? See the movie, and you will understand what I mean. It's also refreshing to see a horror movie in which the characters even show a minimum of common sense. <br /> <br /> Unlike most horror music, the exhilarating work of John Ottman never distracts. However, as in the other releases of Dark Castle, the visual aspects of "Wax" deserve to be rewarded, and raise the film above its outward signs. The talents of director of photography Stephen F. Windon, production designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum and publisher Joel Negron highlight the macabre images. Speaking of images, I think the gore hounds will be delighted with the many effects and makeup tips offered here. Every scene of death is more agitated than the last. Given his past in video clips and commercials, it's clear that Jaume Serra has a keen sense of style. His approach "in the face" is a major asset for the success of this film. Just when you think the camera is going to turn away, that's not the case. He is also particularly good at building thick layers of dread and atmosphere. A remarkable blow is our introduction to the killer, as he slowly comes out of a hatch. <br /> <br /> In a case like this, I would generally admit when I'm in the minority (Shut up, okay? I liked "House of 1000 corpses"!). In this case, I firmly believe that the critics were wrong. I do not know why people are so tough with this film, since it's way better than recent genre entries. Perhaps they are afraid to admit that a horror film starring Paris Hilton might be worth watching ... Who knows? This is a commendable, stylish and effective horror movie. As a horror fan ever since, all I can say is that I really enjoyed "House of Wax", in all its sordid and sadistic glory. I consider safely that it is a great success in modern horror, as well as (with "Sin City") the first fully satisfactory release of 2005.
