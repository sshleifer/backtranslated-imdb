I grew up with Abbott and Costello, A. because my dad grew up with them and our two last names are abbott, so we need a little respect to the deo. I did not realize the flack that this movie and others gave it to him. It was really due, it was funny because abbott and costello were still the same characters, but it was so funny, now what I like in Jack and the beanstalk is that even though the story love is totally boring and a song is prince sing, omg, awefull, but I love the angle they took for love, the story, the couple must get married because a kingdom lack of money, they end up in the prison cell and fall in love because they claim not to be royal and they end up being the couple, so happy ending, I do not think it was the original version if they should have cut it off, but I think it was original and I like it. but watch it suck, lol, even when the movie really starts with the giant + abbott and costello, it's so funny. when the giant knocks Jack and yells "OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR", that sort of thing is really funny. And that joke once Jack starts shouting prince, prince and all those dogs jump on him. a bit cheesy but really original. I would have liked them to have at least tried to remaster it, even though I got that Africa shouts \ jack and bean, and I do not care about the cause of quality when I do it I recorded on tape, it was of poor quality too, no matter what I suppose. the beginning is a bit funny, the middle is really funny and the end is not funny at all, but I'm 19 years old and when a film made in 52 makes me laugh so much, it's great, this movie is really funny. I like their style too the chapters are null. also the part where Jack climbs on the magic bean and they all sing a song about what is a gauge and he's going to be killed, it's pretty funny
