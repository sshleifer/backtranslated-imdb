The plot of this movie is as silly as a bag of hair. Jimmy Smit plays a character who might have been upset by the ridiculous story. He is mean and a woman drummer. It's a character as far removed from his roles in the NYPD and LA law as you could possibly get. <br /> <br /> If you thought he had the paces and acting talent to play the very bad boy role, his gift. <br /> <br /> But !!!!!!!! Mary Louis Parker wears black miniskirts and little black dresses throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She has always had some of the biggest legs in film history. The film is well worth it for this admirer of the leg. <br /> <br /> I would buy the DVD for that reason only if it was available.
