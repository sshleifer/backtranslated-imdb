It's a very dark movie, a bit better than the average film Asylum. It was much better than I thought, combining psychological thriller and horror film. <br /> <br /> The voice on the phone is really scary - this faceless voice, this unknown and threatening voice works very well in the film, since we never see the face of the killer left to the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> The action and the suspense never deteriorate and after the first half of the film, it becomes dizzying; there is not a lot of gore in this movie, just enough to serve the story and the director holds your attention well. <br /> <br /> I gave this film an 8/10 because of some clich√©s.
