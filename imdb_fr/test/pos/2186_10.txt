I saw this piece on Showtime a few years ago in the comfort of my home and when the final note was hit, I wanted to jump off the couch and give the production a standing ovation. As it stands, I shed a tear that it was such a great amount of performance and fantastic songs. For my birthday, my kids bought me the VHS version and the CD of the play with Len Cariou as Sweeny Todd. <br /> <br /> I shared the room with many people ... some found the subject a bit sick, but none of them just praised the songs. <br /> <br /> I have always enjoyed the interaction in songs with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn as well as Hearn and Edmund Lyndeck as Turpin Judge. <br /> <br /> I must own the DVD.
