I saw "Into Pitch Black" on TV and so I had to see that. I must say that I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Not only has David Twohy's style improved since he wrote "Critters 2", but this film caught my attention on Vin Diesel. Of course, he was there in "Into Pitch Black", but here he was fierce, scary and intense. I have not seen such a charisma since Schwarzenegger in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple, but it's the characters that make this film interesting. Then there was what happens with the female lead role. Unexpected. Black humor helps the film to move forward, the effects are not huge, but when Riddick fights the extraterrestrial ... that turns off all my complaints. <br /> <br /> Diesel has not done a lot since. this movie that I would like, but I'm looking forward to the future.
