A wonderful family movie and a wonderful horse movie. 75 +% entertainment. Casey, Buddy and Kelly Marsh are very interesting and endearing characters. Horses are real beauties. <br /> <br /> The horse race serves as a backdrop to show how luck is sometimes just common sense. Show how children can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Show how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The characters portrayed in a very realistic way turn the unrealistic theme of the film into something that everyone can understand. <br /> <br /> Andrew Rubin marvelously interprets the role of Buddy, the sensitive older brother. Something reminded me of Aidan Quinn (eyes, speech, facial appearance). <br /> <br /> Casey makes you fall in love with the character because of seriousness. Sarah Blue is also well represented by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, the father, is played by Walter Matthau and he is his character. <br /> <br /> Although there is room for improvement in the film, it is a very pleasant and relaxing film.
