This film about a group of teenagers from small towns who decide to rob the local bank is excellent. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to get out of his little town, much like Jimmy Stewart in "It's a wonderful life". However, unlike George Bailey, Brian will rob a bank to finance his dream of going to art school, even if his father does not support him. The offer to Brian is to act as a customer and distract the guardian. It's a tempting offer that, if offered to many, I wondered what they would do. Anyway, Brian does it. When the Sheriff (James Remar) and his strength surround the bank, things go from bad to worse. It's a stalemate with even the feds setting up to kill the kids if they have a free kick. The sheriff must prevent this and try to end the stalemate peacefully. Unfortunately, tensions rise and teens fall over. Some are out of control. The cutter scene is horrible and hard to watch. Very intense!
