As a circle around the human condition, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle and continues until the end, exactly where we started. Noting the weakness of words in relation to images, Kubrick has judiciously renounced dialogue, preferring the power and essence of scenery and allowing the public's intelligence to decipher. Or not, depending on the audience. <br /> <br /> Monolith of the cinematographic history, 2001 is a culmination of realization, execution and realization. Considering the ambition of the film (a film about everything) and the measure of success the film has achieved for this purpose, a very strong argument can be made to make this film the greatest of all films. <br /> <br />
