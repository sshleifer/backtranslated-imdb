"Unconditional Love" begins with a great promise. Directed by P. J. Hogan, the film works perfectly until the last third of the film, when it falls flat. The play written by Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse showed a myriad of possibilities that go out at the end. It seems that the artistic team behind the film had high hopes of playing differently. The reality is that this is a film that looks in different directions for a resolution that fails. Do not get me wrong, the movie is extremely appealing and will touch many of its viewers. <br /> <br /> Based on the casting, we decided to take a look. The very talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice to embody Grace Beasley, the woman who discovers at the beginning of the film that everything is wrong for the better in her marriage. Ms. Bates is an excellent actress who deserved much better, even though her character was not helped by what the writers asked her to do in the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett is always ready to deliver. His role, as a lover of the late Victor Fox, is well-written, that is, until Dirk is persuaded to come to Chicago to find Victor's killer. It's weird and it defies all the rules of logic. Dirk does not seem to be able to hurt a fly, let alone hunt down a murderer with the help of Grace and his daughter-in-law, the incredible funny Maudey. <br /> <br /> As played by Meredith Eaton, this little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things in the film. She is impetuous and says it as she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best actors working in movies nowadays has nothing to do with photography; he is totally lost. Dan Aykroyd also has nothing to do. We see it at the beginning and the end of the film and its Max makes no sense. He seems to want changes in his life and marriage, and then return to Grace without any explanation, all forgiven. <br /> <br /> English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better opportunity than the hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing sweet songs. Julie Andrews brings a fun contribution in some priceless scenes. <br /> <br /> In the end, the TV show hosted by Sally Jesse Raphael is disabling and adds nothing to the movie. The best part is to hear Kathy Bates singing. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Ms. Bates is the best excuse to stay up late.
