Watched this when it was screened for the first time, then missed it when it disappeared from UK screens. This has shown a different aspect of old Australia that we need to see more. Good juxtaposition of old hand and young Turkish. Then the realism of the hard back was fantastic. Unfortunately, he missed us. This show was a cold look at the old way of looking at Australia. Hard to live and work hard. The young idealist clashing with the old practical head. Real Politicka fights with New Labor young people. To add modern political language. <br /> <br /> This show is the first of its kind that I came across who was not trying to do tourist work in Australia. It was an excellent presentation of the type of realistic and realistic documentary show. Some good movies were doing the same thing at the time. It would be good to see more of this type of television coming from Australia because it has been sorely lacking for twenty years. for all we have been fed is the soap pulp of varying quality.
