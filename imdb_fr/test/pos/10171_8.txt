The more assured account of Alfred Hitchcock about a film he made twenty-one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur, and although it is certainly not a bad movie, he seems to be right. That being said, this remake, while definitely better, is still not part of Hitchcock's best work. This certainly does not mean that it is not good, that it is more than a bit excessive, and that it leads to it. Hitchcock seems too inclined to draw some elements. These are parts of the film that are not entirely relevant to the plot, which can become annoying. Some of these trailed sequences, such as the one where James Stewart and Doris Day eat in a Moroccan restaurant are good because it helps to establish the different culture in which our American protagonists found themselves, but for every restaurant scene, there is an opera sequence and it is the latter that aggravates the film. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a middle-aged doctor and his wife who go to Morocco for a holiday with their young son. There, they meet a Frenchman in the bus and another middle aged couple in a restaurant. However, things go wrong when the Frenchman dies with a knife in the back, shortly after having whispered something to the doctor. The holidays turn into a nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped, prompting them to cut him short and travel to London to try to find him. The film has a very powerful degree of paranoia, and he manages to hold on. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is the most paranoid film ever made by Hitchcock. Like most of Hitchcock's movies, this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration, only the opera sequence mentioned above seems like a good time to relax. There is also more than a bit of humor in the film, which gives a slight relief to morbid events and actually works pretty well. <br /> <br /> The original version of this story was extremely well supported by the fantastic Peter Lorre. Unfortunately, this film does not benefit from its presence, but this is offset by the performance of the incredible James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man who will always be a candidate for the crown of the "best actor of all time". His collaborations with Hitchcock all present fascinating performances, and this one is no different. (Although his best performance remains that of Mr. Smith in Washington). Stewart conveys all the courage, conviction and sorrow of a man who has lost his child and who would do everything to recover with brilliance. In fact, it's one of the best things about this movie. you are really able to feel the loss of the couple from the beginning and this helps to make it even more exciting. On the other hand, Doris Day is a rather strange casting choice for this film. She is certainly a good actress, but she is more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather strange (even if she manages to flex her vocal chords a bit). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned; it's not the best Hitchcock movie, but there's a lot to appreciate about it and although I recommend many of Hitchcock's films before recommending this one, I'll definitely do it too.
