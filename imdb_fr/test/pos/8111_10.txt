The dictator is a film beyond excellence. Charlie Chaplin manages to be both extremely funny and witty, while providing a strong statement in his satire against fascism. The anti-Nazi speech of Chaplin at the end, with its values, is one of the great moments of cinema. Throughout this film, I had the feeling that there was a form of superior intelligence, beyond the really intelligent cinema, at work.
