Rosie Perez is the main actor in this very engaging affair, in the role of Mercedes, a young woman from Brooklyn who decided to become a movie actress although she is not favored by her situation, living in East Los Angeles and struggling with a series of unsuccessful auditions. kind of part at all. Mercedes met Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), a married and exhausted actor, who had already played in a television series in the 1970s and accepted him as his lover, in part because of his loneliness. and also the hope that parts of the film will come to him because of his "contacts", but these are of little consequence, because Harry is simply illusory in his attempts to recover what he perceives as a past cinematographic fame. In order to meet her financial needs, Mercedes worked as a taxi dancer in a Skid Row dance hall / bar in downtown Los Angeles, while continuing her efforts to succeed in the film industry, and Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo ), a young Mexican immigrant, falls in love with her and most of the story describes her efforts to please the object of her affections, even if they may mean to lose her completely. This melodrama, rooted in tradition, enjoys a moderate budget, despite the presence of a number of well-known players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn and Stanley Tucci, and was kept in the box for about a year before its release date. The distribution and marketing efforts on his behalf are all the more regrettable as his solid production characteristics are solidly complemented by the admirably mastered direction of Alexandre Rockwell, a constant virtue of his work, and in this film, as soon as his first-ever scene, mounting frames behind the credits, starring Perez at Fifth Street and Skid Row's Main Street. Rockwell has often demonstrated that he works very closely with his cast, which is true in this instance, because it allows his actors to create their roles, while any release is perfectly neat through the editing process, resulting in an artistic success for the director. , despite the negative comments of some traditional evaluators. The points scored by the film are aesthetic, with much of the contribution of Tito Larriva, who also plays the role of group leader for taxi dancers. Interim honors here must go to the still vital Perez, though poor performance is rendered. A fair test for the quality of any film is given when a spectator looks at it twice in a short time. Attending this underrated work will be considered an intense pleasure for many.
