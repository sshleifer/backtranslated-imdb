This is not an epic, but for people with a similar problem <br /> <br /> (suicide between brothers and sisters), this could be an interesting way of therapy. An imaginative story <br /> <br /> and a good interpretation make time well spent <br /> <br />. For some reason, it has not really caught the public's attention, <br /> <br /> which, in my opinion, stems from the main theme. Why did she <br /> <br /> commit suicide? It is clear that this is hardly something that <br /> <br /> moviegoers will associate, if it was a European production <br /> <br /> would probably have its audience in a much larger <br /> <br /> area. However, it is a film that, although the realism tarnished by a glittering romantic glow, gives the viewer an impression of heart <br /> <br />.
