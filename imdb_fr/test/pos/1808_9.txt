Valley Girl is the 1980s reference film with filtered slogans throughout this wonderfully played movie. The characters are so compelling that you forget it's a movie and not a "day in the life" video of any high school in the United States. This film is in the 1980s what Brady Bunch's television series is in the 1970s. If you do not like it, then "Gag me with a spoon."
