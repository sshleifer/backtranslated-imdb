As a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange, there was no doubt I had to see this one. However, I delayed it far too long because some of my friends threw it with comments like "extremely boring" or "nothing happened" "a total waste of time". But when I saw images of the mysterious black monolith on the Internet, I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience of 2001: a space odyssey. I did not doubt that I was going to rent this movie the same evening. <br /> <br /> It turned out to be the most beautiful visual experience of my life. Of course, looking at a very good painting or image can be wonderful, but watching a film built with the same kind of virtuosity in each frame adds a whole new dimension to it. My god ... I really like my friends but it's a shame that I can not share with them what makes my heart vibrate and makes me fly like a bird in the sky. This thing, my friends, is beauty. As this film shows, beauty is terribly underrated in our technologically advanced, intellectually superficial and consumer-driven Western fast food companies. That does not mean that I reject these fast-paced companies or that I despise them (just like Kubrick), but only that they can be so much more important if only people stop for a moment and take a little time to soak up the beauty of the world in which we live. And what better opportunity to do so by slowing down the elegant rhythm of this film and letting you take in this place between awakening and dream. <br /> <br /> When we go to this place, it is possible to get a so-called "natural high". It is something that our mind can do whenever we encounter pure and limitless beauty. And never in my life has this "natural orgasm" or "spiritual orgasm", as some call it or "samaddhi" by others, been so intense. Yes, it's more intense than a regular orgasm ... many times more intense in reality. Many religions have claimed that this feeling proves that they were right. Are they right? For me, a direct answer to such a question would only harm the impenetrable hypnotic mystery of the universe. In my opinion, the film attempts to convey the same mystery through the representation of the black monolith and stating the following about it: "Except for a very powerful radio show intended for Jupiter, the black monolith four million years old has remained completely inert, its origin and purpose still a total mystery. "The trance that Bowman undergoes is the same thing that I see when I look at these beautiful images. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that the mystery can be frustrating for those who need direct answers to fast food to big ontological questions. But instead of comforting us, we are constantly irritated by the awareness of the simplifications contained in these answers. The subsequent doubt and embarrassment will make us think that our deeper intellectual activity is at the root of all these problems, when in reality we can only blame our answers. But this film shows us that when rapid ontological statements only give rise to doubt, we can always count on phenomena to make sense of the world. As soon as you realize that beauty is something that can only really be presented as a phenomenon and never as a "thing in itself", the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, frightening or irritating, but becomes fascinating, enchanting and perhaps even comforting. We do not need an answer to what is actually available to be in touch with one of the greatest strengths of our lives. When we are able to let the mystery be what it is, to understand it even ... we can finally bring our souls to rest. However, I am convinced that a film as rich in beauty and philosophical and artistic depth can never be surpassed. Especially now that the greatest director who has ever lived is no longer with us.
