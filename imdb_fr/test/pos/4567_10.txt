Claudine is a film that represents the American system at its worst. The social protection system was initially designed as a stepping stone for families who needed this extra help to get back on their feet. The film showed a faithful description of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit. In other words, if the father or a male character is in the lives of women and children, his financial support through the system would be jeopardized if it were not ended. The struggles of the poor can be seen around the world. I would like to see a reproduction of this film in stores so that everyone can rent it or buy it for the collection of their library.
