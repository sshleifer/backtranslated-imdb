You, the living (2007) <br /> <br /> Mordant. I have never written this word before, but it comes to mind here. Let me look. Well, that's part of it - corrosive, but as funny as hell. So funny corrosive. It's a dark film, of course, with so much dry wit and weird humor that it's impossible not to like it at one level or another. Filmed in a very casual style, often with a static camera and really balanced and stable compositions, like stage scenes, we attend a short staging. <br /> <br /> But it makes you look ordinary - which is not the case. Ordinary life is shown to be frumpy, ironic, delicious, timid and depressing. And impossible. We, the living, must live, and since we are alive, we can also take note of it. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you find yourself laughing and you do not know why. Exactly. And the promotional material somewhere said it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python and that it had the dry, silent and questioning look of Ingmar Berman's famous Swedish films, but also the wacky and touching elements of British comedians. . <br /> <br /> I would say that I would certainly look at least half an hour away. There is a part of me that I thought I had already gone through - the rest continues in a similar assemblage of little sketches and little moments, and they evolve gradually, but there is no big plot to follow or climax of the usual kind. There are some great moments later, just the attention to the storm that kindly takes us out of worldly events. <br /> <br /> The filming is superb in its classic control, almost like a series of scenes by Gregory Crewdson (and surpassing the photographer, in fact). And the acting, with all his very ordinary folksiness, non-glam, is just on. A surprising experience, beautiful and strange.
