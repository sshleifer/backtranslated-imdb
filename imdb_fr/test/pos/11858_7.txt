I have been on this channel a number of times, mainly because the synopsis was so cheesy, so "Love American Style". However, it turned out to be very good, very well done. The two main characteristics are dialogue and action. Large distribution. The principle is actually well executed and there are not too many weak moments. I guess what surprised me the most is how often you think the wheels will come out of the cart. Instead, the cart only turns turns, so to speak, and the film continues to fly. There are beautiful little under-representations, especially the relationship that develops between the character played by the former acolyte of Conan, Andy Richter. In addition, I want to mention that the music that accompanied it was good.
