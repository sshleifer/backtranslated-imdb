I never thought of talking about a biopic, but there is a superabundance of characterization (especially regarding Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little about the literal events of his life - in the end I'm not not sure if he dies (he is supposed to), or if his sister dies at last (she is supposed to), or if the director has spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (it's an inside joke) , in case you missed it - wrote Miyazawa a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad). However, this insight into the mind of a writer who "drew poems and fairy tales from his imagination" is very intelligent, creative, entertaining and emotionally powerful. <br /> <br /> All this despite the fact that everyone is animated as animals (as in many stories of Miyazawa). <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are really amazing, especially since it was a movie made for television. Seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds trailing blue light) compete with parts of Fantasia. However, I still do not support computer animation when mixed with a cel animation. The CGI trains are terribly obvious, even more so than the Anastasia train. <br /> <br /> 8/10
