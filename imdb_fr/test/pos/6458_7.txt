Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) shows up at the New York shipyards looking for a job, but with a hidden past. He gets one on condition that he pays the boss of the team, Jack Warden. There, he made a friendship with the Black, Sydney Poitier, which unfortunately leads to a heart-rending moral dilemma for a man who, it is said, generally escapes his problems. <br /> <br /> The film looks like Oscar winning on the waterfront, feels like on the waterfront, and most importantly, plays a bit like the 1954 Kazan production. However, his racial theme is revolutionary for the moment. Black Poitier and White Cassavetes are treated equally in all respects. It could even be the first black-and-white buddy image that would dominate so many action movies. <br /> <br /> It is useful that the two main characters play so well. Nevertheless, the central flaw of the film does not indicate why the team leader Poitier first pushes a friendship with the dark Cassavetes. He really does his best to become friends with the newcomer. But why not cross racial barriers to do so is never really suggested. One of the possible explanations is that Poitier wants to use Cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with the team leader, Warden, but that he comes to really look like this guy. Some of Cassavetes' suspicious reactions allude to this, but beyond that, the relationship seems unmotivated. <br /> <br /> If there is only one scene in the movie, I can not spot it. Everything is done in a shabby place in New York, without the usual movie extras. In this sense, it is an anti-Hollywood production, carefully deglamorized, even in the world of nightclubs, which looks like a real crowd after hours of work. I suppose sociologists would say that this rather crude slice of life is "a glimpse of the working poor". <br /> <br /> Yet, despite all its virtues, many, the film remains too close to the film Brando. Kazan movie for comfort. Here, a beautiful unknown actress, Kathleen Maguire, gets the role of the redemptive girlfriend, Warden the role of corrupt union boss, while Cassavetes, like Brando, must undergo a bloody beating before regaining his moral status and doing which is right. Despite everything, despite its derivative nature, the striking urban drama retains enough original strength to deserve a look.
