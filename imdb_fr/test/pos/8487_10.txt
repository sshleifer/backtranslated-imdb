Jamie Foxx was the incarnation of Ray Charles. After a few moments, you stop seeing a movie and see a biography interpreted by the great man himself. Ray Charles was really a genius of music and the movie describes him very well. No one has ever written or written, played, or recorded music like this musical giant. When he has gone the creeps, the world has lost one of his greatest American heroes. Regarding the film, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a classical music scholarship and could play as Ray was an asset to the director. What better than that? You do not need a "double" piano game and then try to separate the screen from someone else's hands on Jamie's face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that it also included how difficult Ray was. He has not always been a nice man. You do not have the root for him too. He was an addict, a womanizer, and sometimes his head was hard. But I guess that's what made him great, so I can not blame him. I choose Jamie for the best actor!
