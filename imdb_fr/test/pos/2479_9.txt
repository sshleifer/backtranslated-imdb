With regard to fake documentaries (anyone?), This one is among the best! It sounds very real and that's what it's all about. In the light of recent events (Guantanamo), this film is even more frightening. So you can say he was ahead of his time, when he came out in the 70s! <br /> <br /> One can only hope that such a government does not exist! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people like this? Of course, the interviewees all seemed to have the same thing (70s mentality): screw politicians and politics in general. Maybe it was not so smart, we could think ... but hey, do not forget: it's just a movie! ; o)
