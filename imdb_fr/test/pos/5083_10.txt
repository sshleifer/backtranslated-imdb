I saw the movie yesterday and was shocked, but even more shocked by some of the comments I read here. One person wrote that it was ambiguous whether the victim of torture was guilty or not - so ... One person wrote this because he was not an American citizen, so ... Some people point out that the people from the Middle East we hate and we want to dead, so ... so, are we saying it's fair to torture someone who is guilty of a crime? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who is not an American citizen? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who can hate us and want us dead? Do we affirm that, as stipulated by the Geneva Convention, the Declaration of Human Rights and the United States Constitution, "torture is a fault, but some torture is less bad than others" ? When does it become "right" to torture? That's why this movie is powerful - it's ambiguous, but it's not about torture. Torture is always wrong and if we are willing to do it, even in the name of justice and "national security" or "freedom and democracy", we are wrong and we are perverse; we do exactly what we accuse our enemies of doing (and we call them "evil" in the same breath). My favorite phrase in the film was "If you do not want to compromise, join Amnesty International". Right on.
