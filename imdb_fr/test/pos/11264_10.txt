Wow, do not look at it thinking it's going to be a relaxing circus night! It will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. The circus has never been so colorful, exciting and breathtaking! The whole concept is really amazing. You are immersed in the world of Cirque Du Soleil and you end up with a thousand thoughts when you leave. There's only one thing left to do: get the CD and / or DVD and relive it again and again. Become addicted! It's worth it! Must be next to the most beautiful thing in the world and one of the best Cirque Du Soleil programs.
