I had read about the movie and thought it would be cute, a good night movie on Saturday night. I was not expecting something great, thought it would be mainly down, but I hope it would not be a totally bad experience. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and everything was going well. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn an embarrassing moment into a touching thing was nice to see. He could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but moved away from stereotypes to focus on the character's mind. It was wonderful to see Jonathan Caouette again, I did not know what he would do after Tarnation. Ashley Fink is a gem, a great movie actress who hopes to have more work. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the movie that could have used work, but overall, it's not a bad time in the cinema. My friend described it as a gay / Napoleon Dynamus but it's something more than that. It's a character study of what it's like to grow up gay in a small town. The pain is there, but the humor behind this pain (which only age can make clearer) is magnified. I can not wait to see more Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.
