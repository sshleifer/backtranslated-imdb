The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It was never a serious story, but an entertaining saga and it was successful. Errol Flynn has never been so good, this role has been assigned to him. Olivia DeHavilland has never been so beautiful. Arthur Kennedy never more mean. Anthony Quinn never as noble as Crazy Horse. He had a lot of humor and pathos and held your interest throughout. The historical aspect that I found most obvious is the last "final fight" that took place on the shores of Little Big Horn. The film version was shot in a desert without a river. However, I still consider it a wonderful entertainment typical of Hollywood's golden age.
