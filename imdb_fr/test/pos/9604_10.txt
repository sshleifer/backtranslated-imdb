As you can see, I have submitted 2 comments about this program since 1991 ... and no, ITV has not made it public. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, I recently contacted ITV to find out if there was any way to get a copy, and that was their answer ....... <br /> < br /> "Unfortunately, there is no plan to release this program in DVD / video, but you can buy copies from our Requests for viewers service, their email address is: viewers.requests@itv .com ". <br /> <br /> I hope you will have the opportunity again to enjoy this classic short comedy. <br /> <br />
