On the right, the hospital scene with Holly and Shannon was brilliantly done. It starts with Piper On A boy who looks very badly injured, doctors get him into a resuscitation room and they pass it from one bed to another and Prue holds his hand It is obvious that Piper has very hard to breathe and her lungs are stranded, as she turns to beg Prue not to leave her side, she does not eat "do not go, I love you, then her pulse goes down and she enters in cardiac arrest and the monitor shows a clear flat line and the nurses go into total trauma mode and introduce a defibrillator Prue Backs down from the bed with horror as the doctors desperately try to shock the heart of his dying sister, is tragically pronounced dead very well scene well done girls
