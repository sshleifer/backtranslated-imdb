This exploration of a unique decade in American cinema begins with the fall of a sick and disconnected childhood empire and ends with the inescapable rise of another empire, associated with both escape and recipes at the counter. Meet the new boss, identical to the old boss. Or, as Peter Fonda observed in Easy Rider, "We ruined everything." Between the two, from Bonnie And Clyde to Star Wars, the young Turks (some under the guerrilla Roger Corman tutelage) crawled under the cables to produce some of the greatest works of art of the twentieth century. Although the story is already familiar in Peter Biskind's Easy Riders, the directors of Raging Bulls, Demme and LaGravenese are less concerned about muckraking than by providing a platform for filmmakers and the stars themselves. <br /> <br /> Everyone, from Martin Scorsese to Francis Ford Coppola and Julie Christie are interviewed and a list of well-edited clips puts the decade in a socio-cultural and economic context. If their answers are self-praising (to say the least), they are also highly tractable, entertaining and revealing, making this dream a wet dream of a movie buff. Director William Friedkin reveals how The Exorcist's original poster had to include the hand of a little girl holding a bloody crucifix and the caption "For God's sake, help her," before he complains. Warner Bros. Chief John Calley recalls that when he saw Robert De Niro in Mean Streets for the first time, he assumed that Scorsese had obtained the release of a psychopath for the shoot. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, some difficult perspective has crept into the mix, As one would expect from a generation motivated and broadened to his conscience, Hopper points out "there is also a lot of shit there -in". Julie Christie observes that American cinema in the 1970s was "not a good time for women". But if Demme reacts with a spoonful of women's movies - brief excerpts from Alice no longer lives here, they pull the horses, not those and Klute - we are soon brought back to the usual male shows that piss the walls. <br /> The transition from a hard and socially conscious film production to a risk-free crowd, like Jaws for a fad-hungry Nam audience, is also documented, though it's a bit precipitate. Less sung but equally relevant films like Panic In Needle Park and Joe. "We were not beautiful," Bruce Dern thinks of his contemporaries. "But we were crazy crazy."
