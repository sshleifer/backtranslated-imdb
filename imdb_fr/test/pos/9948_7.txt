If you love Japanese monster movies, you'll love this action-packed battle between an alien invader, determined to conquer the Earth, and a "Giant Robot" with an arsenal of exceptional weapons. The "Emporer Guillotine" stranger on the planet Gargoyle has an army of thugs called "the gargoyle gang" (as well as many other hostile creatures that are regularly released on Earth to destroy buildings, make noise, panic the populace , etc. A small child, named Johnny Sokko, has the giant robot on his call and sends the robot, if needed, to hit him, then blow him up.Johnny joins a group of "good spies" called Unicorn and s strives to save the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the wild nature, the unintentional humorous dialogue and the fact that the target audience was obviously children, this film has a non-stop action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and is simply fun to watch.The battle scenes are well executed and frequent, as the narrative requires.The good and the bad have made sure to have an inexhaustible stock of bombs, lasers, ammunition and ploys to attack each other. Although the film was built from episodes of a television series, the plot develops and ends with an ultimate conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film has a positive vision and seduces all spectators (especially children). ) Desire to destroy evil in its many forms. Children may be the target audience, but it's fun for everyone to laugh at his comical foolishness; yet, at the same time, it is essential that good people succeed and "save the world". The role play is silly in places, but it's the charm: there are several lines of nerdy dialogue (possibly translation errors or intentional jokes on the part of the filmmakers), and you will find yourself citing these absurd lines more later. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film does not have a quality of production or a high budget. However, for what is science fiction campy, it's nice to laugh. I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for this kind of thing.
