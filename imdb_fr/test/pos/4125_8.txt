I saw this (video 2000) a few years ago and I would like to see it on DVD. A good movie, but I would have liked it even more if it included the legacy of the Beatles and Hollies, etc. <br /> <br /> I do not know how true the story is - some changes made to dramatize the story? <br /> <br /> I was only 3 years old when Buddy crashed and I did not wake up to his music until the late 70's. Much later, I discovered that our family had moved into our new home - yes, February 3, 1959. <br /> <br /> Well, little things you say and do ... We will always remember his songs - always ....
