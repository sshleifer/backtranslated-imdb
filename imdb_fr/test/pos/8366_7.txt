Shuai is a sturdy and crude young Beijinger with a punk haircut, who makes a living selling cheap books at a stand in a covered market. He does not seem to have anything in common with Zhang, a nervous and middle-aged intellectual - and yet they both end up in a restaurant discussing the pros and cons of murder (the Chinese title might be be better translated by 'Talk It Over'). If this sounds like a pedestrian, make no mistake: this film is very inventive in its plot, and most of the time, it moves at a dizzying speed (although the pace is not very good in the end) . <br /> <br /> If you only know the historical dramas worthy of Zhang Yimou such as Raise The Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad, or his latest martial arts epics, Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, you'll be surprised . In fact, no matter what movie you've seen, you'll be surprised, pleasantly surprised - it's a far cry from his most original, offbeat, and experimental work. It was shot in a few weeks on a minimal budget, almost entirely on site in Beijing (and appealing to many ordinary Pekingers in the most secondary secondary roles - there is even an ephemeral spur on the part of the director himself ), Camera holding, in a jerky, hyper-kinetic style, a million kilometers from the elegant formalism of his best-known films. <br /> <br /> OK, I live in Beijing. I therefore find an additional pleasure to all. the odd little details of everyday life that I'm beginning to recognize and appreciate (even though the film was shot in '97 and things are changing so quickly here), but I really think this movie can be enjoyed by everyone. I have seen it, like so many other Chinese "comedies", in a film club that broadcasts subtitled versions of recent Chinese films for an almost exclusively expatriate audience; and this is the only one I can remember where the audience burst out laughing. Some non-Chinese audiences may find it a bit too strange, sometimes a bit uncomfortable, as it includes some violence and, having started as a quirky and offbeat romantic comedy, turns into something much more dark in the second half. It is very, very funny. <br /> <br /> He is also a remarkable actor, especially Zhang Yimou's long-time collaborator, Jiang Wen, who is probably the biggest film star in mainland China and has a screen presence that recalls a young Depardieu or De Niro. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie - proof that the Chinese have a sense of humor that CAN translate into other cultures, proof that Zhang Yimou is far beyond a one-trick pony .. .... and for a very good time.
