The timing of the release of this film could not be better, especially in light of all the turbulence in this world today. The film is a warm, endearing and spiritual play. If you have brothers and sisters and your parents are still alive, it will please the viewer. If you have lost your parents, it will affect you deeply. The laughter often comes, the actors of the whole work very well together and are credible. This film is intelligently written and the lines that come from each of the actors often make the viewer laugh. There are times that will make you cry too. I would recommend this film to anyone who respects the importance of the family and can follow a smart movie.
