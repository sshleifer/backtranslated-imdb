It's a film so revered and studied, a classic among the many Hitchcock films, there's nothing to cajole to want to see again. Still, you think: can this hold even when the huge (and astute and amazing) trick of the plot is not surprising? <br /> <br /> Yes. <br /> <br /> And to begin with, there is At first, a deeply beautiful and refined story that tells the whole story. Two taxis, two men shown with their shoes, each walking on the train, then sitting in front of each other, and oops, a mistake, a little nudge, and the conversation begins and we see the men themselves -Same. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, as in many horror and suspense movies, jovial and bright. We know, however, that this will not be the case when entering the film. So we are already worried. After all, what will go wrong? <br /> <br /> Many. In the truly Hitchcock way, it is a purely innocent man (almost always a man) who faces injustice, who is trapped by circumstances that threaten what is most valuable to him. The innocent in this case, the tennis player Guy Haynes, is played with an innocence that is credible - his collegial politeness in this first scene, for example, while he realizes that the other man is a little cuckoo, c could you or me do? The not-so-innocent man is Bruno Anthony, the spoiled, egocentric and cleverly intelligent child who plays brilliantly with Robert Walker. (This strange performance is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock witcho, played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So, from Scene 1, in the train (and the train, really gorgeous!), We have the two main roles and the mind-blowing, utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot plot from Patricia Highsmith's first novel, which also wrote the books behind Mr. Ripley's two films. And the screenplay was co-written by Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economics and intelligent dialogue. And the crime. <br /> <br /> And of course, it's not just the first scene. What to note? Well, this little senator girl (I thought she was great) is Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, who is still with us (in 2009, she also had a role in Psycho). And there is a characteristic landmark for a key film scene - the Hamptons tennis courts, which we know as the site of the American Open. The fantastic final scene complete with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock engages in a kind of slow and steady editing, reinforcing the suspense by making it surreal. Fear increases positively with laughing children and the old man who crawls underneath all this. And when it collapses in a crash, the whole project returns to a set, one of the most naturalistic uses of the director known not to worry about the realism of his projections back. <br /> <br /> The photography is perfect. Hollywood stuns without becoming so stylized (as in some black films) that it is an object in its own right. Look again at the first scene or filming (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the public considers a murder. It is a sophisticated construction. When we are not completely surprised that Bruno is in bed, it only proves that the director is on guard. We always expect something unexpected. <br /> <br /> Are there any problems? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falseness you can accept (or embrace) as a beautiful style. The scene where Bruno stifles the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman, interpreted by Norma Varden, is a caricature so credible that it takes your breath away) and ruined by the fact that he looks at the senator's daughter and that she is unleashed in a deadly catastrophe. trance by his glasses, and his resemblance to his previous victim. It is an idea of ​​mid-twentieth-century psychology that encroaches on Hitchcock's many efforts. (The end of Psycho, for starters.) <br /> <br /> The Wikipedia article on the film cleverly highlights the constant splitting of film elements, from the main characters to the murder victim and to the senator's daughter . This resonates in many different ways: two men lead him to the tennis court, two men accompany the victim to the amusement park, and so on. We can do too much, but it brings an aesthetic coherence above and below our consciousness. Do not forget that there must be two murders - it's the absence of the second murder, the inability to create a dubbing in this case, that makes Bruno fall apart. <br /> <br /> Walker the actor had emotional problems and had been institutionalized the year before the shooting of this film. Right after, he died as a result of a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his seizures. Although he appeared in other films, Strangers on Train is easily his tour de force. Farley Granger has had a long career that has never really seen him get into fame, although his style may have a particular nerve-racking that really works, especially in They Live by Night. <br /> <br /> And if you look at this one for the first time or the third time, look for the chilling and hilarious scene of the tennis match where the head of the crowd moves in unison - with the exception Bruno's. He looks out without moving his head towards us. As the movie trailer says, after this movie, you will no longer be talking to "strangers in a train".
