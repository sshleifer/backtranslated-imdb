The latest American production of the "Blood Island" series of Filipino horror films is about Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), ruler of a fictional country. He is dying of cancer and yet we understand how to bring him back: put his brain in a donor's body. The mad doctor in charge (Kent Taylor) places him in a highly improbable body: the giant, scar-scarred servant named Gor (John Bloom). A doctor's friend of the sovereign tries to remedy the situation and put an end to the projects of the mad doctors. <br /> <br /> The film partners Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) correct several actors I've already worked with, including Taylor, the sexy wife of Adamsons, Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto , Zandor Vorkov and Vicki Volante. They tried to keep the spirit of the previous entries of "Blood Island" but we can say that it was done in the United States. Although not necessarily a "good" movie, it contains a host of fun elements to add to an entertaining and trashy set. A malicious dwarf (Rossitto), bloody operations, a rather unconvincing makeup job on Bloom, the political sub-plot, caves filled with cobwebs, etc. I think it could have been cut a bit; some scenes hang around. But there are fun times and an end that people might not expect. <br /> <br /> For this kind of thing, playing a role is not so bad. Taylor and Rossitto are fun; the latter seems to have fun in his role. Flying is pretty attractive and Williams is O.K. in the heroic role. In any case, it's nice to see all those familiar faces in one of these movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing special, but like a "horror" trash B (I use the word vaguely, none of that is quite scary) movie, it certainly amuses. <br /> <br /> 7/10
