This film was a wonderful adventure, intelligent, cheerful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in strange places and incredible energy. The famous director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through the film get entangled in a fascinating way while he is almost overwhelmed by a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderfully rich images and suggested but not followed paths (what exactly happens with the dark wife of the director of the wedding for pedestrian tourists?). The end is all the better to be messy. Realism and logic are not what you should look for here. This film seems to suggest that if we are going to entrust our marriages and our imaginative life to filmmakers, we should be ready for a frantic race.
