I saw this the week of its opening four years ago and I really did not know what to expect if I did not know the work of Sorrentino at the time. He created a very intriguing and ultimately moving story about a strange character, for whom the expression "life is made to live" no longer applies. It surprised me at every turn and I was constantly surprised by the story. I really liked the rhythm and the way I was gradually given the necessary elements to understand what was going on. Tony Servillo is superb, as is Magnani. It opens with a brilliantly styled wide shot and ends with a very moving image that takes the film to sublime territory. I thought long after the main character, the position he was in and his final destiny and I did not shake for weeks. I recently bought the film and this last scene where he thinks of his friend wins me every time. I still have not spoken to anyone who has seen this. Too bad it did not affect a wider audience, because this is the direction that takes the Italian cinema, it can only be a good thing.
