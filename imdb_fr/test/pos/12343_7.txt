Julie (Meg Tilly) is a schoolgirl of the type "goody two shoes" who, determined to prove herself something, allows herself to undergo the rituals of "The Sisters", a small clique presided over by a sober homecoming. Queen Carol type (Robin Evans). The sisters propose that for the last test of Julie, she spend the night in a mausoleum and she prepares to climb on the wall, but does not know that Raymar, a psychic ill-intentioned and deceased recently, is buried in the city and plans to wreak havoc beyond the grave. . <br /> <br /> While this first picture of Tom McLoughlin ("Friday 13th Part VI: Jason Lives" and "Sometimes They Come Back") is limited by his obviously reduced budget, this is what McLoughlin and his team able to do with that matters. It's really scary, disturbing price; it might have been very scary if I was less than 10 years old, and even at my present age, it makes me even more difficult. <br /> <br /> Some effects have a cheesy appearance. Tom Burman, an experienced makeup artist, tends to forget the names of big names like Winston, Baker and Bottin. "(1982) and" The Beast Within "to his credit. <br /> <br /> What I liked most was a real sense of apprehension and ambience, something missing in some Horror movies that are currently being broadcast in our multiplexes. <br /> <br /> Tilly is cute and seductive in her role, she just finished her first movie in "Tex" before joining this production. " One Dark Night "was completed sometime before its theatrical release in 1983, where it actually did decent business in its first few weeks.The other actors are doing what they have to do well; the cast, including the equally attractive singer, actress and voice-over artist, Elizabeth Peter, every day, Kevin Peter Hall, for once * does not play a kind of character, but ends unfortunately with very little time screen, and none other than Adam "Batman" West Nancy, the director's wife, who i would play Lizbeth in "Jason Lives", appear here as the spacious little girl in front of the arcade. <br /> <br /> It's a decent horror entertainment at B level, maybe too cheap for its ambitions, and maybe not so clever (hey, McLoughlin * was just starting), but definitely good for chills. <br /> <br /> 7/10
