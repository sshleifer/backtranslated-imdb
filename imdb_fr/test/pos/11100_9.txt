Located in the 1970s in Los Angeles, Christopher Boyce just left seminary school and returned home after his father found him a job where he monitors intelligence documents. His old friend, Daulton Lee, is a drug dealer with a cock and gets caught in the act. He must choose between becoming a narc or face a long stay in prison. When he is free on bail, he jumps to Mexico City. Chris proposes to Lee, as part of a partnership, to serve as messenger to sell secret papers to the Embassy of the Soviet Union in Mexico City, because of the shame felt by the US government's control over the countries of the world. weaker, to their advantage. But with time, the two men start to run up against their motives and find themselves in a more ambitious project than expected. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger has directed many films such as the respectable "Midnight Cowboy", "Marathon Man". "," Sunday Bloody Sunday "and" Grasshopper Day. "Although" The Falcon and the Snowman "may not be so badly bred, there is no doubt that this dark drama of espionage (inspired of a real incident) is an unjustly neglected portrait of a character - everything is there, a rather sober affair without real qualities of grandeur hitting a massive mark.The determining factor of the film is undoubtedly the admirable versatility of the main roles of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as two ambitious kids Chris and Daulton, Penn is particularly good at his uncomfortable intensity, which goes far beyond Hutton's superbly cool and collected lap.What starts as easy, we watch the situation deteriorate gradually, while the two amateurs really find themselves out of their league.The highly detailed and symbolic plot (predatory behavior) focuses mainly on the relationship of the peer. e and that of their reasoning on their actions, which finally shows us the thorny developments that led to their downfall. The plan opens up like a plague to never heal properly, because of Daulton's addiction to drugs, which really makes him derail and lets Chris take care of everything. The burning political aspect is there, but it focuses on the themes of idealism (Boyce) and greed (Lee) to get his message across. The two do not mix and the results show. The suspense is justified by its stimulating boiling script and its interactions of character, then by that of any visual gadget. The action is very weak, but there is always a style induced by the pressure exerted on the assured and realistic direction of Schlesinger. The pace is generally well mastered, although some sequences seem to last too long, but it grabs you as it plays on its authentically paranoid tone to slowly turn into a close explosion. The technical production is accompanied by an atrociously poignant score of music and a poignant cinematography. Secondary actors are exceptionally good with Pat Hingle, Lori Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce Van Patten. Also look for Michael Ironside in a miniscule role as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> An espionage film for the most part that benefits greatly from the talent and the fact that it does not play the usual stakes. It's more an emotional turn, then a complex of twists. Recommended.
