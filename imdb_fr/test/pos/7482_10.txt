I was referred to this movie by a friend. I had never heard of it but I thought he had Christopher Lampbert, so I rented it and I realized that it was not Christopher Lampbert, but Thomas Jane who was great this movie. I like that almost all the film is happening in this suburban house. The characters were great and the scenario was amazing. I would like Skip Woods to write and direct another film. On Thursday, in my book, we tell the story of this guy who tries to deceive his wife and child after a shady past, but his former drug dealer friend shows up and it becomes a Thursday. This is one of my favorite movies and it shows real potential in Thomas Jane. But this film is very rare but I found it in some Hollywood videos in VHS. So dust off the old VCR and blow it up on Thursday because it gets Pee Wee's Seal of Approval
