I went in this movie hoping for a slasher, and although Mute Witness draws its influence from this style of filming, this is more than just your slash movie. A number of thrillers focus on a particular disability - blindness is more common (Blind Terror, Waiting for the Night, Cat O'Nine Tails to name a few), but the implications of the presence of a mute in a thriller like this are well described and are an integral part of the plot, because the fact that the main character can not speak is often the reason why she is in a dangerous situation in which he would be easy to avoid. Our mute witness is Billy Hughes, a makeup artist working on the production of a horror film in a Moscow studio. She finds herself locked up after hours at night and, after trying to call her sister for help, she comes across what appears to be an illicit sexual shoot, but soon turns out to be a snuff film! She tries to convince the authorities of what she saw, but finds that no one believes her story ... <br /> <br /> Recently, the hostel made the headlines to show the manufacturing of a snuff film in a foreign country, but this film did it first and actually does a better job. It may not be as bad as Eli Roth's album, but the gore is more effective, and since the director Anthony Waller (who then directed one of my favorite modern thrillers with "The Guilty" ) puts a good sense of humor into the procedure Mute witness is both gore enough and fun to watch. The director certainly has a talent for creating thrilling rides, because it never stays still. The plot is put into action quickly and Waller constantly introduces twists that give a big boost to the movie's overall entertainment value. Playing a movie is not bad for a B movie, while young performers Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards perform well. The atmosphere is rough and the Russian locations are appropriately hostile, allowing the film to maintain an agonizing atmosphere. Overall, Mute Witness is a much better movie than you'd expect. The plot flows well, atmosphere and tension are at the rendezvous.
