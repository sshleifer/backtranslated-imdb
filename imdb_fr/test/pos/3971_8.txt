At first glance, any comedy for teenagers presents the risk of being sophomoric and obvious, and fair enough, most of them. Some have gone beyond the usual banality of source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and they give me hope that others will be able to join this depressing crowd of teen comedies that are actually fun and not not just an excuse for flash Tom Green. <br /> <br /> Enter Accepted, directed by buddy John Cusack, Steve Pink, and directed by the friendly Justin Long (the smart kid of Galaxy Quest and most recently appeared in Apple Computer Ads), on a group of children who are not accepted at the university and decide, as revealed by the trailer, to simulate a fake to steal their parents. When they go a bit too far with the website and other children end up signing up, the kids have some problems to solve. <br /> <br /> Okay, editing is obviously absurd, but most comedies live or die in performance, and here, Accepted is doing pretty well. Bartleby Gaines de Long (usually shortened to 'B') is accompanied by enough well-meaning friendly friends to help him share the burden, but the best secondary character is probably 'Dean' Lewis (probably cited as a tribute to Dean of Rodney Dangerfield) Martin), aka Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who is wisely limited to short bursts where he can quickly turn his unique mark of grumpy observatory humor. Black is great here. It frankly explains to children what life is like (its final line is hysterical) and offers parents the adult face of fake university. <br /> <br /> But Long has to endure most of the film, and he does it with shovel; Bartleby is easily identifiable and we report it to him almost immediately. The character of Columbus Short, Hands, is an athlete who loses his scholarship due to an injury and eventually becomes the de facto faculty of the fake college. It should also be noted that Hannah Marks is Bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic little sister. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film seems familiar in some places. there is a debt owed on all sides to Revenge of the Nerds. Those who are rejected by all others find a home in Bartleby and his cohorts, and of course the bad guys are Master Race types conformist to the reinforced steroids who run a fraternity (well, the fraternities are evil) and seek to humiliate and bury the strange balls. for the ?? panting ?? crime of being different. But apart from that, Accepted has fun with the material and even asks some worthy questions about the expectations of college kids and the path of higher education. It's certainly not a puzzle, but Accepted is not just another blind comedy for teenagers (or Owen Wilson's vehicle). An hour and a half fun and smart that, although it is not a great start of its kind, is smart enough and creative enough to be very nice. <br /> <br /> There is at least a moment of flawless brilliance in the film, when Bartleby goes to a nearby university to try to collect ideas for his own school program. When he sees that the children are all stressed in the other school (many refuse even to talk to him in class, for fear of missing something), he shakes his head, thinking that there must be a better solution. As he prepares to leave, he is greeted by a stream of children moving in the opposite direction, a person moving against the current, while in the background, the first lines of Eleanor Rigby are playing. Maybe a moment of unexpected brilliance, but a shine all the same.
