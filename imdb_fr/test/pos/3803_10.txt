Although this film never reached commercial fame, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-executed pieces of artistic expression often do not attract mass appeal. The screenplay depicts a young boy driving a car and embarking on a surreal dreamlike adventure with very little foundation in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who tries to see this film in the perspective of its conformity to reality will probably be disappointed; it is not meant to be "realistic". It is however metaphorical, with an extended symbolism, obvious for those who pay particular attention to details. In addition, symbolic representations are left open to interpretation, which can be said of many high-quality works of art. Do not be fooled by the cover (if you rent or buy this movie), the movie is not what it may seem to be on the surface.
