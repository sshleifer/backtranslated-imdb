"One Dark Night", nicknamed "Mausoleum", is one of the best horror rental movies. Original and rather crude, we meet briefly with Adam West in this film about telekinesis and teenage headgames. Meg Tilly ventures to spend the night in a crypt of "The Sisters", a group of high school girls wearing blue satin blouses. The initiation is interrupted by the recently buried body of a mass murderer psychic wizard called "Raymar". The surprisingly impressive makeup and scary effects paint this cooler movie with style and deliver a thrilling climax.
