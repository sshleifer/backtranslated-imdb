After reading about this documentary, I rented it and watched it with my teenage children. It was incredibly balanced, showing each party's point of view and leaving many unanswered questions. It's as it should be. I do not watch a documentary to be told what to think. I look at it to learn and draw my own conclusions. <br /> <br /> We then traveled to Waco to visit the Davidians branch on the site of the conflagration. It was a powerful lesson to see for yourself. And this helped to understand the fundamental honesty that underpinned "Waco: Rules of Engagement". If you just open your eyes and look, the facts can speak for themselves.
