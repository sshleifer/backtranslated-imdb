Like most people, I'm tired of the clich√©d figures by Hollywood movies. There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. Companies that only want to spend money on remakes are suites that have an integrated audience. <br /> <br /> This film is a welcome change. It could be classified as a romantic comedy for its genre, but do not be put off by this movie. It's a very original movie that does not look like most things produced by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this, you already know the basic plot, so I'm not going to take care of that. The only movies that come to mind to compare this are "Interstate 60" and "Art of Travel", little-known gems that take a different path from most Hollywood scraps. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you're tired of looking more of the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
