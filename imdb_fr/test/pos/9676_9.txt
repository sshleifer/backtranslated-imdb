Family Guy is the best show on television. ALREADY. He has achieved great things that no other animated sitcom, nor any other show, has managed to achieve. <br /> <br /> In terms of animated sitcoms, this era should be called "The time of animated sitcoms". because they are numerous and almost all imaginable are on DVD. There are good ones (eg South Park, Futurama and The Simpsons). Each animated sitcom has its own style / technique of creating humor. For example, Futurama is fun because it comments or always acts with humor. The Simpsons is also an excellent show because it uses the same comic technique and style as Futurama, but The Simpsons deserves credit, as it was broadcast well before Futurama and the rest thanks to the technique. South Park, to my mind, is the funniest show next to Family Guy because it uses a clever mix of vulgarity and sillyness as a technique for creating humor. <br /> <br /> But enough other animated shows. Let me tell you what makes Family Guy so funny. Family Guy uses a comic style that no other show has used before. He uses a technique of having backtracking after each joke. This not only reinforces the joke, but makes it more funny. He also moves very fast. These two criteria make it the funniest show on television. You must see the show to believe it, but once you see it, you will probably agree. (FYI, the two most entertaining moments of Family Guy were: 1) The 5-minute chicken battle in "Da Boom", and 2) The Dick van Dyke parody in "Holy Crap.") In addition, in my mind, Family Guy is a very modest series because while other series create humor by familiarizing themselves with their shticks / routines and characters, most Family Guy jokes are based on the stupidity of the family. news and pop culture. It also shows that Family Guy is smart, and modest, because it reveals that the series makes sense. And this technique is extremely effective because they associate their references to pop culture to the particular plot of the episode in which they find themselves. <br /> <br /> Family Guy can be enjoyed by all ages, because even if the youngest children do not understand pop culture references, they will be entertained by the hilarious and silly antics of the characters, especially Peter. The show, however, is a little more vulgar than The Simpsons and Futurama, but it is less vulgar than South Park. So, in terms of vulgarity, Family Guy would rank somewhere in the middle when associated with the shows above, but it would rank # 1 in terms of humor and intelligence! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was canceled last year, not because it was not popular, but because FOX was constantly changing slots, so no one ever knew when it was activated. Fortunately, we have the DVD boxes (which, by the way, are selling like mad) and Cartoon Network's Adult Swim reruns are available to us.
