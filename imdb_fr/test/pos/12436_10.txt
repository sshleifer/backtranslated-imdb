This film was shot thirteen years before I was born, but I still think it's the most spiritual, dignified and harmless fun ever made. He simply can not go wrong with the troupe of great British actors he boasts about. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Alastair Sim-peerless; Margaret Rutherford-idem; Gossage, the innocent and wonderfully sweet, is played to perfection by the imperious Joyce Grenfell. Cadet Victor Hyde-Brown (a Guy Middleton specialist) and the rest of the staff sum up England's post-war middle class. <br /> <br /> The humor is sometimes obvious, but it is of this special variety "Ealing" and is never offensive. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie more times than I do not intend to remember and I always laugh like a drip at antics every time. The storming of dormitories occupied by the girls' school, the beautifully planned but ultimately doomed twin towers of the school and the chaotic end involving the arrival of a third school to add to anarchy are priceless. <br /> <br /> It's an old clich√© I know, but they do not really do that anymore. How I wish they did. If you have not seen it, do it, you will not be disappointed.
