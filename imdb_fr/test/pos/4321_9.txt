The writers of the lost have outdone themselves. The Season 2 finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the Season 1 finale. Locke's lack of faith has had not only spiritual consequences for himself, but also tragic physical consequences for the lives of other shipwrecked people. . Michael's betrayal was a success for him, but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to do it if he wants to stay alive. I do not doubt that one or more of his old friends would be ready to kill him for revenge. This final left more questions than the previous final; and I can not wait for autumn. <br /> <br /> Note: What is the point of posting a review just to write all the spoilers? Where is the pleasure of spoiling the surprise for everyone? The current opinion on this page is none other than a big spoiler festival, poorly constructed in English barely readable for the express purpose of making someone crazy. Good work.
