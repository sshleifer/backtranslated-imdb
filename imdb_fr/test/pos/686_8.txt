This is a hilarious diamond in its raw state. The acting and the plot are not so impressive, but the lines continue to come. This attracts a lot of criticism because, at first glance, it looks like a bad movie, but it's so weird that you can not help but be amused. Quick dialogues and weird characters that catch lightning keep him going ... I especially loved Sharon, the Canuck on Shrooms, huh? However, the one who really stole the show is Richard's little brother, Andrew (Ira Heiden). His acute complaint was rather endearing. The whole movie has rocked.
