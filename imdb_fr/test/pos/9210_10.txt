A very reliable entertainment, Las Vegas amuses as much as intrigues, very light and very fortified by Josh Duhanel !! I like this TV show and I think a lot of people look at it as a form of voyeurism escape ... Voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many women in this series are very nice to watch ... This show incorporates Las Vegas legends such as Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the Las Vegas genre !! There have been many performances of sin city, it is one of the best efforts ... The producers and the directors are lucky to have James Caan in the series, it is a completely accomplished actor !! ! Basically, I like the Las Vegas TV show and I watch it on Friday, Monday also, but with Monday Night Football, I could see why NBC had switched it on Friday ... Nevertheless, I like Las Vegas. a lot!!
