I was very surprised to hear that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this film. She seemed very lifeless and completely schooled by Bergman, 54 years old (!), In scenes where they are side by side. If it had been written today, I think that Bergman and the young man Ivan would be together (Ingrid is so much hotter than Goldie ...) and that the two selfish characters played by Matthau and Hawn would be left out. cold. But it was written in the late 60's and looks like Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the Park. However, Matthau's one-liners, Hawn's innocence and Bergman's elegant performance make this experience very enjoyable to watch.
