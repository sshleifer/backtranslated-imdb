I have not seen this film for 50 years, but I still write a comment. <br /> <br /> While JACK WEBB's film was probably meant to entertain only --- showing Navy's basic training at Parris Island was realistic, it was a difficult exercise for character training - it was said that the army feared that the film discourages recruitment. It did not work that way. The film showed that entering the Marines was a bigger challenge than most young people ever understood, and (guess what?) A gigantic challenge was exactly what many guys wanted. I personally knew a lot of guys who joined the Marines soon after seeing THE DI. The lines in the recruiting centers were suddenly so long that the Marines had more recruits than they could handle. <br /> <br /> America will always have young people looking to become the best - while slackers and losers are drinking along nowhere. <br /> <br /> What we do NOT have in 2007 are films that inspire patriotism, dedication to duty of any kind, positive values, et cetera. What we have is movies that make the airhead-ed to be airheads, beer drinkers to swallow beer, other negative values. Exhibit # 1 shows that SUPERBAD, the teenager trickery and beer fan, is now ranked # 81 in the list of best movies of all time. Values? What does it mean, values?
