I had never seen a series so rich in history, mystery, suspense and emotion. I watch more barley television, but I own every season of this show and it's amazing. each episode is extremely well played, written and traced. Towards the end of the series, I felt that the stories were becoming too far-fetched to be in a prison, but the actors removed it. The sopranos are huge, compared to OZ. In fact, any broadcast on a cable network, HBO or not, simply can not hold a candle to OZ. I wish he'll come back for another season. if that happened, they would probably kill all the characters in the series, but hey, we all have to go someday. as for the characters, I would say O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites. Both were hardley in a scene together, but I thought their personal stories were the strongest, besides Beechers of course, but still ... anyway, the best show of all time, the best network ever created , some of the best actors of all time, PERIOD!
