This show is really very good. Like all TV shows, she has her good episodes and bad ones. <br /> <br /> I've read where people compare this show to Married with kids, and I guess it's a similar show for the new generation. However, because of what was expected and allowed on TV in Married with Children's day, this show was pushed to the extreme to show that it was actually a TV show and that it should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> The War at Home has the luxury of being a little more realistic. Parents talk to each other as parents often do in real life, saying something to their children when they turn around and do the opposite. <br /> <br /> Of course, some content can be considered controversial. But I find that this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are many families like this. <br /> <br /> Each episode gives a "valuable lesson". Sometimes the lesson is that you will not find a perfect solution to all the problems that a family may encounter, and sometimes the solution is to choose the lesser of two evils. We all know that in some cases, as a parent, the only goal you can have is to keep your children safe from big problems and hope they learn the truth from the wrong. <br /> <br /> I respect writers to try to keep the show true to life, instead of having a magical ending as the Cleaver family has always had.
