The film is really good, it does not use violence, sex, etc. to sell like other movies, but just use a decent plot (based on the original Michael Caine) and some great actors to make a fun and action packed movie that I really enjoyed. What made me even more appreciative of this film is that it had actors that I really like, such as Edward Norton (whom I saw for the last time at the 26th hour) that I I also appreciated), Jason Statham (carrier, also appreciated) and Seth. I think Green is great. His role as a roommate of Shawn Fanning, dubbed "The Napster," is hilarious and his hacking skills play a big role in the main robbery, which centers on a major traffic jam in Los Angeles. The car chases are really correct and the high tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive. I did not see the original, so I can not really compare but I liked it a lot and I highly recommend it to everyone. This is not a film where you have to love this genre in particular, it will suit everyone. I felt good after this movie, the end was really good and, overall, it was really fun to watch. I give it 8/10. Go watch it!
