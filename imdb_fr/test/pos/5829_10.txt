One of the best TV series, if not the best. Why? Simple: he has the courage to show us the real life in prison, without clich√©s or predictable twists. This is not Prison Break or another series, comparing to Oz the series The Sopranos look like a story for children. Blasphemy, insults, scenes of explicit violence and drug use, disgusting scenes of male sex organs and rape ... all this and more at Oz. But that's not the best part of Oz; the characters are the highlight of this show; they are all excellent and not boring, despite the fact that we look at brutal criminals. The actors are great, my favorites being Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher, as they are so unique and completely change their behavior. And above all ... they have no remorse for their actions. Overall ... Oz is an incredible show, the best ever. Forget the CSIs and the shows about stupid doctors ... that's the case ... OZ!
