"The piano teacher" is all about Huppert's character; a middle-aged classical piano teacher with a stoic facade behind which hides a powerful and convincing aberrant personality. Unsatisfactory as a story, but intriguing as a character study, the film follows Huppert's character until the end of his anxious relationship with a student producing great performances. Not for everyone, "The Piano Teacher" will play best with foreign movies and drama series on dark characters. (A-)
