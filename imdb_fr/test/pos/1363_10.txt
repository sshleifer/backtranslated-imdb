In simple terms, there are two parts of this series that made me cry until my eyes came off. First: the part where he was about to wash the toilet, but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot director giving him a shower in gold !!! (I laughed so much!) <br /> <br /> Second: the part where he tried to be worthy of an instructor at the swimming school. He appeared to be a diving professional, but as expected, he did not know how to swim (at least ^^). However, the fun part of this was when he finally reached the end and said "how was it" or something. It was so hilarious that I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this animated series, I highly recommend it. One of the best I have seen. <br /> <br /> Certainly the funniest!
