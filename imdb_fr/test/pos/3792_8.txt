In these modern times (a subject well known to the director of the short film that this German comte is going to talk about), politically correct films are the "leitmotif" of the projects of modern young filmmakers. "Shoulder Arms" directed by Mr. Charlie Chaplin during the First World War (the film was released only a few weeks before the armistice) is an obvious example of why the early pioneers of cinema were a very daring people! Making a humorous film inspired by the terrible and bloody First World War was a complicated affair that only a few filmmakers with such dangerous and daring ideas could do. venturing into such a delicate and successful enterprise was reserved for geniuses. <br /> <br /> As this German count said, "Shoulder Arms" was made during the First World War, at a time when the whole world has definitely lost its innocence (fortunately not the big German heirs of this aristocrat ??) and it's a hilarious and inventive social satire about this and any war. The film is full of gags and entertaining movie continuity for a story in which this tramp will live adventurous adventures and brave adventures, be it a hero for the allies? or not. <br /> <br /> To make fun of the trenches of war, the insalubrity, the frontal attacks and the Germans (how dare you !! ... by the way, there are many inaccuracies in the film the German soldiers of that time wore mustaches and a long beard, not to mention that the Kaiser did not have many medals in his uniform ??) in an elegant, fun and delicate way, it is still today of a cinematic miracle impossible to surpass. Keeping in mind these terrible circumstances of the war, the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent. It is obvious that Charlie Chaplin had a lot. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will allow me, I have to take time off temporarily because that German count has to go back to the Schloss trenches. <br /> <br /> Mr. Graf Ferdinand von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
