I have heard a lot about Porno Holocaust and his sister film, Erotic Nights Of The Living Dead. Both films are interchangeable and were shot at the same time at the same place, the same actors changing (and removing) clothes for each film. If you expect the genius of D'Amato in movies like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you will not find it here. Nevertheless, this film has a charm that exploiting fans will not be able to resist. Where do you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie / monster and his huge penis strangling and choking women to death? Only D'Amato. There is a certain amount of blood in which many men are clubbed with batons. The film takes place on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know, there is no subtitled version, so if you do not speak Italian, you will not know what's going on ... but who cares, right? In all honesty, Gore fans will probably advance quickly in hardcore sex. And if someone is actually looking for sex, it is obvious that one will be offended instantly. I can only imagine that the modern porn fans go back in the production of D'Amato and discover this atrocity! Of the two, I find that erotic nights of the undead is far superior. But do not look at them if they are cut. Porn Holocaust is an extremely low budget as expected. Even the monster does not look anywhere like the character of George Eastman in Anthropophagus. The film is worth watching for a laugh and complete your quest for D'Amato.
