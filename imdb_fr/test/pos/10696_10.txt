After seeing this movie, I have no choice but to write a review in the hope that there are others like me who have been blown away by the rocket-powered ninja action. by the hot sexual titillation that is Ninja III: The Domination. <Br/> <br /> We all know that Sho Kosugi is swinging. This is a given, but what about the ultra-macho interpretation of Jordan Bennett's "Billy Secord" police officer? Mr. Bennett, congratulations. While trying to seduce Christie (played to perfection by a single Miss Lucinda Dickey of fame), you prove very early that you are not afraid to take risks with your talent. I especially appreciated the fact that you did not feel the need to intervene and try to help her when 4 thugs were trying to rape her outside her gym. Oh, you could have helped, but by standing there and looking at you, you let her know who the boss was. Secord will wear the pants in this relationship. I also appreciated the fact that Mr. Bennett was not afraid to repeatedly remove his shirt or to wear the thresher-shaped tank top despite his gorilla, like his shoulders and back. Back and shoulder hair is hot and Secord knows it. And what about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is "KABOOM" - I see a sex bomb ready to explode. As a temptress and expert in martial arts, she does all the right things. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie tick. You would think she would hate him because he's a fool, but not my friends. Animal magnetism is too strong to resist, and they bond like crazy glue. Sho Kasugi is not as important as one might think, although he remains a main character, which suits me perfectly because all I wanted was more Bennett and Dickey. He seems to wear a lot of eye makeup, which was nice to see. Special effects? Sensational. That's all I can say. I will not give the end, but let's just say that it will not disappoint you. I love Ninja III: Domination, and I can only hope that there is a Ninja 4. I give it a 5 out of 5 stars.
