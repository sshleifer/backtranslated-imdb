Penelope Spheeris (from "Wayne's World") made his mark with the documentary "The Decline of Western Civilization", on the punk scene of Los Angeles in the late 70's and early 80's. Most documentaries feature interviews with punks and concert sequences (often violent). Overall, we see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies: while the hippies were becoming natural, the punks wanted to change as much as possible, with their hair bristling, etc. But we also see how badly they are, and sometimes become skinheads. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's an excellent time capsule. We do not really know if we want to aspire at this time or if we feel repulsed by it. But it's certainly not a documentary that will leave you neutral. Well worth a visit.
