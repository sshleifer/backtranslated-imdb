First of all, I'm not one to go to the bottom of the movies. I saw friends in the 70s when he came out. I was about 17 at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still remember certain scenes. The film is sweet and sad and perhaps too tame for today's teens, but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life than they had at home. At the time, it was very risky to shoot a film about two young runaways who managed to set up a house and have a baby. I'm not surprised that Elton John's film and soundtrack are almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.
