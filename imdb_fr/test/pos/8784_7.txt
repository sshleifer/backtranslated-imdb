A first entertaining version for "North By Northwest", "Saboteur" offers wonderful Hitchcockian moments (one of the best occurs at a table, when the hero is invited by a woman who has not yet seen it is wearing handcuffs, trying to do that, he drops a knife on the ground, exposing himself even more!) but suffers from a badly chosen track (that he pronounces patriotic speeches, that he makes love with Priscilla Lane , whether he's making jokes or trying to look worried, Robert Cummings is out of wood), and for lack of really distinct bad guys (oh, there are bad guys, a lot of them, but almost no one has enough time in front of the screen).
