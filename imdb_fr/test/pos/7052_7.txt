As a young teenager when it came out, I completely told. As an adult in the current American culture obsessed with sex, he does not have enough nudity to be called tamed. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for jokes about the type of American pie, vulgarity or stuffing on fart and feces, Meatballs will disappoint you with impunity and with a guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you love Bill Murray and love pleasure, you will probably love this movie a lot. Similarly with Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack, etc. <br /> <br /> Enough talk, go look at it and stop intellectualizing it. It's Meatballs, to shout loudly! Why read a review? Enjoy and have fun. And ignore the vulgar speech of others. Movies, like so many other things in life, are subjective. Everyone to his own tastes. <br /> <br /> Always be wary of the expert who diminishes the taste of others.
