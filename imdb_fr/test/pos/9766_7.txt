I rushed to the library to watch this miniseries after just finished listening to the wonderful "shortened" version of the book. The first half of this TV version is really good, but it stumbles a little in the second half. The relationship with the custodian is overexploited and conflicts are inserted between John and Joe that do not exist in Shute's story, which, from my point of view, greatly reduces the power of their love story. I was disappointed to find that Bryan Brown's wonderful Joe seemed much more scathing and much less attractive than the man in the book, but Helen's Jean Morse was really very good. I think they should have done a mini-series of 10 hours to tell the story of the hinterland. But all that being said, I have watched everything more or less than once and I have appreciated the merits, while wishing that someone makes a remake less soapy.
