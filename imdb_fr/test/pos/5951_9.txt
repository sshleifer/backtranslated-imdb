I loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes fake spies and thinks that Johnny English is embarrassing. This is the film that I should have been. But since he's based on an old French film series, he's not really tied to Bond. <br /> <br /> The production is brilliant, you will almost feel that the film was shot in the 60s. It even has what kind of pastel coloring films we had at that time. Jean Dujardin plays his role with just the right amount of stupidity and naivety, not with mocking stupidity like Rowan Atkinson. Even if you do not like the movie, you'll want to see it for Berenice Bejo. Oh dear! She is the heat ...
