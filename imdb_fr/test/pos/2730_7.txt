I must say it was disappointing. Overall, it's great to see how Aparna Sen treated the problem of schizophrenia. I am not very aware of this and I only got what was described in A Beautiful Mind and, here too, its interesting portrait. <br /> <br /> But what caused the disappointment for me is the artificial dialogues and the excessive use of English. It is true that a new class is being formed / trained in India and speaks English even at home, but I'm sure it's not as formal as in the film. In addition, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable speaking everything in English. Charu's dialogue in Bihari's tone was apparently much more realistic and digestible. <br /> <br /> The second thing is the abstract flavor she tried to give to the movie. I usually like movies with an open ending, but here there was a lot of things loose. It's as if pieces were assembled to make the film. In addition, there seemed to be no central theme in the film. Schizophernia was certainly the main line, but intermingling sister-sister, mother-daughter, adding a doctor-azmi relationship, no real use of the brother, Bose - Bose's wife relations ..... all were not necessary and let the audience lose track of What did she really try to represent? <br /> <br /> In total, a watch for those who love offbeat movies, to avoid for those who only see movies as an entertainment tool.
