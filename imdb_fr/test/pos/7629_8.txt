The Last Dinosaur was one of those "extravagant" movies of the 1970s, rather exciting for fans of Japanese Tokusatsu films. Originally scheduled for a theatrical release (around the release of Dino King Kong last December), it was suddenly shot and turned into a Friday Night ABC movie of the week. Rankin Bass, who was no stranger to Japanese co-productions, was at the origin of this production, co-produced with Tsuburaya Productions of Japan, the people who brought us Ultraman in various forms. Featuring mainly American actors, including the late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and Steven Keats, this film tells the story of a prehistoric pocket of time in what was an overheated volcanic caldera somewhere in the icy circle of Arctic, containing dinosaurs. This is very similar to The Land Unknown (1956) and The Land That Time Forgot (1975) in terms of feel and pace. Of course, the dinosaurs were guys in suits (A Triceratops with their knees in front!), But they were filmed in such a way, the music and music were so well done, and the cast did a good job that it mattered few to many of us grew up on Godzilla. The film has a lot of class, from Nancy Wilson's opening score "The Last Dinosaur" to the movie's overall feel - the hot spring locations in northern Japan were excellent and lush - and the undeniable feeling of Kaiju Eiga to her. There are amazing sets of scenery - the T-Rex's "bone park" and a tracking plan that takes us deep into the jungle to see the T-Rex eating a giant stream fish. Tsuburaya FX staff members have done their job with style here and aside from some dismal shots they are doing their job well. This film is considered to be the best "kaiju" film of the 1970s from Japan, even on the five Godzilla films made during this decade. Rankin Bass made several other co-productions with Tsuburaya, supplying creatures or miniatures - The Bermuda Depths (1978) and The Ivory Ape (1980) - but neither of them matched the epic look of this film.
