The film is a very good movie. One of the best movies of Yash Raj. The direction is amazing.The story is brilliant.The story is excellent.It tells the story of Rahul who is obsessed with Kiran, his friend in college.He is completely psychopath doing things like talking to his mother on the phone (from anyway she died 15 years back), etc. Kiran is betrothed to Sunil.Rahul does everything for him to look for her. The film is a delight for all nes.Shahrukh is superb, Juhi is good enough, Sunny is average, Anupham is fine, just like Tanvi, Dalip did good.The film belongs to Srk.The dialogues are great (those of Shahrukh and many if not comedy overflowing and comic). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are absolutely melodious songs.
