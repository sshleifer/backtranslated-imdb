I like this film. The portrait of Shehzad Khan as Bhalla a.k.a "Shut up, Robert!" was so hilarious. Whenever he was hit during a fight scene, you could hear him moan. Viju Khote is the stupefied Robert a.k.a "Rabbit". I like this Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. "Crime Master Gogo". The dual role of Paresh Rawal is so hilarious for his interpretation of Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother mimics Bhalla very well. "Relax, please relax." I like the scene in which Aamir Khan inserts a laxative into Khan's food, "Muscles" of Salman, which caused irregular stools forcing him to use the restroom several times.
