This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best I have seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the most recent adaptations, it nevertheless contains the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. <br /> <br /> The image of the prince disturbed by Jacobi is multiple and fascinating. His emotional demonstrations range from hate to grief, from love to revenge and everywhere else on the map, but without seeming forced or disproportionate. In fact, some of the most powerful sequences occur when he sub-reads them, with calm, gentle speech and thoughtful expression. As to whether he interprets Hamlet as crazy or sane ... well, you should decide for yourself; I changed my mind more than once. At one point, he seems to think he's sane and just playing mad, but he suspects he's really crazy, after all ... a revelation for himself, beautifully captured. After playing the role of Hamlet more times than any other actor in history, Jacobi's affinity for the role is therefore hardly surprising. <br /> <br /> As for the production itself, it is presented as a kind of "filmed-copy" of the play, with little special effects or sophisticated camera work, minimal decors and no musical accompaniment proper. This production draws on the casting's prowess and Shakespeare's words to evoke the emotion and interest of his audience. And it works. The other players are also excellent, including "Claudius" Patrick Stewart and "Gertrude" Claire Bloom. Together, the actors form a homogeneous whole. <br /> <br /> The last (but not least) element that distinguishes this production is the game itself. Here, it is presented in its entirety, a rarity on film. But oddly enough, I never noticed the weather. I was too busy losing myself in the story. I think you also.
