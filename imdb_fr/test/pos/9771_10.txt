I saw this drama by cable TV. Although I only saw two series, I love this drama. I am waiting for other series to be broadcast by cable. <br /> <br /> Although it describes a horrible and absurd situation in a prisoner's camp, it shows us an indomitable spirit, warmth, friendship and humanity. They do not know if they can survive or not, but they keep their hope without being discouraged by adversity. <br /> <br /> I know this movie is not realistic, unlike other war documentaries, but I do not want to blame it for that. This makes me believe in the strong will of people in the most difficult situation. <br /> <br /> "Private Bill", in particular, this episode has touched my heart. <br /> <br /> I remember every scene. I still hate mathematics. But after seeing this drama, I can understand something about mathematics ... Mathematics is its link between the past and the present, also symbolizing eternity. <br /> <br /> "Time, light and memory are framed in a circle." Like other victims of the war, he lost his lover by an irresistible fate. I am immersed in his time and memory as if I had lived the same thing. <br /> <br /> He has lived the great loss, but he has a pure passion for studies. <br /> <br /> He started his studies in camp, his joy to realize, <br /> <br /> I believe that his dedication to studying has supported him. <br /> <br /> I have seen it many times, but the meaning of this movie has never faded. Every time I saw her, I feel the same emotion. <br /> <br /> * Their songs are beautiful, harmonious, <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I can not listen to OST.
