Every time I watch this movie, it makes me really want to go out and have a good night! My companion uses the speech "the weekend has landed" to get psyche before going out! and me too ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> This film is a great start for the writer / director - Bravo, buddy! <br /> <br /> The acting is awesome, all the characters are believable and are larger than life! The "strange" scenes are a pleasure to watch, Jip running Mr floppy flashbacks / explanations / visualizations are all great! The scene in the huuuuuuuge pub when everyone gets up and starts to sing the simulated national anthem makes you laugh too. There's a lot of comedy here - Howard Marks' "spliff policy" speech is hilarious! <br /> <br /> Oh my god, you just need to see that. Mind you, I feel that the film has somewhat glorified the use of ecstasy, but hey, that's the truth, huh? At least, the film does not fear this fact. I guess the movie also has a decent message - do not take life TOO seriously, you have to let yourself down from time to time. And of course, the chatter in the pub when Moff tries to explain to his comrades that he does not take any more drugs is a definite reminder that when the descent is announced, you know that the party is over! <br /> <br /> It is sometimes a very intelligent film in its use of the camera, the light, etc. It was a movie piece made and a great story of friends, love, clubs and drugs. <br /> <br /> Get people out of the "rat race" !!! <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Enjoy it!
