Meville's film is not as good as its most famous film, the deliciously elegant "The Samurai (1968)". I do not even think this is the best example of the so-loved heist subgenre. The main thing against the film is its long duration. Meville tends to focus on too much trivial detail. He could have told the same story in a relatively short time, but for reasons I do not understand, the movie seems to go on and on. Nevertheless, the film is never boring. The management of Melville impressed me and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a very master thief. The color photography not to be missed in the film is a plus and Melville uses the sound (or lack thereof) very effectively. From a technical point of view, the film is practically flawless. We sometimes have the feeling that Meville is only showing off, but when someone is as talented as he is, there is little reason to complain. I still love the other films of the "Jules Dassin" ("Topkapi (1964)", to name but one), but we can not deny that this film is a good entertainment of pulp and a good example of what people are referring to. like "cool" cinema.
