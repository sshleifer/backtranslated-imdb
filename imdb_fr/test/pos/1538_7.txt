Act, of course! Think about it, Closet Land could easily have been so horrible: a whole movie shot in a room with only two people, it would be better if they had damn interesting things to discuss. to turn horribly. On the contrary, thanks to the incredible performances of Stowe and Rickman, Closet Land is a masterpiece in its own right. <br /> <br /> That does not mean it's for everyone. People whose attention has been reduced due to lavish sex scenes and random shots may have trouble digesting Closet Land. However, those who can enjoy a good narration without explosions should take a look at it (no matter how many video stores you have to call to find someone who has it in stock).
