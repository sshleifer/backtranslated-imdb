<br /> <br /> "Lets swap murders - your wife, my father" - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet for a lunch by train. Guy, a strong and respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, flirtatious Miriam, will not divorce in order to marry Senator Anne's daughter, laughs at the conversation jokingly. The next week, he does not laugh anymore. In a classic suspense scene at Hitchcock, Bruno guides Miriam in a carnival and strangles him. As he does, his glasses fall and we see the murder strangely reflected twice through his lenses. Bruno, with a cold and amoral heart, concluded his contract with a scared guy who was waiting for him, even forcing him to "do his part". Things are not helped when Anne's youngest and youngest sister shows up, suspecting Miriam's murder of Guy. Then accused of a murder that he did not commit and expecting to commit another, what will Guy do? The power of this film lies in the presentation of human beings as having a deadly side in their nature - and this is what Hitchcock does to perfection.
