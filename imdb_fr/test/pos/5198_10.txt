Stalingrad is a fantastic film, well played and directed, and rather realistic in its approach to the various bizarre aspects of the war and its politics. It is, with "Das Boot", one of the best war movies (with the Finnish "Vinterkriget" ("The Winter War", in English, I believe)). It depicts the hardships of some of the German soldiers who fought - and died - in and around Stalingrad during the Second World War. No great heroism, no emotional blur, only the fear of dying every day in the war. The mood of the movie is similar to that of "Das Boot", and that should give you some clues about what to expect, I suppose. So, if you like realistic, non-Hollywood war movies: rent them, buy them, just be sure to see them! Finally, note of the film buff: for some of the information of previous reviews, I just want to add that "Stalingrad" is not directed by Wolfgang Petersen (who directed "Das Boot")!
