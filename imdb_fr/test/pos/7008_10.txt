While most of the films that pit human beings against terrible aliens end up being cheap imitations of the "Aliens" series, Pitch Black is a great piece of Sci-Fi and an excellent movie. Maybe my favorite aspect of the movie is lighting. This film admirably uses many different colors, shades and light intensities, which create the mood and give the film a unique feel, something different from the "normal" film lighting we are usually subjected to. Vin Diesel gives life to his character in an excellent way, skilfully avoiding the routine portrait of the hardened criminal. After all, the film is about Riddick's personal journey (Diesel's character). Fortunately, Vin does not let go. The other members of the cast (with the exception of the talented and beautiful Claudia Black) were unknown to me, but they all had wonderful performances, animating the various characters with unique quirks and manners. Pitch Black is the perfect example of making a great movie without the resources of an excessive budget. Special effects are more than enough, but at the same time they are by no means the only goal, as in many big budget blockbusters. It's a good movie because it uses science fiction to tell an engaging and provocative story, rather than telling a mediocre story to use the Sci-Fi flash.
