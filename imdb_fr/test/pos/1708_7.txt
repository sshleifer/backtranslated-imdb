As far as talk shows are concerned, Larry King Live is not bad, and as it sometimes gets good guests, it's a show to activate from time to time, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president or other important guests sit in front of him, it's not bad. Other times, it tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal, which provides absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated audience who wants to hear the latest gossip about movie stars and of television. At OJ Simpson's trial, it seemed that all the other guests on his show were related to the case. But is this really journalism? Or the National Enquirer on the tube? Sometimes it sounds a bit like trashy television - Jerry Springer in a phone interview instead of a live audience. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, King's show is definitely better than Bill O'Reilly whose show is nothing more than a political platform on the far right of the Rush Limbaugh variety. That said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but alas, he is not very good. King does not always undo himself as he understands it perfectly when the intellectual material is presented, especially if it is a scholar or historian who proposes a new book on the subtle aspects of politics. It always seems that the minute King can not fix the problem, it's when he turns to phone calls, hoping maybe someone in the country will have a better question than him. He can interview someone like David Gergen, but maybe he has not read any of his books. A bit like the movie producer who never cares to read the script. <br /> <br /> When it comes to a celebrity entertainment, no problem. He can come out as if he knew the subject perfectly well, anyway. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not really rocket science. And I notice that he has usually seen the last movie of the star. Watching a movie takes a lot less time and contemplation than reading a book. However, if it sounds like John Dean or Bob Woodward, King stands out a bit like he's not quite finished his homework. So, go on the phone. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a real in-depth interview, Terry Gross, from NPR, is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads and / or researches everything that has been written by or about her guests and has a working knowledge of these areas. I do not see King doing that. Admittedly, he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than Terry Gross, which perhaps says more about the American public than King. In short, Larry is better than Bill but not as good as Terry.
