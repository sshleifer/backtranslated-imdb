It's a remake of the classic 80s anime, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna and Priss are all back in the role of the Knight Sabers in their combinations that fight against robotic boomers. The animation is clear, the characters are well developed and the action is great. Priss is a singer in her usual work, so the series also contains wonderful songs. There is a lot of violence, but most of the time, it is directed against robots and there is a support service for fans, but nothing is too racy. DVDs also have many extras, including comments, that really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show. Do not miss it for all the fans of cartoons. <br /> <br /> Also recommended: Burst Angel, Armitage III
