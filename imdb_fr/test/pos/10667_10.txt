If you are a film student or if you have one or plan to become one, the name Battleship Potemkin has or will resonate. Sergei Eistenstein, like other silent film pioneers like Griffith (though Eisenstein's innovations are not as trivial as Griffith's) and Murnau, had such an impact on the history of cinema that this is obviously taken for granted. The reason I mentioned the film student part is that at some point, whether you like it or not, your movie teacher will show the movie "Odessa Stairs". It is difficult to say if it is even the "best" part of the various sequences of the film dealing with the (current) times of the Russian revolution. But this leaves the most impact, and this is seen in many movies featuring the suspense, or simply simple editing (we can think of the culmination of the Untouchables). <br /> <br /> Montage, which was not only talent his life, early in his career, is also often misused in current cinema, or otherwise, in a context unfit for the story. Sometimes editing is now used as a simple way to get from point A to point B. Editing was something else for Eisenstein; he tried to communicate in the most direct way possible the urgency, the passions and the ultimate tragedies that affected the Russian people at the time and place. Even if we do not see all the narrative or traditional ideas of Eisenstein's "history" to have much foundation (Kubrick said it), we can not deny the power to see the ships arrive at the port, the people in the stairs, and the soldiers who came to them in all directions with rifles. Some may find it hard to believe that this was done in the 1920s; he has the power, like Joan of Arc's passion, to go beyond his time and keep his importance, if only on a technical and emotional level. <br /> <br /> Of course, we could continue to buy books (which have been written hundreds of times, the least of which by Eisenstein himself). Battleship Potemkin is much more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in a movie. The first segment is also one of the big sequences of the film, since a mutiny is preparing against the captain and other heads-up of a certain ship. This is detailed almost manipulatively, but in one way or another extremely effective; Editing is also used here, but by surges of energy capturing the eye. At other times, Eisenstein is happier to let the pictures speak for themselves, as the soldiers get tired without food or water. He is not one of those administrators who will try to convince all parties of the story. He is of course very Russian at the beginning of the twentieth century, but he is not honest with the way he designs his themes and his style, and that's what ends up convincing. <br /> <br /> Some may want to check it out of the film school, because the sequence "Stairs" is like one of those landmarks of a serious film tragedy, showing the bad side of the revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the most "accessible" silent film directors, but if the editing, the details in the frame, the non-actors and the Bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, it's really one of the essentials of a lifetime.
