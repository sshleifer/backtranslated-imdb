Continuing with the exclusive program devoted to complicated relations in some European courts, the film "Anna Boleyn" was screened last night at the Schloss Theater by the great Teutonic director Herr Ernst Lubitsch. The film describes the terrible story of the Queen's wife Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband (well, not exactly, the king ordered the executioners to do his dirty work), not to mention that this marriage had caused an important political and religious historical event, the English Reformation. <br /> <br /> The film stars Lady Henny Porten, the first German superstar in cinema during these early years, and Herr Emil Jannings, the biggest German actor at this silent time. Both play their characters appropriately; Dame Porten as an innocent aristocrat who is progressively interested in the power given to her by the Court and to Mr Jannings as an unscrupulous, whimsical and attractive British monarch, a character perfectly suited to this German actor who acts appropriately , given the extravagant and disproportionate personality of the character himself. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of cinema, Mr. Lubitsch was known for his films in exceptional costumes, his colossal productions with big budgets ("Anna Boleyn" cost about 8 million marks, a fortune even for this German count ) paying close attention to beautiful scenery, as can be seen in the coronation cortege on the stage of Westminster Abbey, which employed 4,000 extras (the inactive Germans of the time were used, causing panic revolutionary workers when German President Friedrich Ebert went on the set during filming). <br /> <br /> Besides the show, one of the most important aspects of this film and all the films of Mr. Lubitsch, even during his s the complex relationship between the main characters. We live a game of different interests, of double meaning, and the complicated art of flirting, but what we treat lightly is tragic. The importance of these historical facts is put to effective use, but Lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Boleyn. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will allow me, I must temporarily take leave because this German count must ensure that one of his great and rich heirs does not lose his head in front of this Teutonic aristocrat . <br /> <br /> Mr. Graf Ferdinand von Galitzien http: // ferdinandvongalitzien. blogspot.com/
