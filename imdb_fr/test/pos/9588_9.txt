Tweety is sent in his cage on a train by his old lady owner. Sylvester is in the same luggage van, also in a cage. <br /> <br /> In no time, Sylvester seized Tweety, but a man returns and slaps the "stealthy feline", as he calls it, in his cage. He places Tweety "in a safer place", upstairs and says to the cat, "Now remember: no stuff!" Sylvester puts on his halo and looks innocent. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> I found the funniest thing, however, it was not Sylvester against Tweety but the "slimy dog" that is in another cage next to Sylvester. The cat takes his mouth with him and pays a very high price in an extremely funny way. Sylvester just does not learn, but that's one of the reasons we love him! (I know a number of IMDb critics do not like Tweety, but I like the two main characters - they make me both fuck!) - very beautiful visuals.
