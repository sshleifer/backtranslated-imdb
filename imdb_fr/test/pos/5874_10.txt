What can you say about a Wilder movie, no matter what the most humane and true stories about people and what motivates them, the bug, haunts them. Billy created images as paintings that forever reflect the human condition. He paints good and evil in each of us. He also paints with love. I can not imagine anyone having a list of the greatest movies without Wilder. They will last because they are true. I first saw this film on television in the '60s when I was a child and I had to leave the room because I felt the tears flow in me and I was embarrassed. Now I am an old man and I still feel tears flow but do not leave the room. I knew these people, I loved them and grew up around them. Billy has preserved them in this film, not the "greatest generation", but in the most realistic way, while preserving the power of the human spirit.
