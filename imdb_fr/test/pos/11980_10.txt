I caught "On the Run" at the New York Screening Room and was immediately seduced by his true independent spirit. With Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia from the Sopranos Cast, "On the Run" sets us in a wild 24-hour race in the city that never sleeps, as we follow the meanders of an introspective sales agent who is suddenly dragged by his long school friend, just out of jail. In fact, he escaped and is "on the run" in search of action and a glimpse of life in the middle of the big city. Propelled by excellent performances, this film gives us back the old feeling of images of the 70s, the two characters being found while they spread through the city by clashing with crazy events and locals. An elegy in a certain part of New York that seems to disappear, "On the Run" shows great sensitivity and great humor. I predict that it will be a cult classic that is urgent to discover: future viewers must absolutely go to this nocturnal trip.
