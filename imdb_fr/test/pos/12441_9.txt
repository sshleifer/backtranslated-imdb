This film is without a doubt the clearest example of British humor that Germans can not understand. The one-liners rage in a film that has spawned one of the greatest series of films in the history of British cinema (St.Trinians). The history of bureaucratic incompetence in the midst of post-war trials allows Frank Launder to direct the maximum of talent among all actors. This is probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match, in Alastair Sim, for an energetic characterization (she still wins). Joyce Grenfell (bless) and Richard Wattis both deserve to be mentioned in Dighton's masterpiece of English label and stiff upper lip under pressure. <br /> <br /> No Rutherford / Sim / Grenfell fan would be in their collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83 minutes long.
