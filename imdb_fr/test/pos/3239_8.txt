I can not comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I liked it. If there is a god, the soundtrack will be published, the work of Ilona Sekacz is really sustainable. Twenty years later, I am still moved by the obsessive themes of this production and return there often. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds Catherine Moreland's entry into society. Somewhat embarrassed and having an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (old fiction?), Catherine goes down to Bath with Mrs. Allen where she meets Henry Tilney. She is invited to visit the Tilney of Northanger Abbey, seat of the dreaded General Tilney (who is in financial difficulty), who has the false misconception that there is wealth at his feet. <br /> <br /> Where the mutual attraction mingles with the family finances, the dispute is inevitable. This, combined with the lively imagination of the Catherines, makes her fear for her safety. His eventual departure is tainted with accusations and counter-accusations of deception and collusion. <br /> <br /> But the attraction between Catherine and Henry resists these lawsuits. He returns to provide a happy ending. This final scene is particularly convincing, given the fortuitous music of Ilona Sekacz. <br /> <br /> It may be a "bad" production from the point of view of purists, without the garish costumes and staggering performance, but for me it's 88 minutes of happiness .
