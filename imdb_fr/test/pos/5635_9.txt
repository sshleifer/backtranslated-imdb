When we are young, we all choose an ideal profession: artist, actor, writer, rocket specialist, etc. Most of us come out of our chimeras, the main character of American Movie, Mark, has not yet give up his (and at the age of thirty too): become a rich acclaimed director. Despite the fact that Murphy's law does not leave Mark alone and that something still seems to go wrong, Mark is able to persevere in every deterrent incident with even greater motivation to achieve his goals. His desire to be a film director controls his character so much that he considers anyone or any element of his life as something to exploit to achieve his goal. While I have noticed other BDIM commentators talking about Mark's selfishness, I think it's a kind of selfishness almost justified, because for Mark, not becoming a famous director equals death . He keeps talking about leaving a mark on the world and sees cinema as a way of doing it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any viewer of this movie understands very early that Mark has almost no chance of ever realizing his dream. Is he aware? No, not at all, and no member of his family or any of his friends wants to reveal the secret to him (even some of them believe in him). Curiously, however, the disappointing future that prevails for the viewer is certain that Mark will not hinder the ability to find humor in the film. It's a very, very funny documentary. Most bursts of laughter come from the moment Mark is filming Coven scenes. There is a scene where an actor has to break a cupboard, but it does not work. Mark's very old uncle Bill tells a few lines to the camera. Needless to say, after 20 shots with a lot of head rattling and stumbling, Bill finally decides he has enough. A lot of humor unfortunately comes from Mark himself. His scenario, which seems to him worthy of a Pulitzer, is funny: "It's good, it's good, there is something for which one must live, Jesus told me." <br /> <br /> "American Movie" is, contrary to what one might think, a documentary that everyone can enjoy (although my sister, who watched some scenes, seemed to think that it was outright bizarre). The fact that Chris Smith manages to screen a film that inspires the sadness of Mark's depressing lifestyle to the hilarity with scenes from Bill (unfortunately died before the film's release) speaks volumes about him. I wonder how the dreamer Mark considers this documentary. Does he realize that it throws him into a bad light? Or that he is preparing to show it as a fool in many scenes of the film? Or does he see it as something that will be shown before his own segment A & E Biography? It is a subject of astonishment that intrigues, and I hope that it will become reality for him one day. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie: 9/10.
