It must be one of the best Doctor Who episodes I've seen since he came back last year. There is a brilliant mix of fun, fear and tenderness, which is tantamount to an incredible episode. The oods were brilliantly designed and I'm pretty sure there will be a lot of jokes in the coming weeks. I am guilty of this already. I especially liked the way we looked at Rose's and the Doctor's relationship from a different angle, as well as the end: well, this is the first time I'm hiding behind a cushion! I can not wait until next week's episode to find out how they will cope.
