"Hit and Run" is a heartbreaking story featuring the always wonderful Margaret Colin as a woman of the company who "has it all", until she strikes a child with her car and leaves the scene. Hence the title. The tragedy is that she will ask for help and come back, but is frightened by angry passers-by who think the batter has abandoned the stage. This was done at a time when not everyone had a cell phone or there was no story. <br /> <br /> Colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and push her to act so strangely that a detective goes to her right. a way. Her lies push her deeper and deeper into a hole of self-loathing, making her worse to aggravate a bad situation. <br /> <br /> It's a very exciting story, and you can not help feeling that. the sorrow of the lady, wishing she does not say anything, she is simply naive. <br /> <br /> As a TV movie, thanks to Colin and his powerful storyline, it's way above average.
