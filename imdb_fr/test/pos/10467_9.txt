I just watched this movie this morning and found it to be a beautiful demonstration of the richness of faith. Babette gave them another way of looking at life; not a replacement, but an improvement. She shared all she had with those who gave her the little they had. I see the story of God here. He sent his only son to the man. Man can not give anything that would be equivalent to that. So, for our small sacrifice, we have an ultimate treasure and we are transformed because of it. In this film, bickering townspeople are so consumed with a small interpretation of God. Babette showed them that life and God can indeed be beautiful in the full sense of the word. The love that the Son of God has shown to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be richer. Even the film is a metaphor. It sounds slow at first, but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end. It was really a treat.
