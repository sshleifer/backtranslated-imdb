They say that it's always better in horror movies to leave things to the viewer's imagination - to hide some of the details from the viewer to tickle his imagination, to tap into his fears and to let his imagination run wild. his darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> This was not the case when I watched Bakjwi, under the American title Thirst. Now play in some theaters near you. It seems like the filmmakers did not want to spare you the details. There will be blood in this movie and you will try to look away. <br /> <br /> For more information, please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi.html Thank you and I hope you enjoyed reading above.
