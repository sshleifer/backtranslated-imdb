Any movie that has Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the cast should be interesting to watch, and comedic actor Jeff Garlin takes advantage of the tremendous talent he recruited for his debut feature in 2007, a sad comedy about the overweight man who feels out of step with the world around him. Familiar with Larry David's manager, Jeff, in "Curb Your Enthusiasm", Garlin plays the role of James, a 39-year-old Chicago actor who still struggles and still lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can not meet women, but it's the comical way he sees his unmarried status that makes his dilemma complex. If the story seems a bit unfamiliar, it's because the film is partly a homage to Ernest Borgnine's 1955 classic, "Marty", which tells the story of a lone butcher living in the Bronx with his mother poor. In fact, Garlin uses "Marty" as the piece that James is desperate to do because he is so emphatic about the character's situation. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's a kind of love story in this new version of the millenium, and Silverman plays Beth, a voracious and sexually off-the-wall sex server who takes him on a shopping spree. -clothing. Their best scene together is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different aisles. Hunt plays a solitary elementary school teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz musician Ben Webster. They meet accidentally in a record store and then a day of career in his school where he exposes his sexual neuroses in front of a class of freshmen, including Pen, the daughter of his best friend Luca, played by the look-alike. Dakota Fanning. little sister Elle). In camaieu stuck and looking a bit like Jerri Blank, Sedaris plays the school counselor who talks to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca, a retirement home director, and his scenes with Garlin have an easy rapport that makes their friendship easy to believe. Mina Kolb, actress of the character, plays the role of pixilated mother with courage and courage. <br /> <br /> There are also unexpected cameos from the teenage idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (do not ask ?? but the staging is funny), as well as very abrupt passages from the director Paul Mazursky (as a snaky director, "Smear Job"), Tim Kazurinsky (as an unsuspecting victim of this show) and Dan Castellaneta (as the owner of a bustling troubleshooter). With his sad episodes of insecurity and self-hatred, Garlin's comic sensibility resembles that of Albert Brooks, and informal dialogue at its best reminds me of "Modern Romance" and "Defending Your Life". The only persistent problem I had with the movie is the pace, some scenes stretching longer than necessary. The problem is most evident in the first half when Garlin tries to set the right tempo, and the absence of real conflict adds to the sluggishness. Anyway, he manages to capture the feeling of desperation that is felt when you tell him that life is not what it is supposed to be, that another might be out of reach and a balanced diet of junk food The hood of the car is the only thing that is safe in terms of gratification.
