Susie Q. is one of those rare and sweet films that give you a feeling of warmth. It's sweet-bitter, but healthy, and his characters are fun and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the hug shot that would bother me after five minutes, but I was wrong. That made me tear up from time to time, and his plot was enticing, making me take root for the good guys. I loved the movie and I still remember it today, 9 years later !! I highly recommend it to EVERYONE, and the film is family oriented, so you will not have to worry about inappropriate content. In fact, if Disney showed more movies up to Susie Q., it would be the most popular family channel in the world. Now, if only Disney wanted to show it one more time! ^ _ ^ Go Susie Q. !!
