I consider this film one of the most interesting and entertaining films of all time. It contains so many extremely intelligent thoughts that anyone who thinks that the film is awful has not understood it and is not able to recognize very deep philosophical themes, which appear in it (in all 3 films of Schneider). Several German and European universities have conducted studies on how Schneider sees things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and one of the jazz musicians in Germany (maybe in Europe). It is mainly inspired by the great M.Davis and T. Monk. So, if you do not like it, it's good, but do not try to convince others that it may be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you were to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are ready to really look into the art of H.Schneider, you will have to "surrender" yourself.
