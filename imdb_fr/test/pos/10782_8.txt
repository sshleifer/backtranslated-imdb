Oliver Stone, always ready to make political themed films, creates another one here. "Talk Radio" is vaguely inspired by the career of Alan Berg, a radio broadcaster in Denver who was murdered by white supremacists. In this case, the character is Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian), a talk show host in Dallas who likes nothing more than annoying people who call. the racists. And things can get hotter than everyone else realizes. <br /> <br /> Bogosian's performance gives a slightly comical tone to an otherwise serious film. I really liked the scene where he hits a calling redneck. Certainly, I would not call Oliver Stone's biggest film ever, but it's a good reference at a time when the media is becoming more and more concentrated. The good performances of Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help.
