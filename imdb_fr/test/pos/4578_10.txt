I like money! I came across this brilliant film in a local video store last week. I did not know what to expect. I brought him home, set up the player and then my journey into stupidity began. During the first viewing, I laughed a lot, not laughing loudly. It was only during the second viewing that the film really started to take me and the humor was so much funnier. It reminded me of Austin Powers. First, watching it went, then the real pleasure started talking to people, talking only about each scene and its editing. I'm watching this movie to all my friends, to everyone I know. This film could very well be one of the most accurate "Future" movies ever made. This film represents more than 84 minutes of entertainment, it is a warning for the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, the fantastic spirit that brought us Office Space gave us a vision of life in the automated future. The dead humor of Luke Wilson as "medium" Joe has further improved the film. Watch this movie, then once you're done, read more! WRITE more! Think more! For the future, if not for yours!
