I just watched a program for the first time recently - the two hour "kidnapping" program. I do not know why I did not do it earlier? James Caan is remarkable and quite credible as the honcho in chief of the 5 * complex in Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> It often happens that programs like this one have one or more programs that are either really boring, or seem to have been chosen because they have to be related to the producer or director. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not the case with this program. With Caan, all the main and supporting actors are attractive and credible. Invited actors are well chosen. <br /> <br /> The stories I saw are interesting and the show also has a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining program, and I hope it stays. I do not know how I managed to miss it so long, but plan to do it from now on.
