If you watch this film, you will quote it and refer to it for a long time. I have not seen Dolemite for years, and I still quote it to this day. It's a real classic. It's so abominable that it makes a hilarious sight. Every line of terrible dialogue is totally incredible. Each wobbly drew a work of art (?). And every blow and blow so badly executed. You will not believe your eyes. That's all I can say. If I understand how fascinating this film is, I will not be able to stop and I will go well beyond the limit of 1000 IMDb words. <br /> <br /> Please watch this movie, please. You will be in a state of crisis. 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
