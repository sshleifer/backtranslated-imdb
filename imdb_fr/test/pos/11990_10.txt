I am in a large minority here. I did not like the original caddyshack much, except for the duet hunting / murray scene and Rodney's jokes. Okay, break it up: Rodney vs. Jackie - both Jewish and have a similar sense of humor. Rodney is a bigger and more distinct name. Jackie has an incidental and more observational approach to her jokes and is more "up yours" in this sequel. Jackie's attitude towards everything is memorable and somehow inspiring! his quick lines and his overconfidence have left me wanting to be able to express myself in this way. Rodney was good, but he did not have enough, and he was more "face to face" and dismissive. Jackie, in a rare movie aspect, makes a perfect sub for Rodney (go, a gun-shaped hair dryer?!?!) really, look at the little things! <br /> <br /> stack vs. knight - both play very well at snobbish yuppies. Ted Knight, despite his wonderful television and film career, is a little bit older. but it meets the snobbish requirements of the room and we want to see it fall. Ted looks rather weak and boring, playing his anger and his frustration as great, while the stack is more incidentally sneaky and vengeance; you really hate it and like to see it constantly fail. Stack wins with me. <br /> <br /> murray vs aykroyd- well, both had great vintage SNL-style scenes with an ever present and enjoyable chevy chase (ty webb). I liked the murray / chase a better one. Murray plays his big annoying and talkative character with obvious improvisational skill and is adorable - but annoying. and the same can be said for aykroyd. both become boring after a while, but it's a tie. <br /> <br /> I really liked Part 2 during the first one. These are 2 totally different mood movies. The first part is more humorous drug / bathroom / sex with a cast full of big names. The second part uses golf as a backdrop for a comedy genre that "sticks to the rich" and makes the working class feel better. Script of the 80s? Yes. a little far-fetched? yes, but was not the first? an insult to the sport of golf? yes, it's a movie. thin story? yes, it's a comedy with humor, not "dances with the wolves" !! In addition, Part 2 has a much better soundtrack !! PLEASE DO NOT WAIT THIS IS A SEQUEL AT PART ONE! IT IS 98% OF ITS OWN FILM AND SHOULD NEVER HAVE THE NAME 'CADDYSHACK'. That said, I'm a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it's a great 80's entertainment exponent with quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON !!! to all gearboxes - lighten up! it's a great comedy of its own. Randy Quaid was wonderful, Jonathan Silverman was wonderful, heck, everyone was !! all that talk and now I want to watch it! I think I'll do it
