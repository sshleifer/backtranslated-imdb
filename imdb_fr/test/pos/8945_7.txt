A humorous trip into the normally dark funeral business. It's easy to watch, and even offers Blethyn & Molina to steal a scene from an old Fred & Ginger movie. Walken is a zealous competitor from Molina in the corporate sector, who is trying to bring a new style to an old Welsh city. We see some very amusing examples of the "new style". The plot thickens with the fact that Pugh is having an affair with Watts and suggests to him to make Blethyn. Meanwhile, Molina rekindled her feeling of long suffering for Blethyn and convinced her to simulate her death so they could flee to the South Seas, and dance their days together. During the "false" funeral, Blethyn learns the infidelities of her husband and prepares his revenge. Look at it to see what funeral should probably be - a celebration of life!
