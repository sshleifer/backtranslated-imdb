Watching The Wagonmaster will probably not cause deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford movies, such as The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and The Grapes of Wrath, among others, fear and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a train of Mormon cars go to California. Along the way, they meet a healer whose mules have fled, a group of bank robbers and Navajos. There is a lot of adventure and excitement on the track, and the film is filled with pleasure and beauty. The music is absolutely beautiful. The landscape, still in Monument Valley, is as beautiful as it has ever been. Plus, how can you go wrong with James Arness? The Wagonmaster may not be one of John Ford's best-known films, but it's still a must if you have the chance. 9/10.
