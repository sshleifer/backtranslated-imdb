Can a film be too faithful to the book on which it is based? Judging from the 2007 adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's huge salesman in 2007, the answer is rather ironically "yes". Like many, I was fascinated by the book, an impressive first effort of the African-American writer / doctor. The same is true of director Marc Forster ("Stranger Than Fiction") and screenwriter David Benioff ("Troy"), who pay meticulous attention to the most significant details of the story during the 127 minutes of film. Yet, the homogeneous tapestry of sincere events in Hosseini's novel often appears episodic and truncated, as Forster and Benioff sincerely strive to remain faithful to the whole story within the prescribed deadlines. Part of the challenge lies in the way Hosseini carefully used symbolic acts to bring literary symmetry to what is now a three-act story, a technique that may seem somewhat artificial on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, filmmakers are doing the most important things as they should, including giving the viewer an intimate look at a hidden culture previously portrayed by CNN reports, ensuring authenticity by making characters speak in the Dari dialect of Persian language and capturing emotions. entanglements of complex narrative. The first part of the film takes place in 1978 in Afghanistan, before the Soviet invasion and the eventual takeover of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of a wealthy businessman named Baba, and the devoted Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Connected by their mutual love for the kite, they are as thick as thieves until a tragic event separates them irreparably. Unable to find the natural courage of his father, Amir is paralyzed by his guilt for not saving Hassan from an indescribable act committed by a trio of local brutes. Forster makes palpable the ethnic tensions between Hazara and Pashtun in Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> After the invasion by Soviet troops in 1979, Amir and Baba fled to the United States where the story tells their story nine years later, in Fremont, California, a suburban enclave of Afghan emigrants. Baba is reduced to working at a gas station and operating a kiosk at the flea market. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and gets married. This is the least interesting passage of the film since Benioff's treatment pays little attention to auxiliary characters such as Amir's wife, Soraya, and most importantly, Amir is portrayed by necessity as a reluctant young man, weakened by his esteem. self. The last section continues twelve years later, when Amir, after the publication of his first book, is summoned by a Taliban-dictated Afghanistan to save Hassan's son from the Taliban, to be forgiven for his cowardice for years. before. True suspense and fear are generated in this part of the story as shocking revelations and old acquaintances come back to haunt Amir on his journey. <br /> <br /> A British actor of Egyptian origin, Khalid Abdalla (the chief hijacker in "United 93") plays the central role of Amir as an adult, a stimulating role in the to the point where he must convey a constant sense of shame and a loss of self-confidence until the end. The other professional actors are doing better - Shaun Toub (Tony Stark's savior, Yinsen in the current "Iron Man"), as Baba's trading partner, Rahim Khan, who holds the key to the truth; Atossa Leoni acting quietly like Soraya; and best of all, the Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi who brings pride and dignity to Baba. Three young professionals have been recruited into the Kabul school system to play the key roles of the child, and they are all very good. Zekeria Ebrahimi takes up the toughest challenge as a young Amir, and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is poignant as Hassan's almost catatonic son, Sohrab. But it is Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada, with a lunar face and a sad look, who will break your heart as a young Hassan, especially in the devastating scene of throwing grenades. It is fair to say that his performance is comparable to that of the young Enzo Staiola in the classic film "Bicycle Thieves" by Vittorio de Sica. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are well done, especially Roberto Schaefer's own cinematography (convincing Western China). substitutes for Afghanistan), Alberto Iglesias' evocative score and even CGI effects featuring kites in a turbulent flight. The 2008 DVD contains a series of extras that begin with an insightful commentary by Forster, Hosseini and Benioff, although some of their dialogues seem rather forced. There are two features included - the first is "The Rider's Words" of 14 minutes, which focuses on the link between Hosseini and the story and development of the novel, and the second is the "Pictures of the Runner" 25 minutes "", a more standard look behind the scenes of production The extras are complemented by the original theatrical trailer, some previews and a Hosseini PSA on how to help Afghans in a time of crisis.
