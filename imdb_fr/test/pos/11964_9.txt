When one thinks of Soviet cinema, one generally thinks of Eisenstein's propaganda masterpieces or Tarkovsky's gloomy meditations. These are great movies, but in general this is not the most entertaining content. However, the countries inside the Iron Curtain have apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states. In fact, from the 1930s to the 1970s, forty of these extravaganzas of songs and dances were made public by many adorations. However, they are completely unknown in the West, so this documentary tries to remedy this situation. It's a fantastic job to show these films and put them in the proper cultural context. Despite the fact that I have never been a fan of musicals, I found this documentary completely convincing from beginning to end. This proves that, no matter how many movies you see in your life, you just fly over the surface of what's going on. <br /> <br /> As for film clips, they are very entertaining. While some musicals are blatant propaganda showing the workers singing how much they enjoy working under the regime, some films (especially the most recent ones) seem rather accomplished from the point of view of production. Plus, they are all very campy because of their strangeness to my western eyes. There are some similarities between them and the American musicals that I'm used to, but the presence of the government's strict application of the message gives them a surreal advantage. They certainly do not look like western musicals. This documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films I have seen in recent memory, and absolutely must-see for all movie buffs.
