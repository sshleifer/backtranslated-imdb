I must admit that I liked this film and that I did not find it totally misogynistic. It could be subtitled, three ways to see LiV Tyler. Three different men become obsessed with the same woman and tell their story to very different characters: a man (John Goodman) tells his story to a priest (the very funny Richard Jenkins). For Goodman, the character of Liv Tyler is a character idealized. holy, the second coming of his holy wife Theresa.For the character of Paul Riesers (who tells a story to a shrink (a beautiful and discreet performance of the great Reba Mcintire), the character of Liv Tyler is simply an object of sexual fantasy Finally, Matt Dillons, a rather obscure character, tells his story to a hit hit parade played by Micheal Douglas.The three stories of this obsession are told simultaneously and are all fun .. Finally, the film ends with a point culminating strangely funny.I will not give.
