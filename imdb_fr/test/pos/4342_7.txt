The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far from the Paul Kersey of the original film. If you remember the 1974 film, then you will remember that Kersey was a "Conchie" during the Korean War and that he was physically sick after his first execution. Ten years later, Kersey seems to have learned hand-to-hand combat and mastered anti-tank weapons in his spare time. But I'm going to forget this blunder because DW3 is the best suite, lowlife garbage bags are shot, burned alive, teeth broken and thrown to death by middle-aged housewives with wide brushes. Yes, I know that gang members are multiethnic and they deserve credit, but even if they are not racist, they always murder scoundrels who deserve everything they get from Kersey and innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy when you have Paul Kersey, an anti-tank rocket and a group of senior retirees to recover the streets of the underworld. Paul Kersey, greet you sir
