He brings an innocence to the role, especially in his reporting (where he normally interacts with Richard Attenborough's voiceover, playing the so-called scriptwriter / filmmaker).

We must not forget the wonderful characterizations given by Spike in the original book. <br /> <br /> I could say that the film is a bit too long or that Elliott Gould's Irish accent left something to be desired, but would only be minor points and would not take anything away from excellence of this film.
