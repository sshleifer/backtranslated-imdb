As an adult, I am grateful to have taken this film by chance as a teenager. During this time, I had family problems. This particular movie managed to capture what I saw of a closed world. How much peer pressure is too much? In fact, I had to buy this movie because it reaches me on a different level than most movies that try to reach an audience. How far can an individual go for social acceptance? Who is the "bad" crowd? Teens find it difficult to find the answers to these questions, but in the end ... who is the "pack leader" if there is to be one? Is it the strong? The beautiful? Maybe the person we all seem to like? Is it the moral character? As for the film, the actors worked together as if they were predestined. I only hope that more directors and producers will try to create a work that touches us all as this film happens to me. I wish I could vote more than ten, because this title deserves a lot more.
