I bought this video on VCR tape in a goodwill store for 50 US cents. I took a lot of videos that I bought back to sell to other people after seeing them, considering the cost of renting 50 cents. He's the only one who will never come back. It's an explosion of artistic talents, colors and sounds. I do not know if I should call it circus, dance or both. It's bigger than life itself. They will only be able to do this for a few years in their life. They are the interpreters for the interpreters. If Gene Kelly and Burt Lancaster were alive today and saw them live, they would be impressed. I would lend it to others to watch, but I know that if I do, I will never get it back.
