Breaking the Silence or "Race Against Fear" (1998): Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickaryous, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson ... Director Joseph Scanlan, script Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis and Phyllis Murphy. <br /> <br /> This is another film from Lifetime, made exclusively for television, released in 1998 and directed by long-time TV director Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by real events, this is very similar to the majority of Lifetime films, a cautionary tale for women, sensitizing the hidden predator within the family (a mother, a father, a wife, a husband) and a mentor ( a teacher, in this case, a coach). The little-known actress Ariana Richards (she played the little girl at Jurassic Park) delivers a very convincing performance as a high-level track athlete, Mickey Carlyle, raped by her coach, Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller), must to suffer in silence nobody believes his story, except of course his own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter are fighting to put Kurt Ansom behind bars. The film hangs out a bit, is ultimately predictable, sometimes too melodramatic for the drama itself, but is really powerful in the end. Ariana Richards' performance is of the day soap type, but she is the strongest of the cast. Her facial expressions, her body language and her play in general are realistic about how she, as an aspiring athlete, idolizes her coach, is in turn raped by her and must now live with shame, trauma and fight him more in court. William Bumiller plays the role with a kind of duplicity, although it is far from subtle. He has already mistreated other star athletes, who remained silent, reached the summit and proved themselves innocent. William Bumiller, a lesser-known actor than the others, has never played such a role, but overall he achieves a credible and solid performance. It is particularly disturbing to see him in this role because he is the main sexy actor in all he does, including in lesser-known films and in the soap opera "Guiding Light". The only real problem I had with this movie is the way the movie is structured. At the opening of the film, we see the coach Ansom about to rape Mickey, informing us immediately that this guy is useless. But that makes character development and story weak. If the first scene was rather the sequence with the opening credits in which we see Mickey running / jogging in the city on the other side of a lake, we would have a better development of the character because we do not know this coach Ansom, while seemingly interested in the success of his star athlete, is really a dirty job and we would have seen Mickey idolize a person she thought she knew, then have had a rude awakening when she realized that she was mistaken about it. Director Joseph Scanlan is no stranger to TV drama (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, The Outer Limits, Lois And Clark, Earth Final Conflict, and films like The Nikitta Woman, and in 1996 Scanlan made another film , Lifetime, similar to "Stand Against Fear" (1996), he manages to report the gravity of the event, we are really disturbed by the coach who hides around the showers where he violates his own pupil. are graphic and should be watched by adults to the public, but its message is clear: Sexual predators and rapists are not always alien and may take different forms, and their prey may even include a high school. the fight against violence against women and urges women who are silent victims to testify and to fight so that rapists do no harm to others. very negative reviews, this film does a great job in conveying its message and should be given to mothers, girls, hi school students (men and women). As serious as rape is, staying silent when it happens is even worse.
