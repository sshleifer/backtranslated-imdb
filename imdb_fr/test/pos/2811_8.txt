Hmm, is it fair to compare the message of Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Saved By The Bell ,? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is it fair to give this movie a rating of "10"? Hahahahahaha ... it's funny. This movie was not so horrible, though; better than I expected. Movies designed for television are often very similar. Many of them have the same feeling. He had the same feeling, but it worked well that it was another tortured woman who must have the bard in the final story. Before I started, I envisioned Ms. Thiessen as a Vixen-type seductress 90210, but she was as innocent as Kelly Kapowski, which was refreshing. Eric Close surprised me by playing his role really well. With decent writing, the director has achieved a pretty good and convincing performance without being at all cheesy. Overall, it was a bit interesting, certainly better than most TV movies. My note: B-
