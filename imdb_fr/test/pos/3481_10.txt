I just watched a film that, of all rights, should have been used as feed for a second-rate MOW on Lifetime ... but trust the Irish to prevent it from being anything but saccharine. The configuration is anything but SCREAMS "Here's a message about what is REALLY important in life", but the execution was part of "Let's see what we can really do here." <br /> <br /> This helps James McAvoy (Rory) and Stephen Robertson (Michael) are two fantastic actors. While Rory is portrayed as the almost holy - regardless of language and attitude, he is the "life force" of this piece and could easily have been unbearable in his ultimately "benevolent" attitude - McAvoy is holding him sufficiently strong to keep him from being too nice. But the revelation is Stephen Robertson as Michael. Not since Leonardo Di Caprio in "... Gilbert Grape" that anyone who captured so perfectly a person suffering from such an affliction that I began to believe that he was really an actor suffering from cerebral palsy. And his eyes ... God, he can tear you apart with them. <br /> <br /> This film is, to paraphrase Rory, really incredible. Go see him. Take a box of Kleenex and enjoy every well-deserved tear ... and laugh.
