delicious!! In simple terms ... Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen seem to understand each other or maybe they are too good. This could be her best performance as an actor and Aparna's as a director. Yeah maybe better than Mr. and Mrs. Iyer. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, the older sister of Mithi (Konkona Sen). Shabana Azmi made the most of the character of Anjali because she had to play the strong, responsible and arrogant role of an elder sister taking full responsibility for her family. Aparna Sen has beautifully created the character of Anjali, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, her love for her family. <br /> <br /> Mithi's behavior was not at all minor, you can expect this from most Indian directors assume this role. Looks like a lot of research has been done to understand the role of Mithi, a schizophrenic. When, sometimes, Mithi is a sweet and normal girl, she also scares you when you show her sick..the two sides have been beautifully judged and played .. trust me, that sometimes reminds you of the girl in Exorcist..not this scary though .. Overall..Beautiful work of Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
