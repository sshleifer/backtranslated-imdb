The success of SCREAM gave birth to a new wave of horror movies. I'm happy with that, as a big horror fan, and I liked most of these new horror movies. BOC is a big horror pack. Colorful, fast and original. I see this film rather as the opening of a new trilogy (a bit like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) because it brings a new twist. Instead of focusing on the relationship between the little doll and the killer, here we have a twisted movie about couples. We have nice young lovers who contrast with the crazy doll-sized lovers. Very inventive!
