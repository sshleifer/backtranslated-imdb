This is one of my favorite books and I remember watching this series and loving it a lot. Unfortunately, I have never seen it reproduce or have been recorded on DVD, but it has had such an impact that I have never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> The main characters were perfect for the roles, especially the charming Bryan Brown and The Australian scenes did not correspond at all to the book, unlike the movie version of Virginia McKenna which was totally missing this part . <br /> <br /> I agree that the character of Gordon Jackson in Strachan is entirely different from the book but it is still excellent. For your information, "MOLEY75" "Strawn" is the Gaelic pronunciation of "Strachan".
