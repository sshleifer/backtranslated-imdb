"Talk Radio" is my favorite film of Oliver Stone, although he has made several excellent ones, including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of "Talk Radio," a cinematic extension of Eric Bogosian's burning play that was based on the actual story of a talk show host from Dallas. Working with director of photography Robert Richardson, Stone transforms what could have been a tedious exercise into a startling ideological battle that presents a radio station as a war arena. Bogosian is devastating when Barry Champlain is the victim of violence to torture and conveys the contentious and destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-hatred. Alec Baldwin, as his boss Alpha, finds the perfect note as a crazy man to hit by a guy he helped to feed the monstrosity. Ellen Greene is fantastic as a sweet ex-wife of Barry who ends up becoming another target of her vicious personal vitriol. Stone and Bogosian fill each frame with interest and each line of dialogue with a sweet poison and sharp ambiguity. John C. McGinley, Stu, Barry's Technical Selection / Technical Producer, presents a hilarious and precise performance, like the great Michael Wincott. The film is a flawless and underrated masterpiece of superb writing, impressive acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. Stewart Copeland's score is also brilliant.
