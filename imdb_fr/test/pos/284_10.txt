With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses, it was in my opinion the best series of David Jason. <br /> <br /> Coming right after her debut on TV on "Do not adjust your decor!", these 13 episodes reveal a comic calendar mastermind not seen since the old days of silent cinema. In comparison, Porridge, Open All Hours and this horrible series "Lucky Man" did not get close. <br /> <br /> I think Jason banned the rehearsal of the show because it showed him brutally. Shame on him. A new generation deserves to take advantage of this. The series has actually flopped in the ratings, but it's probably because it was shown against "The Brothers", broadcast on the BBC at the same time, before the VCR are commonplace. <br /> <br /> BTW, I just noticed that his long-suffering assistant, Spencer, was played by Mark Eden; Alan Bradley near Coronation Street. I'm surprised he did not try to murder Edgar Briggs !!!!
