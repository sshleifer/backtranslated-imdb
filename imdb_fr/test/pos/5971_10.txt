If you have a chance, see this Russian (how should I call them: jewels, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), War movies like this, or Auroras here are calm, or Proverka na dorogah ..., see American war films, or international productions, those with allies and Germans, etc. Or even worse, watch the Italian war movies. Everything that comes from the West will seem superficial, artificial, ridiculous compared to Russian films. I am so impressed by the quality of the aforementioned Russian war films that I can not find the words to praise their overwhelming superiority over Anglo-Saxon war films.
