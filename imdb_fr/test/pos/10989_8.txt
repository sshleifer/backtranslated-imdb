I found this move beautiful, pleasant and uplifting. At first, the local sites of the film, which was shot here in Buffalo, intrigued me. Later, I found myself lost in the power of the film. How to repay a gift from God? The characters' ability to rise above their basic natures and respond to God's touch has warmed my heart. The whole audience applauded the conclusion of the film. I came out of the theater, joy in the heart and hope for the human race. What more can a movie do? Hollywood, I hope your attention. America loves positive and optimistic films.
