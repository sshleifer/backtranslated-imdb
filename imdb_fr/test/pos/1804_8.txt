Valley Girl is an exceptionally well done movie with excellent distribution. Even though the dialogue is a little dated now, when the movie came out, it was very trendy. To date, I know many people (including teenagers) who can not form a sentence without using the word "like". This is without a doubt the legacy left by this film. A score of 8 has been awarded to this excellent film.
