BROADCAST NEWS begins with a series of short vignettes that are a clever way to start a story about television presenters who have no idea what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> In a speech to a group of journalists, all of whom are bored by his presentation, most leave. When the last one is out, the co-host of the event will say softly to HOLLY HUNTER: "I do not think there will be questions / answers." Subtle line in a discreet comedy brilliantly written, a farce on the anecdotal aspect of the anchoring televised. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM HURT is the inept news anchor who works with HOLLY HUNTER as a network presenter. Hurt desperately needs help with the correction reports and Holly refuses to bite the hook - at first. He knows he's only able to look good, but he's not a journalist. It turns out to be a quick study as long as its headset works and it receives all the direct information from executive producer Hunter. <br /> <br /> Holly's other main friend (ALBERT BROOKS) helps her by providing information that she sends. hurt. Of course, she is in conflict with her feelings for the talented Brooks reporter and her attraction to the presenter of pretty girl Hurt, who has her own alliance with a nice staff member. <br /> <br /> You have to wait twenty minutes. before the movie ends to know with which man she will meet. Brooks tells him that Hurt is the bad one, because he represents everything against which she is opposed. In this unpredictable comedy, we do not know with whom Hunter (the neurotic heroine) will find himself. <br /> <br /> As it should be, HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS have all been nominated for Oscars (Brooks as supporting), as well as the film itself and director / screenwriter James L Brooks. In total, seven well-deserved Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> The scenario does not opt ​​for a conventional happy ending - and, in this case, it is the only flaw of the brilliant scenario. I felt cheated and a little dropped by the nostalgic conclusion.
