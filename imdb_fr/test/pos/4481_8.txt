I recently came across a TV show from "Passion ...." (after missing the first scenes). Currier must be congratulated for having the vision and the courage to bring a tale as strange as Balzac's on the screen. I am grateful to all the actors and the film crew who contributed to the production of such a complete film. It must have been hard to shoot so many scenes in the desert. And I can not understand how his coach persuaded Simoon, such a beautiful performance of the leopard. (This announcement evokes another thrilling adventure, "Naked Prey"). Why is this film not better known? I hope I can find it on video.
