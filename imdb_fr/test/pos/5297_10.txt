Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli shows its wonderful touch that animates and infuses life in every little action of the Ponyo characters. When Sosuke puts his little boat so carefully to catch the goldfish, you know you'll have a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are interesting and you really like them. They remember other stories visually. Riisa seems to be an adult Nausicaa with a son. An elderly woman in a wheelchair remembers the witch in Howl's castle. <br /> <br /> The presence of the elements, the wind, the rain and the sea with its big and powerful waves, is so strong that I think it was never mentioned in any way other movie. It's a simple story, vaguely inspired by "the little mermaid" and that touches the audience's heart, just like Totoro, the real masterpiece of the other Miyazaki. <br /> <br /> An instant classic, with an excellent soundtrack and a catchy song in the end credits. Do not miss it.
