I saw 'NSNA' right after watching all of Roger Moore's films and I must say it was so good to see Connery again. He proves forever that he is the one and only Bond. <br /> <br /> The film itself is not really a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth watching. The jokes are much better here, the effects are funny and interesting, Connery is Connery and Brandauer is really a good villain. But von Sydow is simply lost and the score is not often good, and some scenes seem rather useless. <br /> <br /> 7/10 \ 2.5 / 4 \ 3+ (1+ - 6-)
