Four Friends is one of those movies that you will see without any waiting, to find you in search of a loop. You sort it out, but then you hear Ray Charles's song "Georgia On My Mind," and vague images and feelings start to twinkle to the edge of your consciousness, then you remember that crazy movie that you laughed and cried almost at the same time. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so memorable? First of all, at least for all who have experienced this, because it captures so well the tone of the times - its disappointed hopes, its successes, its sincerity and above all its emotional roller coaster ride that leads to a poignant nostalgia. And then, the acting is so amazing. Danilow, all the anguish and passion, Georgia, as hard to grasp as a wisp willpower ... but enchanting, nonetheless, and Louis, the charmingly disabled roommate to resell who is attacking life with enthusiasm and takes every moment with an ironic smile, because he knows too well that it may be the last. <br /> <br /> How long have you seen a movie that really interested you in the characters of the story? Even if they were far from perfect? The film presents people whose choices are not necessarily praiseworthy, but who never moralize, it allows us simply to appreciate the human condition in all its diversity ... even the minor characters have a well-defined personality and a story that's why this film seems so real, even when some actions and reactions may seem exaggerated ... because it's life, when you think about it. And why this movie engages you with a complexity that is defined by the character. Really an amazing and satisfying experience.
