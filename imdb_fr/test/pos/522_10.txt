I like to see Linda Blair play again in a "horror" movie. I had been disappointed with her in almost everything since the movie "Exorcist" (which I loved). What was going on with all those nasty "B-movies" that she did? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, David Hassellhoff, all I can do is laugh. He is not made to be a horror movie actor. David must stick to "Knight Rider" or "Baywatch". <br /> <br /> All around, it's a great movie. Even for the eighties, it was a great movie. There is horror, action and drama. It's a moment of suspense and I loved the way Linda Blair was revealed.
