<br /> <br /> Giorgino is a strange, dark and obsessive object; the casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminded me of Edgar Poe's tales. It's probably not a masterpiece, but it leaves us with strong images, good music, fear, sadness, confusion and a phrase that says it all: wolves come. GIORGINO is now completely forgotten and, when it came out, nobody seemed to appreciate it. It's a shame. If you ever have the chance to see that, well ... try it.
