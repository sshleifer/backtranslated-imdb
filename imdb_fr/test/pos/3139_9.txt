Wagon Master is a very unique film among the works of John Ford. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was developed by Frank Nugent and the director's son ?? Patrick Ford has become a screenplay, and because of the director's personal opinion of him, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one that "was closest to what I wanted to achieve," saying does not mean a bit, but as Ford once confessed to Lindsay Anderson, his favorite was nevertheless My Darling Clementine and no other. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master has all the ingredients you would expect to find in a John Ford movie. Wonderful casting offering its best, you do not have major stars, except the most "fordian" of all actors ?? Ben Johnson. Strange little characters, who provide obligatory comic relief, and Wagon Master has some, such as Sonnette Ledyard (Jane Darwell) in her shooting, but her concerts are very inspired. And finally, legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth stint after Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache and She wore a yellow ribbon. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two cowboy friends, Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr) being hired as wagon masters or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers heading to Silver Valley, a place that looks like a promised land. On their way, they are joined by the very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women, who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. They are heading in the same direction simply because they have recently been driven out of the nearest city and have no other place to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens until they meet Cleggs, a dangerous family gang consisting of a father and his three sons fleeing the marshal of the city where they recently committed a murder and a bank robbery . <br /> <br /> Master Wagon is nothing more than a pearl in a necklace of John Ford's wonderful westerns. A must see. 9/10 <br /> <br />
