"Quai des Orf√®vres", directed by the brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a film to cherish because it is one of the best representatives of the French cinema of the post-war period. Mr. Clouzot, by adapting Steeman's novel, "Longtime Defense", shows his genius in the way he defines the story and that connects all the characters of this extremely satisfying film which, as DBDumonteil pointed out in this forum , shows how influential Cluzot was and how much the next generation of French filmmakers owes to the master, especially Claude Chabrol. <br /> <br /> The black and white cinematography of Armand Thirard has been beautifully transferred to the DVD Criterion we recently watched. Working with Clouzot, Thirard makes the most of dark tones and shadows in most key scenes. The music of Francis Lopez, creator of light music and operettas in France, works well in the context of the film, as the action takes place in the world of music halls and nightclubs. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet, considered a police detective, is perfect in this role. It was one of his best appearances on screen for an actor who was a pillar of French theater. Jouvet understands the mechanics of creating his police inspector, who is wiser and can take a closer look at the souls of his suspects and ultimately steals the show from others. In an unfair comment from a person on this page, Jouvet's inspector is compared to Columbo, Peter Falk's detective. Frankly, and without disrespect to Mr. Falk, it's like comparing a great champagne to a good house wine. <br /> <br /> Bernard Blier is perfect as a jealous husband. Blier had the kind of face that could be associated with the passionate man that his wife Jenny Lamour woke up in him. Martineau is vulnerable and does not act rationally. he is an easy suspect because he has committed everything wrong in the midst of a crime he did not commit, but all the evidence shows the opposite. <br /> <br /> The other big character in the film is Dora, the photographer. It's clear by the way she interacts with Jenny, where her real interest lies. Simone Renant is tragically attractive as a troubled woman and makes a huge contribution to the film. Suzy Delair, playing Jenny, is seductive as a singer who suddenly goes from obscurity to celebrity and attracts men like Brignon, the old lover. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best shots made during his distinguished career and will live forever, because he has gathered all the elements.
