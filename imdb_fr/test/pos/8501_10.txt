Denis Leary can certainly be funny and smart at times and he is always nice, but it takes the cake! This show showed the genius of Leary. <br /> <br /> The Job takes place in New York. Leary plays the role of Mike McNeil, a hard nosed detective who is married, has an occasional drug problem and has a girlfriend. McNeil has a serious attitude. So many things dripping in it. In addition to McNeil, the neighborhood is filled with fun, interesting and friendly characters. An excellent casting too. All the episodes of this show are really funny and addictive. The linings of this show are everywhere. You will hear them after hearing about them and will laugh a few minutes later. The cases handled by the polling station are something other than the nuns of the stripper, a situation of hostage in a bathroom and many others. This show was too good. Maybe the legs have grown to last a lot more seasons. <br /> <br /> The last word: A great show. I miss this show a lot. All episodes of this show are great. You even get belly laughs ... a lot. ABC made a big mistake in giving the ax. Too bad, Leary did not relaunch the show for cable TV. Yet, I give this show one of my highest recommendations. Really a unique show.
