WEEE is always very fun! Like most of my friends, we had seen this movie on HBO when we were young and we had been looking for a copy since. When they finally reissued it a few years ago, we organized a Midnight Madness party ... and the film held up well. Of course, it's pure cheese, but it's still a lot of fun. If you do not see MM when you were young, you might not appreciate it today.
