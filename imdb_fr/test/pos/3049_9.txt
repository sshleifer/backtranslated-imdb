This film spellbinding me tonight. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it without interruption. John Voight, this cast of unknown black actresses and, above all, children, has made it a great way to spend the evening of Sunday. How wonderful to see the early work of this veteran actor and the excellent portrait of Mad Billy by Paul Winfield. I do not see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn plays the role of superintendent badly. Who would they choose? Acute character actor, Charles Lane? Although his career is commendable, an actor such as Lane would have depreciated the role. Cronyn was a great choice for the game. I will count this film as a treasure to remember.
