Although for most of us, sex appeal is a variable quality, I do not remember a movie that did for me what it does. It transported me to a terribly familiar realm of nostalgia and desire. All the compulsive attractions, the uncertainty about the outcome, the palpable fear and excitement that accompany this state of excitement are exacerbated by this film. So French and what I consider daring! Whatever your orientation, I think the danger of pursuing your desire is at the center of our concerns ... much more, say, than with Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut".
