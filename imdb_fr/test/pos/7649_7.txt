Not having heard of this film, it was a surprise when it was recently aired on cable. Gary Ellis, the talented director of "Tough Luck", does wonders with the screen play written by Bill Boatman and Todd King. The film involves the viewer from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Archie, the young swindler at the center of this story, has been involved in all sorts of minor crimes. In fact, we are witnessing a confrontation from the beginning that makes it leave New Orleans as quickly as possible. He finds himself in the carnival led by the mysterious Ike. Archie cracks for Davina, the woman he should have remained wise. The result is a fatal judgment for Archie, who then becomes the object of a double crossing. <br /> <br /> The director must be congratulated by the cast of Norman Reedus, obviously loved the camera. Despite his nature, we feel for him because we know that his heart is in the right place. The beautiful Dagmara Dominczyk is perfect as an exotic Divana dancer who, despite her love for Ike, leads Archie to fall with her. Armand Assante is barely understandable with the thick accent he speaks during the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> "Tough Luck" shows a new director, Gary Ellis, who shows he's going to do bigger and better things because He knows what he's doing.
