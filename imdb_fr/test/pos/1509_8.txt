I could not help but savor the whole principle of CAT IN THE BRAIN, because it explains conscientiously that the director was getting more and more crazy seeing people murdered from films he had shot in the past. Even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or dispensing a water faucet generate a horrible butchery from a movie. The director Fulci plays himself, directs GHOSTS OF SODOM (?) And does not seem to be able to deprive his mental integrity of perpetual murder. He asks for the help of a psychiatrist who uses Fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people, hypnotizing the director by making him believe that he may be responsible. <br /> <br /> This is obviously a film that mocks in a fun way. like Fulci, while exploring the themes of how such a craft, which produces so many deaths and destructions, rarely untamed, could shape and shape an inheritance. The film presents roughly a recapitulative story surrounding graphic violence continues with every possible means of killing a woman expressed in gruesome details. Hitchcock was never able to direct, nor probably to want. The wildness of the movie compliments Fulci's mental state of Fulci (.. I know) during the current period. Reality and cinematic fiction have merged and Fulci can not find any way out. The end (explaining the old clich√©: "It's just a movie") could not work better than here. Fulci's boat says Perversion (.. excellent touch) and he sails .. I can only wish that this is his last film because it is a perfect match if there is one. David L. Thompson is the disturbed psychiatrist who plans to kill his adulterous wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy is a policeman Fulci fears that a family is murdered by his demon. <br /> <br /> The film's ultra-violence features many unique ways to take a fool's head, such as the door of a trunk, a scythe, a chainsaw and a hatchet. The most brutal violence arises from the ugly activity of the chainsaw when a corpse is shredded (how a gardener's chain saw fits perfectly into a nightmarish hallucinatory sequence) is beheaded! The opening scene with the puppet cat torn apart, feasting on Fulci's brain, is a howler. The scenes that cross in the movie, with horrified Fulci, are obvious, but I could not help but enjoy it anyway.
