It's awesome!!! There is no partnership like Errol and Olivia. there love is authentic! I'm 24 years old and yet this film is as captivating as I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is an underrated genius, his direction is so radical, so broad, and yet so intimate. the last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn) and his wife (Havilland) almost made me cry (not easy for a guy 24 years old !!), so heartbreaking. there is also a deep implicit Christian message here, the faith that Custer has to take your glory with you, as well as the trust and fidelity of his wife to the point of letting him go, so that he fulfills his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians of some massacres. There is no film that deals with these problems like that. a must for anyone who wants to look inside this defining moment in American and military history. patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew that Erl Flynn was a star and De Havilland was a screen legend. This only confirms my suspicions that they are among the greatest!
