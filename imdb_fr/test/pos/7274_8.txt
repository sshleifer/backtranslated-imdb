Oh, what a freshness to see a vision of England in the 18th century with mud, pox and gallows ... and accompanied by a delicious techno soundtrack. This is the story of the mistreated motorist Plunkett (Robert Carlisle) and Captain Macleane (Jonny Lee Miller), a gentleman with the horror of penalties, and the way they come together to steal aristo pigs. Plunkett is a tough guy, but MaCleane is far too polite for that, and so becomes "the gentleman bandit". He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) (who to be frank is the only weak part of all shebang) and wants to impress her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are fantastic. Large, colorful, beautiful historically innuurable togs. Alan Cummings gets all the best leads and the best lines like Lord Rochester, sporting a very different eyebrow piercing of the 18th century. The music oscillates between glorious choirs and techno percussion, which does not interfere, as you think, in a historical film. The scenario is fast and full of modern familiar words; Mercory Ivory, it's not. There are hilarious parties, disgusting parties, sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat-and-nibbling-your-nails, but the whole thing is hiding and is wonderfully entertaining all the way through. These are incentives for cinema. Do not miss.
