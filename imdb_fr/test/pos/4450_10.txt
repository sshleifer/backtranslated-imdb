I have seen this movie five times and I do not get tired of it. There are traces of the genre "giallo", but also in a living Italian landscape, where ignorance and superstition are more lethal than any serial killer. With an excellent location (sometimes reminiscent of Fellini, sometimes the Taviani brothers), a good characterization and some of the biggest genre actors (including the great Tomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), it's not about the euro-trash, but a masterpiece that should be discovered from generation to generation (It was recently hailed by the Cinémathèque de Paris during a double tribute to Lucio Fulci)
