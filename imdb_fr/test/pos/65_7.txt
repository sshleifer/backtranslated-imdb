I'm a big fan of Julie Andrews and I just watched this for the first time on DVD - the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that he was ranked G. How did they get bedroom scenes, a seduction story, two striptease acts, and a war / a shot / blood in a G ranking? ? Bizarre. I would give him PG-13. <br /> <br /> Other than that, I really enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The game was great. The scenario was a little weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled by a good dialogue. There were too many scenes "do not speak, I just walk" for me ... I would have liked to see the relationship between Julie and Rock flourish, so that intense love is more credible.
