Imagine the most depressing winter you've ever experienced: gray instead of white, no snow fights and certainly no paradise. It is Finland as described by "Frozen Land". This film follows a group of people whose lives are strangely linked to those of others and whose results exceed anyone's nightmares. Yes, most characters are defective, as only celluloid characters can do - completely annoying and frustrating to watch, but for whatever reason, you want their luck to be taken into account. <br /> <br /> Frozen Land offers a glimpse of the Finnish mentality that, despite its depressing spirals, manages to restore a certain confidence in humanity. More than Kaurism√§ki, to say the least.
