But both of them never knew how far they would go to seal documents for a living and since they are both amateurs. Both betrayed their country for top secret information. <br /> <br /> Directed by the late Oscar-Winner: John Schlesinger (Believers, Eye for an Eye, Midnight Cowboy) has made a character drama of interest to men on the wrong path in life. Oscar-Winners: Hutton and Penn are both extraordinarily good in the film. The film is sometimes funny and sometimes quite disturbing. David Suchet almost steals the show as a man working for the Soviet Union. This image has a familiar distribution in the secondary roles. It was quite underrated when it was published. Despite good reviews from some of the biggest movie critics. This image is actually based on a true story. There are some flaws in the story, like these two main characters, but overall, it's a movie that deserves to be seen. Based on a novel by Robert Lindsey. Oscar-Winning Scenario: Steven Zaillian (American Gangster, Hannibal, Schindler List). (**** / *****).
