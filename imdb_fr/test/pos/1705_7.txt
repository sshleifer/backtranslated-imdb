I have mixed feelings about this film, especially because it compares to its forerunner, <br /> <br /> "An American Werewolf in London". This film had funny moments, it was even more a horror story than anything else. This updated version, which is currently taking place in Paris, does not have this "advantage" at all and is not just part of the same class ... but it has some good things that the first film did not have. not and overall it's always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> So, aside from the "werewolf purists", most of them think that this film is pure crap compared to the London version. I liked it even though I agree that "London" is preferable and that I prefer this version too. <br /> <br /> The first 30 to 40 minutes of this movie are strictly played for laughs, including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. It also presents the main female character, played by Julie Delpy. I do not see enough of this actress. She does not seem to make so many movies, or at least the ones I hear about here in America. This French actress has a face of classic beauty, so the film earned him points to have it in and she looks great. <br /> <br /> When the horror begins, it can get scary and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of blasphemy of this film, unlike the first: no words f nor name of the Lord in vain - incredible! <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of sexual remarks and there is a scene with a guy missing bars tied to a cross that was blasphemous for me. The soundtrack is heavy metal that does not appeal to a man of a certain age like me. This film is much more about twenty years old, if it can help someone. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining ..... but do not expect it to be up to the first movie.
