When I was a child, I remembered this show, but I thought that now, the series could be a little old-fashioned. Well yes, but for me, the show is more retro (and very funky music). <br /> <br /> This show is usually well written. I think it's a travesty that this show was canceled after a season, especially when this show was more popular than Incredible Hulk. <br /> <br /> I think fans should ignore the mediocre special effects and enjoy the stories. <br /> <br /> This next sentence contains spoilers: My favorite episode when I was a kid was when there were two Spidermans fighting each other in interesting ways. A similar idea is concocted in the movie Spiderman 3. I liked the ideas of this show that some will hate. I think Stan Lee was not a fan.
