Klatret Â© sen (Catch That Girl) is really a great movie! It's a "happy" movie. I watched this movie at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan) on July 12, 2003. There's Action + Adventure + Comedy + Shudder + Happy + Romance (Love Triangle of Cute Kids!). You must see this movie. :)
