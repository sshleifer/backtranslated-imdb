Maybe it's a children's movie ... maybe I will not let my 9-year-olds watch it! So whoever says it's a hmm movie ?!, It's a teen movie, I agree .., so then back to the movie this is a boy who can very well lie .., so good that in the end, no one knows the truth or lies . Anyway, it's a nice movie to see a beautiful game on the screen, I vote an 8 for a screenplay and a story ... I think they write a short lesson to writers ... "The truth is never overestimated".
