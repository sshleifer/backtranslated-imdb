Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a Long Island housewife who fled her marriage when she discovers she is pregnant. She plans to go to the heart of America and start from scratch. On the way, she takes a friendly hitchhiker (James Caan) who calls himself "Killer". Soon, she discovers that the "killer" is a damaged brain and, by taking him in her arms, she has unconsciously assumed a huge responsibility. They drive to Nebraska, where Sara finds a job in Killer at a roadside reptiles farm. It's here that Sara meets Gordon, a local policeman, and everyone goes terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> It is a powerful drama about people disconnected from society, alienated by their choices or their limits. imposed by others. Even with such a low budget and a very free attitude, the film is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex and divergent role and there are times when she plays an impressive role. One of my favorites is when she's on the phone phoning home to her worried husband the first time. It's a scene so tense at both ends and, in every little gesture and inflection of a word, we talk so much about it with so little. Then comes the character of 'Killer' played by James Caan. This character is different from everyone I've ever seen him play and he behaves well. This is one of his best performances because he is very sober and moving. <br /> <br /> The way Coppola develops characters using dreamlike flashbacks is very clever, adding a kind of fragmented view to all of this. Fast, graphic and stand-alone flashbacks contrast well with longer shots of some crucial scenes. In addition, as this film was shot in the eastern United States, it offers an interesting and authentic look at America in the late 1960s. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many other movies with Mrs. Knight, I only know her more recent work on TV, usually playing a beautiful nagging mother or an old woman. It was great to see her so young, beautiful and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. It's also a pity that James Caan has been called "tough guy" for the rest of his career, as this film proved he was capable of much more than that.
