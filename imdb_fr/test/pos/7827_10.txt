The first time I saw this show on Australian television in the late '90s, I ignored it, thinking it was just capitalizing on Kevin Costner's movie, "Bodyguard." But then, I caught an episode and would have liked to watch it from the beginning. The partnership between Sean Pertwee and Louise Lombard was so well played and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining. It was not an exaggerated TV show that, it is said, spent most of its energy exploding things so they could put this clip in the ad to attract the public and not broadcast to another level . The show plunged into the lives of the two main characters and that's what made it interesting. The stories of each episode were also well written with interesting stars who were good actors. And of course, there was a lot of action and intrigue, which is always good. But what was great was that there was humor and that it came naturally from the characters, it did not seem artificial. It was British, but in the good sense of the word, and if this show was made in America, it would probably be on DVD now. I do not know why the British TV production companies are not interested in broadcasting this program on DVD. It was a great show and deserves a DVD release.
