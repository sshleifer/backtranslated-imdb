As a fan of Bills, I was originally bored that they make a movie about the Bills and the loss of four superbowls. But once I started watching, I felt really connected. It was really nice to see the "Bills" win the Super Bowl, and I have to say that for a TV movie, it was really very well done. Gil Bellows as QB and Jon Voight as a coach from the old school did a very good job. 8 out of 10
