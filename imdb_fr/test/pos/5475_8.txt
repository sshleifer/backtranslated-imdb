Wolfgang Peterson directs this thriller in which Clint Eastwood plays the role of secret service agent Frank Horrigan, who associates the wit to a psychopathic malignant (John Malkovich) in a game of cat and mouse involving the protection of the president. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) keeps in touch with Horrigan, teasing the agent, with discouraging remarks about his abilities, as well as the protection of presidents by the secret services. Constable Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) tries to keep Horrigan down; but he is very strong to prevent Leary from executing his assassination threats. Very good FX and fast pace supports the plot. Eastwood and Malkovich are superb. Russo has a way of getting your attention. Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole complete the picture.
