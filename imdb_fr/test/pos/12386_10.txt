Ok, I'll say it. This film made me laugh so much that it hurt me. This statement may shock some of you who may think that this film is nothing more than a waste of film. But what most people do not understand is that this movie was supposed to be bad and insolent. I mean, did people really think that a movie about a killer snowman was destined to be a masterpiece? Just look at the "scary" hologram on the movie's cover and you'll find your answer. Instead, like the original movie Jack Frost (which I found just as funny), this film proved to be a heart-wrenching journey into the depths of a corny dialogue, bad liners and horrible special effects . And everything is done to make viewers laugh. It certainly worked for me. <br /> <br /> For example: Anne Tiler (to her troubled husband): What makes you frown so heavily darling? <br /> <br /> If this piece of dialogue does not work make you laugh, then you have serious problems. Who in his mind would pronounce these words in real life? Of course, no one because it must have seemed ridiculous! Take a look at this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and hopefully you'll see what's so funny about Jack Frost 2.
