Although it was a nice nice cartoon, they did a lot better after that, like Carrotblanca. It almost looks like the first feature of Star Trek, which would have been welcomed with open arms and cheerful anyway, just to exist. It's really a patchwork of old pieces with a few touches, but nothing special. It reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in places and the end is priceless. Available and definitely worth looking for just the novelty and the good pieces. Recommended.
