Dude, I've never laughed so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I was expecting a youth hostel-style movie, the smile came back to me even at first. This movie-in-the-movie shows a stabbed "victim" spoiling the entire scene until she finally "dies". His exaggerated reader and his amusing reaction tell us, viewers, that Mute Witness is not a typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The main character, the dumb American makeup artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful and talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. His performance is excellent. his character can not speak, so the body language and the emotions on his face must compensate. And, oh, my boy, she did a wonderful job. Her sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or fianc√©e or wife of the "director" (Evan Richards). They were both very funny most of the time. I'm not going to tell you more, but the scenes that followed the bathing moment, with both of them, the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were just brilliant and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The plot is twisted towards the end, perhaps deceptive at some point. But do not worry. Such a delicious movie can be seen with your family or with your boy / girl / friend.
