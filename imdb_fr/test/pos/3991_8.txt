Warning - This movie contains incredibly graphic images and should never be seen by children. <br /> <br /> The artist to whom this story is addressed is actually a good Korean painter who has risen from the lowest to greatest painter. Unfortunately, in many ways, this guy was also a fool in many ways. This was partly due to his artistic temperament and what might seem boring was simply his demanding nature in art. But at other times he was just a drunk idiot, especially when he was about to become a great artist. At the end of the film, his annoyance, aggression and useless cruelty seemed to have diminished. Although all this has not made him a particularly nice man, it is important to film so that we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. <br /> <br /> I really found the film fascinating and I loved the way real artists were shown throughout the film (as in LUST FOR LIFE). I would really like to be able to show this to my students (I teach at an art school), but I can not because there is just too much adult material. Yes, there is nudity, but what is even more problematic for all audiences (especially the younger ones) is when, hmmm, ... I do not think IMDb will even allow me to describe this happened, involves body fluids. Not only a nasty and disgusting scene that does NOT need to be seen, but a reason to prevent junior from watching this film, which would otherwise be wonderful. It's a shame.
