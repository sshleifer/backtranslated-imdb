Normally, I'm a typical "goose bumps" girl, but after watching this movie (on YouTube, of course), my outlook is different. And also, I did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer had made another film about a community of insects whose garden of the city was threatened by humans (cigars and cigarette butts lit, not, etc.). ), and how a brave young grasshopper named Hoppity saves the day and wins the honey bee's heart; I like the beautiful Mrs. Honey. You know, after watching the movie, the insects reminded me of some of the "nervous insects" of Don Bulth's Thumbelina. And among the songs of the movie, I love "We are a couple at the castle;" when I sing this song, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> This wonderful film is the second (and last) feature from Fleischer Studio. The film was originally due out in November 1941, but since Fleischer's rival, Disney, released Dumbo a few weeks earlier, Paramount changed the date in December of the same year, but Mr. Bug unfortunately fell into a trap. realized terrible timing. Unfortunate enough to open two days after the Pearl Harbor attack, Mr. Bug was a financial disaster that caused Max and Dave Fleischer to be ousted from the studio they had created in 1919 and reorganized the company under the name from Famous Studios. Another important factor in their departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer no longer talked to each other because of arguments (how sad it was). Overall, I love the two films of the Fleischer brothers. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
