I saw this show when I was younger. It's a very good show to watch. It is very educational for children from 1 to 8 years old. Barney is really great to fool. B.J. is pretty funny. Babie Bop is very cute. The kids are very cool too. This show deals with the learning of numbers a lot like sesame street but different types of shows and characters like Barney the purple dinosaur, BJ the yellow dinosaur with a baseball cap on the head and Baby Bop the pretty green dinosaur with a pink bow. The first one that started is the very old Barney and Friends show. But the second was different to be new episodes. The last one in 2000 was also the new scene of Barney's Park. They also have a Barney show at Universal Studios Florida, where you see Barney, B.J., and Baby Bop, and when the show is over, you can go play, shop and meet Barney. This is a very good show, watch this show when you learn a lot of things you will like about the movie and the live show at Universal Studios Florida.
