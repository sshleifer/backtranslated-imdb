I think the problem with this show that does not get the respect it really deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, after ELR and after Friends. These three sitcoms were the star shows of their time. <br /> <br /> The KOQ came at the end of this special period on television. <br /> <br /> But do not let that dissuade you. <br /> <br /> The King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned. <br /> <br /> Seinfeld it all started and was and is a timeless classic. I have never laughed so much as at Seinfeld. But the KOQ are very close. <br /> <br /> When it comes to laughter, I have to give priority to KOQs only in Seinfeld. ELR must be second because the creation and interaction of characters is more attractive. <br /> <br /> Anyway, KOQs is in the top 10 of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The only other sitcom worth mentioning We are now talking about two and a half men who really do not care about the other four but who stays.
