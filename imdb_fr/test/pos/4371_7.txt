George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I saw so many of his specials and I even had the opportunity to watch him play live. He had a certain cynicism that always attracted me. His last two specials (Life is worth losing, and Complaints and grievances) have lacked a certain spirit and content. George seemed overweight, elderly and tired (not to mention his rehab outing). "I said not to mention it"! Anyway. Life worth losing is particularly tragic because he was overweight, dissatisfied, coming out of rehab (here we go again ...) and was extremely unfriendly. If there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without heckling him, George did it with Life is Worth Losing. It's as if America in the new millennium and post-9/11 was trampling George's mind. The bs had become too big to be managed. <br /> <br /> The return is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! This special is the transmutation completed. George is no longer trying to revive his glory days. He fully accepts his age, age and prospects of death. He agreed to be a crusty old SOB and he loves it. It's better than his previous specials, but far from Jammin 'in New York. It's a bit tragic. His observations are no longer at the forefront of technology and seem more Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George is no longer George. He does not criticize us anymore, but the man from the big castle explains how things were going and how modern life was different. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the previous two stages, but George is not recovering his former glory (if ever). He was reduced from scathing social and political criticism to mainly personal peeves. When he becomes political, he still has something to say. It's highly derivative (especially if you've seen one of his previous works), but it still works, unlike his random speeches that lack relevance outside of the baby boomer generation. The last 25 minutes are the best that this special offer can offer. <br /> <br /> For the moment, I'm going to love the sun and pray to Joe Pesci so that George can recreate himself as a high-tech septuagenarian. It's a 50/50 chance. Life seems to have become more tedious for George and his "art" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction compared to his 2 previous specials, but he is far from his old self. Where is he from here? He may never recover, but perhaps he can still morph / refine this new old man's routine. Here's hoping for 7 more words that you can not tell on TV or at least a windmill he can handle.
