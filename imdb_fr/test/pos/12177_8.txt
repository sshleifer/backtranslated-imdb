Aaliyah hunts all the female members of the cast, including the official lover Marguerite Moreau. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see this movie unfold as Akasha's power trip. Aaliyah is just electrifying every time she is on screen. She is sensual, beautiful and threatening to the power of 10. Watching her take a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin plays the thankless role of the "older woman", which is extremely unjustified. She looks great and at 46 (according to the IMDb), she always looks great. <br /> <br /> The story is unfortunately very limited in terms of plot, we have seen everything before, etc. > The scene of Akasha's death is the most heartbreaking, especially keeping in mind what happened to Aaliyah after the shoot. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a remarkable vampire movie.
