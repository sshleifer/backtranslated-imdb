Shepitko is the wife of Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov, who directed the best-known 1984 film COME AND SEE, widely regarded as one of the most realistic wartime films to date, without exception, notable for its poetic intensity , but I think it lacks the inner complexity of this even bigger Russian film, which looks not only at the graphic exterior horrors, but finds truly inspiring images centered on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect absolute madness which takes place inside these human beings, whose end is simply: INSPIREUSE. Bullets fly and bodies die in a skirmish around the opening credits, where the intensity of the film never fades, focusing on sinister faces, exhausted soldiers with almost nothing to eat, a terrified population under occupation , hungry children with petrified mothers, all immersed in a huge landscape of endless white snow. Like CRANES ARE FLYING (1957), it is about a retired Russian army, a traumatic shock at the beginning of the war, when it was almost destroyed. The Russian campaign was invaded by German Nazis who terrorize citizens, steal their food and force them, under duress, to become their eyes and ears as informants. Russian soldiers are left hidden under forest cover, but are forced to send food supplies to neighboring farms. This film follows two soldiers who, from the beginning, have an almost impossible mission, because there is almost no food left in winter. One is in good health and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin in Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov in Sotnikov, is slowed by a tubercular cough and subsequently a bullet in the leg that lets him almost die, but his partner saves heroically. As they walk through deep snowfall to the knees, crawling in some places without sufficient protection against hard elements, like many other Russian films, nature itself becomes their worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Spoilers !! Everything is reduced to a question of survival. When they arrived at their destination, the farmhouse was demolished and left in a state of rubble, pushing forward on German occupied territory, where the next farm is held by a former Soviet collaborator who fears Nazi reprisals. The partisan soldiers consider him a coward, but leave, where they are finally captured and taken to a Nazi camp in a neighboring town and held as prisoners, with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who helped to hide. The pillar of Tarkovsky Anatoly Solonitsyn appears under the name of Portnov the interrogator, a Russian teacher from a nearby academy become a Nazi sympathizer. The Russians who torture and execute their compatriots are the depths of the depravity of war and Solonitsyn is brilliant in the vile role for which he is perfectly suited. From what we can see, while the Nazi officers were chatting jovially close to each other, he is an outsider even within this group, perceived rather as a kind of macabre macabre immortal who regularly sends men in their graves. The public is not spared from witnessing the torture of Sotnikov, who offers only contempt, while Rybak speaks freely, hoping to save his life, but both are sentenced to death. , although Rybak is offered the opportunity to serve the German Reich as a police officer. The mother, the elderly collaborator and one child are added to this group. They spent one last night together discussing the merits of a soldier's mission: patriot, mother, coward or collaborator. Everyone seems individually motivated by a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov offers himself as a selfless example, trying to confess his guilt to spare others, where the right title reflects his spiritual redemption. <br /> <br /> The next morning, Portnov seems slightly amused, mocking their sudden willingness to speak, but spares no one except Rybak, who changes sides to keep his life, justifying in his thoughts that he is alive, he has at least a chance to escape. But there is no escape - not this torment. What is happening is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace, as we witness the betrayal of war without firing a single shot, as the hanging performance is transformed into a public spectacle, where the villagers at the tip of a gun are obliged to attend. The harrowing pace and intensity of this film is implacable, as there is never a moment without imminent threat, beautifully shot by Vladimir Chukhov (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko), presenting perfectly composed landscapes and many camera movements, very closely, using portraits, especially that of a fierce young boy in the end who looks at the convicts, who establishes a surreal bond with the next generation without any words being uttered , accentuated by the psychologically horrible music of Alfred Shnittke that resembles the transcendent but disturbing monolithic music of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY by Kubrick (1968). The sound design of this film is extremely advanced and particularly modern, where the use of off-screen sound continually exposes the raw nerves of every moment, barking dogs, gales, bullets, close to the nazi gossip. German or sadistic laughter at their helplessness. which only increases the hideous tension to senseless heights. In many ways, resembling Dreyer's THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (1928), total madness is exposed here, the implacable realization that you have no choice, but you are obliged to do it anyway. The end of nightmarish thoughts in the end is expressed without words, where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes, where the voices continue to resonate in the minds of the living as an explosion of endless echoes, while only silence fills the air. brisk, wintry air of dark respect and a deep sense of loss.
