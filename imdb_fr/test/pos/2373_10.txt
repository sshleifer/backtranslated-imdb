I like this kind of movies. Blood, revenge, lots of action, very dark, cheesy and more. But this one does not provide the kind you could expect. When I already saw Kite Birds and Ichi the Killer, I had fun watching them, but why not this one? Dead or Alive: Final is a decent anime and it is not hardcore and do not even expect nudity in this movie. At least, add a little more action to entertain the audience. Even the drama was not so good. Well, I do not want to ruin the movie or the plot. But I felt like Dead or Alive: Final is a bit corny. So, no more to do. I do not recommend this movie to everyone but I recommend it to those who like the anime correct and well directed. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine and University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
