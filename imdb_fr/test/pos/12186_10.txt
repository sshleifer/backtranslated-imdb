I remember not loving this film the first time I saw it, but it grew on me. I like the costumes and the poses of the actors, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. The scenes are very rich and it moves very fast. Every time I look at it, there is something new that catches my eye. Aaliyah as Akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it, but not enough. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Lestat in this film is different, it's not the same character. You can see that the character of Armand has received the qualities of Lestat because I suppose Anne wanted it. But there is no reason to destroy this film just because it's not like books, it's fascinating in itself.
