These immortal lines begin The masterpiece directed by Jack Starret, "The Dion Brothers." The plot centers on two blue-collar brothers from West Virginia (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) who commit theft in hopes of using the money to open a seafood restaurant !! The following is an adventure and many humorous events ensue. The action scenes are all first-rate and consist of shots well done. The latter is absolutely incredible and occurs in an abandoned building being demolished by a demolition ball! The film was written by famous director Terrence Malick and features an early appearance of Margot Kidder. All in all, it's an excellent hidden gem of the '70s and, without a doubt, one of the best action / comedy hybrids of all time. Hopefully the big screen DVD will be available soon.
