I liked this movie since I was a kid and I still do it. At the time, I also always loved Batman, but the real difference is that this film does not date from my childhood. I noticed some scenes in this movie that made no sense, like, "Hmm ... the crowd is angry, Hey, where did they get these tomatoes?" Anyway, this movie is not really serious! "<br /> <br /> The original Tim Burton Batman was also excellent, but it was a little tacky in some places and I did not like All the actors This film has improved on almost every aspect with a superb cast, a more gothic style and no involvement of Prince. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, many fans of the films of Christopher Nolan do not like Burton, claiming that they are more serious and therefore more faithful to comics, I do not think that this is entirely true: -There was never an adaptation of the original concept of Batman, which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years, especially in the 60's (and a bit with Ba tman & Robin) A director is free to choose the type of Batman he will represent as long as it is good. <br /> <br /> My opinion: Batman does not have to be serious. This is a man in a rubber suit with pointed ears. Burton has managed to create a perfect balance between foolishness and darkness that surrounds this whole idea. <br /> <br /> I just watched Nolan movies and I love them (especially The Dark Knight). There is just something in this film that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character a lot more depth and, in doing so, he was looking for an explanation of almost every aspect of Batman. It's a bit too much for me, I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. Burton's films are more theatrical and centered on the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My conclusion is that you should not compare Nolan to Burton's films. They are just different and it's up to you to decide which one you prefer. My respect is for the two directors.
