Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership, in which they work together to associate image and music, scene by scene. Unfortunately, the recording of the sound was a disaster, so for once the dedication to the authenticity of the flames of Criterion DVD. Fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the film on VHS (BMG Classics) with an excellent recording of music (by the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir). <br /> <br /> It's interesting. compare this film with contemporary propaganda films in England, Germany and the United States. Eisenstein's film was shot in 1938, in response to the fear of a German invasion. and Olivier in 1943, when a German invasion of England was still awaited. Both films are scenic, but in different ways. Olivier begins by showing the play staged at the Globe Theater by Shakespeare's own company, then takes us out of the theater in a more cinematic (although still stylized) setting. Eisenstein's film has been cinematic from the beginning, but dialogue and discourse are still influenced by the melodramatic playing conventions of the old Russian theater. This works very well for the speeches of Cerkassov as Alexander, because part of his work as a prince and military leader was to play a role in public. <br /> <br /> In Nazi Germany, the first major propaganda film was the tedious boredom of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, which recorded a huge political spectacle - a large crowd applauding Hitler's raging speeches . The propaganda contained in his masterpiece, the film of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is much more subtle, as it venerates the body of a male athlete with disturbing shades of the myth of Aryan superiority. But German propaganda films in wartime could also be subtle. Urlaub auf Ehrenwort by Karl Ritter is typical. He shows a young lieutenant leaving the men of his company on 24-hour leave before returning to the trenches of the First World War (and almost certain death). Against the advice of the veterans, he accepts the word of honor to return, but he will be judged and courted if he does not do so. Naturally, they all come back (although some boast of having done so), presumably inspiring viewers to similar demonstrations of duty to their country. <br /> <br /> In the United States, one of the best propaganda films of the Second World War was Howard Hawks Air Force. We follow the ill-fitting crew of a bomber who team up to share the experience of the battle and overcome the obstacles to continue his role in the war. For Hawks' films, however, their true loyalty is more to their country than to their country. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein must go back a long way in history to find some sort of Russian military triumph. Ironically, Alexander (like other Russian princes) comes from the Vikings who traveled up the Russian rivers to conquer and rule their own fiefdoms. So he is a conqueror repelling another potential conqueror. Physically, they are not so different (although the actors representing the German princes were obviously chosen for their derisory ugliness and stupidity). But the real contrast is between ordinary soldiers. The Russian peasants are as tall and strong as the nobles; while the German peasants who come out of the shield wall to kill wounded Russians are one foot less than their masters. There is some historical truth in this contrast. The Russian serfs of the Middle Ages were much better off than their European counterparts, as they could still escape into the wild and clear their own territory. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's film also cleverly offers us our first glimpse of Alexander the Fisherman. In the battle with the Germans, he uses his knowledge of ice on the ice as well as his military tactics to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks the wall of the shield, they are forced to regroup and massage on the west side of the lake, where the ice is thinner. <br /> <br /> One of the other pleasures of Eisenstein's film (missing at most audiences) is the historically accurate way he portrays the politics of medieval Russia. Cities like Pskov and Novgorod owe their increasing wealth and importance to trade, which puts merchants in power and keeps princes away until their military expertise and feudal levies are needed to repel the invaders. In the film, Alexander is presented not only as a military leader, but also as a political master, knowing how to wait for his time and make the most of his popularity after the victory.
