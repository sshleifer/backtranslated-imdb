If you are looking for a movie with fantastic music, a nice cast and a story that is not difficult to understand; FAME is for you. <br /> <br /> I have several scenes that I like in this film; some make you laugh, others make you contemplative. I think the editing is wonderful, very fast and often funny. Shure, maybe there would have been more potential in all of this, the whole story stayed on the surface; maybe a little too many characters are involved.But I do not care, because the real stars are ... <br /> <br /> ... the musical scenes! One of my favorites: the hot-jam-jam sequence. This piece is so raw, brilliant and filmed in a special way (handcamera style in "music-hell-raging"), it's just electrifying! This raw energy I miss in current music videos; the only similar energy that I found maybe in Bette Midlers "the rose", all the images of the concert. It's about capturing something "wild" that's going on "really", and that's not perfect. take by taking. <br /> <br /> Thus, FAME is a wonderful nostalgic journey in which the synthesizers are heavy and difficult to use. I recommend it once a year; of course not for everyone.
