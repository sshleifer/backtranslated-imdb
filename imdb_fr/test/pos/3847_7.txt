Walt Disney's 20th feature film was the last to be endorsed by the great man himself (he died in late 1966) and is generally not considered part of their best result. The main problem is that, at first glance, the film seems to be only the feline version of LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961), which are certainly more appreciated by fans. Nevertheless, it is at the same time of an animation and lover of the cats, I dug this rather bouncy mixture in which a pampered pussy (expressed by Eva Gabor) and its three small kittens are thrown in the streets of Paris by the greedy butler of the wealthy lady (Hermione Baddeley). Fortunately, they meet a street cat (Phil Harris) who guides them on their return trip and are helped along the way by a feline jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two friendly dogs and friendly dopey; Meanwhile at home, Edgar the butler celebrates his alleged heritage, while the mouse and horse help feline pets. The legendary artist Maurice Chevalier had returned from his retirement to sing the title song (which includes a verse in French) and Scatman's band was performing a windy number "Ev'rybody wants to be a cat".
