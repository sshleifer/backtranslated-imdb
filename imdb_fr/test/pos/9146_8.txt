If you love vampiric traditions and are a fan of Gothic horror, then you might want to take a look at Soul's Midnight. I did not know much about this movie before I saw it and I did not expect much, but I found the movie fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> With Armand Assante as the leader of vampires Simon Soul stands out from other low-budget vampire movies by fitting himself in a fun way in the mythology of St. George and the Dragon. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure of the budget of this film, but I feel that if it was a little more, they might have really been able to focus on gore and effects . <br /> <br /> If you get up late at night and you're in the mood for low-budget vampire fun, then Soul's Midnight is a good choice.
