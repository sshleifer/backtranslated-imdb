I have often heard people express their disappointment at the fact that Mazursky's "Tempest" had nothing to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion, this is both true and false, but most importantly, it is a bad starting point for proposing a critique. A work of art should never be criticized for what it is not, but for what it is. The movie "Tempest" does not look like a faithful rendition of the piece but, in my opinion, it is faithful to the work of Shakespeare. Tempest is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No, not experimental as a wearable camera and scrambled, but experimental dialogue like exploring the convolutions of a story without worrying too much about box office gains. Mazursky's storm is epic, sad, realistic, joyful, full of life, but above all imagination. The portrait of Philip / Prospero by Cassavetes alone is worth 10/10, and when you add Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, a wonderfully deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, dialogue, music and the extremely suggestive small paintings scattered in the painting . ... I leave my case. One of the best movies of the 80s. Do not miss it.
