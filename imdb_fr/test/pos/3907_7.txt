I think it's one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I've seen most of her films. I saw it for the first time on TV when I was about fourteen and I was so scared. from time to time, and I always appreciate it a lot. I know that these days, this film probably would not be too scary to people. It's just going to show that the movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence over the thirty I like movies that do not show graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you. The cast in this film was first rate. Jess Walton, who played the sister in the story was very good, although her role was rather small. She also starred in a breathtaking TV thriller entitled "Never Never Me Me Again" with David Hartman. I had the greatest enthusiasm for Eileen Heckart's performance as a housekeeper. Eileen was so good as a woman with a very bad disposition.Gorge Maharis who played the husband was quite effective.This story obviously had a lot of so-called errors in the plot, but I love the movie anyway. I highly recommend this film to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence. I gave this film a vote to seven.
