I really appreciate Dr. Who. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not dismiss me as a "science fiction person" because I'm not normally. I understood because a friend made me addicted when they started to watch him. It's really funny, and most often it's fast. Everyone in my family is watching it and it's a miracle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Ecclestion is very good, but David Tennant is brilliant. I think it's because he made the Doctor so manic and it's nice to have that little quirk again in a TV character. <br /> <br /> work like clockwork. <br /> <br /> All I'm going to say is to try. An episode (probably better if you do not choose the second half of a two-part, though).
