It was Bollywood's answer to Fatal attraction and it's a classic movie in its own right. Juhi Chawla was good, as was Sunny Deol, but it was Shah Rukh Khan who did well as a stalker. Since then, he has become a favorite of the Chopra (Dilwale Dulhaniya the Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil to Pagal hai, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). At first, Shah Rukh seems to be a bad guy, but towards the end, you start to sympathize with him. The scripts were great and the songs were diagrams. My favorites are Too mere samne and Jaadu teri nazar. <br /> <br /> After Lamhe's dismal failure, Yash Chopra, an underrated man, fought back against Darr. The dialogues were memorable, the dialog k..k..Kiran is often repeated. Since Darr Yash Chopra has slipped little. Dil to Pagal hai was bad but he bought slightly with Veer Zaara, which was much better. This was the last masterpiece of Yash Chopra.
