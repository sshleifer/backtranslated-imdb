It's an excellent TV movie with a good story and lots of funny moments thanks to the excellent casting. <br /> <br /> The only problem with this film is that it has not stood the test of time as well as it could have. <br /> <br /> Even so, it's definitely worth watching, especially if you're a fan of Alan Alda or Ruth Gordon.
