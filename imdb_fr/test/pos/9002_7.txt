Now, before people start having a breakdown about this movie (those who play rugby anyway), it's a movie! It is a Hollywood treatment intended to entertain the spectators. Therefore, those who play rugby (myself) will naturally dig holes in the choreography of the game in the film. At the same time, it's a decent film that draws attention to the moral and ideas behind rugby. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real team, a real coach and his work helping to guide the right kids. direction to be better people in the future, and is also based on real people who have played for the Highland team. It's just a typical sports film with a character who is lost and ends up finding his way on the right track with rugby support in this case. It's usually a movie that feels good, but has some flaws in terms of how the game is portrayed. However, as I said, it's a movie under Hollywood treatment.
