Unfortunately, every person I ask about this series has never heard of it. I remember it with affection since my childhood (I was not yet 10 years old when it was released). <br /> <br /> My favorite story was "A Story Short". Something in the way the story of "Stone Soup" has been woven into a bigger story wins me every time. And then the storyteller explains why he has no story to tell, and it becomes a story itself. I've always been a fan of Jim Henson, and that's just one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> I add this DVD to my account with Labrynth, The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride. , The last unicorn, Willow and MirrorMask. These are all DVDs that I share with my siblings aged 6, 5 and 4 years old.
