The film tackles the horror here and now of the "restitution" with a multi-actor trans-global narrative of all the people involved. Nobody gets away lightly because we see the blindness of the players as they carve themselves a part of the global game accumulating hate and misery on their "enemies" and on themselves. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the senator's friendly aide (played brilliantly by Peter Sarsgaard) and Washington's real power-seekers is electrifying. Meanwhile on the ground, the new CIA man (Jake Gyllenhaal) is radically changing his attitude towards the new sensation of torture found in the United States. Although his rejection of what he initially tacitly endorsed is a sudden, one must wonder why anyone would call himself civilized will he stand and see someone humiliated and mistreated in this way? The film has few heroes - perhaps the flawed, flawed CIA man from Gyllenhaal is an exception and a necessary indulgence for the film to offer a net of hope. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is not fiction, but an awakening for those who have the decency they have left. The terrible truth is that we in the United Kingdom and the United States have lost the moral plot and this film shows how ready we are to go. All this in the name of freedom! There is a wonderful phrase in the script that says that torture is a sure way to increase the number of our enemies. This is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message conveyed by this movie and start using our power and money smarter !! The message seems to be that all of us who claim that restitution, torture and human rights violations are necessary to protect our way of life are as sordid and stupidly stupid as jihadists and suicide bombers . All praise for the sensibility of a talented South African director, attentive to the blatant injustice of the way power is exercised, and to a host of traditional actors with principles, from the United States and beyond. Oh, and besides, the film has a sting in the tail with the end a clever and provocative surprise (which I will not reveal). <br /> <br /> I saw the movie in a London London. While the preview has not been broadly written yet, I am happy to say that the wave of less than rave reviews seems to be turning around. The criticism of the BBC has been very favorable and they suspect (and I suspect) that a lot of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specs of Hollywood - where the good and the bad are cutouts cardboard-based. Hence the reason why many of the real big movies of the year are more and more independent and / or non-American studios.
