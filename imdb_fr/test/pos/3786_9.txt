It is one of Chaplin's first national films from the period between Mutual's glorious short film and the more mature feature films of United Artists. More opulent than Mutual's films, Chaplin continues his quest for the perfection of his comic expression. Most people forget that the movie is actually Charlie's dream as he was waiting to be sent to the forefront. <br /> <br /> Limburger cheese, used to gas the enemy, overflows enemy territory disguised as a tree. <br /> <br /> At this stage of the career, the great man had become so immersed in the filmic expression that his films give the impression of being made oneself. This is probably not the case, but it still gives a realistic view of life at the front, even if my point of view is ironically humorous. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, familiarity with all of Chaplin's work should be a prerequisite for all moviegoers - do not delay!
