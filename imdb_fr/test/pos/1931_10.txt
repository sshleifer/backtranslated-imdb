Deep Water examines the pressures and ambitions of an ordinary man in a compelling documentary. The testimonials and archival footage are a fascinating insight into the late 1960s and a revolutionary sailing race around the world. The personal conflicts between duty to the family, the person, and reputation can be found in one of the most memorable and touching films I've ever seen. I did not know the story of this story and the drama was directed successfully and clearly. The story is especially respectful to the participants with heroes and villains involved rather than pitilessly exposed. Most of the interpretations are left to the viewer, which allows him to be personally related to situations and characters. This film is a sweet and bitter experience with an entertaining mix of thoughtful suspense, joy and drama.
