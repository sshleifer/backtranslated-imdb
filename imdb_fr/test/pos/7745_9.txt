I rented this gem many times! It is a small masterpiece, certainly sprawling, that takes the viewer of Manhattan to the beauty of the Greek islands. John Cassavetes' on-screen wedding with his real wife, Gena Rowlands, is on the rocks. He finds meaning in an adventure with Susan Sarandon he finds in Greece while their daughter, interpreted in the film role by the very pubescent Molly Ringwald, falls in love with the son of the tycoon of the Greek navigation who is courting his mother on a yacht. neighboring waters. Meanwhile, the immense talent of Raul Julia plays the role of a goatherd living in a cave with his Sony Trinitron. He loves the character Molly Ringwald until he is confronted by John Cassavetes. Everything comes together at the end in a classic closing scene where everything is reconciled. We see Raul Julia, the goat, dancing with his goat. This film is full of mysticism, beauty, young and old love, humor, sensuality, and more. To see him!
