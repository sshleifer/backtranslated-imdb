For a children's movie, it's great. As an adult and mother, I loved watching the movie with my daughter. There is a lot going on in this film. The following * could * be considered a * spoiler * ... Barbie learns courage and learns not to judge others so quickly in this movie. She also learns not to lose hope and control her anger. I loved the sense of teamwork that comes from watching Barbie, her sister and her friends solve the puzzle. There is nothing in the film that I find offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. In fact, I had the impression that the moral messages of the film were excellent and well done. <br /> <br /> The animation was pretty good. I really like the skating scenes and I think they were very well done. There is a lot of action in this movie, so I guess most kids would appreciate it ... not just those who really love Barbie. My daughter actually chose because of Pegasus. She loves horses But she really liked the movie. My daughter is autistic and was able to sit throughout the movie to enjoy. She was very fond of action scenes and all scenes with horses. <br /> <br /> One of the things I thought was that many people are opposed to Barbie (and Ken) because they are so beautiful. Still, I think children, just like adults, love to watch beautiful people and beautiful things. It's natural. As adults, we also like to watch beautiful movie stars. It's wonderful though, that Barbie's character and her "boyfriend" have a lot of personality. Although it's fun to watch pretty people, it ages if there is no substance behind the pretty face. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say it's a fantastic movie for kids and parents will appreciate it too. :)
