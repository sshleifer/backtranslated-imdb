This image does not have big explosions or expensive hunting sequences. However, it has really wonderful performances and an exceptional scenario that puts it at the top of my "list not to be missed". Taylor Nichols and James Remar are great together. The young cast surprised me with a really coherent acting game. Usually, independent images have a weak link, but there is none. Impressive. Go get this one.
