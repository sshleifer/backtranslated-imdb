On June 14, 1905, during the Russian Revolution of that year, sailors aboard the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated by the poor quality of treatment they receive, and more particularly from the meat infested with flies that they are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by the inspiring Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakouloutchou (Aleksandr Antonov), decides that time has come revolution. Thus begins the great classic of Russian propaganda Sergei M. Eisenstein, "Bronenosets Potyomkin / The Battleship Potemkin." gently swing from the side rope on which it was thrown; the corpse of a dead mutineer rests on the shore, the sign on his chest indicating "KILLED FOR A SOUP BOWL;" close-ups of the clenched fists of hundreds of spectators who finally tired of the tsarist regime; a carriage unleashed in the steps of Odessa as desperate spectators watch with impatience (this scene was "borrowed" by Brian De Palma for a particularly thrilling scene in his film "The Untouchables"); the canons of many canons are dangerously razed to the battleship Potemkin, largely outnumbered. <br /> <br /> However, the film itself is better analyzed ?? not like a fragmented selection of memorable scenes? but as a unique film, each scene is truly memorable. Although divided into five rather distinct chapters, the entire film is marvelously well; at no time do we lose interest and we absolutely do not doubt which side we should be sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The film is often called "propaganda" and that's exactly what it is, but it does not need to have a negative connotation. "The Potemkin Battleship" was produced by Eisenstein for a specific purpose, and he does it perfectly in every way. Scheduled by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the 20th century celebrations of the failure of the 1905 Revolution, "Potemkin" was to be a popular film in his home country, symbolizing the revitalization of the Russian arts after the Revolution. It is therefore a bit unfortunate that Eisenstein's film did not work well at the Russian box office, which was allegedly beaten by Allan Dwan's "Robin Hood" in 1922 for only four weeks. Fortunately, despite being banned at various times in different countries, "Potemkin Battleship" performed better abroad. <br /> <br /> The film was also an effective way for Eisenstein to test his theories about "editing". Thanks to a rapid editing and distant shots of the multitude of extras, the public does not have the right to sympathize with individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. Eisenstein briefly breaks this mold, however, in a scene where Vakulinchuk flees the ship's officer who tries to kill him and, of course, during the famous sequence of Odessa Steps, while our hearts beat with horror at the life of the unhappy child. in the landau tumbling. The soundtrack of the version I watched, largely composed of orchestral works by Dmitry Shostakovich, has been a wonderful addition to the emotional impact of such scenes. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest films of the silent era, "The Battleship" Potemkin "is a triumph of phenomenal film production and a major slice of film history. The very exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there have never been violent massacres on the steps of Odessa) are so deeply rooted in memory that we are often not sure of the true story behind the events described. It's a great success.
