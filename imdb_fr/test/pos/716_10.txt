I watch a lot of movies - DVDs, feature films and classics, for example. The night I looked at JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the Internet) said she remembered when she was in high school, that it had remained for all those years. In a somewhat reluctant way, I sat down (with our daughter and our son) and was thrilled from the opening sequence to the final titles. We were all. <br /> <br /> She, who remembered the original, and our kids (aged 18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about could not believe it. Our favorite scene? Without exception, when Peter Strauss strikes his fist with such passion and says: "I would do it again!" He did not advocate violence because it was a crime of defense, but it was so intense that we could not believe it. House. <br /> <br /> Someone please do more movies like this one. UNBELIEVABLE!!
