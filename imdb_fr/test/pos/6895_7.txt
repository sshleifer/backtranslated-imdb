I Sell the Dead is a big sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously. This has advantages and disadvantages. The 85 minutes of the film pass and the film is full of sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes gory, sometimes all three at a time, but the individual pieces are much better than the sum of the parts of the film. <br /> The story, as is, follows the burglar professional Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monaghan). Arthur's crime partner, Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) has just been cut off for murder and one night remains with Arthur before his own head is lost for the same crime. Arthur insists he is innocent of the murder, but he is willing to confess many more crimes when he was bribed by a Catholic priest with Irish Whiskey. (The film is played by Ron Perlman). <br /> <br /> Since the film is a series of anecdotes about the robbery admitted by Arthur, it becomes a kind of anthology of horror - a series of disjointed stories, all linked by a similar cast (Arthur and Willie) and a similar theme (the nightmare). As in most horror anthologies, there is no coherent mythology, because all the mythologies are true and occur simultaneously even when they contradict each other. <br /> <br /> It probably did not help that I saw this movie the same night as Trick 'r Treat, a horror anthology that avoids all the pitfalls in which I sell The Dead. In fact, Trick 'r Treat, conceived as an anthology, tells a more coherent and coherent story than I Sell The Dead, which is a unified narrative. <br /> <br /> The other problem of the film (and I recognize that it is a senseless cingling) is the way the film is played quickly with the story. Grimes is killed with a guillotine. Maybe we could expand and say that he was killed by a Scottish girl, forerunner of the French guillotine, but the Scottish girl was abandoned in 1709 and this film is a hundred years later, once Burke and Hare were mentioned. and they were executed for murder in 1829. The robbery being an industry become obsolete with the adoption of the law on the anatomy (1832), the film must therefore take place before this date. <br /> <br /> I know this question is important we are dealing with a world where all sorts of dead, undead and legendary deaths are possible, but the easiest way to anchor a fantasy To convince the public to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic. to bounce the fantasy. And it's not as if the story of grave robbers, body thieves or resurrectionists (call it what you will) is a boring story. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is that the director of writing, Glenn McQuaid, knows the story clearly. , especially the good pieces. For example, when Grimes for the first time takes Arthur as an apprentice, he correctly explains to Arthur that as resurrectionists, they do not steal clothes to the dead, because stealing corpses is a punishable offense of a small fine, while stealing clothing a crime punishable by expulsion or even death. So, you would expect Wille and Arthur to strip the corpse at this point (and for the rest of the movie), but of course they do not do it. You can accuse the director of ignoring the script of the author, but not when the writer and the director are the same person. <br /> <br /> I'm not right to say that there should have been a lot of dead bodies in the skin. the film, what I mean is that if you want to talk about this quirk in the law and make it clear that Willie and Arthur will follow the law, as stupid as it is, then you have to continue your thought until you logical conclusion. Even if that means that Willie and Arthur end up chasing a zombie in a graveyard trying to snatch his clothes and put them in the empty coffin, so they will not be deported for stealing the corpse's clothes, otherwise Do not mention the case at all. <br /> <br /> Aside from the historical nervousness, I Sell The Dead is worth being praised as a light but fun horror movie that could have been a lot more.
