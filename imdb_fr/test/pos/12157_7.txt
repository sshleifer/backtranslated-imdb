Like most people, "More" only interested me because of the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which turned out to be Pink Floyd's only album that I still listen to after all these years. It was quite surprising to see the film in a local video store, in a digitally remastered version. It was even more surprising that it was a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It's visually very beautiful, especially when the two main characters frolic on the rocks of the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of the soundtrack music, which, as far as I know, is exclusively that of Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a joy to watch the movie with my copy of the album next to me, mentally checking each track as it was used in the movie. Dave Gilmour's short "A Spanish Piece" is the only one I have not heard and several pieces are used quite prominently, including "Cymbaline", "Main Theme" and "Quicksilver". This last track is tedious on the album of the soundtrack but works very well during the sequence of the title of the film, resurfacing at least once thereafter. Maybe now I can enjoy it on the album, now that I have some visuals to accompany it in my mind. <br /> <br /> The plot of "Plus" is a little difficult to take from time to time, especially at the beginning go, when the film seems to be simply a vehicle to demonstrate the haunting of those involved in its production. But ultimately, the film proves that it has much more to offer as the plot becomes more focused. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why does anyone take the heroine, fully aware of the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to answer this question directly, but Stefan's use of heroin seems to be a logical extension of her resolute quest for pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to all fans of Pink Floyd who have an appreciation of the soundtrack "More", largely underestimated. I also recommend it to anyone interested in the sixties counterculture and how it has been portrayed in the media. I do not know how realistic this film is, because I'm too young to have lived in the sixties personally, but it seems to capture the spirit of the time in a way unlike any other film.
