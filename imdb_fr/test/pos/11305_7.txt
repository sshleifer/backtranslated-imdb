My 5 year old daughter is very interested in the Barbie film series. I had mixed feelings about it - not wanting it to incorporate the entire Barbie-doll image and recognize that movies are a marketing ploy to convince young girls to buy more dolls and to make more money for Mattel. This morning, however, she asked me to watch this movie with her, and since it was a lazy Saturday morning and there was not much to do, I agreed. I do not know if the films were made to help commercialize the dolls, which seem to lose some of their appeal to what I heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies (or, more likely , a bit of both) but whatever the case, I must admit - a little to my surprise, it was not bad at all. <br /> <br /> It's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and characters and unforgettable characters (Annika ("played" by Barbie) must find a way to build a "magic wand" to reverse Wenlock sorcerer's spells, including transforming his sister's horse and his parents into stone, the animation here was pretty good - not Disney's (if you think of Disney is the norm to aspire to), but generally good, and although the film is visibly designed for girls rather than for middle-aged men, I still found there were enough twists for me to wonder how it was going to turn out. It's true that there were flaws in the story, or at least logical inconsistencies, but again, you have to remember the target audience, who would not really think about such things. decent family all around 7 / 10
