"Pearl Harbor, buddy." This movie is great! Of course, this does not exactly happen like a multi-million dollar comedy, but the jokes that are thrown at it all the time are incredible. I'm a fool, like "Dumb and Dumber", "Airplane" and "Wet Hot American Summer" and I have to say it fits easily up there. The movies are simply not written with this kind of sporadic comedy. Too many jokes in this movie are such a surprise to the viewer that it is truly surprising that more and more people are not aware of or praising this burlesque masterpiece! Looking at this, you will easily find more than 20 quotes that you will find after ... and after that, you will find even more!
