I like this film...! I saw it on DVD x 1000x and I can not say enough about it. He has it all, comedy, awesome action and amazing stunts / FX. Samuel Jackson steals the show here high time. I do not think there is not a moment where he is in what he is not funny! "Everyone knows that when you make a guess, you make yourself an ass and an umption" !! The f / x are great! The explosion of the bridge / truck is amazing, although the sound is not so great! When Samuel comes out of the truck, the sound is a little off and what he says is priceless! For those who own it on dvd, put the audio in French! It's halarious !!! Even the moments of emotion are great when the villain discovers that the daughter of Sam / Charlie is his, it's great ... This is an excellent film that no action fan can do without ... publicity negative, that kicks !!!!
