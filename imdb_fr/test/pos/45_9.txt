Just an excellent soundtrack. Really nice music. Outstanding distribution, excellent performance in lead. To watch. <br /> <br /> Do not really explain what happened to the neighborhood. You feel that the integration is to blame or that, with the departure of the main character, the neighborhood has disintegrated. <br /> <br /> This film seems well documented and extremely well designed. I particularly enjoyed some minor characters like Jeffrey Wright. <br /> <br /> Cutting off the opening sequence helps to express what vivid, engaging and desirable experience this nightclub would have been with music, food, skipped drinks dancing, gambling and sex .
