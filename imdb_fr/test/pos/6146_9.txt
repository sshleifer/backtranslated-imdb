The journey of Wirey through the last days of the bachelor, littered with flashbacks on a sexually active and diverse childhood. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not a sentimental love movie. It is a film of love, but without illusions. Here, everyone is grown up, not your cup of tea if you want another sleepless night in Seattle or Notting Hill.
