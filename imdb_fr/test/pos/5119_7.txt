This time, the lovable imbecile is summoned as a juror, where a corrupt lawyer notices that he looks like a prisoner who wants to escape, so that both are mutated. Of course, most of the film is a series of gags; In "Ernest goes to jail", most gags are about electricity. I really liked the complete sequence of the vacuum cleaner from the beginning. All in all, the purpose of the movie is just to have fun, and I'm sure you'll do it. It may be the ultimate movie you watch with a bud. It is safe to say that Jim Varney will be missed. You know? FYI: The only other cast member I recognized was Randall "Tex" Cobb, who played Lyle. You must have seen it somewhere.
