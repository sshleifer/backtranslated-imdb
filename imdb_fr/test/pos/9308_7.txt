It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes us through the trials and tribulations of a group of renowned American scientists who confided a colossal task during the Second World War: beat everyone else against the atomic bomb. Sequestered in a highly guarded New Mexico complex, brainiacs are slowly turning the idea of ​​an ambitious concept into an immense reality. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those movies that requires your full attention. It is a true thinker film, not only from the scientific point of view of the development of a seemingly impossible weapon, but also the moral implications of contributing to the large-scale massacre. The characters are constantly torn between this reality and their duty of war as Americans. However, the film is never preached, leaving us free to marvel at the enormity of the inner turmoil these men face. The performances also deserve a special mention. Paul Newman delivers one of his great sober performances as a Pattonesque General charged with delivering the ultimate big stick to Allied forces. <br /> <br /> Where FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY lose much of their traction, it is unnecessarily a romantic component. Dwight Schultz, as head of the science team, wrestles with his affection for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project. Director Roland Joffe has apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story, but the romantic accents are mainly distractions. In addition, it is the interaction between scientists and their military hierarchy that allows us to better understand the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men. <br /> <br /> It's hard not to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. It is a largely forgotten jewel that puts a human face on one of the most intriguing stories in human history.
