It's an extraordinary film. As a play, it is frightening as an indictment against the American justice system. For Brenton Butler, the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws in the legal process, namely that it is not a question of discovering guilt or innocence, but of knowing who is better in the courts. In reality, the consequences of this case go beyond the possibility of an innocent man being convicted or a guilty man to be free. Every citizen has the right to justice, whether it be an author or a victim. But do they get it? The film is well paced, sober and one of the best audience documentaries I've seen.
