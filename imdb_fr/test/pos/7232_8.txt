Once upon a time, Troma, the company that introduced us to movie classics such as: The Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grannies, Poultrygeist, Redneck Zombies and Surf Nazis Must Die, have long decided to adapt Shakespeare's famous play, Romeo and Juliet. This adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding perverted sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, bodily piercing and incest, and she managed to create a strange and hilarious film. Anyone entering a Troma production must know what to expect, and it is an irreverent and perverse comedy that has many political mistakes. Expect many Troma movies and many reused gags (car rollover and head crash). Many people may think that sounds like total crap that only morons would find funny ... they may be right, but they may also need to lighten up and enjoy the madness and the mental numbness that characterizes Tromeo and Juliet. <Br /> <br /> With a superb cast, a fun storyline (by James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), a decent soundtrack, and lots of visual gags, Kaufman has once again managed to transform what's good about the game. and to make it even more disgusting. everyone. Grab some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what it is, an adaptation of Shakespeare with lots of balls. The end. <br /> <br /> 4/5
