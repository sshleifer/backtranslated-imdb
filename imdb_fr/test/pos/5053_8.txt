At the front, if you are tired, the first hour could be slow. The staging of the story has a natural rhythm, without haste - leaving us time to appreciate the kind of daily life and the situations in which the main characters are. Once you have arrived at the climatic segment of the plot, the turn of events will keep you hooked: how things are going to happen, what will happen to our precious Fanda (presented by the veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský), how his Will the woman (admirably interpreted by Stella Zázvorková) treat her, what will happen to the dear friend of Fanda Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka - a matching acolyte in Brodský) and Jára the son with a hidden selfish agenda, blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!) <br /> Vladimír Michálek directed the film sensually with brushes of humor, preserving the insightful script of Jirí Hubac. Thanks to clear captioning, I could see that every "plaintive" sentence of Fanda's wife uttered a sign of "benevolence" visible / buried between the lines - as the judicious judge observed. Fanda is '76 passing at 80 'and the affection of their enduring (endearing) marriage is manifested even in their mocking arguments. His playfulness can be contagious. <br /> <br /> It's about "growing together together" for (at least) beyond the 50s and lessons learned for sons and daughters so they do not take their parents for granted. It may be necessary to rethink if, so to speak, "the home of the elderly" is a means to an end. The film gently screams to live to the maximum of our life. (Hint: it's nice to stay and watch the end credits.) <br /> <br /> We're lucky to be able to see a casual Czech movie. The 2001 "dark blue world" of the father and his son Sverák ("Kolya") was indicative of a pathos. It is good to slow down from time to time and appreciate a foreign jewel: its subtitles, its landscapes, its melodic score and an engaging human story with elegant performances. "Autumn Spring" (aka Babí Leto) is available on DVD. Enjoy!
