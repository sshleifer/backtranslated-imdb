One of my favorite favorite childhood movies. The Chipmunk adventure offers incredible entertainment for young and old. The animation is lively and colorful and the film itself contains some of the best songs ever written in an animated feature film. Who could forget the dynamic "Boys / Girls Rock n 'Roll", the exciting "Diamond Dolls" and the heartbreaking "My mother"? <br /> <br /> This should be considered a nostalgic classic jewel of the eighties. It's a shame they do not make them like that anymore. Most animated films nowadays resort to violence, brutal humor or sentimental porridge ... except of course to the inhabitants of Pixar. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: An incredible and unforgettable adventure for all ages.
