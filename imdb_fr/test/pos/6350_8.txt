This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle way, which distinguishes him from most of the films presenting this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also very talented in "Koma") in a situation that at first sight seems inexplicable. He has been married for 20 years in Ching (the great Anita Mui, in his last role before we were cruelly kidnapped), and this seems to be a romantic relationship. When Ching offers to take care of his and Lam's former teacher, Choy and Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes the film so good is the pace of the director Ann Hui. It takes a while to discover the secrets of Lamsm and all that makes sense. The film is very dramatic and touching. You feel no repulsion at the teacher / student situation, which elevates this film above many people with the same scenario. It's slow, but stay with it. In addition, enjoy the wonderful performance, without glamor but beautiful Ms. Mui. She was and really is a special person and in this movie you fall in love with her one last time. It's worth the time to testify and be right with her.
