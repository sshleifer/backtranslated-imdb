Be careful, My Lovely recently appeared on television on BBC2 at the beginning of the day. So I programmed the video so that it is recorded. I'm glad I did it. <br /> <br /> A man finds a dead woman, he escapes getting blame for his murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow but she does not know what she's taking here. It turns out that this man is a psychopath and a possible killer. He begins to torment her and locks her in the cellar. He then cuts the phone line so that she can not get help from the outside. A young boy who regularly goes shopping for her remarks that something is wrong when he comes to drop it. Finally, the man leaves, acting as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> I understand why Beware, my charming received a certificate X when it was released in theaters. Some scenes are rather nasty at the moment. I also thought that the man was going to do something to the young boy too. <br /> <br /> The casting presents an excellent performance of Robert Ryan in the role of the psychopath, Ida Lupino in the role of the widow and are joined by Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock as the boy. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the scariest performance of Robert Ryan to date. A must see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.
