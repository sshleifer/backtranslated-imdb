"Admissions" is a good drama even if there are problems with the end. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie trying to avoid college. For her overburdened mother not to realize it, she invents poems that everyone thinks her sister with an intellectual disability has written. All actors are first rate, especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both performed well. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. The first is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd. His part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the end. It goes around in circles, which I did not expect with 84 minutes of execution time. On top of that, the movie is definitely worth watching.
