I have seen it a few times and I am completely stuck every time. It's very suspenseful and intense. To describe this sounds boring but it's amazing. This is the kind of movie where you should not miss anything, but if you let it soak, it stays long after the movie. Now, thinking about it, I do not even know what Stone was trying to show us. Just the story of Alan Green? I do not think so. It was a look at ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption and a guy who had just lost his grip. Maybe he had more control than the listeners. I did not like Barry, but I still seemed worried for him for some reason. I did not understand why I could not get it out of my mind once the movie was done. I wish I could see in Olive Stone's mind for this one.
