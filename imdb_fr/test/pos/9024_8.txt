It's an excellent movie for pure entertainment, nothing more, nothing less. It's a nice and vaguely positive film. <br /> <br /> A minor but irritating thing about the movie is that we do not know why Justine and Chas broke up. Okay, most early relationships did not work for one reason or another, but they looked more or less like a beautiful couple. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it's worth watching to escape reality.
