The Lubitsch's Touch is more than ever in this movie. Humor at all times and very subtle. The plot is simple but transformed in a delightful way by the director. The film cut is very clever and adds to the comic effect. A real comedy that does not grow old for a 21st century viewer. The character is finely interpreted by Gary Cooper and especially Claudette Colbert so smart and nasty with poor Micheal in the film. She avoids all the traps of her husband and turns the situation to his advantage, very funny. And no problem, with Lubitsch, there is always a happy ending. A movie for men too confident with women. Do not let your girlfriend watch this movie ...
