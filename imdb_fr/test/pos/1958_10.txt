I hope that the writer, the director, the editor and the composer (and let's not forget the producer) read this ... because their work was really incredible on this film. Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this film. I'm just an ordinary guy who's been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and has seen it about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Every second of this film is moving. Each scene is classic. The acting game is real. The film is honest. You can understand these characters as individuals and not as actors. <br /> <br /> This tale tells of three different murderers at different stages of their lives. The story is carefully thought out and each secondary plot is intertwined and woven, resulting in a message that lets us reflect on the values ​​of good and bad that each of us carries within. <br /> <br /> Crispen Glover, Daniel Roebuck, Dennis Hopper and 12-year-old Joshua John Miller give amazing performances. I have seen this movie about 8 times or more and I am still so absorbed in their performances that I forget watching a movie. It's that good. Great job to everyone who worked on it. Excellent work. <br /> <br /> The music is also wonderfully well matched and haunting. With the chosen cast, the carefully planned arrangements and cadences, the mood and tone, and even the subject, the director made some of the best decisions for a film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This film is true. It's honest It's a real cinematic experience that I'll never forget. You can not be in the subject, but it's something you can not ignore. In the end, it's about people as people ... and everyone can understand that. I recommend this film to lovers of drama, suspense and horror above almost every other film.
