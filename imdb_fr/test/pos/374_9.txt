Safer indeed. Hitchcock is a pervert of all time in the cinema; However, we all know that his perversions are also ours, so we forgive him. And not only do we forgive him but we applaud his clever way of inviting us to an unforgettable train ride. <br /> <br /> I saw Hitch 1953, I admit it, a week before this one, and I put both in the same category as part of his marks. These trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsating his artistic veins that pour psychological drops of blood onto the viewer without leaving any traces of guilt, instead a very subtle awareness of feeling ashamed. <br /> <br /> The pen is always more powerful than the sword and Hitch firmly wrote the most questionable questions with his wrist, then, holding firmly with his hands, he held cameras that always reflected the thirst for blood of peoples (most humans have it), otherwise the comedy would not be primarily a tragic thing. people would laugh would not be so complex. <br /> <br /> Mix all the dark elements of "high society" with a rich psychopath, Bruno, and an ambitious tennis player who wants to be a politician, Guy, the story is one of the very well built and guided by Hitch, inspiring many filmmakers, not only with his intrigue, but with delicate images provoking black smiles and happy nightmares. <br /> <br /> Barely perfect!
