While Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by vengeful murderer Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), his real sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantastic world of his favorite soap. opera. In a state of total denial and delusion, Betty physically and mentally escapes her unsatisfied life in a small town to search for "Dr. David Ravell" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of "A Reason to Love," a soap opera placed in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles. Immune to reality, Betty arrives in Latin America and becomes "nurse Betty" as she tries to belong to the hospital world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, Charlie and Wesley, angry, find Betty, convinced that she is a dangerous witness and that she is also aware of their compromising relationship with Del. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense by opposing the extreme innocence and optimism of her main character. with the obvious hypocrisy and the violence that surrounds it. By clearly defining the difficult life of the protagonist, nurse Betty justifies the tendency of her character to turn away from reality. Thus, while commenting on the popularity of the soap opera in the film, nurse Betty also comments on the widespread dependence on television and its celebrities. In addition, nurse Betty takes advantage of the effective manipulation of the mental state of her protagonist, especially in scenes where she can not distinguish between Dr. David Ravell, the character, and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who plays it. Betty's inability to recognize George as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings that underscore the extent of his delusional state. However, despite these successes, nurse Betty suffers troubling characterizations through which narrative evolves. For example, although Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comic couple, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance that the viewer might have had at the outset. Similarly, although the initial scenes establish Del as a detestable man, the humiliation and violence he endures with his murderers surpasses all the humiliation and violence he caused to his wife Betty. <br /> <br /> Finally, towards the end of the film Charlie undergoes delicate transformations as he develops an obsession for Betty; an obsession that leads to noble feelings of love and ultimately destroys it. As a result, since the roles of the characters as victims are inconsistent, the processes of victimization of the story seem random and insubstantial. In summary, the indeterminacy of Nurse Betty - instead of creating suspense - weakens her characters and pollutes her plot. <br /> <br />
