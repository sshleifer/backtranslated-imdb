CKY team's totally awesome movie ...... (not the jackass boys ..... John Knoxville, Chris Pontius, Steve-O etc. are not in this movie <br />). OK, so maybe they are not the best actors but it's not what you call a serious movie ...... but hey, it's fun and it's totally funny to watch. who does not want to see don Vito disguised as Roman Emperor! <br /> <br /> a must if you like viva bam or CKY ............ an amazing soundtrack provided by the all-powerful HIM, CKY and others .... .. check the extra features on the DVD, especially the free style of Bran <br /> <br /> The number two of the Chinese rap ...... seriously hilarious ..... ...... watch this movie ... you will not regret it ......... 10/10
