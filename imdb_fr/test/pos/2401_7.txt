I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternately. Anger rose in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12-day bombing. And by now living in the country with my parents, who have been living in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we are doing much better now and that it would have been better if the Americans had not waged war here. While watching the film, I learned more about the different types of wars planned by America in Vietnam and the disasters they caused. <br /> <br /> The series seems to work well with interviews with real people. But I do not like that some people give only generic opinions, as the analyst towards the end of the series, I forgot his name. <br /> <br /> There should also be more documentary images, such as life in the military camp in South Vietnam and those in the North (if possible). There is also a sudden change from 1972 to 1975 (I do not know if the in-between was censored, because I watched this series on TV).
