<br /> <br /> SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW <br /> <br /> The long kiss Good evening is another good example of a plague common to many modern movies; it starts with a very interesting concept - a qualified assassin whose memory has been erased regains consciousness of itself - and the initial configuration is engaging but then it seems that the writers do not know very well where to go next and all is lost . paths increasingly confused and / or alienated, leaving the disappointing taste of something that was OK but that promised to be much better. The wicked are remarkably remarkable, and even Jackson's comical trickery is more like something from his time before Pulp Fiction; it seems that Harlin, as in Cutthroat Island, did everything possible so that no one would splash his wife at the time. His character is by far the best of the movie and it only makes you even more frustrated that you could not do better with it. <br /> <br /> However, there is still something about this movie. which, for me, distinguishes it from the ordinary uncle and places it above the average, so right. It's a very subtle thing that I can not quite put my finger on; it is a troubling, cold, dark, even sickly edge, a nightmarish and unreal sensation, a decadent air, a medium drag, which continues to multiply in different ways. It's in dark reddish photography and the almost permanent night that the characters live, it's in Samantha's dreams in front of the mirror, in her vicious eyes and her smile when she's about to kill a man or when she announces how much she will like to watch her nemesis die with her daughter who listens, it's in Mitch's return driving a car as he squirts so much from his mouth that he can barely speak ... I do not know, it's an atmosphere, something that I can not define, but it gives me goose bumps (a little) and makes this movie always oddly intriguing to me.
