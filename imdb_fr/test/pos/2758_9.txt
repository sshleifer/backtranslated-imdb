Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, is not much different from previous games (excluding Tony Hawk 3). The only novelty offered by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is the new level selection and improved graphics. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x features a new career mode, the 2x career mode. The 2x career is essentially a Tony Hawk 1 career, as there are only about five challenges per level. If you missed Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I suggest you buy the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, but if you've played in the first two games, you should still try this one. Overall, there is really nothing new, but it's still very fun to play. If all goes well, this review meets your needs. <br /> <br /> Graph: 7 out of 10 Overall, the clear graphics are not really one of the main features of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x. The atmosphere of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 has changed a lot, and the character models seem a little better. When you come back to Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and 2 on the old PS1, you think these old graphics are ugly. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, the graphics are MUCH improved. The character models are no longer filled with jaggys, the textures are smoother, but not to the maximum. The graphics of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x do not compare to the graphics of Tony Hawk 3, but Activision probably did not want to give Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x extraordinary graphics. Overall, the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they have not exploited all the power of the Xbox. The graphics are beautiful and clean, that's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Sound: 8 of 10 Sound effects do not offer much imagination, but the skateboards that come out of the ground sound good. . The main reason I rated the sound factor is because you do not have to listen to the sub-average Tony Hawk sound because there is a custom soundtrack function. The sound effects are much better than those of Tony Hawk 1 and 2, mainly because it is clearer and all sounds good. One of the main reasons I bought this game is the custom soundtrack. The sound effects of grind are always the same as those of the first two games, slightly modified. One of the major problems with the sound factor is that if the song is over, it will NOT go to the next track, the song you just heard will be replayed. I do not like the soundtrack of the game, but as I said, you do not have to listen to it. <br /> <br /> Orders: 10 out of 10 Orders are the best part of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. 2x. The configuration of the controls is wonderfully comfortable and easy to get used to. At the time of the Playstation, people thought that the controls were the best of all time, but it seems that 2x did a better job with the Xbox control. Surprisingly, it is very easy to use the joystick to perform tricks. Activision did a great job with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x controls. They made the Xbox controller the best solution for Tony Hawk games. You will not be disappointed with the control style, and that's a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Play: 10 out of 10 Excluding the fact that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is essentially Tony Hawk 1 and 2, the game is still incredibly fun. The game factor has been slightly modified. This time, you get a lot more air than in the first two games, and it's much easier to perform tricks. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, each character has three career modes: a Tony Hawk 1 career, a Tony Hawk 2 career, and a 2x career. The career of Tony Hawk 1 is quite easy, because in the first game, you get nothing for the air. The career of Tony Hawk 2 poses the same problem as the Playstation version. The only difficulty that one encounters in the 2x career is knowing where all the elements are, but after doing it, the 2x career is not difficult at all. In the 2x career, there are 3 levels in total and the first two levels consist of searching for secret bands, collecting S-K-A-T-E and doing all that is needed for that particular level. The third level out of three is the level of competition, where you have to get a certain number of points to win the gold. In the first two levels, the secret tapes and the collection of the letters S-K-A-T-E are described in both. Overall, the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x still retains the old Tony Hawk atmosphere. <br /> <br /> History: - <br /> <br /> Fun Factor: 10 out of 10 The Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is by far the most fun game on Xbox today. I played Pro Skater 1 and 2 Tony Hawk and at the time I did not like them, but for some reason, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x is really fun. There is really nothing to say, except that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is by far the best game on Xbox today. One problem is that if you have already played the game once, you will play it a few times, but it will be repetitive. <br /> <br /> Replayability Value: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk 2x Professional Skater provides a great deal of replay value. There is a lot of stuff to unlock and a lot of character videos. All in all, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x has a lot of replay value, mainly because it's a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Best feature of the player: You do not have to listen to the shabby soundtrack of the game. Worst feature: the custom soundtrack is a bit spoiled. <br /> <br /> Final Statement: In the past, many people have complained about not liking Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, because they should stop complaining because you get a lot of play for 50, $ 00. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10. Sound: 8 out of 10. Control: 10 out of 10. Game: 10 out of 10. Story: N / A Fun Factor: 10 out of 10. <br /> Overall Rating: 9 out of 10.
