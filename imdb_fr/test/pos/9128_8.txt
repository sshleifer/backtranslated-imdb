What is the quality of this film? Apparently, it's good enough that they plan to do it again in 2011. Jean-Pierre Melville, who gave us Le doulos and The Good Thief, wrote and directed this film. <br /> <br /> The film is almost silent. They are men of few words, preferring to let their actions speak for them. They respect a code that governs each of their movements. <br /> <br /> There are big actors in this film - Alain Delon (The Leopard), Yves Montand (Jean de Florette, Let's Make Love) and Gian Maria Volonte (El Indio of A handful of dollars and a few more dollars). The film does not shine on them; they are there for the walk that Melville has for them. Melville does the movie; they make it better. <br /> <br /> You see Melville's work in Ocean movies, but they just have the idea. It can not make it work like it did. A great loss in the seventies, but his work remains for our pleasure.
