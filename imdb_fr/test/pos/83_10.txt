Channel zapping one night, I just watched the beginning of this movie and it caught me from the beginning. It tells the sad story of an adopted child, Adam, whose mother left him after birth. The film takes us in his childhood and makes us discover a very troubling fact of Adam's past. I will not reveal more, but it is a very thorough film and will intrigue you for sure. This was one of Jimmy Smits' best roles in my opinion.
