as I said in the other comment, it's one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites. For me, this movie is the second best teen movie of all time. second only to the breakfast club. The last American virgin is perhaps also the most honest teen movie of all time. it's an underrated and almost unknown movie for a lot of people. he arrives on the SCT maybe once a year, but sometimes longer. The first half of this film is a sexual comedy with some honest scenes. then the second half is pure honest, and most of the time serious. with only a few comic scenes. In my opinion, it's the best soundtrack of all time. I had never heard so many good songs in a movie before. There are 4 love songs in this movie which, in my opinion, are some of the best love songs in history. the movie is about a pizza boy named Gary, who is a virgin. hes in high school who has a couple of best friends. his two friends are sex-sarved teens. the first half of the movie is about the whole story of sexual misadventures. who are very funny. Gary is older in love with the new girl at school. he later discovers that his best friend is dating her. he's also cheating on the side. you can feel a lot of the love that gary has for this girl. you can feel it even more in the second half. Gary's friend turns out to be a creep. but his other friend is pretty cool. the film shows how bad people can be. you can relate to a lot of this movie. the plot is like your typical teen sex comedy. but it's so much more than that. it's a very honest film. it's also very 80ish that I like. If you like the 80s or grew up in the 80s, rent this movie. but there may be people who do not like the 80s, but who still love this film. I saw this film for the first time in 1987, I think. it's very fun and very fun. he combines very touching moments with very funny moments. it is an underrated jewel! I have the movie. I like that! I give the last American virgin *** 1/2 on ****
