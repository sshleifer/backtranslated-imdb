It's fantastic! A sick and twisted story of coincidences and deceptions. <br /> <br /> The story is built with meticulousness and ingenuity. It's really a perfect mix: everything goes from suspense to humor and the story is told with a lot of originality ... The film is built like a puzzle that is assembled piece by piece and solves the story .. spectator there are many surprises until the end !! I also had a small impression that the director had been inspired by some of Hitchcock's work. I have seen movies before, where the same event was taking place from different angles, but this film goes beyond that. In this film, everything is built on what happens to a body that appears and disappears and reappears in another place. Each actor in the story has his own secret and we come to realize it in a way that contributes to the assembly of the puzzle ... I particularly liked the scenes of black humor ... that made laugh all the theater ... is a must for everyone!
