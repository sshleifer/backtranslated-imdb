I thought West Point was a nice movie, although I doubt I'm looking at it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as another odious fun young man who has his place at the end of the film. It's hard to believe that Joan Crawford, less than a year after the shooting of this film, has caught the attention of her celebrity, as she looks rather clumsy. <br /> <br /> I would also apply to this film the comment made by another about "Huddle" (1932) by Ramon Novarro. There is a big movie waiting to be done here, but something is missing. The backdrop and the integration of the body were well used, but I was less involved than I thought. Maybe the character from Haines has gone too far or has done too much. His "repentance" did not seem authentic enough; and what kind of message did he send him to play all the games in the final minutes of the Army-Navy game? Where is the "Body" in that? Could as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do everything himself. Moreover, I doubt very much that William Bakewell's weak and puny character has ever had a real-life counterpart in West Point. <br /> <br /> All that aside, the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. This is a good overview of the daily practices of an honorable institution. Fortunately, tradition still means something to West Point, unlike the insipid "traditions" of schools in the Ivy League, not very engaged in recent days. <br /> <br /> As for the score: it was properly martial. But there was a clear overuse of snare drums. Using them to knock on the door, scene transitions, as well as in well over half of the scenes, became quite tedious. It has rather diminished the viewing experience. I was ready to say "I'm getting the point already." <br /> <br /> With that, have fun with the movie, but do not expect an excessive emotional commitment.
