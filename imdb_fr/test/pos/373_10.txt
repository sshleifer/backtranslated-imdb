One of Alfred Hitchcock's three greatest films, with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps", "Strangers On A Train" is as brightly uncontrollable as a ride in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. This is the kind of movie you have so much fun watching, you can not even feel guilty until you have time to catch your breath. <br /> <br /> The best amateur tennis contender Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a strangely strange and grotesque stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages, Bruno knows all about Guy's problems with his bad wife Miriam, and rather happily suggests that they do themselves a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father, who wants to put Bruno in an institution. . Guy laughs, but Bruno does not laugh, as Guy discovers at his own risk. <br /> <br /> It's a good base for a murder story, and Hitchcock gives Strangers On A Train the opportunity to run all its value, with Walker's help in perhaps the greatest performance in a Hitchcock film, including Anthony Perkins in "Psycho". While Perkins makes his mark playing badly against grain, Walker and Anthony are perfectly at home, whether they pamper old ladies at a chic dinner or strangle a young woman in an amusement park. <br /> <br /> What motivates Bruno? Many commentators suggest that his apparent homosexuality finds his happiness in the pretty Guy. Yes, Bruno lights up the old gay-dar, but Guy seems quite happy about the rebound of love with socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest in Guy might just as well be a desire, for someone who marks the world while he lives at home, leaving mom nailing his nails. <br /> <br /> "Oh, I certainly admire people doing things," Bruno purrs, looking like a cat looking at a mouse. "You know, it must be very exciting to be so important." <br /> <br /> Later, Bruno calls himself a "fool", fairly faithful, aside from our basic interest for him, even if he destroys Guy's life with his homicidal interference. It's the ultimate tale of the perverted oppressed. There is a sense of integrity in Bruno, in his stubborn dedication, which commands our respect and which Hitchcock plays brilliantly. When Bruno moves away from the scene of his great crime, am I the only patient in the world to be really happy for him? I do not think so, yet Hitchcock keeps the story on a trajectory good enough for us to realize how much we have fallen. We do not want Bruno to win, exactly, but we appreciate his momentum as he tries. <br /> <br /> Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. Hitchcock has always managed at least 2-3 good sets of film sets; Here, you have about twenty at the theme park alone. ("20 Big Shows," says the neon side at the entrance, and they're not kidding.) Scenario, work-camera, captivating tennis match, Ruth Roman's breathtaking figure, that's too much for a film can contain. Even Granger here makes his passion for youth with a more laughable plausibility than Gregory Peck has ever succeeded. <br /> <br /> You can call it a clinic but a "clinic" seems too dull. "Strangers On A Train" is a really fun game, which leaves you with a clever punch to the tail when you realize that you are always looking for the wrong stranger. Heck, I'll resume this ride in a second!
