I borrowed Sarah's three films from a friend and watched them sick in bed for a weekend. I really appreciated each one of them. I appreciated the fact that the last film gives a glimpse of what Caleb and his sister looked like when they grew up. In addition, I liked the report of the song "Billy-boy" that was heard in the credits of the first film, entitled "Sarah, Plain and Tall". However, the only thing I did not like at Winter's End was the youngest girl. She was a very cute little girl, but she was too witty and childlike compared to other children, even compared to Caleb, a talkative but still good-natured, when he was younger.
