Even though "The Beginning" showed that we would still have "classic" files, Drive showed that X-Files would explore new territories. They start by giving us a unique teaser on Drive, with the images from the camera. It was an interesting transition from television to real events. I would have liked even better if they had kept this report camera for the entire teaser and not cut inside the car. Watching this episode live in 1998, I thought, "Am I on the right channel?" This first autopsy of Scully flooded me with big words that I do not understand. I think she learned her lesson ALWAYS wearing a mask before performing an autopsy. Stupid Scully! What is wrong with the lighting in the autopsy lab? It's dark like a grave inside! How are they supposed to see what they are doing there? Deputy Director Kersh draws his first lines from this episode. I have no lost love for this man. He is the third recurring character in a series you love to hate, the first two being Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I guess the producers felt there was too much love for Mulder, Scully and Skinner. So they had to add characters to give grief to our favorite agents and incite our anger to support us. I love the quarantine suits worn by Scully and his team with the beautiful helmet bulbs. Boy. It's really smoky or foggy at night in northern Nevada at DRY. Can we say the word "effect"? Drive is a cool episode, but looking at Route 36 on my American atlas, there is no way that Mulder has maintained a speed of 70 to 100 km / h on this road. If he had been on I-80, the highway, maybe. But no way on a national road with so many curves. All the shooting inside the car looked very authentic. Great job of Rob Bowman. It's nothing like the old days of the obvious blue screen or landscape clips that pass the window of a car on a stage. It was a fun episode, but some of the inaccuracies prevent it from being a good episode. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, so hang on for a quick exit!
