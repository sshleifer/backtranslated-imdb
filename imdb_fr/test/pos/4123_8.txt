This biography of Buddy Holly (1936-1959), a former rock and roll star, is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The highlights of the film are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly's songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's filmed performances are almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious smile lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for Best Actor was well deserved. <br /> <br /> The film follows the career of Holly, who grew up in Lubbock, Texas, starring New York and her untimely death in a plane crash. One thing that I found interesting, if it's true, is Buddy's driving ambition: he had great plans to go beyond recording and performance. From an early age, he was already a wise businessman and wanted to change things. We will never know if he would have catapulted his first success with a commercial brand like The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The lyrics of many of Holly's songs are mostly teenage; read the lyrics for "Peggy Sue" or "Oh Boy!" and you will see what I mean. This may be a major reason for his popularity with the teenage audience, but his instrumentation and stage performances certainly explain his influence on the bands to follow - the Rolling Stones and the Beatles have recognized its importance. <br /> <br /> Clearly, certain freedoms have been taken for a dramatic effect. For example, I doubt that Hollywood has ever hit a producer in Nashville or that the audience at the Apollo Theater in New York has been so receptive as to dance wildly in the aisles. If you want to get closer to the truth, check out the documentary "The Real Buddy Holly Story" (1985), produced and presented by Paul McCartney, very relaxed and engaging. It contains interviews with Holly's family, friends and band members (Holly's musical brothers are not even mentioned in "The Buddy Holly Story"). Members of other groups such as Keith Richards and Don Everly also offer opinions and stories, as well as footage of Holly's previous performances. McCartney's production may be self-sustaining, but it is a great complement to "The Buddy Holly Story" and should perhaps be watched by anyone viewing the story as fiction.
