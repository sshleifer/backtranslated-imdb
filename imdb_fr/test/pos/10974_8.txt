No bullets, no secret agents, a funny story, funny and credible. Met with producers / actors of this film at the theater. They seemed as interesting in person as their characters on the screen. You can not hear about this movie on television with expensive commercials, but it's definitely worth watching. I spent $ 8 on a movie ticket for many other movies that were not as entertaining. Looking forward to future projects of this production company.
