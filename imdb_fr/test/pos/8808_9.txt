I remember a time when the only thing that existed was clubs, drug pubs and parties. This movie came out a few years after I started going clubbing. If I had never discovered the real side of things, this movie might not have made sense to me. That night, when I watched it for the first time, with some friends, I was completely blown away. I had never watched a film so close to the reality of my life at that time. Almost everything I could understand one way or another. There has never been a single character to which I can fully identify, but rather a combination of all, one way or another. My friends were no different and I remember all of us saying they were where we were or where they were. We were all out together this weekend to do exactly what the crew does in HT. We were going down while we were watching and when the movie "came down" I actually remember going down a little further. it was actually quite depressing in our room during these "weak points". That's good in Human Traffic. he is really exploiting the situation as a whole. <br /> <br /> This is a unique film in the sense that it is not based on plot, but it is not totally character-oriented although the characters are important. it always seemed to be situation-based. Situations in group and as individuals. Every character is lost in life, for his own reasons. yet each one responds to the loss in the same way. work any job to make money and pay for the weekend and escape. for them it's their vacation. But the reality is that you can not really escape. Another situation they all face. <br /> <br /> My friends and I are no different from these guys. We all had our own belongings. Human trafficking has helped us explain what we do not understand about ourselves. He does it in a way that does not tell you anything. We felt like we were not the only ones out there, like us, and the lessons learned had been lived by many others around the world. Only when my lifestyle changed from party to career mode did I understand this movie. Nowadays I look HT, from time to time (as I just did), and I remember old times. No other film can do it. I was peter popper, jip travolta, I was never going to land with my chosen family. I would have $ 200 in my back and I wax the lot! No problem!
