This image was published in May 1979 with Susan Kiger in Playboy Playmate as Honey Shayne, Playmate Playboy in Lisa London as O'Hara and Pamela Jean Bryant as Terri Lynn. In one of the most delightful musicals in the history of the drive-in, a crowd of young girls full of twists meet in a story of sisters bikini sorority who will stop at nothing to reveal everything. So what does H.O.T.S really represent? You will have to watch the movie to get the answer. You see, girls have problems with society on campus that makes them stand out as sex-hungry maniacs. As a result, girls have begun to discredit society, no matter what they have to do to do their job. In addition, the college dean wants to dismantle the group of girls before they become uncontrollable. I loved this movie especially Lisa London. I thought her acting was fantastic and I'm disappointed she did not get other acting roles. Based on the three playmates alone, I give this film 10 stars of the weasel.
