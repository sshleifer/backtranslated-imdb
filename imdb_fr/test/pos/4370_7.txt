The recoil is a wonderful thing. Although little known at its first appearance (inspired by the famous magazine "Me No Leica"), this precursor of "Cabaret" can now be compared and it is not half bad. It is certainly not a classic, but it has its capricious charm (the film version of "Cabaret" follows this plot, while the scenic version has changed somewhat the plot). Of course, we must resist the temptation to sneer when Laurence Harvey's Christopher Isherwood (he keeps the real name of the original author, God knows what Isherwood was thinking), describes himself as a "confirmed single" and although Harvey is quite inadequate "hero" (he is virtually asexual) and Shelly Winters wrongly regrets the name of Fraulien Landauer (the role played by Marisa Berenson in "Cabaret"), Julie Harris is a wonderfully wonderful woman (that's a charming role of comedy), and Anton Diffring is first-rate Fritz, the German Jew in love with the character of Shelly. Of course, if "Cabaret" had never come, you might wonder if it would have seen the light of day again. The fact that it was relaunched may not be a reason for celebration, but it is quite acceptable.
