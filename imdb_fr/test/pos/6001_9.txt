Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is a doctor missing at sea, leaving behind his pregnant wife, Mary (Mary Steenburgen). Eight years later, he appears, ruffled and apparently crazy, chatting about his adventures on the lands of the tiny Lilliputians, the giant Brobdingnags, the floating island of the intellectual Laputa and the Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent and talking horses who have to face the Yahoos - a breed of bestial humans - among many other adventures. Not so good Dr. Bates (James Fox), who has motives over Lemuel's wife, has incarcerated Gulliver in a psychiatric facility, and Lemuel, Mary and his son Thomas (Tom Sturridge) must find a way to prove his health mental. <br /> <br /> Splendid adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, this film is a magnificent adaptation on many levels: the story, the satire, the characters, the visual elements, the brilliant cast. It's just a treat to watch, and it's almost incredible to think it's a movie made for television. <br /> <br /> The film brilliantly captures the vicious satire of Swift, who cuts like a hatchet across Britain. the society of time, but still resonates today. The wise Brobdingnags and the Houyhnhnms are almost perfect people who find it difficult to understand why Gulliver speaks so proudly of the vices and corruptions of his society. The scenes where Gulliver tries to prove that he is different from the Yahoos are perhaps the best, with a scathing satire describing how they choose their leaders ("they seem to choose the worst among them ... Who reigns up they find someone even worse "), go to war (" We only go to war for a very good reason - because they are weaker than us, or we want their whole country "), etc. The scenes involving Laputa are also well done - the intellectuals are also packed into their specialized fields, they have no time to do anything else and have very little common sense. And the addition of the asylum plot greatly enhances the story - Dr. Bates is a really nasty character, and when he delivers a speech to the board of inquiry into Gulliver's alleged flaws, it's obvious that he describes his own faults. <br /> The film uses beautiful and quite convincing CGI effects, describing with great effect the different scenery of the novel. The contrast of sizes is very skilful and all the worlds described in the story are convincing in their own way. Cinematography (especially that concerning asylum) and costumes are brilliantly made. Writing the present with memories of Lemuel is a device that could be embarrassing, but works very well. <br /> <br /> The distribution is really beautiful; a real who's-who's British and American talents. Ted Danson gives an excellent multi-layered performance as Gulliver, effectively showing his transformation from a person disconcerted by his strange environment, to the state of madness in which he was when he reappears, to his rational intellectual personality to the end. Danson, well known for his work on sit-com, shows that he is much more than Sam Malone with this magnificent serial-comic performance. Mary Steenburgen is effective as a wife and James Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rest of the cast is mainly composed of cameos, Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud being the most memorable, even the smallest. the games are played very well. <br /> <br /> Without being 100% faithful to the book, "Gulliver's Travels" is a triumph of history and images. This is not to be missed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
