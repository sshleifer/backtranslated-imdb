Like many children born in the 1980s, I grew up with Mel Brooks movies that are not necessarily more "classy" films like Blazing Saddles and History of the World, part 1 (I've seen these this, although less often now), but those meant for the "whole family", Spaceballs, and this movie. At the time, I knew that I did not see great art, but just a campfire movie, clumsy, but still worthy of laughter, Robin Hood and / or adventure movies. But to call it a family film in quotation marks means that a) adults can really enjoy it as much as children, if not more because of silly little jokes and vulgarities, and b) once a child sees it, when it revisit it, as I have done a few times, it's still fresh but some things are not very well understood the first time. It's a comedy that is not just full of jokes in Robin Hood's movies and other movies (the godfather of course, as well as little mentions for other modern-day movies), but that also makes reference to Brooks' own films; Filmmaker who does not fail to joke about his own style. <br /> <br /> Basic Story - Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best turns) returns home after the crusade to realize the perilous adventure with King Richard gone, and so goes to reclaim his land and, of course, rob the rich to feed the poor. Along the way, he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), his head with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the sheriff, and of course always pine for the sake of Maid Marian. This, of course, is Brooks' usual clothesline, which lets the comedy unfold behind the scenes. Although sometimes a joke may not work or become obsolete if it is rebroadcast, it blocks so much that it's hard not to laugh. It is also helpful that some of Brooksfilm's best songs, such as The Godfather (Dom DeLouise at its best), Brooks' own cameo as Rabbbi, Lewis and Chappelle, and countless quotes lines and a few songs ironic. Part of that is obvious, yes, some of it comes from the pages of Blazing Saddles, of course, but is it a good time for the good crowd? For parents who grew up with Brooks' work in the 70s, it's a fantastic way to introduce his work to the youngest (even the suggestive sexual jokes and those that are not are not evaluated, they are all fun).
