Looking at the Armored preview, I thought the movie was going to be a very bad movie or a very good movie. Fortunately, the film was entertaining, suspenseful and realistic. There is never a perfect crime and Armored has shown why. The film shows perfectly when people find themselves in a stressful situation, they behave like animals. The last hour of the film is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Hard to believe Dillon is 50 years old. I would like to buy this movie. I give Armored eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie. Have I already written ten lines? Nope! Anyway, there are not many action movies. Armored has a lot of enthusiasm, which gives the moviegoer a choice over another comedy.
