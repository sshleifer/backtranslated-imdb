I remember watching this movie several years ago in VHS at friends' homes. At first I thought it would be a boring car movie. But to my surprise, it turned out to be one of the best movies I can remember to watch for its time. <br /> <br /> He has a good history and, better yet, great Australian cars and street racing. I really liked Fox's car, a working Dodge Charger. The painting that was done on this car was really exceptional in my opinion :)! <br /> <br /> There is also a 57 Blown Black Chevy of 57 doors that enters the movie later. <br /> <br /> In fact, I managed to get a copy of this film on VHS last year at K-Mart here in Australia. I myself had planned to convert this film to DVD, because I think it is a film that is worth it. But to my surprise this weekend, while I was browsing the trash of DVD movies, I found it on DVD. So of course, I took it while I could, because it was the only copy available. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you really want to see classic street racing with real muscular cars, including a nice story without rice burner in sight. So this movie is for you !!!! <br /> <br /> Here is some additional information from the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> He will win at all costs Fox is a young man who lives in the fast lane. He thinks he's the fastest man on the road, but street racing is illegal. If he does not accept his last challenge, he could lose his daughter ... if he accepts, he could lose his life. To live dangerously, to live quickly and to win at all costs is their obsession. They do not come back, do not give in ... and do not ask for help.
