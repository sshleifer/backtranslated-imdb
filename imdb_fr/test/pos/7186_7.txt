The French are not famous for being great film producers. <br /> <br /> Although their Amélie scores high points at the Oscars. Asterix and Obelix is ​​a film very different from what I'm used to French. It's an excellent movie especially for kids. The only thing that attracted me was that it was spoken in French and subtitled. Normally, with English movies (here in the Netherlands), I do not have to read the subtitles. But with the French language, just read to understand. The story itself is just great with Obelix who does not remember being fat, but there are also pretty details mainly in names such as brucewillix and malcomix. You all know the history of comics and this film shows most of the slides. Everything is there, from the nose brake of the Sfinx to the red beard of the pirates lose three other ships. I would say a good movie for the weekend with the kids.
