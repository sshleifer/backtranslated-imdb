Dude, I thought this movie had rocked. Perfect to sit alone and watch like 3am with just a bottle and you. All the time you look, do you think WTF? What will happen next ... dude, come with the girl already. Good ..... they are pickin mushrooms ... it's strange ... but a little scary cool. Damn, all this movie has a dirty, naughty and devilish erotic connotation ... it's a subtle dance that attracts you all the same ... you just wait for someone to get hit. But damn ... WTF!? You get that and then some. For the morally enraged stomach, it is good to run to the toilet to skim equipment. Any film that can have this kind of reaction deserves to receive a prize.
