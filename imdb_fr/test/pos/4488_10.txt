It seems like there are two kinds of people in the world: those who think that "Five Characters" is one of the best episodes of the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucks because they were so intelligent and already predicted the "lame" at the end (which, apparently, in their little spirit, is the only reason for the existence of Twilight Zone: to create twists). <br /> <br /> There are many lame episodes in the series and I am not one to rate all ten episodes of TZ. But this one is certainly one of those who deserve such a note. It's claustrophobic and colorful. The suspense is built and we can not wait for the revelation of the secret in the end. But whatever that secret is, what these people are, it does not really matter. Most of the beauty of the episode is to go there. It would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers really are in a foreign place.
