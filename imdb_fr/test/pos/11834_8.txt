"In Love and War" is a simple TV movie, which must be considered as such. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler possible) <br /> <br /> The story of a world war British soldier, Newby, captured with his commando by the Italians and imprisoned in a former orphanage. When the Italians surrender to the Allies, the commando is released and tries to escape. However, the Germans arrive and the commando is again captured. Only Newby, wounded, is still on the run. The rest of the film tells how it is hidden and protected by the fans and its survival. <br /> <br /> (End of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> According to a true story, "In Love and War" is a simple and refreshing film. Half comedy, half romance, the story is simple and unambiguous. The atmosphere is warm and sunny and the various stereotypes (hopelessly unorganized or romantic Italians, stern German seriousness and phlegmatic and pragmatic Britons), although unoriginal, are always full of humor. The musical score of Nicola Piovani also adds a Mediterranean touch. <br /> <br /> Although it's far from being a "tea with Mussolini" or a "La Vita E Bella", "In Love and War" is a movie game of chance that will put a smile on and -being even a tan on your face.
