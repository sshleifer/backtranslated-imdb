It was my first look at this short-lived British TV horror series, but I had already seen two Hammer horror movies (Horror of Dracula, Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter) and I thought about it enough to be able to take a look at it. This first episode was a shock - not for the horror but for all the nudity. Was this television "regular" in England in 1980? If so, he has shown much more skin than we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, a scene where a guy put his hand on a woman and another scene with the man, the top of a woman simulating intercourse. Hey, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a witch who disappeared in the seventeenth century returns to her former home and makes life difficult for the married man. The latter, Jon Finch in the role of "David Winter", was not really an actor, but his wife was not bad and was really beautiful. She was Prunella Gee like "Mary". The husband rightly suspected her of having an affair, and that plays a part in this story. <br /> <br /> Patricia Quinn was fun as a laughing witch "Lucinda Jessup", who comes back with a gang of naughty her and has a good time tormenting the couple until things go wrong at the end. As a man, I would say it was particularly fun to see both women participate! It starts slowly but once "Lucinda" has begun to stir things up, it becomes very funny.
