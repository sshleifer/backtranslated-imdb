Based on a short story by William Faulkner, Two Soldiers is a high quality short film, a film that has enough story, emotion and excellent cinematography for a feature film that leaves something to be desired. The story tells the story of two poor Mississippi brothers, one child and one old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, does not want to let go of his older brother, and he embarks on a quest to join the army. Ron Perlman is an army colonel who decides to help the kid. <br /> <br /> Because it only lasts 39 minutes, this gem will be difficult to find (it will probably be limited to the festival circuit for now), but remember the name of Aaron Schneider - this image marks him as a director to watch.
