Throw Momma did not come out at all, it's as funny as when he came out. A truly eccentric comedy that does not seek to be loved and is worth it, filled with memorable lines of laughter. Even the little characters are well written and played brilliantly, such as Billy Crystal's best friend girlfriend and Rob Reiner's adorable cameo as Crystal's agent. A little crazy and very funny.
