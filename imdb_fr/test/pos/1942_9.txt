Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not just his) is extraordinary. You really want to believe him because his body language and his performances are perfectly suited to the person. He gives Layne that extraordinary character that makes this film a cult. In addition to Feck, this role is played very well by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right side or the wrong side, without logical thinking on the stage. Friendship is more important and that's exactly what I think makes choices so difficult. Rivers Edge allows you to experience this with serious sonorities and family mathematicians. I really enjoyed watching. I saw it a month ago for the first time, but if you like the 80s, it's the one you have to see. It's the same thing I did not know before.
