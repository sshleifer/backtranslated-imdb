Roy Anderssons "Du Levande" is not quite original, it is a counter-foot of the previous film "Sånger de Andra våningen". However, the film has an aura of total originality. Some film making conventions are always rejected: most actors are not what you expect from a movie and shooting takes a lot of time. Most of the time, the camera does not move but people move around. The shots start from somewhere and often, the landscape takes incredible proportions. W. G. Sebald comes to mind in literature with the same technique. Because of the time invested in each shot, the suspension is very high in many scenes. There is a story and it is not - it is up to the viewer to build a personal thought. This film is positive. He is determined not to see all this negatively and at the same time not to overcome social injustices. One of the messages I understood is that maybe all chess and accidents are not deadly after all. Super movie.
