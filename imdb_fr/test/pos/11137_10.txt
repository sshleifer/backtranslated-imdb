This show was amazing !!! I saw the three and it's the best. This film has suspense, a bit of romance, stunts that will amaze you (GO BOBBIE), great characters and incredible places. Where was it filmed? Will there be more? I really liked the story with his brother. Looking forward to Chameleon 4 and see how the world is still saved.
