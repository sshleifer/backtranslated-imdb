This film has no age and should probably appeal to today's children, even if there is no Jedi in the film. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is great too. Even Mickey Rooney is good; Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury are too. The release of this movie was a different world, and it is certainly a great place to visit.
