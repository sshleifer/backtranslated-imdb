This movie was very funny with just a little gore. These are two grave robbers who continue to work as usual when they discover that they can serve a different clientele. This changes the direction of the corpses they collect. The film is told by the youngest of the two as he explains the case to a priest before he is sent to be beheaded. His partner had already been beheaded. The priest is required to take the last confession that takes the form of a story. There is an animation that gives an impression of "Tales of the Crypt". In the story, we meet another group of grave robbers that everyone fears, but at some point, the youngest of the two to be executed is offered a job. This calms down some of the animosity between the groups. When a woman joins the two men, she goes beyond her limits and gives them trouble with the looters of the dreaded graves. The story leads to the meeting of the two groups, which led to the arrest of the man who confesses and the one who has already lost his mind.
