The main criticism of this film by others, namely that Macy suddenly looks Jewish while wearing her glasses, is misplaced. The glasses are just the little change needed to convince others that he is Jewish. The scene in which he tells his boss, (paraphrasing) "but you know what I have", as well as a discussion with his mother, suggest that he had to fight this same hypothesis in the past. The glasses now make her look Jewish enough to "confirm" the existing suspicions of her neighbors and colleagues. There is also the big nose of his new wife and his taste for noisy clothes, which of course means that she is Jewish. The purpose of the film is to know how these stereotypical little lies become the very basis for judging others. <br /> <br /> If he has a lisp, he must be gay. If he has long hair, he smokes drugs. If he is Hispanic, he has a knife ... and if he has round black glasses and is light, he must be Jewish. These statements all seem to me equally (non) plausible. If the conclusion that people joined in Focus was reasonable, the purpose of the story would be lost.
