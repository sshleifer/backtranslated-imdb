OZ is an old television series published by HBO. It shows life in a security prison called Oswald, but the main plot is centered on Emerald City, which is one of the levels of the prison. <br /> <br /> Oz has an amazing plot and an exceptional cast! There are many characters and almost all are very interesting. Basically, they are divided into groups (gangs), Sicilians, Blacks, Aryans, Gays, Latinos and many others who do not have a specific group, but who deal with many others). <br /> <br /> The plot is very well constructed, there is a lot of conspiracy inside, a lot of struggle for power. But all this is not just exposed in the form of violence, everything is very intelligent and intelligent, nothing happens without reason, everything is connected and very interesting to guess! I really like this series and want to see something smart, very well produced with a very good cast and very good performance, MUST see OZ!
