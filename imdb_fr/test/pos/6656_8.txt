I watched Cold Mountain and the English Patient again this weekend. The first is a Civil War melodrama on Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who abandons the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), a girl he barely knows. Both films were directed with love by Anthony Minghella, who does an outstanding job. Although Cold Mountain is very good, it could have been a good film with the right cast and a less folkloric and less scholarly dialogue. <br /> <br /> Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. The English Patient, Kristin Scott Thomas, was perfectly chosen to interpret the beautiful, seductive and seductive Katherine Clifton. The main problem of Cold Mountain is Ada, who seems silly and confused and lacks this quality would make you believe that Inman could become obsessed after a kiss. As an actress, Kidman has a limited reach, she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversity with stoicism. Kidman was too old to play Law's ingenuous and love. The film needed a young actress capable of playing a charming, warm and vulnerable role. For someone who was supposed to endure hardships and almost starve, she looked ridiculously well fed and dressed. Kidman was so impeccably neat that it looked like she had spent three hours putting on makeup for each scene. Michele Pfieffer in her youth could have played the role perfectly. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement. <br /> <br /> Renee Zelleweger was more comfortable, but her lively performance was eating away at the landscape but she was perhaps trying to compensate Kidman. Jude Law was in his own silent film as Odysseus, but did a good job. Ray Winstone was excellent as a London and Southern villain. <br /> <br /> During the civil war, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and they may have spoken in monosyllables. However, if you look at the BBC adaptations of Dickens, Austen, or Ms. Gaskill, everyone speaks clearly. It may be unrealistic, but it would improve my entertainment.
