Almost no movie experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a housewife teacher who suffers from amnesia. She'e even on the PTA! But then a car accident wakes up the woman she was, and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as a low-rent private eye trying to help Davis find his past, only to find that he is above his head. Davis also has some hilarious lines, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well. <br /> <br /> Look for Brian Cox, the first Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally managing to lose his televised image of St. Elsewhere. The film is directed by Davis' husband, who almost seems to have built the entire movie around her, but it works. <br /> <br /> I take out this DVD and look at it often. I still like the makeup scene. Is Geena hot or what?
