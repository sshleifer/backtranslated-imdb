That's how I felt when I saw the episode in its original version and I still agree when I watch it in reruns. The perpetrators made fun of Columbo all the way through the episode and treated him as if he was suffering from Down syndrome. And in the end, you see their shock when Columbo condemns them to death and stops them. You also get a realistic response from the arrogant killers of Preppy. They still could not give his accessories to Columbo and say that he had just been lucky. I like the formula where there is an elaborate crime, the murderer or the murderer completely underestimate Columbo, then you realize that Columbo was totally the criminal. I remember that in the first episodes after 1989, they did not follow this formula and it was the first episode that pleased me.
