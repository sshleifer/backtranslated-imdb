I saw various hamlets and I taught the room. Looking at Jacobi, I am tempted to think that he is just as clever as Hamlet himself, so much is he alive in every nuance of that character's mind. He delves into, rather than solve, each enigma about Hamlet's character. It illuminates line after line, word after word, illuminates this sparkling spirit. At the same time, however, we fear the horror felt by Hamlet - much more than any other actor - because Jacobi feels the pain more deeply than anyone else. And we shudder at Hamlet's own betrayals, because Jacobi is not afraid of the baseness to which Hamlet can descend. In short, Jacobi gives us Hamlet as a whole, and Hamlet as a whole is the greatest character in literature. That's why I'm convinced that Jacobi's Hamlet is the best performance of an actor to date.
