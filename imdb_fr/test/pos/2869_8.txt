Do not see any harm with Kane. The film has a great scenario But it was just not a movie Wink, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it would be watching WWE superstars Monday night when the movie will arrive for the first time in room. I loved the movie even though I loved the story he told. <br /> <br /> GREAT FILM EXCELLENT WISH TO SEE PART 2 <br /> <br /> It does not matter if Kane is killed in The End <br /> <br /> or not, they killed other horror stars in every film <br /> <br /> they came out and they come back for more stuff, so part 2 would <br /> <br /> Be very interesting .
