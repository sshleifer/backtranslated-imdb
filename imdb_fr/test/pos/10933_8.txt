8 points to probably take what is maybe a little more than it was at the time. The American Indians have probably stolen more than killed. Who really knows? A slower and slower pursuit means that it has a rhythm and ... interesting and unique. Fortunately, not another stupid shoot em up. I thought it would be bad at first, I found myself packed ... a nice treasure ... good job! I hope nobody dissects this film. When the whole movie unfolds, you have a lot of unique twists, you can not determine what will happen next. The characters are human and have the honor or not, passion or not, forgiveness or not. Wound Up love the white horse, the Indian, Sheen even the damned wilderness. All good.
