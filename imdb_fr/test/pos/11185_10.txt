The curse of the monkey island. Exit exactly 6 years after the success of Monkey Island 2. One would think that with the weird end of Monkey Island 2, it would end once and for all with Monkey Island. But everything turned out to be a trap for luring Guybrush into captivity. But enough of that, all this is saying that Monkey Island is back and the voices are just phenomenal. If LucasArts were doing a Monkey Island movie / cartoon, that would probably be what it would look like and look like. His plot is really good, and everything is great. If you have not heard of the Monkey Island series, purchase the Monkey Island or The Monkey Island Booty Pack and play all the games starting with The Monkey Island Secret, then Monkey Island 2 and The Monkey Island Curse. Monkey Island 4 was really good, but this one surpasses them all.
