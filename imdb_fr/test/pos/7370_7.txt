This film dethroned Dr. Giggles as the best horror movie I have ever seen. The plot was great, the twists of the plot were even better and the distribution was great. It is hard to believe that they brought together the most unknown people 8 years ago and that they would be big names today! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. 4 teenagers destroy their car in the middle of nowhere. They fall on this campsite and do what everyone in an accident should do. Light a fire and tell scary stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "The hook." Excellent beginner. Everyone in high school has heard variations of this story on the night of the ball. But they do it really well in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. "The honeymoon." OK, it was not the best of 4. It was pretty good and you can see breasts. Emphisis on the word "some". It's just your basic creature story in the woods. <br /> <br /> 3. "People can lick too." This is a warning about what happens in online chat rooms across the country. This segment alone should be mandatory for parents whose children have access to the Internet. <br /> <br /> 4. "The Medallion." Now it's the best story of the whole movie. A guy on a motorcycle breaks down and goes to that dumb girl. Very good twist of the plot. <br /> <br /> The main plot, "The Campfire" has the biggest and the best twist of all the movie. I will not say what it is because I do not want to ruin it. I've never been so shocked in a movie of my life! <br /> <br /> Intrigue: A + <br /> <br /> Actor: A + <br /> <br /> Writing: A + <br /> Achievement: A + <br /> <br /> Music: A + <br /> <br /> Overall: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone over the age of 13, with the exception of "People can lick too." Any parent whose child has access to the internet should watch this one with his child.
