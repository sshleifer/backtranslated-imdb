Every Saturday morning at 11 am, I watched the Superstars. All the biggest events took place on this show at the time. Challenge, broadcast on Sunday morning, was also ok, but all the important events happened on this show. The wrestlers did all their interviews with Mean Gene on a platform next to the audience or spoke alone on screen in front of a group promoting them. The matches were usually squash, but sometimes we saw two mid-carders clash in the main event. There were also interviews showing that violence usually resulted, creating a quarrel. These segments included Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor and The Barber Shop. I do not remember that titles changed hands on this show. This usually happened at the price per view and at the Main Event on Saturday night.
