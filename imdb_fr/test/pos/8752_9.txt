I really appreciated this program. It is exceptionally well written, with finely judged performances and intelligent images. <br /> <br /> He is also very frank and honest, refreshing about the healthier picture of drug use in movies and television. <br /> <br /> Do not miss - one of the best TV shows in recent years and a Channel 4 all-time victory. <br /> <br /> 9/10
