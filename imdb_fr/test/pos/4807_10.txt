Having seen "only" about 200 Hong Kong films in my day, I must say that this film is one of my favorite. Not only is the plot intriguing (and in some ways surprising, which is rare nowadays for any film), but the chemistry between the two main actors is superb. A first-rate casting! And even if even the most serious HK films tend to insert a little humor between the drama and the action, often spoiling the mood, the jokes here remain subtle and integrated into the plot, improving even the character relationships . The music is also very well done and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of the special edition of HK, they even cleaned the image (the first version was grainy) and subtitles, although the quality of the translation is still lacking (nothing new there). All in all, if you have to see an HK movie that is not directed by John Woo or have Chow Yun Fat in it, that should at least be on your short list! A truly fascinating and entertaining watch!
