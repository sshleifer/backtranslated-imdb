Of course, one would expect this to be a typical and stupid movie of T & A, and it's true. But there are really moments of humor quite well thought out. Given the time when it was shot and its obvious aspect of exploitation, it is still one of the best comedies B of the time. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, you will obviously see the inspiration of many scenes in "Revenge of The Nerds", and many other similar films. Most of the actors are horrible, and MUCH too much, but that's exactly what I expect in a movie like this. What is lacking in his way of acting is more than compensating with his camp value and total indifference for any merit. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie is that there was obviously money that went into it. Movies like this one shot today just do not have the same style. If you stop your brain and increase your sense of humor for an hour and a half, you'll enjoy this movie. I challenge anyone not to find at least SOMETHING in this film that they find funny, even hilarious.
