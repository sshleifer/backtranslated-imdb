Sex is Comedy, while not inspired by a fantastically imaginative plot, effectively focuses on the relationship between the director and the film crew during the filming process, while successfully addressing the dynamics of human relations and more specifically the problems encountered by the actors involved in the shooting of sex scenes. The director 'Jeanne' is omnipresent, because it is she who pursues the plot instead of the narrator and gives us many small pearls wisdom to think. As a social commentator, she tells her assistant and others about the problems she encounters with her new male role by associating her with a male stereotype. Their ambiguous relationship is typical of human nature ?? the tendency to be fickle. On the one hand, the two seem close; when he is not in sight, she pretends to hate him. Jeanne also speaks of her masculine pride, perhaps of a feminist idea. <br /> <br /> The taboo of what constitutes obscenity is raised: the content of sex scenes is not considered obscene but beautiful, because it constitutes an obscenity - such is the justification of the director. This is however doubly ironic, because the film we are looking at is in itself a construction in a construction. <br /> <br /> This film is not limited to simple relationships, of course. To watch this film, it is not enough to analyze it to make sense of it. We can feast on the natural light that permeates the film. This makes it realistic and believable. A static camera is sometimes used to record a heavy composition and sometimes it looks shaky like a movie at home. If you are looking for something fun to watch on Sunday afternoons, it is not too heavy but lets you think: that's it.
