I saw this film at the Philadelphia Film Festival today and I enjoyed it overall. It is an interesting and clever analysis of the all too common revelation that our parent's marriage was more flawed and difficult than we had originally imagined. In addition, this film is an excellent example of the process of discovering truths about our parents' lives after death and related issues. However, I found the sound quality (recording and editing) relatively mediocre and annoying. *** This may very well have been related to the theater and the specific projection conditions *** I am not a filmmaker / student or anything and does not claim a real understanding of the sound production process, but as such as a consumer, I found his part of the movie distracting. In particular, I heard very unpleasant lips (especially a long interview with the younger sister) in the film, and often the level of background noise was higher than people's voices (for example the scene where a small group sorted the parent papers). Has anyone ever seen this movie, nothing noticed the sound ... thank you
