This jewel brilliantly captures the life of the early 80s. As a young graduate of 1983, <br /> <br /> myself, I must say that Valley Girl (with Fast Times at <br /> <br> /> Ridgemont High) stands out as the class of the movie about teen sex <br /> genre. The characters are faithful representatives of the time. <br /> <br /> insolent shopping mall chicks, punk pseudo-rebels, preppy jocks are all <br /> <br /> shown here. <br /> <br /> I have already seen it more than ten times. The music in the movie was top <br /> <br />. Unfortunately, these tunes have never been as popular in their day as those of Arena Cockrockers like Journey, Styx or Loverboy. Before creating the soundtrack I searched for <br /> <br /> recordings and tapes (it was the 80's after all!) By Josie Cotton, Sparks, <br /> <br /> Plimsouls and modern English. <Br/> <br /> This film deserves respect. It's not just a good 80s teen movie. It's an excellent movie. Period.
