The combination of amazing special effects and Oscar-winning acting make Vindicator one of the most important sci-fi movies of recent years. For some reason still unknown to me, this gemstone was found in a bargain basket. Why did a worthless human think that it was right to dirty a modern classic by masquerading as a bargain bash? I've never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and in random bursts. Forget Terminator, Robocop, Aliens and other films that have ripped off this masterpiece, the vindicator is an unstoppable force.
