These last days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre. Most movies have mean stories, a night out, not to mention the famous baseball teams? The last days actually contain male affection beyond the kiss in the dark, and a pretty graphic material that made me wonder if the movie belonged to Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The emotional journey of the film is what sets it above the rest of the genre. It was not until this film that I saw a story of such intense passion and love, and the torture it could cause. I think that when people cry during the cinema, they should be beaten, but I found myself sobbing during several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live. I suggest to all gay men to see this movie, and if you have a boyfriend, thank him ...
