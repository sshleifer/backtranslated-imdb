"A tale of two sisters" or "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a true masterpiece. A brilliant psychological thriller, a heartbreaking drama and a shocking horror, all wrapped up in beautifully orchestrated packaging. From complex intrigue to superb cinematography to absolutely perfect casting, every aspect of this film is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> For fear of revealing too much information about the plot, I will simply say that it is very satisfying. Although it may seem a little difficult to understand at first, it explains things very well in the end. And if you prefer psychological thriller, drama or horror, I promise you that you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, it is almost impeccable. The decor, cinematography, lighting and especially the soundtrack are all captivating. The waltz seemed a strange choice at first, but it turned out to be an ingenious choice. <br /> <br /> When it comes to casting, we are talking about absolute perfection. I am Su-jeong is totally convincing as a provocative but troubled Su-mi. Mun Keunyeong is just as convincing as his sister Su-yeon, emotionally traumatized. These two girls were magical on the screen. I will definitely look in their other movies. Yeom Jeong-ah is falsely cheerful and terribly bad as a stepmother. Finally, Kap-su Kim gives an excellent performance as a broken and tired father. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. If you have not yet seen 'A Tale of Two Sisters', I highly recommend locating a copy. It is a real gem, worthy of the collection of all. <br /> <br /> (10/10)
