Greetings again from the darkness. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds in this film based on a version of the true story of a man's struggle to control his destiny. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to watch in his role of Ramon. His eyes and head movements leave little doubt about what's going on in his mind. The dream and fantasy sequences are not overused, so is very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. Rather than force us to answer the question of euthanasia, the real question is: what is love? At every turn, we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. The scenario is tight and keeps the film moving although it was shot mainly in one piece. The cast is beautiful and we really feel their pain and how each family member manages Ramon's decision. It is a jewel and deserves to be seen.
