Well, what's wrong with the title "Separate Lies" (accused elsewhere of not being "exciting"). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course, there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi movie called "Separate Lives", which is alluded to here.) <br /> <br /> movie sounders. Okay, this is not a hilarious title "in the head", but it's not a hilarious film in the head. Please give a chance to such British movies. They try to make people think about important things, like here: how far do you go to protect your life (even if it is a little rotten) against unexpected disasters. Maybe you are telling lies. Maybe you do not know the lies of your loved ones. It can be a lot of people. <br /> <br /> American films on this theme are abundant, but they generally go much further by involving the use of firearms, which are not part of everyday life here in Europe. <br /> <br /> Maybe we are not so "exciting" here, but we do not expect slogans for films that are not aimed at a wider audience.
