If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado, played to perfection with expert timing and panache, do not look at this version. If you want to see a captivating version with Eric Idle strutting in the private club society of English gentlemen of the 1930s, this is the one to watch. It's a lot of fun and a good introduction to Gilbert and Sullivan, but after that, get started and rent the Canadian version of Stratford. You will see the difference between good and excellent. Nobody does better than G & S Brian McDonald and Stratford Group.
