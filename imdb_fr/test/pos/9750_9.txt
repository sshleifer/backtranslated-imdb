It was a thoughtful and well-made TV movie that tackled a huge subject with precision and intelligence and gave it a cinematic treatment that would look great on a larger screen: the palette is a little muted for television. if you're looking for a war action movie or "Bosnia Lite", it's not for you - it's an ordinary woman who has taken on an extraordinary challenge for humanity. If you want to know more about the conflict and the influence of a woman's work on the world, watch this film when it comes to you. I do not see that many other TV films have addressed the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. history avoids the obvious demonization of the "bad guys" and instead shows the daily denial and hatred that has led to the deaths of thousands of people. I was moved at several moments, and not in a manipulative Hollywood manner with catchy music and showy staging, but discovered the horror and implications with the characters. It is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself and keep the visual elements unobtrusive to support it with dignity. <br /> <br /> The actors are doing a hell of a job to bring the dramatic scenes to life. the scenes where the victims testify before the court of war are powerful and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are excellent. William Hurt's British accent is awful - no one else has given him the chance to play a Briton, and when he finally gets it, he loses it! - and although John Corbett's body was born to play the role of a soldier / commando, he is a little too great, even if he does a good job.
