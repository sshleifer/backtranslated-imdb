This film is a hobby to spend time, entertainment, but that could then be done in no country he did not identify anything "the Colombian". Who looks for the subjects of the supposed Colombian cinema or socially and politically correct and what it is denominated "that puts in danger", it is better than not to go to see this film. Some for drug trafficking, or the fight is not a reference neither farmer and worker, nor guerrilla wing and political kidnapping. <br /> <br /> The corrupt police is a character who could be Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, but also the protagonist of the character, an Argentine photographer, it could be Venezuelan, Peruvian or Filipino and the "boludo" frequent in his parliaments he could be replaced by another slang word from any other country without change of character or history. What is important is that it is a story very decently counted with images and good performances. Its quality is almost TV movie but good. What if a movie like this deserves or does not deserve the support of a lower audience is a bit of a classic "mamerta" debate.
