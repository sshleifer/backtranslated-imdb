Cop with a warm heart, describing angel-angel Michael in the form of a slob smoking cigarette that fights and is overweight, who loves to dance and play with the opposite sex. However, he has a good side, as he strives to redress the situation in the lives of some exhausted losers before being recalled to heaven. Funny film and well played; very nice although a little irreverent.
