Okay, so I do not understand why people are so upset with this movie. So I thought it would be Amanda Bynes' usual movie, but it was not. It was great. <br /> <br /> Alright, all right, the acting was not the best, but I thought the performances were always great. In addition, you could say that the actors were having fun making this movie. You could say, in other films, which were awarded in a surprising way, where the actors did not like working on the film. All the actors had chemistry, and that also showed. <br /> <br /> A ton of people are tearing up the actors' football skills. Yah, then they are not perfect ... get over it! They are actors, not football players. I've been playing football all my life and believe me, it's hard to learn, so stop mastering their skills. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was going to be stupid, but it was really fun. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a situation fun without even saying anything is funny. I had a lot of fun in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, I love it!
