Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) have just celebrated with their family and friends the announcement of their engagement in France, when he receives a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle in Scotland. Gerald's uncle would have fallen ill and asked to be present, the only heir, Gerald. Gerald leaves for Scotland, leaving behind his future wife. A few weeks pass and he does not return. Worried, Kitty sends telegrams but does not answer for his fiance. Four weeks later, Kitty finally receives a strange response from Gerald, canceling the engagement and asking him to move on. Not ready to give up her relationship and look for answers, Kitty gets on a plane and decides to visit Gerald. She is accompanied by her aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, best known in the world for her role in the classic cooler ISLE OF THE DEAD). When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam domain, they immediately suspect something is going on. For starters, Gerald seems to be twenty in a few weeks. Secondly, this once charming and charming guy has become a complete fool who repeatedly demands that he leave the castle and never come back. When Edith catches a cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there and try to get to the bottom of things. <br /> <br /> Why is Gerald so cold and so cruel with the woman he was just about to get married? Why is Gerald so opposed to the company? Why do the rules of the house stipulate that guests must be locked at night in their room? Why is it forbidden for guests to enter certain areas of the estate, such as Gerald's bedroom and a large labyrinth of hedges at the back? And what makes these strange trail sounds every night? These are just some of the questions asked by LE MAZE. The film does a great job building a mystery and intrigue. You are really interested in what is happening and wait patiently for the resolution to explain the strange events that are taking place. And then it's going on ... I definitely do not want to ruin the finale of this movie because you'd better not know, but it takes one of the most incredible and incredibly weird turns I've ever had seen in a movie. It's wonderfully ridiculous, but it also requires a pretty solid black-and-white mystery and sends it straight into Z-Grade schlock territory. And yet, this ending seems so irrelevant that you will probably not forget it once you see it. <br /> <br /> Despite the end (or maybe even partially because of the end), I really enjoyed this strange bird. It's very talkative and it moves slowly during the run time, but it managed to keep my interest throughout. Director William Cameron Menzies (who made the most famous INVADERS FROM MARS the same year) is best known as a two-time Academy Award-winning art director. His sets here are also very interesting. There is sometimes an almost silent cinema atmosphere, with models for some exteriors, painted backgrounds and unkempt interiors with very high ceilings. As in any good castle, there are also secret passages and long staircases. This one also adds some rubber sticks for good measure. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are a little stiff and clumsy, but I liked most of the actors. Hurst is one of those obscure and mostly unknown actresses who, unfortunately, never seemed to captivate despite her talent and beauty. Emery, who also plays the role of narrator in the framing of the shots at the beginning and end of the film, is quite decent as an aunt too mannered and cautious. My favorite, however, was Michael Pate as a sinister silver-haired servant who makes this hilarious vertical zombie walk every time he climbs the stairs. Hillary Brooke (who starred in the mystery of Sherlock Holmes, THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (THE OLD DARK HOUSE) of Whale are also in the lesser roles. Of course, Carlson also played in IT CAME FROM OUTTER SPACE, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and some other horror movies. So you have a pretty decent cast for genre fans. I say check it out!
