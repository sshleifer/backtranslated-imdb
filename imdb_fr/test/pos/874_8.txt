I slowly collect the movies available on DVD of Catherine Deneuve and François Truffaut. The actress and the director have both done nonsense. Fortunately, the Mississippi Mermaid is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Next to "The Soft Skin", stopping by chance the sister of Deneuve (late Françoise Dorleac), must be my favorite film of Truffaut. <br /> <br /> In addition to the realization, Truffaut also wrote the script. Something always strikes me at Truffaut's, it's his almost childlike innocence when he presents a story - one could almost speak of naivety. <br /> <br /> There is a scene towards the end of the film where Belmondo returns to the Lyon apartment with the remains of the loot. He rings at the door and Deneuve answers with a neglected. As Belmondo sets the room off the street to their room, Deneuve dons her dress, puts on her best stockings and shoes, then lies down on the bed and pretends to sleep. It's a scene that could almost come from a child's mind - but it's Truffaut for you. <br /> <br /> Seeing Catherine Deneuve in her films from the late 60's is truly a sensory delight. She is so extraordinarily beautiful that it is almost painful to look at her. Incidentally, for these fans, there are some topless scenes of her in this movie - actually a sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the previous posters. I do not see anything "hitchcockien" in the movie. As for the "look" - I like the look of the older movie film used in the 60s. This certainly gives the films of this period a unique look. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for fans of Deneuve and Truffaut ......
