Like any good art, this movie could mean different things to different people. For me, this means that not opening your heart to others could deprive you of happiness and leave you with an empty life. The convenience of selfishness is similar to that of junk food: it feels good, but could eventually make you sick. stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic film really touched me. Thank you, Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and all the other actors)! <br /> <br /> Ivan Yanachkov
