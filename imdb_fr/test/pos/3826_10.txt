I watched the original outer limits in real time, during the first broadcast, and have since watched the original series in its entirety, again and again, in reruns and DVDs. I find the new outer limits MORE than just a remake of old retreading episodes, as suggested by some of the more teenage commentators. <br /> <br /> With seven (7) years of programs versus just two (2) In the last years of the original series, producers and writers have certainly added many new, original stories and philosophical lines to a television series (cable) much older and very well produced. Scenarios are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of a sometimes scary and imminent future. <br /> <br /> While most producers and directors in Hollywood consider ignorance of science fiction as inseparable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns the origins of science fiction in logical, moral and new technologies in their potentially disturbing realizations in the short term. This series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the "shoot-em-up" video game monster mentally from much of the current generation. He has brains, a story, a message and good entertainment. This is a series for adults without unbearable fantasies on the part of teenagers. Hurray! <br /> <br /> Now, if we can only make sure that MGM publishes the entire series New Outer Limits on DVD instead of the six records of mediocre teasers, the first season is no longer available.
