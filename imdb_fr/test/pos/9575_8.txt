You know, this movie reminded me of so many people I know, I think that's why I liked this movie so much. I was just on the floor laughing because it felt like a document and so serious, but the dialogue is so hilarious that you can not help but have a good time. Basically, the movie talks about those crazy dog ​​owners who participate in a big dog show to see who is the best of the best. If it seems that it is the dogs who take this competition seriously, it turns out that the owners are just as crazy. Megan, one of the dog owners, will almost make a psychopathic serial killer to the hotel manager as she does not find the special toy squealing bee for her dog. <br /> <br /> There's another awesome couple, Gerry and Cookie, this complete nerd and that alluring woman who are so adorable. At the beginning of the movie, Gerry describes how many little Cookie friends had had. Throughout the film, her "lovers" see her and even drag her in front of Gerry! It was just great and fun to watch Gerry's look. All this film is just a joke, and you can not stop with the recognizable faces that continue to appear. It's a good movie, it's just fun to watch, I highly recommend it! Now, I have to find a good way to show this to my friends who are like these couples to see their mirror image. : D <br /> <br /> 8/10
