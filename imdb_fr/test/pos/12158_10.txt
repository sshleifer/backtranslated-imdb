Has there ever been a death angel like MIMSY FARMER in Barbet Schroeder's 1960s hero opus? A kind of Jean Seberg with a hypodermic. Pink Floyd's score. In spite of some ultimately insignificant weaknesses, a classic that Erich Segal / Noel Black ripped shamelessly for his inept JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971), although Tippy Walker, playing a similar character, is very seductive in this last mess. MORE, it's great, it's a great 60s drug movie and, quite simply, an important document of its time. Really a cult film, join the cult. <br /> <br /> No American film describes, so far as I can remember, the same territory. MIMSY is an amazing archetype, erecting that into mythical realms. Not for sensitive souls. Super sex scenes too.
