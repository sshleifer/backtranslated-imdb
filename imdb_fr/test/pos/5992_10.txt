Romuald and Juliette is one of those French romantic comedies where they seem to break all the rules, a bit like Too Much For You. The magnificent Daniel Auteuil discovers true loyalty and love when his life threatens to crash around his ears. The film is not a morality tale preached, but a wonderful story that will keep you hooked until the end. Firmine Richard (as Juliet) is a hero whom women will cheer - her laugh is my undying memory of this warm and witty film. The realistic way she includes all her children from their different fathers - especially birthdays - gives the film an edge that surpasses it above your average romantic comedy. But it is always the French who seem to show us how easy it is!
