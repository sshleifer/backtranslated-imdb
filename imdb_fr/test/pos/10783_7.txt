I chose this film really for my husband who works in broadcasting. I thought it would be more of a movie he would like and tell, even if it was from the 1980s. So it was a bit dated. This movie really draws you. Sometimes you just want to strangle the host, Barry. Sometimes you just want to send some of the bigots who call in a real concentration camp. Sometimes you feel really sorry for Barry because he's really grown too big for his jeans if you know what I mean. It was on the Drama channel on Encore. So I think it's a true story. If you really like dramas, you will love that, even if you do not know all the nuts and bolts of the broadcast industry. If you are a fan of Alec Baldwin and you are watching him to see him, you should not. His part is really part of this movie.
