First of all, I must say that this film is much less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. Of course, you have the religion versus science problem, but that does not try to make a big statement about it. It's basically an action thriller that goes very well from one scene to another. one scene in particular (which involves fire) I find extremely well done. <br /> <br /> Second, the changes from book to film. although when I followed the evolution of the film, I complained about the change of some characters and the complete deletion of others, I must admit that I was wrong. It was heartening to see that the film did not follow the book in the same way as in Da Vinci. if you are a purist of the book, some of them may annoy you. However, the Big Twist is still here, so do not worry. Finally, I'm glad they removed some stupid secondary intrigues and did not even try to hint at the possibility of Langdon and Vittoria meeting. <br /> <br /> The performances are really good, but nothing extraordinary. it's okay for a movie like this. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 9/10, mainly because it keeps its promises: entertainment, pure entertainment
