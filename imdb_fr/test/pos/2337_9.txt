I want to thank you for giving me the chance to be one of the first to watch the film. It really takes you. John Paul finally has the chance to see the light and make a living without being tied to the cords of his mother's apron. <br /> <br /> I imagine there must be so many families in the same situation (especially with the children leave the house older, but I would not say wiser) with very sad parents who would have not really had their life and make their lives a misery. <br /> <br /> I think this movie should definitely have a wider audience. I would also say that the other actors also played brilliant roles. It's such a profound and moving film.
