It's a brilliant series in the same sense as Simpsons. Follow a family as they go through their lives and problems, etc. A little less realistic than Simpsons, talking baby and dog, you're tempted? Family Guy goes where Simpson or Futurama do not dare, going beyond the sicker jokes and the more racy gags. And believe me, it works! Almost all gags have reached the target and they will let you go (especially random and frequent flashbacks!). When my brother showed me for the first time that, I was not addicted, but after a few episodes, I was addicted. You will be 2. 10/10 for a really brilliant show. Congratulations to Seth Macfarlane for bringing this show to life. :)
