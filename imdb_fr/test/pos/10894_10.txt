007's Goldeneye is one of the best N64 discs to date. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time are much better and superior games. But I still like Goldeneye very much. <br /> <br /> This is the best adaptation of a movie second only to the adaptations of Star Wars. The story is perfect. It's as if you were in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The graphics are excellent. The movements are extremely realistic. The artificial intelligence of enemies is the best part of this game. I loved playing on the stage where James and Natalya leave Janus' base as Goldeneye prepares to burn him. Escape without triggering the alarm was very difficult. Evading the cameras and controlling your shot is an important part of the game. <br /> <br /> It's also the toughest game I've ever played. N64 games are usually very, very easy. Goldeneye is the only exception. I'm still trying to beat Agent 00's tough level, but winning the easiest level was already a big win. I loved it when Alec Trevelyan asked, "For England James?" I replied, "No, for me!" It happened just when I shot him to death. Just like in the movie. I like to reach every goal. <br /> <br /> The multiplayer game is even better. At first, I was killed every second saint. Now, I know how to win. I like to force my playmates into playing License to Kill. <br /> <br /> The music and the sound are amazing. Super Mario 64 looks like an Atari next to that. The only thing I wanted to hear again was the Goldeneye theme song, which plays at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> After the release of Zelda, I almost forgot that I still had this game. It's always excellent, even if it's already outdated. I hope that other 007 games will be produced. <br /> <br /> Fantastic work Rareware! Nintendo was very smart to release this game on the N64 exclusively. Beautiful work Nintendo!
