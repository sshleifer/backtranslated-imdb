Let me waste a moment of your time explaining how I approached this film. First, I dismissed the trailers because the movie appeared to be an uncredited remake of Aliens, which I consider one of the weakest films in the Alien series. Stupidly rejecting the film after hearing positive testimonials from people I trust, I completely missed the script. I then became addicted to Farscape, in his 3rd or 4th season at the time, and I found Pitch Black on the cable one night around bedtime - so I said "oh why not, at less, there is Claudia Black in her. " Soon, I recognized Keith David and I began to understand that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why should that surprise me, I do not know). I was captivated. I remained captivated for four years. I just watched the movie for the 3rd or 4th time and I still love it so much. <br /> <br /> This is not an art film, nor an independent film, and it's not quite original, but a lot of new ground, it perfectly manages to provide interesting characters and realistic, ruthless action through a compelling but simple plot, and nonstop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with special effects made with taste. Sounds too good to be true? Do not believe me on my word ... see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film has also highlighted the charisma of Vin Diesel, a little iconoclastic, which presents the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would continue to play in his somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles (which I also appreciated, though acknowledging his rather huge flaws) and is now a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big and so interesting to watch that it's easy to ignore the fact that he's not only a talented actor, but also a smart actor. Check out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio commentary that might surprise you. <br /> <br /> The film tells of the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but keen and heroic (Mitchell), but he is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities: a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel ). Is that all? Of course not: the planet is inhabited and the inhabitants are hungry. <br /> <br /> As original and improbable as it may seem, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told and very well played. Do not expect to learn anything and do not expect much thought, but expect to have fun with this classic science fiction classic.
