An interesting look at the immigration experience, told as a fable with very strange images. <br /> <br /> I was attracted by this film because it tells the story of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine pretty much the same as my grandfather at the time. Traveling in the maneuver to provide ballast to the ships, I can not imagine that it was very comfortable, as this movie shows. <br /> <br /> There were laws restricting immigrants. I suppose these laws were stricter for those coming from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants should be free of contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities. In the film, we see physical and mental examinations, the latter because of the opinion that a weak intelligence is heritable. Single women could not enter the country because they were presumed to be prostitutes. That's why most single married men already settled in the country, as agreed in advance, to Ellis Island before they enter. <br /> <br /> a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who marries a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He tries to support his family with a mute son and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi) considered weak. By the way, she was fantastic in the role. <br /> <br /> You will also see the actor Vincent Schiavelli, in his role as penultimate apparition. I do not know if his last movie was out. He plays a matchmaker and is also very good. <br /> <br /> It was a strange but enjoyable film. It's not for everyone, because I imagine that those who are not interested in the immigrant experience would find it rather slow.
