So we saw this on DVD in our apartment in Paris. We are all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard because so much happened to us in the movie! I mean, yes, certainly, some were pretty clichés, but still true, know what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> I think I told the quiet guy (Italian) more than Xavier because I'm no longer the observer of our group. Anyway, I would like to have a roommate like Cécile de France. She seems to be a cool girl in the film and for real, after seeing her animate the Cannes Film Festival last month. <br /> <br /> Now, I think I want to go to Barcelona next summer after watching this movie. I must also look at what has just been published in France.
