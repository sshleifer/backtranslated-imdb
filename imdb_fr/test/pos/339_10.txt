This movie was amazing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary and the acting act spectacular. At first, I thought it would not be great because of a summary, but after the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it seemed to me that I was wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this film, and despite that, I had to watch the same scenes again and again about thirty times in a week! No, the song scenes were not as impressive as they could have been, but the plot is what really makes you. American or Asain, I would recommend it to everyone - and I have it now. I guarantee you that after seeing this one, you will make the most of it, as well as its plot. I hope you feel the same and write a complimentary review too!
