I have not seen it since 1998 and yet, I can not ALWAYS get away with it, or stop recommending to people to find it, which shows what impression it has had. <br /> <br /> Just a wonderful story. <I only hope to see the stairs at least once in person ... <br /> I did not know much about Mr. Petersen before this movie because I had not seen any of his previous works, but his subtle playing in this movie impressed me and I think his interpretation of Grissom on CSI just shows more of the same. He knows enough to show the character in place of the actor, which makes him even better actor. <br /> <br /> I do not remember enough "poor accents" to comment, but I must say that I always liked Barbara Hershey in all her roles and I thought she had also done a job phenomenal in this film.
