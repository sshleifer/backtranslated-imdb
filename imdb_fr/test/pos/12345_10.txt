It's my favorite horror movie, close to 'Poltergeist'. I saw "One Dark Night" when it was released in theaters in 1983, at the theater where I worked. <br /> <br /> I was born in 1963 and I have a certain love for the horror movies of the 80s, despite being a bit dated and the dialogue not well written. What I imagined to be so original is that the phenomenon of "psychic vampirism" has not been addressed (at least to my knowledge at this time) and that it is a very real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if Adam West was in (nothing against him, but his supporting role was not memorable), but thought Meg Tilly was a good cast. The little known Donald Hutton (from "Brainstorm" and "Invaders From Mars") as an ambiguous scientist who supervised studies of Ramar's abilities was unfortunately neglected. As a gay, I paid more attention to David Mason Daniels, the unhappy but wonderful boyfriend of Meg Tilly. He sells real estate in Texas now. <br /> <br /> I found the film "Realistic" in two ways: it was discovered that Raymar had murdered 6 girls in his surreal apartment and had an infrequent burial, which reflects not only he mysterious, a hermit, but a killer. As you know, these guys are buried without fanfare. Secondly, if the corpses were to be mobile, they would flutter by shuffling their feet. The filmmakers could have gone to see the schlock walking, moaning, arms outstretched, zombies stretched, but to opt for what would be credible. Glory! The buzzing electric shock of Ramar's eyes on his "throne coffin" (as if he watched over his dead realm), cast a strange magenta light into the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! If you have ever been to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass windows. Do not throw me into cavernous silence. Even Ramar himself looked like someone who might look like an eccentric and perverse old man. The score was unique and memorable, and I blame myself for not having put it on tape right out. The filming track was made at the scheduled location. I especially liked the carefully prepared features of each corpse: the bride, the badly decomposed child still holding her teddy bear, the grandmother, the big black and skinny guy, the half-faced veterinarian of World War II and scarlet eyes an elderly man who was the first to greet the initiators of the clique 'Sisters'. Even corpses can be good actors, I suppose. The only thing I had to moan about was the arm sticking out of one of the vaults and smothering Julie's boyfriend if a corpse was on my stomach and feet first, but why? It looked a bit too cool too. <br /> <br /> The film starts strangely, we never see Ramar's face (until the last quarter of the film, which is like unpacking a birthday present) as he picks up a teenager girl running away in the psychic flash of his daughter. We then see coroners carrying his body into his one bedroom apartment where we see that he has experimented with his telekinesis art by placing dishes in his wall. The rest drags while the group of "Sisters" resembling Bruy√®res initiates Julie in a final initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum, but it is a fitting well placed later. The film is not bloody. The most gorulous part is when Ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to restore her energy, and then melts. I have always thought that a power like Ramar's could never die and that a sequel might be worth studying. I can see it now: One Dark Night II: Turning In The Grave. But let's face it: the film is isolated. I heard that the film had other titles, but the original is appropriate. <br /> <br /> A remake would be useless. But if there were one, I would write a better dialogue and prolong certain scenes, for example show the studies on the capabilities of Ramar performed in the laboratory instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder. In the information age, such a thing would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why simply raise those from the mausoleum while Ramar's power could also spread to the cemetery? Let's just say that I would hate to be one of the people who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax; something that can also be shown. I think having one of the initiating sisters recognizing one of the corpses as a parent would have added a good character so disturbing. With the effects of synthesis, some impressive scenes with cremated remains animated by Ramar would be out of the ordinary! <br /> <br /> Say what you want, "A dark night", but everything is there. So, see at least once in your life ... or your death!
