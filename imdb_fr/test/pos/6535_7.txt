Aaron Carter stars the pop star (J.D. McQueen) in this film (surprise). It's a typical movie where the star (Jane) has a crush on pop star JD McQueen (as well as many other girls), but she's lucky enough to spend days with JD and forming a relationship is more like a fantasy. J.D. must attend a public school to maintain a mathematical grade in order to complete his summer tour. The problem is that J.D. is not good at maths. He finds the smartest person at school (Jane) to give him private lessons. Jane preaches and falls in love with J.D. In return, she falls in love with him too, but J.D. jokes and has to fix everything to win the girl and do the summer tour. The film is really worth seeing. Aaron will be a great actor !!!
