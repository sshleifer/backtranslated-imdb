When I first saw the movie, I thought it would be another Disney movie that goes almost directly to the video. I finally managed to rent it and rent it. I thought it was going to be bad because I could not see Shia in any other role than her recently canceled show "Even Stevens". When I turned it on, I was ready to turn it off in about ten minutes. It started a little slowly and I did not understand the beginning because the years did not make sense, then they explained that later in the series, so I was relieved to ask the question Overall I thought it was a good movie and I would recommend it. The cast was top notch and although I'm not a golf fan, he easily caught my attention with a good plot.
