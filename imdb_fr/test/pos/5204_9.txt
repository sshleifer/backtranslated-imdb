I just watched this film in the hope of seeing a faithful portrait of the bloodiest battle of the twentieth century. I got what I expected and much more. Just to think that I came across this film by chance, even before I ever heard of it. It's a German film shot in 1993, so I guess I can not be surprised that it's almost totally unknown to the modern American public. It's a shame because it's really a remarkable film. I dare say it's as good if not better than Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse now and All Quiet on the Western Front. These are all emblematic war films. <br /> <br /> 1942: The Second World War is in full swing. Nazi Germany dominated continental Europe and parts of North Africa, then Adolf Hitler ordered the large-scale invasion of the Soviet Union. A fatal gesture that ends up condemning Nazi Germany to defeat. At first, the invasion went well and the German armies conquered vast expanses of Soviet territory, but a critical battle ensued in Stalingrad, a city of great symbolic and strategic value. The battle quickly turns into a bloodbath of epic proportions, a nightmare for German and Russian soldiers. On the verge of taking the city, the Germans are suddenly attacked by the Russians who eventually cut off the entire 6th German army inside Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter is coming, causing unbelievable suffering to the Germans. The whole battle is seen through the eyes of some young German soldiers fighting for their survival, not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions, but also against their own sadistic officers who care only about the medals and the glory and generals disrespectful of the average soldier. <br /> <br /> This movie will haunt me for a while. The German soldiers on whom the film focuses are so young and naive that their humanity and mental health have been taken away from them and that you feel really sorry for them because they are not often illustrated by demonic Nazis. Everything they were fighting for no longer mattered, and everything they believed in was broken. After waging a terrible battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad, we see them deteriorate further with the onset of winter, causing many people to die of cold. The Battle & Winter scenes looked like a horrible nightmare, but they seemed just as real. It's amazing, at first, we see young men tied in the prime of life, and in the end, a shell of themselves stripped of everything. After witnessing so much carnage, these men lost their will to live, it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope, they are betrayed by Hitler who finally abandons them to a horrible death, which is only one of Hitler's crimes who abandon the men who fought to make him massacred by the Russians. <br /> <br /> A good anti-war movie describes the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. The battle for the tractor-making sequence is the closest thing to hell on earth, but that's really what the Battle of Stalingrad looked like. The German and Russian soldiers were portrayed with humanity, only the rotten apples (specifically on the German side) condemned the men. In the end, this film is amazing, because we see how men physically and emotionally disintegrate during the war. We all have our limits and these men have been pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time. What the average infantryman endured at Stalingrad is beyond imagination. Even if they had survived everything they had seen and done, they would have scored for life. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad shows us why war is hell and what exactly is hell.
