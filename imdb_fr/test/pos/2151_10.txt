I was lucky to have seen this film during its screening at the Seattle Film Fest and I was blown away by its quality. This is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). It is a loving look at the life, times, music and relationships of one of the legends of music. Harry Nilsson deserves to be among the best, like Gershwin, Cole Porter and all the other great 20th century songwriters. He was considered a peer by the four members of The Beatles, who all called him a 5th Beatle and one of the same wavelength as themselves. <br /> <br /> Harry refused to tour, so many people today do not remember, and those born after his heyday do not know who he was. It's tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent. This film is a step in the right direction, to finally give the man his due. Unfortunately, the film has not been widely broadcast, nor even a DVD, so for now, good luck to see it. <br /> <br /> If you are the power to create a DVD distribution deal, please contact the filmmakers. This film must be available. Hey VH-1, how about broadcasting it live, then put it on DVD? Harry Nilsson deserves nothing less.
