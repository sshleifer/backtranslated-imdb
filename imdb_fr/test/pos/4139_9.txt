What a beautiful movie! I never knew Buddy Holly very much, but I knew her lively and fun music. It's a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950s. Although Gary Bussey never interested me, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I do not know how accurate the film is, but I presume at least that it's accurate, which makes it all the more interesting. The music throughout the film simply adds pizazz to this biography. I do not think I would change anything in this movie, it was all good! What a difference between the stars of the 50s and the stars of today's music. How can you compare someone like Buddy Holly to Justin Timberlake? or one of the other popular singers of this generation?
