It was very funny, even if it was a little collapsed at the end. Hitchcock is no exaggeration - Owen (Danny DeVito) was lucky to have had "Strangers on A Train" at the local cinema. The film tells you that it's the inspiration. <br /> <br /> DeVito is very funny but also a little sad. He has no friends and all he wants is to write and have someone like him. His teacher, Billy Crystal, is currently living in a block of serious writers and his wife stole his book and made it his own success, which also frustrated him. <br /> <br /> Mr. Pinsky's book proposal ("One hundred girls I'd like pork") and all the scenes with Anne Ramsey, which is so horrible that even Mother Teresa would have wanted to kill her too!
