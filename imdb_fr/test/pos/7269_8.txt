I waited since last October to see this movie! (It was supposed to be out in October 1998) and now I have finally seen it, I'm not disappointed. Wonderful! OK, it was a little slow at first, but once it's gone, it's very exciting, Robert Carlyle is so different from Gaz in "The Full Monty" and Begbie in "Trainspotting" that he is difficult to recognize. ! And Johnny Lee Miller, who no longer has with his blond-haired "Trainspotting" Sick Boy, plays his dashing gentleman with the right humor and sensitivity that is easy to see why Liv Tylers Rebecca falls in love with him. A great movie. As Hades said in "Hercules" Disney: "Two thumbs up!"
