Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best humorists in the world. He really shows up in this scene, joking left and right like comedian Tom Dobbs. From the previous one, it looked like it would be a laughing festival apart. And it was funny. But there were a lot of serious roles in the movie that I did not expect. I would describe this as a drama or a comedy. But it's still worth seeing the money, and I always thought it was just about everything I expected. Robin Williams is at his best with the famous Christopher Walken. They play a very good team in this film and I was shocked to see how much they were able to work together. I recommend it to anyone looking for a light film.
