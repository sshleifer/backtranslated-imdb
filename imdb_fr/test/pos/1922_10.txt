Have you ever found yourself watching a movie or documentary and holding back from shouting things like "No! Do not do it!"? No? Well, it's time for you to do it. And it's probably DEEP WATER that will get you started. <br /> <br /> The story is based on that of Donald Crowhurst and his entry into the first yacht race around the world that will be undertaken by individuals in 1968. This word "individuals" is important because the men who embark on this almost suicidal escapade are heading alone. <br /> <br /> Most men are well known in the British maritime communities (where they throw from), but one of them is the "Unknown Dark Horse", and his name was Donald Crowhurst. In financial difficulty, Crowhurst uses a sponsor who can take it all if he does not succeed in at least trying to cross a large part of the race. He could take his house, his property, everything. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst is now between a rock and ... well ... in deep water: either try the race with an unproven ship and an unsuccessful captain, or lose everything you own ( which was important since Crowhurst had a wife and several children). You will also note the term "unsubstantiated captain". Not only was it not proven, but it had never been on the open sea! Did I mention suicide? Between archival images of the before and after-race and those of Crowhurst's friends, family and acquaintances today, Deep Water is perfectly organized. Initially perceived as a poor sap that has crossed his head, the film gradually shows you the limited choices that Crowhurst had after months and months spent in the water. His ship is fleeing. Equipment breaks. Psyche extended to breaking point (and beyond). Crowhurst finds himself lost in an internal struggle without a successful outcome. It is also interesting to see the psychological ruptures of the other runners during their isolation aboard their respective boats. <br /> <br /> The wave-shaped emotions you will feel when you watch This amazing documentary can make you a little sick (a bit like trying to sneak into the sea). And you will probably be frustrated by the choices that are made; perhaps as frustrated as poor Mr. Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is also amazing as we come to see the boat that Crowhurst sailed, seated, deserted and rotting on a Caribbean beach things that looked abandoned and rotting toward the end of this misjudged race. <br /> <br /> Incredible.
