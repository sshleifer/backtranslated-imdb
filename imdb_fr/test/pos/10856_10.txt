Of the 24 best lesbian films in my library, I must say that this one is the number one movie of all time. This film will go down in history as the best of its kind. This is the story of a girl (Rachael Stirling) who goes from ragged wealth and rags to wealth, with her first love (Keeley Hawes) coming in and out of her life. It is part of a Victorian backdrop of the 1890s, making it an ideal setting for the best entertainment in the industry. This film saves no expense for music and costumes, and the makeup that Rachael and Keeley brought to the stage in theaters only added to the diversity of the film. can guarantee that this movie will not only surprise you, but will hold your attention throughout the three episodes. This film will be played and enjoyed for decades. The unclassified DVD collector version is a must for all libraries. Rachael Stirling and Keeley Hawes were the best choice for casting in both roles, and they played them extremely well.
