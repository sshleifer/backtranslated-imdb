The film is about Paul (Páll), a young man immersed in the mad world of madness and his stay at the psychiatric hospital "Kleppur" and his friends. Victor (Viktor) who, during his studies in England, began to think he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Pétur), who took too much LSD and tried to fly under a roof, left no fracture or physical damage, but is obsessed with China. Oli Beatle (Óli Bítill) Oli has spent most of his time in the hospital although Viktor is slightly older than him, he claims to have written every Beatles song and telepathically <br /> <br /> > The novel is better then the film and covers the whole life of Paul, from his birth to his death, it's been a long time since I saw the film, but if I remember correctly, the film does not cover the childhood of Paul. <br /> <br /> "Englar Alheimsins" is funny, sad and powerful if you have not seen it, watch it NOW! and read the novel first, it improves the movie
