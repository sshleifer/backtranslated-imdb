The man who knew too much in 1956 is an exceptional entertainment. To those who prefer the original of 1934, I will say that this one is faster and more spiritual. However, even if the American version was (God forbid!) A big blockbuster budget, I believe that the British version is put to the test. I think it's one of Hitchcock's top 10 achievements, considering that he has made more than 50 films and many of them were some of the best of all time. I find so much to love: <br /> <br /> 1) James Stewart, the all-time favorite man of the United States for so many years, does a great job playing with the distressed father right here. He can make any movie enjoyable and, working with such a sympathetic character in such a captivating story, he made me love him very much. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes Doris Day. Despite all the criticism directed against her, I think she makes the woman / loving mother extremely friendly. I disagree with the negative remarks towards his character; it is not because she is gentle and gentle that she is docile and helpless. I do not want to spoil anything, but she makes a crucial discovery all by herself after her husband's failure. It gives the story a warmth that was not at the rendezvous in the first, and for those interested in that, this version is the way to go. And I loved what will be; I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and rightly deserves its Oscar. He raised the film to another level. <br /> <br /> 3) The sequence of Albert Hall. I do not think it was too long at all; I think that the suspense built all this time on this fantastic crescendo and that the direction of Hitchcock in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the assassin was really scary. <br /> <br /> 4) The end really made me smile; even after the end of the aforementioned scene, I found the rescue scene very exciting and it was great to see the lovely family again. The last line of the movie is very funny. I do not think the movie started slowly; Hithcock was trying to make us know and love the McKennas and he did a great job. I was not a big fan of the kid playing Hank, but I did not have a problem with him. Since Hank was the son of Ben and Jo, I cared for him too; it's not like he's a brat or anything. <br /> <br /> I have not found any major flaws in this film and so many major and minor virtues. Way to go Hitch!
