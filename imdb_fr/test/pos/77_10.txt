Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot, Rock Hudson, while on a mission to Germany. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. Both are well matched. Julie shows in this film a more capricious side than the nice girl she plays normally. <br /> <br /> Julie, a half-German, half-English girl, who sings beautiful and entertains the troops during the First World War, sings endearing songs by Mancini. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie. Some would say it's a "chick movie", but never mind. That's wonderful. <br /> <br /> Support characters are somewhat stereotyped. It may not be Rock's performance in Pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession or Giant. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland and authentic WW I aircraft were used in the film. The landscape for England and France is absolutely beautiful.
