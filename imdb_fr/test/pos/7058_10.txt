Yes, it's like in most cases and it sounds like a "special after school", for a slightly more adult audience, maybe a teen audience. But let's add Bill Murray (who has already shown some dramatic talents and his usual comedic talent), a nice cast, and an unexpected sweetness when you grow up, and remember those big or less beautiful days at the summer camp, and you get a comforting, funny, sleeper. <br /> <br /> It gets a little too smarmy for his good, but it's also one of his charms. When you hear the title "Meatballs" and you see the poster, you expect a teenage sexual boil, but you get a sentimental, but sometimes sexy, look at those formative years of the summer camp. The essentiality and memories of simple times remind me of "A Christmas story", which I also love. The memories of the summer camp have never been so well stated. The only film I've ever seen that comes close is "Indian Summer", which I love almost as much as "Meatballs", and which also stars Matt Craven. Let's hope he completes the trilogy. Maybe he could come back for "Return of the Meatballs" and give a little dignity to the franchise (Meatballs 2 to 4 has no resemblance to the original classic). <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" easily gets Top 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty either). It's a wonderful little film that always makes me smile.
