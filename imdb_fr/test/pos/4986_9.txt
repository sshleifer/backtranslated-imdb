One type of western that I really enjoy is the one where the seemingly weak, who hesitates to fight and to take up the challenge of the strong, finally decides that there is no other way. There is a big moment in this movie when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) enters the living room and decides to stand up to the shooter Wade Matlock. This is the type of scene that makes the audience applaud. In my opinion, The Violent Men is a great western, I would rank it among the best. It makes great use of the big screen, a spectacular landscape of the mountains. Women have a crucial role. Caroline (May Winn) is betrothed to Parrish, but you feel like using it only to get out of there and go east. She wants him to sell the ranch at any price. Martha (Barbara Stanwick) is tired of helping her disabled husband, Lee (Edward G. Robinson), but she will do anything to have an ever bigger ranch and more power. In the meantime, she betrays her husband with his brother (Brian Keith). Her daughter Judith (Diane Foster) sees everything that happens but feels helpless to react because she does not want to hurt her father. Parrish brings together all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the military to fight the Anchor ranch. As he warned Lee, "Do not force me to fight because you will not like my way of fighting".
