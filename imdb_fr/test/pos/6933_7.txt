I'm a glutton for B movies. I like the old Drive-In fare like this movie. This film, built for very little money apparently, makes some big budgeted films fail. It's cheezy. It's gore. There is no real plot, but he entertained me for an hour and a half. I laughed or covered my eyes in shock. There are some remarkable effects, such as a shot in the mouth of a man when he is stabbed on the chin by a knife. the eyes escaped. But there are also tons of zombies and psycho killers on the model of the chainsaw massacre in Texas, as well as a demon-possessed scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that killers talk when they torture and kill people. He has great camera work, and some cool editing tips. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it's still inspired by these trash zombie movies nicknamed the '70s and' 80s, and it still has a very high control factor. . Do not expect Romero, just Fulci, who is second-rate. I would say that horror fans will like that, and it's funny, funny and fast and it's fast to get through B-movie Land.
