Minor spoilers will follow. <br /> <br /> This film is even stranger and unconventional than "the songs of the second floor". We do not follow any main character. There is no "conspiracy" in the conventional way. There is no insistence on a happy ending. There is no crowdpleasing. In other words, Roy Andersson is back with a vengeance. Rather than falling back on conventions and fixed formulas, Roy Andersson focuses his film on an idea. I will not go into the details of this idea, but even if you do not get it, I promise you will see the greatest visual depth ever recorded. The majestic scenes of "songs" pale in comparison here. A work of visual splendor. <br /> <br /> So be kind to your neighbor, because after all "we are the living", and only you and I have the power to change our lives. At least that's what I thought when I saw the last scene of the film, with the inhuman bombers flying over the city in the film to take lives. <br /> <br /> And of course, do not forget to watch this movie when it will have a limited release near you. It's one of those movies that have the power to make you a better person, like Sica's "Bicycle Thieves". A very warm and humanist film.
