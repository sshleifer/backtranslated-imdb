"Nuovomondo" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a great extent through dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film in a very visual way. For all he wants to say, he finds powerful images able to defend himself. Thus, he understands the film as a medium that mainly tells his stories about the images on the screen. European cinema, in particular, is often very dialogue-oriented (and many young American and American directors are strongly influenced by this). The opposite attitude of Crialese was really the problem, which made this film special for me. There is also a very interesting subject that can be summed up in a rather unusual story that is told with humor. Vincenzo Amato is remarkable as head of the Salvatore family, as well as for the amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg, whom I love to watch in all his films. There are many great sequences in this movie. Just to pick one: when the ship leaves Italy and people look at it quietly. This scene is excellent, especially if you consider the pop cultural references that go with (Titanic!).
