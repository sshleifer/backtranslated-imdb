All viewers who have seen "The Cure" would agree with me on this comment to say that it is a superb film and that it is hot to the heart. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro prove the quality of their star in this film, alongside the mother of Dexter (Mazzello), Annabella Sciorra. <br /> <br /> When I watched The Cure for the first time on television, I did not know what to expect, but Looking at this masterpiece, we quickly understood what it was was. Dexter, an 11-year-old boy with AIDS, is sitting in his garden playing with his toys. One day, he met his neighbor Eric, a little embarrassing at first for the two boys, but they quickly became good friends. <br /> <br /> During the movie, I wondered what would happen to the two boys, who were asking me. I wondered how on earth they would arrive in New Orleans sitting a door with a sea biscuit underneath, pulling an inflatable crocodile behind. There were other great scenes throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> But the part that touched me was where Dexter's health started to deteriorate. You just could not help but wonder if he was going to succeed, but you'll know it at the end. I thought that at the first joke they played, that Dexter was really dead, he was obviously not stupid. But when they play the third, something is wrong. Dexter does not get up to laugh and shows no type of laughter. At this point, the victim of their farce soon announces that poor Dexter is dead. At this part I lost it. I rolled my eyes and from that scene I cried. You must be right. As the end approaches, you begin to understand Eric's loss and the movie ends on a pleasant note with Dexters shoes floating very slowly along the river. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was excellent. There is laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness, and so on. When you put that in a blender, you get a great movie, you have to watch. Peter Horton did a great job in making this film and I think it's certainly one of his best. But for the moment, I will try to find this movie on DVD, if it exists. Again, a great movie that will take you on an emotional rollercaoster.
