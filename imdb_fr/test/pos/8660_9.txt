What a beautiful movie it was. Is it paradise? hell? or something in between? I disagree with many critics of this movie saying it is a representation of hell. It's not even clear if the opening scene starts the movie or is a flashback from the end. Also, it is not clear that the main character goes to hell, but maybe somewhere in between. The review I read on IMDb says it's a hell, but I totally disagree. Know that good people who commit suicide may not be sentenced to hell ... this unique religious belief. It's really a thinker, and I would / would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of movie. It's really worth it!
