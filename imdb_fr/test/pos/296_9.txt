I saw this film 4 times in 5 months and I do not get tired just because it is perfect. And he also has the best movie music of all time and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you have to like Robert Duval, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie, but especially Duval. I can not believe Kramer versus Kramer won an Oscar instead of this incredible war movie. So that's my conclusion. If you take the director of the biggest film in the world (The Godfather) and the best actors of Hollywood, you will only succeed. Now, I just have to tweak something to get this preview so do not read this except for the last line. The rules of this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
