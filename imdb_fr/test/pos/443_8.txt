I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and I have always enjoyed it. This Can-Can is a true explosion of joie de vivre, like the musicals Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, but French. And a beautiful tribute of Jean Renoir to his time, his friends, his lovers, his music and his dances. It is both a show business chronicle of this age, full of affection and French humor. It is also an obvious tribute to Impressionism (those who love Impressionist painters will love this image). It is in particular a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and, of course, to Jean-Renoir, his father, Pierre-Auguste. Here you will find a reputable, colorful reproduction of some masterpieces by Renoir. Excellent casting, landscapes, sound effects and music. Even if it tells us about the creation of the Parisian Moulin Rouge, it is obviously a story of fiction (and it is not very original in passing, because it is a well-known morality that must continue the series ). But the production of Jean Renoir is excellent. <br /> <br />
