Secondary school. Years and decades later, some see it with affection, others with embarrassment. But few people find it easy to forget. It's one of the most critical phases of our lives, when changes happen quickly and furiously, whether we're ready or not. More children, not yet adults, irresistible forces assault us, pushing us and pulling us in all directions. <br /> <br /> "Fame" did its best to capture this chaotic and chaotic period for its cast of young characters. For the most part, it succeeded. It snaked, but seemed to be a slice of life. This film occupies a special place in the heart of the 1980 promotion. We had just bid farewell to a decade and soon to the end of three or four challenging and sometimes challenging school years. We were heading into the cold and cruel world, leaving the house to go to university and then to unknown places. As we approached our event, this newly released movie was like a two-hour directory for us. We could not escape the titular song on the radio. It was us up on the screen. It was our friends, our rivals and our classmates, because we had faced our own dreams, frustrations, successes and failures. <br /> <br /> This is particularly moving for those who attended one of the most prestigious high schools in New York. , especially Stuyvesant, Bronx HS of Science or Brooklyn Tech. Like the kids here, we were considered the best of the best. We did not audition, but rather rigorous entrance exams. Perhaps even more than the children of the performing arts, we were supposed to change the world, without becoming famous. Like them, we have not done it all. But the pressure cooker environment has fostered an extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps, much like the "Hot Lunch Jam" tapping on the toes in the cafeteria. The day of our graduation, our spirit flew almost like the jubilant crescendo of the catchy finale. The film leaves us on a single triumphant note at the end of "I sing the electric body", showing the blinding and infinite future and all the promises it contained. "Fame" I have not been installed anywhere else. This story would never have worked in a small school or suburban school. Los Angeles has stronger identification with movies and television, but NYC is a haven for all the arts. With not only what was then called PA, but also the world-renowned Juilliard, NYC is a cultural center unmatched in any other city in the world. It is also a time capsule of the rest of the city at the time, showing the endemic addiction, dust and dirt of a New York state that was still struggling with the financial crisis that had nearly bankrupted it. . But above all, it showed vitality, as mitigated by the incursions of Giuliani, Disney and tourism. <br /> <br /> What I would not give to become young again. But with "Fame", at least I can remember how it was.
