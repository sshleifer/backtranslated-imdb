At the time of the DVD, one would think that one could find just about any piece of shit dedicated to celluloid and, for the most part, that's the truth. So, WHY, why is it so hard to find this awesome little movie, made clear by people who love black as a loving tribute (without ever descending into a parodic country) of this genre the most cinematic. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are very much appreciated by Carla Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY) and her up-and-coming superstar who is doing her routine today. <br /> <br /> This movie really has it all for movie fans. JUDAS KISS succeeds on all fronts with brio and black on steroids. <br /> <br /> Please Columbia TriStar PLEASE post it soon on DVD !!!!!!
