Cinema, at its best, is entertainment. If we have to question all the aspects that we can disagree with, and a large part of recorded history is based on contemporary - often biased - opinions, then we have to leave the cinema because their prejudices will always spoil their pleasure. When I spotted a plane flying over a film dated 33BC, I was amused. The backdrop of "Casablanca" is absurdly false. So, do I make a groan and say that the movie failed to convince? Fiona, relax and enjoy an excellent acting game. Wajda's decision to turn protagonists into French and Polish was inspired. we immediately knew which side each of the main characters represented. No need to insist on the authenticity of wigs. It's a powerful cinema. If a political message is still relevant, organize a dinner: a Yquem castle with foie gras; a Puligny Montrachet with the entrance; Polish vodka sorbets and perhaps a 1961 Lafite-Rothschild Castle with beef - and discuss the political aspects of Danton until you fall tired. Danton would surely have accepted?
