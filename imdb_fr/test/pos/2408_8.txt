I have seen this film more than once and it's worth it. For those of you who love martial arts and overcoming internal conflicts, this is a valid choice. After watching this film, I wanted to be a more productive member of society, because I could understand the inner turmoil of a girl in search of acceptance and needing a way forward. Of course, Mr. Miyagi always gives his wise advice. 2 bravo!
