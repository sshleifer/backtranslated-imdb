This is one of those social dramas that WB was able to stage and which was a guaranteed success in the box office of the thirties. These young "dead ends" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. Cagney, a gangster under an agreement, is appointed commissioner of the school. At first, he does not take it seriously, but he changes and makes the changes necessary to improve the lives of boys. The idea is to let the boys govern and administer their community. Whether it's good social reform is beyond my beliefs, but it's a movie. It looks a lot like Boys Town with a slightly darker tone. A happy end useless deluge which impacts the scene before hard but is still good. WB would later make the same movie with Bogart in Cagney / paternal role.
