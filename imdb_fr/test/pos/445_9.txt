This film works at different levels. This is the profile of a very cool couple, a social commentary on retirement homes and retirement homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a few times and every time I look at him, I do not know who to call first. My parents, my wife, a friend with whom I lost contact. . But it allows you to remember the most important relationships in your life and reaffirm those that are going on. Expect a lot of bursts of laughter and probably a few tears if one of the living characters resonates here. I'm sure they will do it.
