Father Hood is an entertaining story of a reluctant father who is definitely a COVER! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles who is a hood always looking for the big "score" that will put him in the easy street. His wife died while in prison and his two children were placed in foster care. When he "went out", he thought they were probably better in foster care ?? in addition he still had to make a fortune. Her daughter Kathleen Charles (brilliantly interpreted by Sabrina Lloyd) escapes from a host institution that mistreats children and diverts money that is supposed to be spent on children. She tracks down her father; tells him how bad the place was and that his brother Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall), "just a 7 year old boy" had been moved to the school where she had just been released and convinced her father to kidnap him . The three men go on an adventure across the country, while Jack continues to tell himself that he has to get rid of the kids! Patrick Swayze is really good in this comedy, playing a "hood" (probably a bit of a euphemism for this criminal character) that looks like Johnny Castle's Dirty Dancing character, except that Jack is more funny in this comedy and more upbeat than Johnny Castle. Swayze is funny and the rally is pretty comedy! Halle Berry interprets Kathleen Mercer, a journalist who tries to discover the truth about the foster care system and becomes Sawyer's ally. Diane Ladd plays Rita, the mean mother of Jack Charles.
