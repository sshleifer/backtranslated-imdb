I have been addicted to "GG" since the middle of 2001-2002 (2nd season), when I logged in to see "Smallville" 10 minutes earlier. Thanks to "Beginnings", I now have all episodes except 2 on tape, until last night (Ep 4.9). I am a mature heterosexual man and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch. <br /> <br /> I like this series for the following reasons: a) Lauren Graham is a damn pretty woman, funny and smart to start; b) the dialogue is extremely well written; c) he is hilarious, shaming the excessive waste such as "Everybody Loves Raymond". Many current television comedies have been heavily influenced by the well-known and despised slime pit known as "Married with Children", which encourages the viewer to mock and feel superior to the characters. In "GG", the characters have flaws, but we can see our weaknesses in them and laugh with them, not them. It's a stimulating TV, where writers ask us to keep up with the fast-paced exchanges and references in popular culture / literature / news off screen. I have a lot of fun watching these episodes again and again, grabbing all the one-liners and references to previous episodes. Stars Hollow is his own little world that I will gladly continue to visit as long as the series is aired.
