Martino, a young teacher from the island of Elba, was trained by Maestro Fontanelli, an excellent educator, to be his own man and to say what he thinks, which puts him in trouble at school where we met him for the first time teaches revolutionary ideals. The island is in frenzy because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in European history of the 19th century. Napoleon arrives at his exile, not really a peak in his life. <br /> <br /> To his surprise, Martino is chosen to accompany Napoleon who writes his memoirs and who needs help for his own project. The young man comes from a family of sea merchants. His brother and sister want him to participate in a commercial expedition, but Martino decided that his place would belong to the Elbe because he would try to assassinate Napoleon. Little deterred him after his mentor, Fontanelli, was tried for treason and sentenced by firing squad. <br /> <br /> Martino is comforted by the much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. In his own interaction with the deposed emperor, a different type of man emerges. Napoleon is perceived as a more human person who really appreciates the company of Martino, without suspecting the plans of the young man. Unfortunately, Martino is not able to realize his project because Napoleon has other projects in mind. <br /> <br /> Paolo Virzi, the director of "Caterina va in citta", shows why her past promise is still there. Mr. Virzi also collaborated on the script based on Ernesto Ferrero's novel. The director shows that he is as gifted in the drama as in this type of show. Alessandro Pesci, the director of photography, does an excellent job with the images he has been able to obtain. <br /> <br /> Elio Germano, a young Italian actor, is the best in the film. He plays against more experienced players, but he manages to convince us that he is the idealistic youngster seeking justice for what he sees as a noble cause. The great Daniel Auteuil is a more moderate Napoleon than one would expect from the interpretation of this larger-than-life man. Monica Belucci is Martino's love interest, but she has little to do. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
