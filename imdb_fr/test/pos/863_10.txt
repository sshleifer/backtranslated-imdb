When I first saw Stella at the center of the comedy, I thought, "My God, it's horrible!" But I liked Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew that something did not make sense. It only remained for me to look for the Stella short film which, I had heard, contained more dildos than any other troupe of comedies. When I found them, not only were my dildo expectations met, but I probably found the best comedy scenes I've seen in years. All twenty short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs. Not only did I laugh the first time I watched them, but I kept laughing louder when I watched them again and again. It's a pity that Comedy Central had the restrictions of cable TV for the Stella series. It would have been much better on HBO or Showtime. Their mark of humor can not be restricted by censorship or popular culture. Even if it was on HBO, I'm sure the "masses" would have voted it off in one season or less, but it would still have been fantastic. Needless to say, I am now in love with Stella and all her members. All Stella fans should check out David Wain's site with all his shorts. They are just as nice as Stella. My hat comes back to Michael Showalter, Michael Ian Black and David Wain for the incredible comedy they made with Stella. I hope to see a lot more of the troop in the future.
