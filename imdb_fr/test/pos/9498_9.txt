This is apparently the first film starring Gloria Swanson - the film that made her an epic star. Although she was good in the film, I do not see how this performance was so remarkable at the time - but it was still a very good movie. <br /> <br /> Gloria plays the wife of a rich slob who always takes it for granted. He cares little about his grooming, eats onions and forgets their birthday! And, at the same time, a Lothario enters their life and begins to pay a lot of attention to Gloria and her nipple husband does not even notice it and gives him no reason not to deceive him. In the end, she divorces her husband and wife Romeo, who speaks well. However, while the film might have been an excessive melodrama (they were quite common at the time), it takes some interesting twists and turns into an imaginative and entertaining film. Even though it's not the biggest silent movie I've seen, it's remarkable and worth remembering. <br /> <br /> By the way, Image Entertainment's DVD release is surprisingly good - with a decent impression and music. This has not always been the case with other versions of Image (especially the way they handled Chaplin versions in a careless way).
