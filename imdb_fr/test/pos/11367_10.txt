It was so long ago (1960), but I have never forgotten this series and I often wanted it to reappear. So, taken with her, I corresponded with Mr. Rathbun, then president of Standard Oil, who sponsored the presentation on PBS. He sent me a picture of the tapestry used (behind a generic) behind the credits. <br /> <br /> At the opening music theme of Bayco's "Elizabethan Mask", my family and I gathered around our black and white TV. to drink in the words of Shakespeare, uttered by a group of excellent players but relatively unknown (at least to the American public of the time). <br /> <br /> We have been introduced to actors such as Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have continued to appreciate their achievements since. One of the most interesting things was how the actors continued to age in their respective roles when Shakespeare's "King" plays were presented, perhaps for the first time, in chronological order. . <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell these actors how important this series was to me. <br /> <br /> If "Age of Kings" could be revived in VHS and / or DVD, it would appeal to those of us who aspire to see her again and those who missed her the first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS! PBS has just released a DVD of "An Age of Kings"! CHECK THE JULY 2009 CATALOG, PAGE 19, OR CALL THEM FREE OF CHARGE. I just ordered mine!
