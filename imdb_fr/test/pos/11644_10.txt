I saw this film many years ago and it never left my list of the best movies of all time. When I watched it for the first time, I was just beginning what has become a long-standing passion for justice. It gave an interesting perspective on the death penalty and also gave me some food for thought. <br /> <br /> When you have a cast like this, you're right to assume it will be nothing short of fabulous. This is by far the best role I have ever seen playing Sean Penn (with me, Sam). He nails the role, does not glorify his actions by doing it. He manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the film that I consider very important. Until the very end, he does not try to be seen as more than he is. He is a sick man who regrets his past, but always seeks excuses. He ends up being able to redeem his self-esteem as much as a convicted (and guilty) murderer through the help of Susan Sarandon's character, Sister Helen Prejean. His character taught me goodwill towards others without making me forget how horrible a person's actions can be and without finding excuses for them. <br /> <br /> The support cast was also top notch. I was surprised to see a little cameo from Jack Black in this movie given the funny man he's become today! I liked this film for personal reasons and just because it was a cinematic work of art. And, in my opinion, this is one of the few exceptions when the film has far exceeded the book.
