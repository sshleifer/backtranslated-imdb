It is an excellent film that tackles the problem of racism in a delicate and balanced way. Sidney Poitier plays a role quite exceptional, but absolutely exceptional. <br /> <br /> It makes you breathe and animate this film. His portrayal of a guy fighting discrimination and violence is simply breathtaking. His play is energetic, delicate and subtle at the same time. Really worthy of an Oscar, Poitier had to wait (because of the color of his skin) for many years before the Academy recognizes the brilliance of his acting. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes also performs a superb performance. removed, troubled and realistic as it became his trademark. He and Poitier oppose inimitable opposition to the forces of cowardice, courage and human transformation through friendship. <br /> <br /> The film is nice and at the same time deeply haunting in its description of racism in the United States. The irony is that it reflects in a way the realities in which Poitier had to work.
