This is an interesting and hard-to-find film from the early 70's, starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who does not cut like a sailor. Dressed in "light blue" outfits to humiliate them on their return home, the failed recruits are fired. Vincent stops in a bar and meets a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour of the Pacific as a hard-core "Raider" Marine. The character of Gere is already jaded and envisioning desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence to steal his "sky blue" uniform after drinking it and hitting him in an alley. The character of Vincent, whose name is Marion, takes over the costume of Gere and suddenly turns into a "Raider" Marine. Marion hitchhikes in Wyoming and stops in a small town in Norman Rockwell. In the local cafe, he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. Staying with the parents Hudkins, Marion attracts all kinds of attention from the townspeople. Mr. Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine "Adventurer" could be so innocent. The story also evokes the Japanese internment camps, while the inhabitants of the cities will "hunt" 3 escapees. Marion is accidentally shot during this hunt. But there is always a happy ending, which confused me a little. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, it captures JMV at the peak of its 70s performance. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70s have been incredibly successful in JMV. He was both an action star and a heartbeat !!! He made a lot of quality films during his career and continued to do so until the mid-80s with the superb TV series Airwolf. He does a very good job as a hedge, quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. He must also have done some waterfalls - there is a heartbreaking river scene at the end of the movie - and it looks like it's the guy who rushes at me to the river! But really, at the height of its popularity, this film could have done much more with the talent and the appearance of JMV. Innocence can only be interesting. The evil, as explored in "Buster and Billie", is much more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is lovely in the role of Rose. The look of the film is like a Norman Rockwell painting. The outdoor scenes are beautiful - they must have been shot in Canada.
