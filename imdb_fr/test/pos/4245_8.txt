Remember when this film was directed by Robert Downey Senior. a very good, entertaining black awareness film, which was an underground hit in california-los angeles and new york at the time. a favorite hippie classic where, the changes that occur in the business world are striking, a refreshing and interesting comedy. good for baby boomers.
