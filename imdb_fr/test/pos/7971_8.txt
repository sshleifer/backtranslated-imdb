An extraordinary action movie that I have never seen. It was the first expression I uttered after watching this show twice on local television in my country, Indonesia. A combination of constant fire and excellent combat choreography interpreted by David Bradley. He was good here, except for "American Samurai". His martial arts skills were above average. He managed to make the fight scenes enjoyable. Not just punches and kicks like what most martial artists show in their movies. David Bradley could use all martial arts techniques such as throwing, crushing and kicking. Highly recommended for action fans. I tried to get the DVD, but I still can not get it, especially in my city. Can someone help me?
