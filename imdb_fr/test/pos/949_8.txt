Tamakichi Anaru's "Tumbling Doll of Flesh" is a shocking Japanese story about three thugs who abuse, torture and mutilate a young woman while filming their horrific actions. no intrigue to speak of, just a lot of hard basic sex scenes (again censored) and a lot of blood. The special effects are pretty impressive. The dismemberment of the Japanese porn actress is shown in every detail. His arm is also cut off and his stomach is cut off graphically and finally one of the sickos has sex with his intestines. "Psycho: The Snuff Reels" actually reminds me of "Guinea pig: flesh and blood flowers", not so memorable.So, if you're a fan of ultra-depraved Japanese sickies like "All women are whores" or "Raping My Virgin Slave", take a look at it. 8 out of 10
