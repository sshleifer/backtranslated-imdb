OKAY. A warning for anyone who is a parent or guardian. Pay attention to who you see this movie - ie. - DO NOT TAKE CHILDREN TO WATCH THIS FILM. I will explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - the title is misleading and the movie has nothing to do with romance - I guess it was quite intentional on the part of the producers, but boring 2 - the movie itself even is really very disturbing. I have some problems. First, the film is neither violent nor sexual and is not a "horror film". But it's a very disturbing film that involves a child, his parents and a small town. <br /> <br /> OK, that's all. The film is not suitable for minors because it contains disturbing and confusing sequences and images for a child. It's weird, and it's ONLY because he has a child that makes me feel it's inappropriate. As a parent myself, I feel enough that I want to tell people because I only read the other day that it will be released in theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope I do not offend the filmmakers by saying that, but I think it's my right, because it is released and has only a note M. (because it is not is neither violent nor sexual) Just strange and disturbing but pretty good in itself.
