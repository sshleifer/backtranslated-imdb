There is a great danger when you watch a film that has so marked you the first time that, 20 years later, it will not have the same magic as before. I must admit that I did not expect him to be as good as I remembered, but was pleasantly surprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still as fantastic as I remember when I was 12 years old. This film has a certain type of brilliance that few films possess. It's captivating, it's great, and above all, it makes me feel like a child again and there are not many things that can do it. The roles of John Albasiny and Abigail Cruttenden in this film are 1st class and I had forgotten how good they were until now. I urge all parents of teenagers to look at them and see if it has the same effect on them as on me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 of 10.
