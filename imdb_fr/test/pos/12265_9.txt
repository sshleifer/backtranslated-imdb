I sit watching movies and not seeing anything that I want to see. My appetite keeps saying, "Something like BROADCAST NEWS." This is what I want. Something clever and fun, with ideas from adults, great actors and writers, and a directorial style that is unmistakable. It may be Hurt's best performance (is that or THE BIG CHILL, in my opinion): as eccentric as possible, Hurt is clever, and play an unintelligent character without making sure - wink wink - the public knows - wink wink - - hey, I'm not stupid ... well, it's going to play there. Hunter is a perfect note and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Excellent and excellent work. <br /> <br />
