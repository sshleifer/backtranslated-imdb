I just saw that at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most wonderful film - the best I've seen in a long time. The seductive character of Isa is an open, exploring and (as the film remarks) in love - portrayed without complacency by the beautiful Camille Natta. The music that accompanies it is soothing and transporting, a balm for the soul. <br /> <br /> Each character seems to be in conflict one way or another - and their interactions (with conflicts) make it a beautiful story. The story told by A.K. Hangal as the old man was done by magic - I wanted it to last again and again. <br /> <br /> This Hari seemed to remember his "place" throughout his story to give more power to the story - a refreshing change in the bubble at the head of many modern writers. <br /> <br /> To all, an excellent movie. Will see.
