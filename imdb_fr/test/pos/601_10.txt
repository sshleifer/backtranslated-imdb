First of all, I would like to say that this film is the greatest thing that has happened to humanity. This is the best of all the excellent Muppet movies, and all the other movies that exist! So BOO-YA for Jim Henson! <br /> <br /> This movie is the first of all Muppet movies and the best. (boo ya) This is a frog (kermit) trying to get to Hollywood. Two of the greatest songs ever written that will become classics, including "the rainbow connection", as well as the great friends he meets during his life, <br /> <br /> finally, I would like to say in watching this movie the movie was the greatest thing ever! If you have not already seen it, then go out of your computer and connect to the nearest video library !!! (If they do not have the movie muppet, I will sue them BIG TIME)
