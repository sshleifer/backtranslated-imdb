Intrigue: Ed and Alice are engaged. They live together and live dull lives. He slept before meeting Alice. She has a lot less experience. She decides that she must sleep before getting married. He very reluctantly agrees that they should both see other people for a while. <br /> <br /> At first, he is not really interested. His wild days are behind him and he's just happy. Until the day Alice comes back and tells her that she came out with some guy; which of course begins to fall for her. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a bad idea that causes extreme tension in the relationship. <br /> <br /> Good movie. You can see the sinking of the train arrive but it's still good. <br /> <br /> Worth a rental.
