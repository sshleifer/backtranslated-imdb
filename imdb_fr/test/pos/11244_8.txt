This is an excellent show despite many negative reviews. The goal of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys are competing for a girl's phone number. Simple. The pleasure in this show is to watch both men try to reach their goal. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to hate the series for a variety of reasons, but I think they misunderstood that it was an "educational" show about how to get girls. Well it's not the case, it's a humorous show, and the main thing is to make you laugh, not to teach you anything. If you do not like the show, because it does not teach you anything, do not look at it. If you do not like all the clubbing, do not look at it. If you do not like socializing, do not look at it. This show is a comic show. If you look at other people taking girls, well, that does not make you laugh, so do not look at them. If you are so disappointed with yourself after watching this show and realized that you do not have the ability to "catch" girls, there is no reason to hate her, but do not look at her!
