As soon as I saw the "Changi" advertisement on the History Channel, I knew I would love it. It fantastically captivated the ANZAC spirit - you would die if you did not have companions around you. The characters in "Changi" were strong and everyone brought something different in the story, and the Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but were described as normal soldiers doing what they thought was right, as did the Australians. The staging, the screenplay, the acting and the set have all been done wonderfully, with a clear and easy-to-follow scenario. Humor was the key to the survival of the soldiers and it was great to see a mini-series about the war containing a kind of humor, which is usually difficult to do without offending people. From what I read about the Changi camp soldiers, this story is a very realistic three-and-a-half year approach by the Australians, British, New Zealanders, Americans and Dutch. I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in the war or not. 10/10.
