Very beautiful movie! I used to run the channels on my television, and I do not usually know the channels that broadcast drama, but then I saw that channel that is showing old school movies, and this is where I saw that movie. At first, when I saw the title "The Cure", I thought it was going to be boring, but I got hooked when I saw that Brad Renfro was in this movie (because of one of my favorite movies of all time, "The Client" where Brad also stars). Then the scenes became better and better. The story is so beautiful and so touching! I cried a lot in this film, which I do not usually do. Super casting! and there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this film that is very striking and made me cry loud! Now I bought my own copy on DVD and I always recommend it to everyone!
