The history of pre-unified China must be popular. The hero of Jet Li made popular the assassination of the king. <br /> <br /> This is another story made a few years ago. He stages the incredible beauty of Li Gon (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2046, Vice of Miami) as a lover of the king, who was sent to recruit an assassin so that the king could defeat him. She recruits Fengyi Zhang but falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> Be that as it may, he is not able to carry out his mission because the king knew it before. I suspected him too, but he was still going. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story with massive military operations and, of course, another chance to see Li Gong.
