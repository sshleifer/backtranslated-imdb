It was a wonderful little film that was really creative and entertaining - something you rarely see in the movies. The film begins in Russia just after the fall of the communist government. As a result, society seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone. Dirty cities, crime and lack of housing still weigh on the poor inhabitants of St. Petersburg. <br /> <br /> In this scene of moroseness and uncertainty is added an idealist music teacher. He is one of the homeless and receives FINALLY a letter from the government informing him that he has a small room in a neighboring apartment. When he arrives, the place is messy, but people look friendly enough to make everyone have a great party. In the middle of the night, they are awakened by an old lady coming out of the giant wardrobe of the room (I almost expected to see Lucy and the other children of THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE go out, but they do not did not do so. They are too shocked to do anything at first, but soon decide to investigate. Instead of being a simple wardrobe, the wardrobe opens on Paris! The way the residents of the apartment respond to this magical bridge is really intriguing. Some, like the music teacher, are thrilled and impressed. Most of the others are more pragmatic and are especially concerned with looting everything from Paris before the final closure of the portal! These Russian thieves are frightful people - greedy, coarse and gross but very deep - VERY DEEP - are golden hearts. I love how it is a metaphor for the nation on the brink of capitalism. At first, they are completely crazy, they catch everything they can and only later they reveal a little depth - but they act mostly as guests of THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW! The film has a lot of twists and is both funny and hypnotic. The only negative is that because of a hard language and a naked scene (although it is very funny), this film is not intended for children. It's a shame, because with a very minor editing, it could have been a good family film.
