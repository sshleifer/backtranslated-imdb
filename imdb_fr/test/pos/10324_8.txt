Clyde Bruckman borrows the principle of this short film from Buster Keaton's "Seven Chances," which has recently been reluctantly relaunched as "The Bachelor". In the original, Buster has 24 hours to get married in order to be able to inherit a large sum of money. In this version, the music teacher prof. Shemp only has 7 hours (after all, it's a short film!). This is one of the best Stooges shorts because of its history and wonderful routines (including the phone booth scene with Moe & Shemp, reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy's "Berth Marks" and the famous Marx Brothers' cabins in "Night At The Opera - Here Boys Factor in Their Variation in this Routine." I'm not a big fan of Stooges, but this one should be noted by any comedy student as being one of their best since the short film of the 30s.
