Okay, the other commentators have pretty much covered the gist of this little gem, namely that the story started in life as a material for Buster Keaton's classic "7 Chances" silent. Comedy, or playing in any genre for that, is simply to interpret a scene and lines that someone else has written and interpreted before, if not a totally original creation. Here we have the Stooges, which are essentially material that has been written and performed by someone else and yet, for a small budget and a short film, they manage things well. Regardless of what the credits say about their movies, the true "stooge-philes" know that they have contributed a lot to the lines and direction. They took their job as seriously as a surgeon performs a vital operation. Words spoken by Emil Sitka himself in a documentary about boys. Here, what seems to be their usual anarchy about something as simple as getting married, is actually organized chaos. Each line is perfectly synchronized with an associated physical action. How many comedians today can claim such mastery? Obviously, the Seinfeld team, but no other I've seen in the last 35 years of television. Critics will always "poo" the Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others, but again ... who ever remembers the names of the critics or what they said? Just watch, laugh and enjoy!
