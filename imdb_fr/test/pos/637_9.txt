It's still a known and important director's device to create the atmosphere of a movie in the first 5 minutes. In the first crucial scenes, the film should assert itself and draw the viewer's attention to the rest of the film. Here in "Mute Witness" we find an excellent example. <br /> <br /> * Stage Spoiler * <br /> <br /> In the first 5 to 10 minutes, the film opens to a Hitchcock Scene of a pretty blonde woman in her apartment, with the radio on. She wanders, applies lipstick, combs her hair and ignores the report of a serial killer on the run. Of course, the serial killer is at home and monitors her movements, knife in hand. She hears a noise, looks in a room and her partner is in a pool of blood. At the very moment she screams, she turns to face the maniac wielding the knife, which stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act .... <br /> <br /> ... then something of 'strange happens. As the woman gets angry, the murderer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim perish. Before finding his lighter, his cigarette is lit ... by someone else in the room! The camera is panning, and we realize that there are more and more people in the room, some taking notes, others filming, some recording the death, and that the lady takes a lot of time to to die and doing a very painful job. of that too. When the audience realizes what is happening and the whole scene is part of a movie, the suspenseful and horrible scene takes on a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> * End Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> I highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. First, it perfectly portrays the atmosphere of the entire movie. A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma, with moments very exotic and even nostalgic. - It addresses a central topic (that of the difference between a "screen death" and a "film death", a subject that will be developed later in the film) and, finally, it presents the character to the characters, the most silently possible. <br /> <br /> The plot of Mute Witness is centered on Billy Hughes, an American makeup artist specializing in special effects who works on the film and is shot in a big warehouse in Moscow. . Billy can not speak, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. At the end of the shoot, Billy inadvertently finds himself in the warehouse. In his attempt to escape, two members of the team realize what appears to be a porn movie, but turns out to be a movie snuff. Suddenly, leaving the warehouse is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely captivating. The saving grace of Billy and her disability is the fact that she can not make a sound. (In fact, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it is not filled with women screaming). There are some very disturbing moments and some beautiful scenes of suspense (The corridor and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). The timing is fluid and the entire first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film introduces new concepts. Although there are still many moments of suspense, the focus is on twists and turns. New characters are introduced, and it is ambiguous to know which side they are. Although there is nothing wrong with the second half of the movie, it just does not fit the first half. There are beautiful moments of black humor that juxtapose and perfectly punctuate very dramatic scenes, but there are also moments of comedy very nil (coming specifically from the sister of Billy and his fianc√©e, who happens to be the director of the film Billy is working on), which almost ruins the film, simply because they are misplaced and / or misinterpreted and ruin the rhythm. - In the end, the twists continue to arrive at a fast speed and the climax of the film is, appropriately, as tense as that of the first half. <br /> <br /> Several elements really make the film. job. The communication barriers that Billy faces, both as a mute and as an American in Moscow, make even an urgent appeal for help a dangerous situation. Actress Billy, Natasha Zudina, does a great job in the film, with an engaging presence on the screen and a brilliant performance, and finally the staging as a whole, but especially in the first half of the year. film, which is really a study of Alfred Hitchcock's thriller / thriller film techniques. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the failures in the film come from terrible moments of comic relief that do not really need to be added. There is already a coherent and effective band of black humor that appears in the film without the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (The Sister and the Director) transforming their scenes into an unusual sit-com. However, despite these shortcomings, the movie is a very nice thriller, ideal for a group visit to Halloween. (Certainly better than the usual slasher horror movie ...!)
