This film is entitled "Junior Pilot" here on IMDb but "Final Approach" to Netflix. Go understand! The film is a delight for the target audience of young people and for adults who can mature enough long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth. For the adult, the story is fairly predictable and perhaps banal and melodramatic; while the story may seem new and creative to young people who have not yet seen or read many movies or books with such stories. <br /> <br /> In all cases, we must thank the creators of the film, especially the director James Becket and the director of photography Denis Maloney, for making this film very entertaining and visually interesting. The phantasmagoric thoughts of Ricky's young protagonist are both hilarious and deliciously filmed. <br /> <br /> The young actors play quite credible performances, apparently very invested in their roles - as stupid as many scenes. Jordan Garrett plays the protagonist "Ricky" with great, having an excellent presence in the camera. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a deliciously sweet and sensitive "Shashi" that, of all ridiculous things, feeds on pungent sauce. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley also offer solid performances. <br /> <br /> As his role always makes him play well, Larry Miller creates a strong parental figure around which turns the world both real and fantasy of children. Compared to his father figure, the other major roles for adults seem to be superficial and one-dimensional, intentionally and with humor, so, of course. <br /> <br /> This film is a simplistic story aimed at young people, of course, it is quite fun, maybe several times, for the targeted audience of young people, but also for at least a viewing by adults who retain the ability to watch such a film from the point of view of their youth.
