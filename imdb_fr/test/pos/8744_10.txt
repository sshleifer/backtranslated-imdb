I remember seeing it when it was done and thinking it was brilliant at the time. Looking at it for the second time almost 20 years later, I still think that Traffik is brilliant and much better than the American movie based on this drama. <br /> <br /> It should also be watched by all our past parties today. the politicians of tomorrow who think they can win the war on drugs, because the issues raised in this film are as relevant today as in the late 1980s and, unless they change their policy, they will be in 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well written, well done, beautifully interpreted and superbly filmed. A provocative drama that entertains and highlights some of the harsh realities of drug trafficking.
