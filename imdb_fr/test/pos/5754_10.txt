I own this movie on DVD and have watched it about 10 times, and it's still funny. The jokes will never be boring and I often burst out laughing at inappropriate moments. The principle is that Richard and Eddie Bottom are the owners of the cheapest hotel in Britain, next to a nuclear power plant. They desperately need money and when a movie star hides to stay, their luck may be out. . Some would say that only hardcore fans really like to watch it. But overall it's a good movie.
