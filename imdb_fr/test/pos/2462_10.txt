The time of the Vietnam War is certainly well before my time, but it has always interested me and I have seen many films about it. All the others I had seen had dealt strictly with the front line. When I read a description of "The War At Home", I found the concept intriguing. No film about the Vietnam War that I had ever heard talked about what would happen to a soldier once the fighting was over. <br /> <br /> One night, flipping through the channels, the film was broadcast on Sundance. I put the remote in and sat down to watch it. I did not move from my seat for two whole hours; it's one of those movies that interests you a lot, because there is no way to predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This film made me a big fan of Emilio Estevez. I really enjoyed it as Billy the Kid in the "Young Guns" movies, but I never saw anything he did later. Emilio was very good at writing and directing, as well as acting. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film is extremely well done. I have a hard time thinking about a point where it's hanging out. <br /> <br /> What amazes me is that he was not rewarded by an Oscar or any real recognition at his release. It is a dramatic story of parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not what he was and will probably never be as they remembered him. Well worth a visit.
