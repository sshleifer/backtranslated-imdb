At the moment we see Monica Dolan (in a really great casting) doing the delicious trick when Cora was already hooked, it is only later that she reveals herself in her wonderful screen creation that disturbs, the evil queen of murder and deceit, pretending to be Miss Gilchrist, tense, not only does she effortlessly steal the entire movie, she simply throws out all who approach her, including the very measurable David Suchet , who himself seems to be dazzled by his acting skills and, very gentlemanly, allows him to take center stage. Dolan is the real driving force of the film and her maid Gilchrist is a truly complete character in this Christie rendition, aided by a playful script and rhythmic direction - as well as by the rest of the cast led by Geraldine James and Dominic Jephcott, who all signs of sympathy for the given material and play with pleasure accordingly. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are as usual, and if there are weaker links, they could be located in the music score comparatively below the standards of the majority of subsequent Poirots, and can -being also the absence of a true actor of Italian origin for the role of the husband of Cora. Apart from that, it's an hour and a half of pure TV delight that is as indulgent and entertaining as love.
