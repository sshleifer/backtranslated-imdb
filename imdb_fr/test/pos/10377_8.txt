This film was for me a pretty nice watch, I mean it was not great, but it was one of the best horror movies of recent times. He seems to have been weak, almost the size of the state benefits budget, but he has his charms like pretty ladies. The atmosphere was good too (which is what is missing in hell many horror movies these days). The acting game was the business of your typical small budget of the 80s, namely in case you do not know it, it's a "game". But that's what Lucio Fulci's films were full of. This film had an atmosphere they lacked in terms of script, money, etc. They compensated largely in the horror and the gore atmosphere of the film is itself. <br /> <br /> It's just a typical low-budget horror movie that I can watch, I've watched it all the time and I love horror movies. I've seen movies where I've just been shutting down in 10 to 20 minutes or sitting down and moving fast if it's on video, or if the scene is ignored on the DVD. This film did not make me want to do that, I sat down and watched it all the way, not wanting to skip passages. <br /> <br /> I would have liked it if the type of zombie folk was a little more scary because they were as scary as having Freddy Kreuger as your babysitter, no. But seriously, if they had been a little better, it might have been a low budget perfection. <br /> <br /> The music of this film was of the highest quality, an ideal horror music. I've seen horror movies where the music is good or average, but it could have been better, fortunately this movie did not contain Metal music. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of hardcore metal since 1990, but in horror movies music spoils it, the movie loses a lot of atmosphere when another type of music is played. So I'm glad there is no music in this movie other than your typical score that was rather scary and well done. <br /> <br /> He could have used "Profane Grace - Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams" on it. As keyboard music, no guitar, nothing but keyboard tracks really "scary". As on track 1 "Forever Sleep", you hear the wind blowing through it and a music that causes the goosebumps that follow. The track on this cd is still the same, the perfect horror music at its best, it would be perfect for this movie. <br /> <br /> The only unattractive girl in the movie I was the one who was stung on / was killed (or so we are led to believe) and hung like a scarecrow, only to break free and try to escape later. All the other women in the movie were charming, with a whopping 9 out of 10, with the exception of the one I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> I wish Hollywood (the general public) gives money to Romero and the guy who made this movie. It's much better to give them that to the movies than to give it to a stupid idiot called Paul Anderson, the "nasty resident". <br /> <br /> Well done, it's not bad, not bad at all, I loved the endgame part when they continued to show you clips making the movie (behind the scenes) movies do that sort of thing, which, I think, has added a little bit to the movie, because it has also shown you go out and it's always a good thing if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Note for this film 8/10, Note for the beautiful ladies of the film 9/10, Note for the atmosphere in the film 9/10 film, note for the score of the film 9.5 / 10.
