One of my desires is to be a filmmaker and I just have to say that I will never be able to compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is that the acting is perfect, and when you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is to watch this movie; I am so involved and extremely impressed. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Estevez and Sheen on the screen was absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> And his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). 2. <br /> <br /> As well as the relationship between Sheen and her daughter, Estevez's sister in the film. <br /> <br /> 10/10, and certainly in my top 10. I want the DVD!
