"Do not torture a duck" (1972) is a thriller of grade A master horror Lucio Fulci. In this one, someone has strangled teenagers in a rural village in southern Italy and, typical of these gialli, there are many suspects. There is Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia), looks more succulent than you've ever seen, a rich girl who hides after a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), the local veiled epileptic woman; his handsome sorcerer; Giuseppe, the local idiot; the priest with his sweet face; his mother; And so on. The film features particularly violent scenes, including flogging of one of the main characters in a graveyard (one of the bloodiest sequences I've ever seen) and a nice dukeout when the murderer is finally revealed. The film's outbursts of violence compensate for the fact that there is no fright or suspense as such. Yet this giallo fascinates with its unusual rural decor, murders of troubling children, strange characters and terrifying Rice Ortolani score. The film was beautifully photographed in what I presume to be Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic, in southern Italy (at least, the police of this city is thanked in the closing credits). And if subtitling would have made this beautiful DVD even more powerful (the American slang does not convince in this rural Italian setting), we must thank Anchor Bay for another job well done. Oh ... this title makes sense!
