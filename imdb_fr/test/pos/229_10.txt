One night I was listening to talk on the radio and Leslie Nielsen was on the program. He then explained why there were only 6 shows. '<br /> <br /> With TV shows like MASH, you can have a beer in the fridge and as long as you hear what's going on, you will not miss anything. But with Police Squad, you MUST watch the show, with the jittering view, you miss a lot if you do not see them. Who could forget "... the part of the city known as" Little Italy "..." with the Colosseum in the background. <br /> <br /> Even the movies bet on visual gags, but in the theater you were a captive audience. <br /> <br /> Leslie also said that the only reason the series, movies and other movies like Airplane were fun was that they did not try to say what was funny. It was up to the viewer to understand the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, these are just my two cents.
