Another of Kickboxers' countless films "Fight to the death to distract the wealthy" that existed so often in the 90s ... You know, those created by taking the words "Death", "Blood" and 'Steel' and the words 'Ring', 'Fight', 'Match' and 'Cage' and put them in a random generator! However, Death Match is a very good entry into the overused genre, thanks to its thrilling fight scenes and the amazing quality of its kickboxer cast. <br /> <br /> The story is about two buddies - ex World kickboxing champion, John Larson (played by Ian Jacklin, the middleweight champion of kickboxing players, probably better known before for his terrible performance as the main villain of Ring of Fire 2) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, a friendly guy probably best known Sergio, street fighter in Bloodsport 2), who works at the Los Angeles docks to load crates on ships. After finding a box full of rifles and a brief fight later, our two heroes are unemployed and hold a LA bar. Sensitive John Larson decides to head north and look for a job; Nick Wallace has heard of a guy who pays a lot of money for fighters to fight at private kickboxing matches. "Why should things change?" John said, "If you need me, I'll be here." Predictably, Nick quickly disappeared and his good friend fights in the murderous circle of death to try to find a track to his missing friend. <br /> <br /> Indeed, there is Here, no price for originality, but as I said before, the strength of this film lies in its action, in its distribution of real fighters and in the pretty good performance he manages to draw. Ian Jacklin in particular surprised me. Previously, I had just seen him as the villain in Ring of Fire 2 and in binary parts like The Steel Ring, and I've always been pretty amused to see how good he is an actor (good fighter!). But in Death Match, it's pretty good! With a decent writing and a haircut, he turns out to be quite the charismatic leader! And his friendship with Nick is very well portrayed. Jacklin and Hill have great chemistry and you really believe that these two characters are interested in each other. Enough for one of them to lose a job, travel to the other end of the country and risk death to save the other - I'd like to have a friend like that! <br /> <br /> It was also nice to see Matthias Hues as a naughty man with a little more depth than we used to see in his many roles as "ugly henchman" . However, do not be fooled into thinking that he is the star just because he is on the jacket of the video (with, it seems, his head stuck to Michael Bernardo's body of the cover of Shootfighter) - he is good when he is on the screen, but he <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the film is quite slow when there are no fights, with many useless scenes (what happens Does it have the useless story of gangster Jimmie Fiorello about his grandfather?)), and the final fight is disappointing, but overall, I enjoyed! Many fights, most good. Is not that all we really need? And of course, candy for the eyes, here in the beautiful shape of the very pretty Renee Ammann. All in all, a pretty entertaining kickboxing movie.
