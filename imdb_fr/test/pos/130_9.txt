What makes "Fire" even more appealing to look outside of her magical art is her touch of feminism and rebellion. To me, the very character of Shabana Azmi is a symbol of Indian feminine protest against Indian society. The name of the film and the scene where Radha walks in the flames of her kitchen are emblematic of Sita, the wife of Lord Rama of Hindu mythology, walk in the fire to find evidence of her immaculation, according to the same story that appears also in the film. The film could be a great source of inspiration for women, especially those in the subcontinent, to seek their freedoms and take control of their lives.
