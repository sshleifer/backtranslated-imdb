I thought I was going to watch another Friday the 13th or a Halloween scam, but I was surprised, that's about 3 psychopath kids who kill, there are not many movies like this- I can think of Mikey, Children Of The Corn and a few others, this is not the biggest horror movie but it is a rent that is worth the least.
