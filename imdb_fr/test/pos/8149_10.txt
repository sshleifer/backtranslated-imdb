Apart from the main character, the acting did not convince me, but the story was pretty good: it's a love story between a gay party animal and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and, as such, has some metaphysical nuances to counterbalance its criticisms of religious intolerance. But some stories are hilarious: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague: "Do you believe in God?" And he answers, "do you mean: other than Madonna?" Overall, the movie is not one of my favorites of all time, but the script is really good and I really liked it: it's fun and resists (religious) prejudice and intolerance . I think this is an important message in our time. Since I rated the movies I liked the least with 9, it's clearly a 10 for me. Some people may find this exaggerated, but I think this film deserves it.
