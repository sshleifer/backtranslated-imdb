Körkarlen (1921), a cult classic film among silent films, directed by Victor Sjöstrøm, who also plays the male lead, is based on a story by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of the brutal drinker David Holm, who beats his wife, neglects his children, encourages his brother to drink and is blind by the love of Nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). David sits by the end of the year with his friends boozing in the city park and tells the story of the ghost chariot (Körkarlen): who dies on the night of New Year's Eve as the last before dawn must serve a year as a driver of death and free the dying souls from their bodies. But David struggles with his friends, suffers a bleeding and collapses on the ground. Meanwhile, the ghost carriage is approaching. The driver is none other than David's late friend, Georges, who seduced him into alcohol and died a year ago. Since David refuses to get in the car, George forces him. Together, they drive to resorts where people who have suffered from David live. They visit the nurse Edit, of whom he was unable to recognize the love for David and to whom he contracted tuberculosis and who is dying. But his unconditional love for David will save his soul. Filled with her spirit, they join David's wife and children. David can prevent his wife from killing herself and her children, because she does not see the way out of the misery into which David has thrown her. They also visit David's brother, who committed a murder after being seduced by David. David asks George to return to his body, because he finally realized that his path was bad. Since it was George who had seduced him once to drink, David's wish is granted, he has a second chance and George must be one more year driver of the Phantom Carriage to be able to pay his own sins. This film probably belongs to the strongest and most impressive films ever made. In a deplorable way, it is still not available on international DVD.
