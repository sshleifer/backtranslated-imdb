I must admit that I did not have the opportunity to see this film at the theater. Released at the beginning of the summer season, this cute little movie could not help but get lost in the shadows of multi-million dollar special effects movies, did not it? <br /> <br /> "Return to Me" has a simple and charming story and is extremely well directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been an actress in several major movies herself ... with this one! This charming story is beautifully woven with brilliant comedies and animated by superb performances of veterans and younger actors. <br /> <br /> For those who say that David Duchovny has not really managed to get out of his mold "Fox Mulder", I agree. I saw his other movie and this is by far the best thing he could have done for himself. Minnie Driver is simply beautiful, charming, funny and alive in her Grace role. <br /> <br /> Apart from these two main characters, however, you are surrounded by family and friends very close to Grace. Jim Belushi is an absolute point, Bonnie Hunt is a stable and real force. However, I can not go without mentioning the talents of Robert Loggia and dear late Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I have not watched this movie on DVD until the day before his death. It was his last film, and he gave a performance that an actor of his caliber could certainly be proud to leave as the end of a great career. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Return To Me" turned what could have been. It was always a fun love story, and I made it a movie that has become one of my favorites! Take the time to rent this one ..... it's worth it!
