Mike Nichols in better shape. I was not a fan of "Closer", so it's refreshing to see him again with this comedy in the darkest circumstances. A single slip could have annihilated this convincing image, but Nichols and his very strong distribution of A-list never got into the trap in this biopic of a deeply flawed but absolutely convincing Congressman. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is brilliant and brilliant - here you play a damaged but ultra-intelligent CIA manipulator, and it's in the exchanges between the characters of Hanks and Hoffman that comedy takes off. It is rare that the humor of the film bursts of laughter, but that it is also intelligent ... It arrives constantly with a satirical point which makes you laugh and cry about the state of the world (often simultaneously). <br /> <br /> Another major advantage is the length of the photo. The film is based on George Crile's big book of the same title. The temptation of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame is "The West Wing") must have been to make a big film, but we get a breathtaking 90 minutes of great history with profound implications. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen and recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest subjects and the light touches of its sparkling and witty scenario - even if it eliminates the obvious connection that exists between the help that Herring and Wilson provide and the ultimate consequences (9/11).
