The performances of the male leaders make this long and difficult western journey interesting. The soundtrack of the Pioneer Sons is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard. The trip itself is somewhat episodic and Joanne Dru is misinterpreted. All in all, it's a very comforting and sincere western.
