Honestly, I must say that A CAT IN THE BRAIN is one of the hottest and most hilarious movies I have ever seen. This film is full of stupid dialogues, ridiculous scenes and a plot involving the legendary horror director Lucio Fulci himself. <br /> <br /> The story is about an aging director (Fulci, also named Lucio Fulci in the movie ...) who starts to go crazy and hallucinate because of all the evil things that he has put in the movie in recent years. He goes to a psychiatrist who hypnotizes Fulci and tells him that he thinks he is a killer, but that it is the psychiatrist who commits the murder. The rest of the film is composed of shots of the "film" that Fulci makes during all this action, scenes of shrinking killing people while smiling like a fleeting fool, and certain sequences of hallucinations of Fulci. Oh, and some tits thrown for good measure too ... <br /> <br /> A CAT IN THE BRAIN is completely ridiculous and ridiculous in every way. The gore is classic Fulci - nasty and strong with really decent scenes. The chainsaw cut of a corpse is pretty cool, as is the chainsaw decapitation of a little boy. Many stab wounds, gougings and other cool killing scenes make it a non-stop bloodbath. The ridiculous dialogue (LICK IT !!!! LICK IT !!!), as well as some incredibly zany scenes (the Nazi orgy, the opera singing slap-fest and the fall of an innocent hippy come easily to the mind ...) make this one fun like hell. Not as dark as some of Fulci's other films - CAT is rather a self-indulgent horror comedy that, if not funny, was rather sad. I say grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in this one. I watched CAT with some friends and we laughed all the time. This is the film of well-being of the summer ... Recommended 8/10
