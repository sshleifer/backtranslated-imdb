Some thoughts before getting to the heart of the film: 1) I had never seen so many bare breasts in a movie before, presented in so many non-sexual scenes - it was weird; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where were you? You charmed us in * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare in Love *, and then you left for a while. The American mainstream wants more! Okay, I'm a college English teacher, I've read this piece many times and it's probably the best movie version I've ever seen. Although some aspects of other productions have been able to stand out, that's all. Pacino is not Olivier, but he does not need to be, so let it go! The cinematography of the film is amazing and not just because of bare breasts. Venice is incredibly portrayed and you really feel like you're really here. The residential island of Portia is incredibly beautiful and the lighting is always tinted to match the moods of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Anti-Semitism in this film / this piece is hard to watch, especially at the end. The fact that Pacino drops to his knees and grabs his religious artefact is perhaps the most powerful moment of his film since * The Godfather Part III * (when Michael's daughter is shot on the stands of the opera). Is the game anti-emetic? Sure. Is Othello racist? Sure. Take it for what it is: a comment on the Elizabethan era, not a comment on today. <br /> <br /> Fiennes is underused in the film, but remains a pleasure to watch. The women in the film are doing well; No one has really stood out here, but they blend well into the landscape. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent in both the juiciest roles, the opponents to the end. I always felt that irons were underestimated (I still have shivers when I hear his voice from * The Lion King *), and Pacino is Pacino.
