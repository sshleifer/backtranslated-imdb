It does not happen very often, but sometimes only one man can tell the difference - a big difference. <br /> <br /> The 2003 George Crile bestseller CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a fascinating and telling tale of the most unlikely "difference maker" imaginable. A relatively obscure Congressman in the Texas Second District, "Good Time Charlie" was better known for his libertine lifestyle than for his libertarian legislation. Sympathetic and licentious (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well, because the good people of Lufkin only wanted two things: their weapons and to be alone. It's Easy Street full of her world of belt beauties known, rightly, as Charlie's Angels. <br /> <br /> When asked why all of her office staff are alluring young helpers, her answer is a classic: "You can teach them to type, but you can not teach them how to do it. to grow breasts. "No discussion in there. <br /> <br /> But even the fiercest kidnapper has an awareness hidden somewhere below, and for Charlie Wilson, the unimaginable atrocities committed in Afghanistan led him to muster all his political wisdom to fund all his passions . the defeat of the Russian army and perhaps even help to hasten the end of the cold war. Big luck, huh? <br /> <br /> Under the clever direction of Mike Nichols and Adam Sorkin's clever and percussive script, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that tells the story behind the scene. Colorful characters including "Charlie's Team". <br /> <br /> The on-screen team consists of three wonderful actors with four (4) Oscars and nine (9) nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid and slightly sober fashion that is among his best achievements in years. He is helped, encouraged and locked up by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston company played by Julia Roberts. Why does the bikini scene take place to let the world know it? By all accounts, Ms. Roberts looks good and is good, but the script never gives us any idea why Kabul and his country are so important to his character. The two Afghan dogs by his side may know it, but we, the audience, never know it. Regarding the third member of "the team", Philip Seymour Hoffman steals all the scenes in which he appears under the name of Gust Aurakotos, a villain dissatisfied with the CIA who does not know the Ivy League diploma and who knows the result - both in the conference room of the Agency. and in Wilson's room. <br /> <br /> For the Mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance that the United States can provide is the ability to shoot down the fearsome MI-21 combat helicopters that dominate the skies. It takes money, a lot of money, and finally, "Charlie's team" secretly forces members of Congress to fund the $ 1 billion sophisticated weapons effort to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes high-end, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets, as well as other extremely sophisticated killing devices. Bad, nasty thing. <br /> <br /> That this kind of unlawful multi-billion dollar activity can take place behind the doors of Congress is really alarming. All Americans should see this film or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the political scene that reigns as usual, rarely seen outside the walls of our own government. Oh, mom, I wish it was not ... <br /> <br /> Even though the initial result of "Team Charlie" was an unprecedented success, the unimaginable and unexpected end result is that these sophisticated weapons are now being used against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the funding was entirely "secret", the younger generation of this part of the world has no idea of ​​the fall of Soviet oppression and the end of Russian barbarism was the direct result of the American intervention. Yes, once the Russians have left, our help has done it too: zip for schools, for infrastructure, to maintain constructive relations with the Afghan people. As a result, the overall consequence is a total disaster - it is like the forerunner of "Mission accomplished." <br /> <br /> As Nichol's film so aptly points out, "The ball you put in motion can stay bouncing even after you lose interest in it." Mike Krzyzewski knows it, Eva Longoria Parker knows it, Lafayette's little Lateesha knows it, but the typical American politician does not know it. So we pass good to bad guys because we could not let the world know we were the good guys. Talk about a Catch-22 (another Mike Nichols movie). <br /> <br /> Maybe Charlie Wilson said it better and better, "We still played the final game." <br /> <br /> Once again.
