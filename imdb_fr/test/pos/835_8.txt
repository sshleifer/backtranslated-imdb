The original Female Convict Scorpion is a masterpiece of all time. The first suite, Jailhouse 41, was not as good in my opinion, although it remains remarkable because it takes the original idea and creates something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film. The story is a little different here, but it still manages to take what made the previous entries better and better than many movies of this type and to create something quite original around that. Once again, the action focuses on Nami Matsushima ("Scorpion") and this time she is out of jail and not very excited about coming back. After escaping from the police, one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself catching him with a prostitute and his belated brother. The prostitute ends up being impregnated by the retarded brother (...), while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged by a person whom she has transformed into an enemy in prison. But Scorpion does not really like to spend time behind bars and should not wait to do what he does best. <br /> <br /> The film starts very well as we see Scorpion turn away from the arm intent on bringing her back to jail. From there, the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more dramatic than the two previous films. That does not mean that there is not much action yet - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in "revenge mode" and the film is not quite lacking. Meiko Kaji once again takes on the role of sinister title and it is another sober performance, almost silent. However, her presence on the screen is excellent and she manages to have a threatening presence although she is physically small. The structure of the plot for this film is similar to the other two, in that everything turns into a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have irritated Scorpion in this film than in the two previous ones and this section thus occupies a rather important part of the film. There are some surrealist sequences, fewer than in the first film and nowhere near that in the second, but the film remains faithful to the rest of the series on this point. Overall, I would say that this film falls between the first two in terms of quality - not as big as the original and slightly better than the second.
