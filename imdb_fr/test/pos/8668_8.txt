At first glance, The Bothersome Man seems to look like several other movies / books. The trial of Kafka, Bartleby de Melville, The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin and Groundhog Day, come to mind instantly. A man, Andreas, arrives in an unnamed town where he is immediately assigned a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend. However, there is a drawback: all his colleagues are friendly, bland and totally devoid of character, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one topic of conversation: the interior design . Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, in which people throw buildings without anyone raising their eyebrows, or spend their days reading furniture catalogs and eating dishes that have no taste. <br /> Andreas quickly realizes his problem and passes the rest of the film to escape, in different ways. Suicide is not an option, and when he finds a new girlfriend, he is as devoid of feelings as the old one - there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in with him and all that she can say. is, "it does not bother me". <br /> <br /> In fact, much of what The Bothersome Man has to say has already been said, and after about 45 minutes you begin to feel that you are experiencing some sense of déjà vu. Yet his point probably deserves to be repeated again and again: an unexamined life is one that is not worth living. Moreover, it offers a resolutely modern vision of the eternal theme of the destruction of the heart by capitalism. More than one character reminded me of people I met, especially his girlfriend obsessed with furniture, and if at the end of the film, the filmmakers are running out of ideas, maybe the point essential is the following: there will be no end unless you can. Find others who share your sense of alienation.
