It's a movie about passion. The passion she describes is largely misguided, even for the ruler. But this is the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe can be contaminated by nonsense, and can even lead us to do destructive things - for ourselves or for others. In addition, those who try to escape the passion (look at the drug addict who visits the studio) may also self-destruct. <br /> <br /> The world needs to hear the message of this film more often.
