This film immediately catches the eye with the aerial views of the beautiful Hong Hong. Filmed in these rich 1950s films that modern blockbuster movies never seem to capture. Probably a sign of these times, because it's not a powerful one, see everything before the movie, full of havoc and violence. The ravages and violence reign however in the scene, with thousands of refugees trying to leave China. It is a very touching and fascinating story, full of hope and love in a tragic time, of recent history. The story of two people from different cultures who fall in love. And trying to overcome this is the heart of this very fine and moving film.
