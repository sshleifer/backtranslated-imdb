In my childhood, travel in space was my favorite movie. I remember when KTLA (Channel 5) shot the movie all week long and my sisters and I watched it every day! I still remember every part of this movie. The end was so sad when Giant Robot blew himself up with Guillotine, then looked at Johnny Sokko with all the tears running down his face, calling Giant Robot. There should be a sequel to the movie, in which Giant Robot survived the blast. :) I can not believe there are still so many other fans of travel in space. I really want to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD, but my sister said that these are now illegal copies and probably poor quality of the film. I do not know why they have not published it yet, because it's been over 40 years now. I think that Space Travel was done in 1968. Only now, my second favorite Japanese monster film of all time (The Gargantuan War) finally arrives on DVD and goes out on September 9th. I am impatient! :) Now, if only they would do the same thing with Space Travel. Giant Robot, Johnny Sokko and Space Travel will never be forgotten! In my eyes and probably many others too, it will always be a classic of my childhood! :)
