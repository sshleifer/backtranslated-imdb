I love pop culture, but I was a bit worried when I first heard about it. Then I saw an episode and I love it! I was a little upset to hear that Christopher Eccelson would no longer play Doctor Who. He was probably the best they had. He goes so well to the character. It's sad to see him go. I really do not think the new guy will remove the doctor as well as Eccelson. <br /> <br /> I think everyone can ignore the nerdy effects of certain places and creatures, such as the Darleks. Stories and characters can more than make up for that. I am currently waiting for the second season and will also be looking at it, in case, for some reason, the quality decreases. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think everyone should try to see only one episode. I did it and I love it since. Well written, well mounted and well produced, this show is worth seeing. Doctor Who gets a 10/10
