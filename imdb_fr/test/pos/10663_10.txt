Originally considered part of a huge epic of 1905 depicting the 1905 revolution, Potemkin recounts the mutiny of the Potemkin crew in the port of Odessa. The film begins with the crew protesting against the fly and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents. An uprising takes place in which the revolutionary leader is killed. This crew member is taken to the shore to be in good condition. When the townspeople gather on a huge staircase overlooking the port, tsarist troops appear and descend the steps to disperse the crowd. A naval squadron is sent to take back the Potemkin but as the ships come in range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass. The historically non-exact end of Eisenstein is open, thus indicating that it was the seed of the last Bolshevik revolution that would flourish in Russia. The film is divided into five parts: men and tricks, drama on the back deck, call of the dead, the steps of Odessa and meeting of the squadron. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but at the level genius. Not wanting to make historical drama, Eisenstein used a visual texture to give the film a topical aspect, so that the viewer feels like listening to an exciting and politically revolutionary story. The Battle of Algiers Pontecorvo uses this technique. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on striking or casting non-professionals who had a striking physical appearance. The extraordinary faces of the cast are what Potemkin is remembered for. This technique is later used by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe. But in Potemkin, no one is considered a hero or a heroine. The story is told through a series of scenes that are combined in a special effect called editing: editing and selecting short segments to produce the desired effect on the viewer. D.W. Griffith also used editing, but no one has mastered it as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic shooting of the sleeping crew in their hammock is completed by the graceful swinging of tables hanging on chains in the galley. On the other hand, the confrontation between the crew and their officers is charged with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses show their anger at the injustice. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein introduced the technique of showing slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity. The break of a plate bearing the words "Give us today our daily bread" means the beginning of the end. This technique is used last year in Marienbad. In addition, when the surgeon is overthrown, his nose clip hangs from the rigging. These are the glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the fly-infested meat. This sequence links punishment to corruption in the tsarist era. <br /> <br /> The most noticeable sequence in the film, and perhaps throughout the film's history, is The Odessa Steps. The vast expanse of steps is filled with hundreds of extras. A rapid and dramatic violence is always suggested and not explicit, but the images of the death of some will remain forever etched in the mind of the spectator. <br /> <br /> The angular images of boots and moving legs descending the steps are cleverly accented with long ominous shadows of a sun at the top of the steps. The rhythm of the sequence varies deliberately between the soldiers on the march and some civilians who have the courage to beg them to stop. A close-up of a woman's face frozen in horror after being hit by a soldier's sword is the direct antecedent of the bank teller at Bonnie in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the regime's horror tsarist. <br /> <br /> The death of a young mother drove a child's car down the steps in a sequence copied by Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent, by Terry Gilliam in Brazil and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables. This sequence is repeatedly shown from different angles, thus drawing what was probably only a five-second event. <br /> <br /> Potemkin is a film that immortalizes the revolutionary spirit, celebrates it for those already engaged and diffuses it for the unconverted. It burns and roars before the senseless injustices of the decadent tsarist regime. Its most important impact is on film students who borrowed and slightly improved the techniques invented in Russia several generations ago.
