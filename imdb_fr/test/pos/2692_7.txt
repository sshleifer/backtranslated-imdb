I need help to identify an episode of King of Queens. It begins with a scene where Doug speaks on the phone with Carrie, who suggests they agree to end all conversations with "I love you". However, it's difficult to do and he ends up reminding her, ending with "I love you". It's a very smart moment and I think I'm saying a lot about relationships that have been going on for a long time. <br /> <br /> I THINK (but I'm sure) this is the same episode where Doug receives some construction guys whistling and throwing dirty comments at Carrie to cheer him up. <br /> <br /> I saw this episode recently, but it was probably a rehearsal. I do not know which network I saw it on. Can anyone tell me the title and the season of this episode?
