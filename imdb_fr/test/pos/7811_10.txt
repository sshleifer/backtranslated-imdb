This film deserves to be one of the best Hindi comedies ever produced. Rajkumar Santoshi is best known for his impactful social dramas, but this is the easiest film he has ever made. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around two jesters from the small town Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem. (Salman Khan) They want to get rich quickly and settle in the big city. They develop the same plan separately - to seduce a rich heiress, Raveena (Raveena Tandon), daughter of a wealthy businessman, Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). Thus, the one who marries Raveena gets his hands on all his wealth. but when they learn to know each other's plan, there is an intense show of strength about who is marrying Raveena. Gags and hilarious situations ensue as the battle rages on. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Ramgopal Bajaj's identical twin brother, Shyamgopal Bajaj, wants to eliminate his brother and niece and usurp the family's fortune. Add to that an assortment of fun characters, including a Raveena maid, Karishma (Karishma Kapoor), an error-prone butler named Robert (Vijoo Khote), a director named Bhalla (Shehzad Khan) who mimics the villain of old, Ajeet, and the funny gangster Gogo (Shakti Kapoor) who looks more like a pirate and a giggling comedy awaits you. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time looking for LOGIC in the movie. Quit the company of your brain and enjoy it. The actors are so in tune with the scenario that there is no room for error. The dialogues (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) are spiritual. The music (Tushar Bhatia) and the lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are memorable. The images and choreographies (Saroj Khan) of "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Doori", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Karta Hai Tere Paas Aaoon" suit me and will remain engraved forever in my mind. <br /> <br /> The film features two up-and-coming superstars, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (they eventually became superstars). Aamir Khan is impeccable in his first comic role in his own right. I salute his sense of comic timing. Salman pales in comparison with Aamir but remains friendly. Among the secondary characters, Paresh Rawal is distinguished by its dual role, that of Ramgopal and that of Shyamgopal. <br /> <br /> The film has surprisingly failed at the box office. I do not understand why. I recommend it nevertheless to all.
