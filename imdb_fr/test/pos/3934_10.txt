I'm not sure why this movie has such a low average on IMDb when that's all you could want in a horror movie. That's the definition of a horror movie. I consider myself a big fan of horror and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax is the story of a group of college students heading for a football game who decide to camp for the night and go to a local crazy. Upon waking the next morning, they make a macabre discovery and decide to go to town for a broken car part. The city is scary and I will stop there. Because that's when the real chaos begins. Trust me when I tell you that if you're looking for a horror movie, see this, you'll love it. It is marvelously diabolical and inventive with its scenes of killings, the story is interesting and the characters are well drawn, the actors giving them all the personality. Paris Hilton included which does quite well with its share. the film is a little on the shallow side but it's so much fun and we do not care. This film should devour the box office and all horror fans should be part of it. Check out House of Wax, the skin-peeled film, super-stuck lips, dead animal carcasses, hot wax spray on a still-living person, a cut finger, a decapitation, a perch of the head and much more. I had the chance to watch the screening of this film at the premiere of Tribeca and all the actors were present to promote the film. And then, they have something to be proud of House of wax is the scariest ride of roller coater of the year! 9/10
