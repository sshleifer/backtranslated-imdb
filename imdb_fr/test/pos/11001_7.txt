I enjoyed watching Squire Trelane mess around with the team in this episode, although after a while it all seemed a little too long. Of course, the distractions were pretty funny for a while, and the end was a great way to pack everything. I think the problem was that I loved to see Trelane when he was full of bravado and pleasure, the pleasure seemed to disappear when Trelane became vindictive and nasty. You talk about a mood killer, who goes from the odious but affable host to the guy who condemns Kirk to death! But despite that, the episode was enjoyable and worth it. For the harder Trekkies, it's a must, for others, it's just a nice series.
