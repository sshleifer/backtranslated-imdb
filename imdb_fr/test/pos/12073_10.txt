I have nothing but praise for this film and this cast, especially Ann Margaret. But more importantly, I congratulate my in-laws who were (are) adoptive parents of Warren and Frank in real life. I met most of the "kids" at Warren's wedding in 1989. It's an incredible story, and it's even more amazing for me to know the family and what everyone has experienced. It's also nice for me to see how my in-laws were featured in the movie. It was quite precise. My wife even likes to see some small details like a toaster she remembered from her childhood. Yes, it is a difficult film to watch, but so incredible and sincere. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this story is that many children have gone through my in-laws and, as a result, marrying their daughter and having Warren as brother-in-law, how many I met in mine. For 20 years, this story has been part of my life because of what my mother-in-law shared with me. That and knowing Warren. For what it's worth, Warren lives in California with his family. He married his high school sweetheart, with whom he reconnected during his 20 years of high school reunion. <br /> <br /> There was a show in the 1980s titled "It's amazing". They had a family meeting that also met the show's cast. <br /> <br /> For the benefit of all, the DVD is available in Britain and Australia. This is a difficult video to find here in the United States and I have not found a DVD here yet.
