It was a good movie. There was an explosion "sot-so-nice". In addition, there were very intense (dramatic) scenes that could make it inappropriate for younger viewers under the age of six. <br /> <br /> For a film under the radar, the acting is very pleasant and arises in our family room for a near perfect landing. It caught the attention of our entire family and we were a little sorry to see it disappear. <br /> <br /> This film had spy spy elements with young people saving the day, but the scenario was a little more believable. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but helped to establish the plot. The pranks and jinx were also pretty fun. <br /> <br /> We hope you like it as much as we do.
