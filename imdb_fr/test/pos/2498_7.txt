The love letter is one of my favorite books of all time, so I was naturally skeptical when I heard that it would become a movie. But I liked it. I found myself smiling throughout the movie. I admit that this is not a good movie but a nice half hour. I thought that Capshaw and Scott were perfect like Helen and Johnny. Just as I imagined them. And the city and the landscapes were also perfect. I recommend this movie, but do not wait too long, enjoy it.
