I read the book before watching the film and it left me emotionally exhausted, but I felt it really carried me to Afghanistan, a culture I know very little about. I had high hopes for this film and it did not disappoint me. I watched this with someone who did not read the book and who also enjoyed it. They had to shorten certain things in the film but it was a well-played and well-shot film. This lets you think about the movie long after it's over. You feel for the characters and their difficulties. I highly recommend this film to those who like exhausting dramas and want to experience Afghan culture. Some disturbing scenes are not suitable for children. It is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.
