Interesting tale of giant mammoth elephants running crazy in modern India. Features transparent special effects - elephants dressed in long-haired coats with tusk extensions.

It has been said that the race time of it had been doubled when it was shown in India, with the permission of Robert Lippert, a master of "padding". If you have a choice, opt for the shorter version.
