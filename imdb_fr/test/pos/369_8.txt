I was lucky that this film came in TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It is rather difficult to find, although it is a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which have been repeated by Hitchcock. First, the end is a little too neat and "perfect". In the last scenes, until the last five minutes, there is incredible tension. then, the five minutes clear everything perfectly ... very unsatisfactory. The ending is also too dramatic for a Hitchcock film. He is, has always been and will always be the master of suspense ... why would he sink to something as low as an inexpensive sequence of action for the end? Aside from the few flaws, the movie is awesome. The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal of all time. The theme? Simple. You meet a stranger. A perfect stranger. He proposes to kill someone for you ... you know that you have someone (if nothing else, unconsciously) died. The catch? He asks you to do the same for him ... Will you accept this arrangement as bizarre as it is ingenious? You are not suspected, and so is it ... after all, none of you knew the victim. And you do not know each other ... you are only "strangers in a train". A great concept, to which each person can relate. The pace is good, you never lose interest and patience. Cinematography is good, but not as good as in other, better Hitchcock films. The acting game is flawless. The characters are well written, credible and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the elements he uses often; the dominant mother, the mother's boy, etc. The film is very good, but it just feels a bit diluted. It did not make the famous extra kilometer that would have made it super. He stopped before crossing the dividing line between what is common and what is daring. This is the main reason why the movie is not great, but remains good, with potential to be more than that. The end leaves you dissatisfied and disappointed. However, all that led to the end is very good, so the film still has a deserving 8/10. Good but not great. Any fan of Hitchcock should see it, because it's one of his best ... a bit far off the list, but still there. I recommend it to all Hitchcock fans. 8/10
