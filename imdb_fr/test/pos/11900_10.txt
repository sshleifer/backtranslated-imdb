This film was the one I had been waiting to see for some time. I was happy to see that everything was planned. The writing of this film has been done with extreme meticulousness and research far beyond what the public sees. I found it amusing that so many viewers do not read between very important lines, but otherwise, the film will have a different meaning and is very brilliant. The film has many stories and characters woven together around this character, Kilo, a man who came out of the street amid many misfortunes and became a very powerful criminal. After spending some time in prison, Kilo finds a loophole in the justice system and is released by a disturbing turn of events to find that everything does not match at all it seems. Kilo is confronted with the higher realm of society and political kingship in order to clarify the importance of human speech and its importance. A war begins when the street is in arms against rich lords and corrupt power. <br /> <br /> A rise of incessant and powerful turns. This movie will leave you riveted. I found that the distribution of this film was exceptional and it was not a film to ignore. Excellent. Go rent it today !!
