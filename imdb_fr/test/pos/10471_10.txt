The French Babbette appears in the modest house of two Danish sisters wet, cold and alone. Fleeing the revolution in Paris, she takes refuge in an obscure religious community on the coast of Jutland windswept. <br /> <br /> Unbeknownst to those who welcome her so generously, she is a great chef, a gastronomic artist. Babette gives herself to her adoptive community through her economy, productivity and shared faith. She only leaves when she wins the French lottery - 10,000 francs. She returns loaded with exotic goods, which constitutes a unique meal commemorating the birthday of the father of the sister, founder of the community. <br /> <br /> This sad meal in the minds of the faithful who deny pleasure, but its subtleties are translated by an elderly military officer who, young man in Paris, has learned to appreciate the sensory experience that takes place right here. The meal is the culmination of the film, a communion of love in the transient art of food - an insignificant rise of art, love and the meaning of life.
