This is a good movie, I will not go into detail because the other comments of users do a good job taking care of that. However, I do not agree with the statement that this is Eastwood's best work. This is simply not a very defensible position given the number of strong films he has made and featured. I would like to note that I find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, again appeared in another movie or TV show, despite good performances. My curiosity made me wonder what happened to these two actresses?
