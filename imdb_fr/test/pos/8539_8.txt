Ed (a publisher by chance) is hired to cut the horror films so that they are favorable in Europe (where the standards are much more rigorous). But he finds the movies very destructive and starts to get a little crazy. Okay, "a little bit" could be a euphemism. <br /> <br /> Let me say this first: the best. opening. scene. already. A man in an office exploding his head with a grenade. His boss said - with an impassive face - "you're fired". The whole movie does not maintain this level of intensity, but it certainly tries. <br /> <br /> Take the shotgun scenes, the beheading, the clips of "Lost Limbs" (that my friend Jason would like to be a real movie). The writer of this film had the idea of ​​a woman who is raped by a beaver then, immediately after, is shot in the head with a bazooka. This is something you will not find in any other movie (at least I doubt you do). <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw of this film is its quality. The picture is not as sharp as a 1997 film should be, and the sound could be retouched (though it's not bad). I thought I was watching a film from the 1980s. Although it gave my spirit a boost - the film also had the writing and direction style of the 1980s: a sense of pleasure and giving the audience a little something more. I miss those days. <br /> <br /> I wish I could say more, even if for the moment I do not see anything strong enough to praise this film. I think you should see that. You've seen the box in your video store with the ax chopping your head ... maybe you've already gone through it several times. Maybe you thought it would be corny. To pick up. Savor it.
