Quai des Orf√®vres takes too long to launch, Clouzot being so in love with his backstage that he almost risks forgetting the story. However, once it's done, it's Clouzot at its best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid) is the pianist dedicated to the world who married under himself and who plans to kill the shady studio mogul with reasons on his wife to see that someone beat him to this point. Not only that, but his alibi carefully planned but clumsily put in pieces falls apart, especially when a thief steals his car on the scene of the murder ?? <br /> <br /> The film really comes to life with the arrival of Luis Jouvet police inspector, a rather wonderful creation, half Alistair Sim in Green for Danger and Maigret, tired of the world, with a better dialogue . In neat running gear, his investigation is constantly conducted aloud against chaos and noise, whether it's noisy typewriters at the police station or a noisy rehearsal. The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation, a wealth of chaotic, revealing little details that make Steve Bocchco's once-revolutionary American crime series of the 1980s look like old-fashioned museum pieces. <br /> <br /> If Suzy Delair is a rather unconvincing femme fatale, the secondary distribution makes up for it more than anything, and the beautiful Simone Renant stands out as a lesbian photographer in love with her from afar and constantly confused with Blier's lover by Delair and other interested parties (only Jouvet, just as unlucky with women, understands and sincerely sympathizes). With superb black and white photographs of Armand Thirard, it's a great little thriller with a nice end and a nice scene with a taxi driver reluctantly identifying Renant in a police station. (Note: Pierre Larquey, who played Dr. Vorzet in The Crow, plays a taxi driver role at Quai and Les Espions.) The Criterion DVD is truly superb. - an excellent image quality as well as an illuminating extract from a French TV show including interviews with Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
