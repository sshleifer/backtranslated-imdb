In the ever-changing world of CG and what was not happening with cartoons, etc., Faeries was at least a warm welcome from me. I think it's important to show such films from time to time, to preserve them and help us remember where the originality and fun of cartoons come from. People were saying how annoying it was because of graphics and other things, but hey! Think of the movies that will be considered boring if all the movies look like the new, state-of-the-art movies that everyone and his mother are currently doing. Call me old fashioned, but I liked it. It's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings, and all the audience really needs is their imagination.
