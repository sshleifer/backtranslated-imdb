Even for a 17-year-old student who loves history and glimpses emotion and excitement during his childhood in this series, his DVD release has been a blessing for all time. North and South is really a series about friendship, love, honor ... you give your own list of feelings that you feel while watching this series. I still remember the first time I had a preview of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I think that sounds exciting. Too bad I have never had the chance to see books one and two on TV in the Netherlands. When the third book was broadcast as a late-night series in the Netherlands in the summer of 2004, I knew I had to see the other two series. For most people, booking three was a big disappointment to my knowledge. Well, since I saw the first book on DVD, I have to say that so far, it's the best of 3 books in full. For all young people watching fanciful films like The Patriot "Oh America for freedom", you have a more realistic view to see here .....
