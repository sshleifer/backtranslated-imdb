I went to "The Closer She Gets" knowing that it was the story of the filmmaker's mother battling cancer. I expected it to be a very painful and depressing film. And although the subject is emotionally heartbreaking, the remarkable thing about this film is the positive message it sends. This shows the total dedication of a family to take up the challenge of cancer together. They refuse to lose confidence in each other, even in the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> The most moving moments for me are those where this faith is revealed. Small comments from the mother and the family that reveal his will to survive (and their), as well as their defying emphasis on love and family solidarity. In this sense, it is an edifying and deeply hopeful film. We should all be lucky enough to be surrounded by such a family in the event of serious illness.
