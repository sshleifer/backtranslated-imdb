I think Fame was the best movie I have ever seen. It was funny and dramatic, but that's what makes a movie. That's right, there are a few details, a lot, but I still think it's a fantastic movie. Some of the fun things happen during the audition at the beginning of the movie. I think it's hilarious when the girl tries to play O.J. Simpson in "The Towering Inferno" and Raul / Ralph goes to all the art departments to say that his father was great in all areas. He says that his father danced with the Rockets and left his shoes to Ralph. As far as I know, the Rockets are composed of women. And the tap shoes were just ordinary shoes with capsules on the bottom. Also the guy who read Juliet's lines in the Romeo and Juliet game was funny. One thing about the movie that excites me is the music. I have never heard anything like it !!! My favorite song is "I sing the electric body" and my second is the song "Fame". Irene Cara has a great voice and is a great actress. I like the way the film has focused on many ethnic groups. It showed all the types of people present in what is now called "La Guardia School of Performing Arts". This film has shown the triumphs and trials of many young artists, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. They all had difficulty, but they did it in their own way. This film could have added about 30 to 45 minutes more (before graduation), but it remains my favorite movie anyway !!!
