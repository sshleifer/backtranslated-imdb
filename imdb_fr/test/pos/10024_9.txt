Although I do not know if Larry Hama has ever seen one or more of the old cartoons, I would think that writing drawings such as cartoons, cards and some comics would count for something. <br /> <br /> For fans of the old cartoon, it's pretty much the same thing, except for a few new characters - and a more insane Cobra Commander. <br /> <br /> We still have all the old favorites too, but as an individual. Mind you, one thing that always pissed me off is this "Duke in charge", when there are tons of other * officers * instead. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences are also similar to the old series; the main thing here seems to be the CGI. Overall, it's pretty good, if not a little exaggerated.
