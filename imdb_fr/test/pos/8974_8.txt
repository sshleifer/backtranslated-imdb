Nice to see an adult comedy. Masterfully structured by Aaron Sorkin through the mastery of Mike Nichols. Mr. Nichol's mastery consists of presenting characters in all their shocking truth, ranging from sad and fascinating Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, in "Who Fears Virginia Woolf" to Julia Roberts, Trive and Captivating, by Jude Law and Natalie Portman, in "Closer". In "Charlie Wilson's War", the shocking truth is outside the characters and Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams sad and captivating are serving something else, it's personal up to a certain point. Hanks has to bury his talent in single malts and Julia Roberts organizes parties and features characters from a blatant franchise. Amy Adams is a witness and exists as a character, witness. An insurmountable task that Miss Adams manages to overcome, beautifully. It's Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gus with a t that has however monopolized my attention. His character may not be a first, but it's the first time Hoffman introduced it to us. Someone who survives the contempt with which he is treated by the absolute conviction that he is smarter than everyone else. Hoffman is superb. The rhythm of the story helps enormously not to fall into a myriad of useless questions. A sharp comedy, short, intelligent, sad and when was the last time I could say that?
