It's always difficult to bring a 450-page book back to a three-hour film. I have already read the book and found that BBC production handled this difficulty in the best possible way. The qualities of the book are not lost: the dense and vivid depiction of a family of finger patchwork in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is raised, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of talk, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film gives viewers a different look from one scene to another, when we first tell them about Sue's point of view and then Maud's point of view . The main actors do a very good job, and the growing love between the two women has grown convincingly, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two women and finally forgiving all the harm that they were ready to do and did each other because they still love each other. <br /> <br /> For each of her books, the author, Sarah Waters, has studied in depth British life in the 19th century. While in Tipping the Velvet, it was the world of vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the terrible reality of penitentiaries and the evocative fashionable spirits, she described in Fingersmith the public ceremony of hanging at London and the inhuman treatment of people believed or reported disturbed in asylums from reading sources and scientific research. This is very well transferred in the film, so that the corresponding scenes show a high degree of historical truth. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, lively emotions and suspense.
