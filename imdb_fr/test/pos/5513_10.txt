Honestly, it's one of the BEST horror movies I've ever seen. I was captivated by history, petrified by Captain Howdy and on the edge of my seat all the way. I do not really understand all the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> The installation has already been discussed in depth; Captain Howdy is an online predator who organizes meetings with teenagers, removes them and introduces them to his favorite hobby: body modification and piercing. Dee Snider is Captain Howdy and one of the scariest psychopaths ever created. perhaps the scariest because it is so human and you have the feeling (especially if you like body modification) that there are really people like this in the world. <br /> <br /> But the main reason I liked film and the reason it's so horrible is that Captain Howdy becomes the hero. At the beginning of the film, the roles are clearly defined. the victims are innocent, the cop is the good guy and Howdy is pure evil. In the second act, however, things have changed a little. You want Howdy to be mean, but it turns out he's just a victim of the circumstances and that good and bad may not be obvious. It's terrifying to be acclaimed by the "bad guy". <br /> <br /> Some people mentioned that Strangeland should have been divided into two separate films. Of course, there are two separate "acts", but this film works very well because the two acts are one after the other. The first act is the typical psychological thriller, but the second act is the most disturbing because of the viewer's reaction to the situation. I do not think the result would have been the same if the second act had been developed and transformed into a sequel. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of horror film, I highly recommend this movie. This is the first horror movie of all time to give me nightmares.
