When I first saw this film, I was both surprised and a little shocked by the blatant vibrancy of the story. It's a very artistic drama with incredible special effects, spectacular acting, and a very good job in the makeup department. Jennifer Lopez retired from previous roles that were rooted in her career with this film, describing a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to encourage comatose patients to treat them. Vincent D'onofrio played incredibly well. His portrayal of a sadistic serial killer was perfect for a T. The emotion itself expressed by his performance is staggering. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but he did exceptionally well. Symbolism and artistic talent were intriguing and moving, sometimes surprising and sometimes shocking. Overall, I say it's a beautiful movie, with great acting and beautiful illustrations.
