This film presents a cherished irony, hard-nosed tales for hard-haired dogs, mixing subtle cultural references, classic parallels, masterful use of rich saturated colors and a fabulous rendering of Keystone Cops hunting scenes. <br /> <br /> All the actors and the team is charming. Literally. How could I continue like this? <br /> <br /> This film speaks to everyone. The clever and poignant use of so many universal archetypes: this is what makes this film so satisfying. <br /> <br /> As an experienced film student, I find that Checking Out contains all the essentials. Of course and Bergorra, it's not the GODFATHER, but would serve as a perfect follow-up; Tragedy's mandatory Satyr drama that binds our collective cathartic wounds. <br /> <br /> See you at the theater and watch this film, you will be entitled to a unique masterpiece.
