I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Hauer at the Sarasota Film Festival in 2005 for the world premiere of this film in the United States. Not only was he kind enough to autograph my copy of BLADE RUNNER, but he took the time to answer some questions about the film before projecting THE ROOM for a packed house. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed by the movie that I used it as a criterion to compare all the other films I saw at the festival. It was powerful and moving, but subtle and brief. The film tells how a young man (older version played by Rutger) finds himself fascinated by an apparently banal piece in a mundane building near the street. By the way, he notices a single window, still open, from which a haunting melody can be heard. Every day he walks past the room, sometimes standing for hours, looking through the silk curtains that float in the light breeze, hoping to get a glimpse of his occupants. Towards the end of the film, we discover how important this piece is and what seduced our protagonist. <br /> <br /> The film has been beautifully cut. Not a second of screen time was lost on an uninteresting shot. Any image of the film can be used alone in an art gallery. Rutger is amazing. He is mysterious, but affordable. His dialogue includes a series of reflections on a life that has run its course, for better or for worse. His words evoke the familiar feelings and thoughts of the audience. I was particularly moved by a scene in which he looks at old photos, recalling his favorite dog, his favorite horse and his first love. You feel that you are in his presence, because he lets you enter his world to glimpse precious memories of a life that is about to end. <br /> <br /> I loved this film and would recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh, intelligent and moving. Should be forced to watch for all major movie houses.
