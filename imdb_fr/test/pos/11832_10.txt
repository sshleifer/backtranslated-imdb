I loved this movie - the actors were wonderful and suited to their roles. The story itself was excellent (and true, the setting was perfect and the message about human reaction to war, danger and risk was exceptional.) The score creator also composed the music of Life is Beautiful - his comment was apparently that "... it was not an English film, but an Italian film." I think he's right! Callum Blue is perfect for Eric Newby. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a true and morally inspiring story as well as a beautiful love story.
