It was the favorite film of my late wife. I'm sorry she did not live long enough to get the video because I'm sure she would have used it. What can we say? A beautiful romantic story and the thrust of two great men, the Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are excellent in these roles. But if Connery is his usual sexy sex, it's the late Brian Keith who gives us a strong performance as mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. Back up is provided by Candy Bergen, beautiful in her early thirties, incarnated by the abducted American widow. The great John Huston is an excellent substitute, as Teddy's beleaguered secretary of state, John Hay; Geoffrey Lewis, Clint Eastwood's film, is excellent, as is the hesitant US ambassador, Gummere; The late Vladek Sheybal, with his diabolically diabolical look, is great, as the Beshaw and Steve Kanaly and Roy Jensen, whose faces we have seen in many contexts. All in all, it's a film filled with beautiful romance, concerned with a bygone era. Foolish history? Not at all. The question of the great nations defending the smallest nations to defend their own hegemonic interests is as true today as it was at the time. Too romantic? Not really-- certainly not maudlin in any way. Fun to watch? You bet. I own the video and I will watch it again and again. I advise you to do the same.
