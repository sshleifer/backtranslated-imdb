This revolutionary film is truly a work of art. I went to the screening at the Indiana Congress with very little expectation, having already watched 2 other films with "gamer" in the title (both were so terrible that at the end of the second, I had removed one of my films). my eyes with my straw and a twisted trombone I found between the seat cushions). But the opening credits "Dorkness" had me. The temperate northwestern setting is a wonderful backdrop for the tragedy surrounding the frustrated game master, Lodge (powerfully portrayed by Nathan Rice) and his group of unsuitable friends who set aside the real tragedies they face every day to deal with fantastic dramas in the decor. provides for them. After the first scene (in the imaginary world they inhabit), they are violently driven back into the world they are desperately trying to flee. It made so many comparisons with my own life that I was moved to tears. Rice's role is so amazing that, in the first 20 minutes of the film, he was truly a man in his twenties suffering from frustration, male pattern baldness and a boring group of "friends" who seem to be incapable to understand. concepts like good and bad. Lodge's friends are remarkable here: Leo, the oldest and heaviest of the trio, seems to be the only other character with a job, aside from Lodge. Still, he seems socially attracted to Gary, the youngest in the group. It sounds a bit odd at first, until you realize that Gary is actually a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects outside of his "imaginary" world. This dichotomy serves not to confuse but to inform and raise the public on the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint is that the actors who play Leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle) seem to play the characters laugh sometimes, as if they were informed that they were acting in a comedy rather hitting action. drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis made his film debut as Cass, third and most influential member of the motley team at Lodge. the tension is always strong when he's on the screen, talking passionately about his beliefs about Lodge or showing off his fantastic martial arts skills like "Silence", his fantastic character. Or even when he suddenly turns to face the audience and you bend down in the audience to not snap the fantastic chin. Lewis lights up the screen no matter what he does and I hope to see him later. Once the action starts in this movie, it just does not stop. the drama and the action get married so well sometimes that you can tell if you're in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment. Truly a thrill ride of epic proportions, I would recommend "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" as it should be for anyone who loves movies. It was almost worth losing an eye on it. <br /> <br /> ~ Chip Deedlenick
