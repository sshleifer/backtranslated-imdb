VIP keys are BS. <br /> <br /> Rob Cavaliere vs. Justin in the second season. <br /> <br /> I went to school with rob cavaliere and Adriana Doria. you may remember her as the last girl he "picked up". It was at this point that the "angry girlfriend" passed by, they discerned and "left the club together". They were good friends at Father Bressani Chs in Woodbridge. <br /> <br /> Whether Rob plans it or not, they ask him to do it, men need to know that what they see is not real and the guys here are shower bags. especially this episode. <br /> <br /> Another line to fill the space.
