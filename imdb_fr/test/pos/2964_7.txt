For me, the thing about a love story is whether I like the characters or not, and whether they click between them. Matt is not very friendly: distant, boastful, apparently lazy and misogynist. Her dysfunctional mother seriously injured her, making her a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction - he was credible. He overcompensates by boasting that he nails Amy. He's so cool with Amy that he hits twice. When they speak, he can not show him who he really is. She shows empathy and then launches against him at the right moment. She seems so mature and strong that her features that appear later do not seem to match. (For me.) I found her incredibly sexy and pretty. . . pretty next door girl, I call her. I was going to love this movie unless it was really messed up. <br /> <br /> Fun things are happening with the coach, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. The football scenes at the end were disturbing. Matt does not carry the ball but seems to be a blocker behind. People, he does not have the right size! It is too light for this position. But I thought his game was clever. I can see that I wanted to twist her neck several times during her scenes with Meredith Monroe. The film was going well. Meredith M was better than good.
