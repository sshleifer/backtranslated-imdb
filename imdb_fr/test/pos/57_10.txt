I gave this film my 10 rare stars. <br /> <br /> When I started to watch it and realized that it would not be a movie with a powerful plot, I almost shut it down. I am very happy that I did not do it. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven movie, a true story, which revolves around the life of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a beautiful and powerful (inside and out) Black woman and how she touched the lives of many people in the Lackawanna community. <br /> <br /> Very interesting, not only his strong characterization of Nanny and the people who lived in his boarding school, but also its visual appearance. what the life and community of African Americans in the 1950s, before integration, looked like, the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the black community. <br /> <br /> In addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast, there are some beautiful songs and dances of this time.
