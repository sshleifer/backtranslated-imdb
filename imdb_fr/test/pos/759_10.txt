I had to have this movie because it did not come where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint was visible, since they had also worked together on the Harry Potter films. great job playing the part. I only wish I could see the sex scene or part of it. LOL, but of course we just have to use our imagination to understand how things went. (Snickers) I really thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch. Rent this movie. I must say that Rupert really did a great job and it's nice to see that he's shooting movies outside of Harry Potter, although I really like him like Ron Weasley. The whole cast did a great job and I hope that Rupert will continue to act outside of Harry Potter to expand his skills!
