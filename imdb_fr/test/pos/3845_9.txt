When "Madam" decides to let her cats inherit it, it creates problems. The scorcher Edgar, the next to inherit, decides to get rid of cats. So, the story can begin and the cats can live an adventure that would have been impossible otherwise. An adventure that allows them to meet the charming cat O'Malley, but not quite trustworthy. It helps them through many dangerous and fun situations until the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> The strength of this film lies in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as an insulted butler who wants to settle the score and, of course, he himself is severely beaten. One of the best scenes chased him chased by the two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is excellent and, as in "The Book of the Jungle", you have almost "musical" scenes in the sense that the story does not progress and the goal is to let the protagonists express themselves through the dance. And of course, we like the score to be pretty Jazzy. <br /> <br /> And of course, it's not just me, but my children who love it. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Simon
