A sparkling film. BB is a marvel. She is sensual. She's a feminist. She is still very much in love. <br /> <br /> The film presents Paris in the 50's. It's wonderful to watch sites, cars (DS!) and Orly. <br /> <br /> A simple but very nice romantic comedy. The music is terrible. It almost disappears. On the other hand, it's hilarious. But that's probably the only thing that's wrong, at least looking at it with the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The film comments on the French way of dealing with infidelity. It is this modern sense. A movie like an elephant is a lot wrong in the way of the 80s. But the basic principle remains the same. <br /> <br /> Thank you to the manufacturers for giving BB this opportunity.
