I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and I must say that I thought it was amazing. The combination of humor and sincerity was really worth it. The film was about a boy of seventeen whose father and mother are very pious. Ben, seventeen, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches girls, driving and life. It's very funny and touching. Honestly, I must say that it is now one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to everyone. If you do not attend one of the festival sessions, she is expected to be released later in the year. Please, go see it! It's a great movie.
