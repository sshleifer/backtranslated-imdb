<br /> <br /> `The Last Frontier 'is an upper Westerner who overcomes many shortcomings in weaving his story of trappers Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army, especially Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, wife of Colonel (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their stocks to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adapt to lead a "civilized" life in a fort located on the edge of the "last frontier". Jed, who was raised by Gus, inspires and looks up to the "old" Gus and Mungo, and has great difficulty managing "civilization". His real problems begin after he became strongly attracted to Colonel Corrina's wife. Colonel Marston is an imprudent man who puts his entourage in danger by realizing his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent. Corrina, a woman repressed by her status and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for who he is. In the middle is Captain Riordon, a brave and friendly man torn between his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the disastrous consequences of the Colonel's heedlessness. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so interesting (and entertaining) is that, in most cases, the weaknesses and strengths of 'The Last Frontier' are EXACTLY the same elements (forget the tasteless title and dated music) <br /> <br /> First, the scenario. Almost all secondary intrigues (especially the reckless colonel) have been better done elsewhere, but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity. Just when you think you know what will happen next, this one takes off in a different direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: "The Last Frontier" being a film "Production Code" (at the time, the word "virgin" was taboo), it is very surprising that the adulterous factor has been treated as mature and tolerant. I expected Jed, the colonel's wife, to get some reward for their sin. I was surprised and a little disappointed that the film did not exploit this expectation to create a less predictable end. <br /> <br /> Second, the casting. Mature is at least ten years old too old to play the role of Jed, the wild-eyed innocent raised in the woods. James Whitmore, who plays Gus, "the man who raised Jed" is actually five years younger than Mature. Nevertheless, Mature is very endearing and plays an innocent character of civilization but by no means stupid. Although several actors were able to play this role at the time (including Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), none could better interpret Jed. Preston (also the Mature Junior) plays Colonel Marston, missing the tics and postures that one would expect from such a motivated man. However, Preston perfectly reflects the sense of honor that Marston must have seen to promote such a reckless fool to the rank of colonel. Bancroft is a particularly clever choice like Corrina. Bancroft's black hair died blond, and it has the same effect as Winona Ryder ("Edward Scissorhands") and Christina Ricci ("Sleepy Hollow"). That is, I felt conflicted over the character without knowing exactly why; I think the answer is that blondes and brunettes have very different skin tones and eye shades. In addition, Bancroft has always projected a hardness that borders the hardness (here, the blond hair soften a little). This allows Bancroft, 24, to face both the 40-year-old and 37-year-old Preston; Yes, she could be the wife of a colonel. Madison performs a careful balancing act as Riordan, managing a complex role and sometimes a sharp dialogue. Playing a role similar to that of John Wayne in `` Fort Apache '', Madison does a smarter job. <br /> <br /> This film has a "Silverado" camaraderie. This alone is worth seeing. It also has memorable performances, beautiful landscapes and remarkable action and direction. I just hope that a version of the mailbox is available (many have been lost) because this movie takes full advantage of this format.
