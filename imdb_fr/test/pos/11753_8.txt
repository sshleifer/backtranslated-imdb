Holden and Jones SIZZLE in this film, but not as we think today - it's very subtle and under the surface - and yet palpable. Jennifer Jones, in particular, is so sexy in this film (much more than a caricature like Monroe EVER) because she creates a real woman - with ALL facets of femininity: she is intelligent, intuitive, graceful. She desires and desires. <br /> <br /> There is a scene on this famous hill, where she is lying in the grass, watching Holden, and the expression in her eyes is X-rated, but in the context of the scene and of the character, in the most complete sense. You do not need everything to be said in the dialogue - stated as rough evidence in most modern movies. Everything is in his eyes - sexy and elegant. What a magnificent and underrated actress she was. (I saw her recently for the first time, Mrs. BOVARY, and I'm also blown away.) I'll take her every day to Bergman, Davis, or both Hepburn.
