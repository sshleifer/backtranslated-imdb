Having grown up Mormon and struggling with church fanaticism toward blacks (they were not allowed to hold the priesthood of the church when I was a member) - I did not know the politics of the organization aimed to excommunicate homosexual men and women until I left the church in 1966 - (I was 20 years old). I was stunned to learn that homosexual friends were excommunicated even after serving on a mission. LAST DAYS exposes the persecution of homosexual members by Mormons. The film is long awaited. He does an excellent job of showing how the two main men get along, while growing and developing more fully as individuals. LAST DAYS has a big heart, wonderful original music and an added class touch of Jacqueline Bisset. The film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the limits of organized religion and claims his very soul.
