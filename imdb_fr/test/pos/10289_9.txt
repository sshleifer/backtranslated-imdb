It's an intelligent story about relationships and a presentation of three main categories of players in the relationship game: playboys (Max), manipulative women (Alice) and fools who may be in love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien). Max and Alice are very implausible and perhaps despicable characters, but they still keep control of the game, leaving their partners in the dark. But as the end discussed, as veterans like Max and Alice, they would be happy to separate at any time, as if the game had just been announced and that each of them did not care. live your own life and play another game with other anonymous people when another opportunity arises. Lisa, Muriel and Lucien are perhaps the ones who wanted to invest something real in a relationship, not be able to realize that they were the bait of the game and the ultimate losers (as far as this which has been shown to us ... who knows if they are also advanced players in their world that are not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> It's a very fast story, delicately crafted and spiritually catchy with a seductive cast performance. It also deserves a deeper reflection: how real is the game in a relationship game?
