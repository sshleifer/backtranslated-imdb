"Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters" is a visually stunning production that deals with complex problems with evocative ease. It is based on the life of the controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It's not really a biopic - at least not in the traditional sense - but an exploration of the work iconoclast of Mishima. The film manages to present abstract concepts in a totally inviting way and without embroidery. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or remove his work. This does not solve the problem, but it allows you to understand it. An added advantage: Schrader strongly shows us Mishima's fury at the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society. John Bailey's cinematography is spectacularly good. The greatness of the work of composer Philip Glass is perfectly suited to the project. "Mishima" is the best movie I've seen this year, so far.
