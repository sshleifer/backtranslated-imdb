Sometimes I really wonder ?? When I look at the comments here, it seems to me that most people have seen a completely different movie than I have. I just saw it ... and I liked it. Not that it makes me happy, but for having seen a good movie! <br /> <br /> The film needs patience, yes. And yes, the main character is REALLY annoying, but I'm sure it's by intent. <br /> <br /> Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this movie at the movies or at home. Most people watch movies at home as if they were listening to elevator music. This film is certainly not suitable as background noise. <br /> <br /> And no. Running well does not mean having five laughs or explosions per second. To lead well means to follow one's subject and keep the story and the actors together. And although it does not work perfectly, at least I think it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> I liked the photography and the decorations, even if they sometimes graze the surreal. The opening scene is really special. <br /> <br /> I also liked the acting game ?? Guillaume Depardieu does not play Pierre. He plays the role of a Pierre who plays a role himself! Pierre is not the romantic hero whom he tries so hard, he is a presumptuous and honest idiot, a downright stupid who harms all the people he claims to protect. The fact that even his love for the truth is simply a posture is magnificently demonstrated by his permanent lie and not once by a questioning or an explanation of himself. <br /> <br /> People wonder where this or that person came from and other things: No The character who is seen for more than two scenes is unexplained, there is enough information scattered throughout the movie on everyone. <br /> <br /> And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target who is practicing is seen: Remember that Isabella has fled a war zone - and this is obviously a refuge for fighters in civil war, probably Bosnia (which was still going on during the production of the film). This is at least what the story told by Isabelle to Pierre at his first meeting and the subsequent scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover, surrounded by books on Bosnia.
