When I saw this film, I was expecting it to be a cheap American film made at a low price with dreadful actors. I was really surprised to find that I was totally wrong. The film revolves around Bartely or B, who has been rejected by all his colleges - the actor who plays B is very natural and gives a real appearance to his character. However, many people visit their fake website and join the group. Feeling their sorrows, B can not move them away to the chagrin of his best friend. The college is the perfect place to learn what you want or do nothing. The school faces the opposition of the appropriate college which ends up closing it. The film ends in beauty and I recommend you watch it. It's a cheerful movie with some unpredictable twists.
