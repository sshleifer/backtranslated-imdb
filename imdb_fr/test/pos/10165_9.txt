The film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, has been brilliantly directed. It begins with a family of three, a doctor (James Stewart), his wife (Doris Day), a former theater singer, and their young son, whose average age is about 10 years. In the bus, a French government agent came across an agent too kind to him. He is killed on the market after discovering the information he was looking for. He wants to pass this information on to someone, so he's talking to the only person he knows, even slightly, James Stewart. The antagonists kidnap their young boy and say that if he told something to what the agent had told him, his son would be killed. Stewart has to go to London because that's where his son is and where the murder was told by the officer. The film is very suspenseful. There are a lot of twists (typical Hitchcock movie). In addition, he has just the right amount of comic relief. In addition to all this, he won an Oscar for the show "Que sara, sara" by Doris Day. This film is very good. It's hard to find a problem about it. I would definitely recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and all suspense fans. I give an "A-" to this film only because it is a bit predictable.
