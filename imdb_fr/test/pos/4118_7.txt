This interesting film noir presents three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly remarkable. Demming, as a detective, is unfortunately not so good. It lacks the intelligence, strength and vision of the cynical world of a Bogart. If Humphrey had played that role, we could have had a classic. <br /> <br /> The pace, the location (a library) and the atmosphere are all good. But there are some holes of ground. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet, after killing Blackmer by mistake, Sanders does not seem to feel any anxiety or remorse. Sanders then seizes the library and its occupants using the trick that he and his men are detectives investigating the murder. However, Sanders's killer later tries to kill Demming by shooting at him (without a silencer), even though one would have expected the many other detainees to hear the noise and be alarmed. Finally, Sanders' killer tries to kill Roberts, who discovered the truth, but inexplicably, when she fainted. <br /> <br /> But what worried me the most was that the opportunity to reach a great and unexpected conclusion was wasted. Throughout the film, Patrick is described as an intelligent and uncompromising sociopath who does not fear anything. Yet, in the end, she flees panicked from the last surviving Nazi, a brutal thug. By the time the cops find him, he has killed her. And she ends up being just another weak, stereotyped victim. Here's what should have happened: the cops find the Nazi thug, but he's dead. She cleverly killed him, then disappeared to continue his bad manners.
