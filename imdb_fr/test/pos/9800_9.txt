I saw this movie for the first time when I was younger. My sister told me about it and I thought it would be more of a children's movie. However, it remains to be also an incredible movie. It is true that the subject behind the film is shady, but it is true too, this film will not stop touching your heart. <br /> <br /> I was only 6 when I saw him for the first time and yesterday, 7 years later, I saw him again. For the first time in a long time. Even after knowing how it ended, I knew I had seen it a billion times, billions of times, I cried like a tiny little baby. When I saw it a few years ago, I finally understood the idea and the seriousness of the film. So I stopped watching for a moment. But yesterday, I did not change channels, I watched it. In the end, I was surprised to see how much it made me laugh, cry, think and especially believe again. I have not believed for a long time and this film took me out of my shell and opened my heart. This film has not only had an impact. I was also very impressed by the actors. Especially Bobby. So, if you want to see this movie for the first time, I suggest you see it alone. With tissues And be ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent and the side that still has hope. This film touched my soul when I was only 6 years old, and even at this time of trying to understand who I am, this film helped me to realize what I do not do and that I still want to be in the life.
