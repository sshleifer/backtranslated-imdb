A bus drops an unnamed man in front of a Standard Oil gas station in the middle of nowhere. We never know where the bus comes from, why it's on board, who it is. Why is he the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is he "the annoying man" mentioned in the title of the film? Is he dead and did he go to heaven or hell? Like our man, we do not have the chance to stop and ask ourselves questions. He is met by a sort of porter and leads into an indescribable city. From the first day, all the choices are made for him. An apartment was rented, a job was found, an office assigned. In fact, his life is not totally different from that of the virtual reality of corporate lodges and suburban condos. Women are heartless, dinners are a drag, office jobs are zero. But some pieces do not match the puzzle. Silently effective, gorges clad in gray walk the streets. Is he a kind of paramedic, or secret police? And why are there no children? Does the story unfold in the real world? Whenever we think we have answers, new mysteries are revealed. "The Bothersome Man" leaves you half relieved that it's over, half wanting more. I hope they will soon make a computer game.
