"Dead Man Walking" is not a film about the death penalty, but about the people involved in a capital punishment case - the murderer, the families whose children have been killed, the nun who becomes her spiritual advisor and this that is happening. He tells the story with fanfare but with a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch it (it's not often, it's never an easy movie to watch), I'm more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the whole cast have done here . So telling that it could be a documentary, so convincing that you can not leave the eyes, so subtle and yet so powerful ... "Dead Man Walking" is nothing less than a masterpiece. No matter whether you are for or against the death penalty (or even that you have no opinion), this film will make you think of the problems for sure. It takes a brave screenwriter and director to watch this movie in the face, without flinching once, and everyone involved in the film removes it - no scene sounds wrong. A masterful film, but do not expect light ... for some, the final scenes might be more graphic than anything you can imagine, even if no blood or violence is shown. You are attracted by this film and become a participant, and there is a character to whom almost everyone identifies. 10/10.
