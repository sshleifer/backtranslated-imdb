As with FOOTPRINTS (1975), I became acquainted with it by pure chance: that's what was mentioned in a review of THE LIBERTINE (1969), which I looked for when this film was broadcast at Italian television late at night. vein; besides, I missed this projection of THE LIBERTINE (although I later acquired it via the same channel), but I managed to watch the film thanks to the rental of the DVD R1 dubbed in English during of my stay in Hollywood at the end of 2005. / early 2006. In fact, given the enthusiastic criticism of it, THE LIBERTINE dropped me - my nature was too light for what was essentially a serious theme (the sado- masochist between a young couple)! ;; to be honest, most of the time, I was worried that the SURPRENANED WOMAN would follow exactly the same path ... but was later largely bought off by an ugly final turn (if not exactly unpredictable). <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the free social attitudes and dazzling creative arts that prevail at this time: a prominent philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a journalist (Dagmar Lassander) into his fashionable home for the weekend; However, it turns out that he is a misogynist who is wary of all members of the opposite sex and who prefers to dominate (even kill) them! Therefore, during the first half of the story, we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation on the part of Leroy (including being forced to make love to a model in her own image!) ... until the paintings are subtly transformed: not only emancipates from his control, but also teaches him that the Man and the Woman can coexist harmoniously - with the exception of the fact that Lassander also follows his own personal program !! <br /> <br /> The main roles are perfectly melted and the film itself is often very dark for those who want to; moreover, it is greatly encouraged by a typically effervescent "Euro-Cult" score (from the highly reliable Stelvio Cipriani) and by the imaginative - even exaggerated - look (the giant structure representing the lower part of the female silhouette, with a trap in steel). where his sexual organ should be, seems to emanate from Freud: incidentally, this accessory figured prominently in the images I had already seen of THE WALEN WOMAN ... but it barely records in the film itself!). The absurd radio show "Sexual Aberrations And The Stars" and an idyll in a castle belonging to the Leroy family are completed by a secret passage through the wardrobe and by a dwarf servant. Lassander's erotic dance, practically naked, is therefore one of the highlights. This episode is in fact the spearhead of Leroy's "humanization"; Finally, both characters will have a "showdown" in the reserve of the latter - in a fun way, on a spaghetti western theme! <br /> <br /> In the long run, despite its elegant style, the film appears to be inferior to the contemporary, similar but far more extreme Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally, it should be noted that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the United States by the company of the director Radley Metzger, Audubon Films; he would even use his production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To arrive at the edition I watched: apart from the usual shortcomings of the English dubbing department, the presentation was spoiled more by a rather faded appearance and brief examples of distracting noise on the soundtrack! By the way, there seems to be some confusion as to the duration of the film: its duration given on various sources varies from 84 to 108 minutes - all I can say, however, is that the copy I own has lasted 87 minutes. !
