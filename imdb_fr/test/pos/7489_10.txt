A GOOD THING: This hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from start to finish. An example of a low-budget movie at its best, screenwriter / director Skip Woods apparently uses everything he could find (ex: Lamborghini, super model, cow phone) and an attentive ear to dialogue to add Satire levels intrigue his camera settings. <br /> <br /> ANOTHER GOOD THING: This film seems to be made for the DVD era, with several segments that make up a larger story (similar to the work of Desperado de Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez). Each chapter of the film features the main character of Thomas Jane, spending a day at home, watching the fast and memorable performances of Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter and James LeGros, as well as that an unforgettable role of Paulina Porizkova. <br /> <br /> EVEN ANOTHER GOOD THING: Not really a "good" thing, but incredibly shocking and memorable ... Every person watching this movie remembers an important scene. Although Deliverance will always be remembered for her horrible rape of Ned Beatty, Thursday will be considered the film where a woman violates a reluctant man. Unforgettable. <br /> <br /> BAD OBJECT: The title suggests that it is somehow related to (or derived from) the "Friday" movie series starring Ice Cube. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A +
