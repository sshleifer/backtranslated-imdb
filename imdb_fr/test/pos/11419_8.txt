With all the movies, the horror movies that have appeared lately "Saw, Hostal, Saw 2, The Hills have eyes" Yes, they have their place, do not get me wrong! I went to see "When a stranger calls" with my friend the other night! Why? Because it's a remake of the 1979 classic, which at the time was excellent and scared everyone! I did not know what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It was a film made of mood, atmosphere, suspense! Because remember people, what you can not see, what you think you see, what you can not hear, or what you think you hear is far more frightening than what you do! If you like movies mood, goosebumps, suspense and atmosphere !! You'll love it! This brought him back to the roots of the original Halloween. Bravo, 8.5 out of 10 Remember, it's done! not perfect! It's scary, not bloody, It's scary, not gore! It was good to see a movie come a long time like this. Our minds have been conditioned and distorted by the pomp and shock of modern horror movies, we forget what is really scary.
