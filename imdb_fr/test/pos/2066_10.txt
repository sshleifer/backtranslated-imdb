Definitely a movie for people who just want to be entertained and do not think too much about their movies. <br /> <br /> Lots of action, a lot of dialogue (for example, fun to quote), a little intrigue, and all that explodes. Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis had excellent chemistry. Violent, but not gore. The fact that the female part was the main competent player is a nice turnaround. <br /> <br /> I have seen the film more than a dozen times and appreciate it enough to put it back in my favorite rotation every 3 or 4 months. At first, I rented the movie because Samuel L Jackson was in the movie, but he was caught in the events surrounding Samantha's quest to find his memory and I never turned around. <br /> <br /> suspend disbelief for once, take yourself a little less seriously - you might even have fun!
