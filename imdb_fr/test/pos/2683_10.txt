In short, it's the best-selling TV comedy series of all time, and the most enjoyable too. Each of them is a comedy actor first hand.I know only one television series that was better (ie "Moonlighting") ?? that one had Willis in the lead ?? but he only had Willis, while The King of Queens has a lot of comedians who are as handsome as possible - Kevin James, Leah Remini, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Sullivan, Victor Williams, Gary Valentine and even all the others ??. I loved her spontaneously, continually and promptly. The advanced age did not spoil the pleasure, anyway. <br /> <br /> In a few words, the series is intelligent and original, miraculously spared by the stupidity and garbage of current television. It is politically incorrect and does not court minorities in the usual disgusting way. <br /> <br /> The comic is very nice and tasty. <br /> <br /> I read, with approval, some IMDb. writers, and sometimes they write about their favorite shows? Yet, although these writers are many, I have never met, at any of them, the slightest mention of my favorite TV shows (- but it is true that the critics we love are not those with which he finds in complete approval - but those who offer at least a common basis for disapproval) - who are primarily WILD WILD West, MOONLIGHTING, REINES, FANTOMAS, TWILIGHT ZONE from the 80s, Bradbury and SANDOKAN TV show . I saw most of them when I was 13 or 14 years old; about a few, I wrote, and execrable.
