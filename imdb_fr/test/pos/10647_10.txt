Based on the events of 1905, the silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an imperial Russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by the conditions prevailing on the ship, the citizens of the port city of Odessa rallied to the support of the mutineers - and found themselves at the mercy of the imperial forces, who attacked the civilian supporters with savage force. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a film in which the characters are much less important than the groups and crowds they are members of. He achieves incredible power by showing clashes of groups and crowds in a series of highly visualized and edited sequences. Surprisingly, each of these sequences manages to surpass the previous one, and the film is really built of power as it goes from mutiny to citizen rally to the massacre on the steps of Odessa - this last one is among the most famous of all the story of the film. Filming largely where the real events really took place, director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary, as he builds - not only sequence in sequence, but also moment by moment in each sequence - some of the most memorable images never engaged in the film. <br /> <br /> Describing POTEMKIN as a great film is a euphemism. It is an absolute necessity, an absolute necessity for all those who are seriously interested in cinema as an artistic form, the purely visual cinema, its most brilliant, often imitated, rarely equaled, never equaled. <br /> Gary F.
