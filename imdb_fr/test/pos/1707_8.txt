Tia Carrere was the reason why I decided to watch this movie, because neither the title nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and my money on this film ?? which proves to me and to everyone that a DVD should not be judged on the cover. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The movie had the impression of rolling, not going anywhere else. the moment ?? Paul Faber's clumsiness (Zak Orth) with the girls being almost too embarrassing to watch, and the bangs of the seductive Kirsten Beck (Alexondra Lee), too attractive to watch. Where were they really in fashion in 1995? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Vicky Mueller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Boomer (Jason London) was already exhilarating! This first meeting on the other side of the lake ?? magical. What a nice coincidence, they should end up just like he behaved like a complete jerk ("Boomer, with two O's like in the moron ??") in front of Alexondra. It's a shame that as an audience we knew who Vicky Mueller really was. (Well, the title revealed that, do not you think?) <br /> <br /> What really surprised me was the acting. Especially in the scene where Vicky gives Todd a metal version of his alter ego (the character of the dog), in the little white jewelry box. The actors have really managed to recreate the tingling sensation of a first kiss ?? point of no return for Todd and Vicky. It's a shame that the movie ends with a focus (after reviewing Todd's father's drive, Harvard), his re-union with his friends. I could consider a brand new movie ?? to follow Vicky in New York ?? there must be a good art college that Todd could attend?!? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, a movie that does exactly what we want in Hollywood: entertain us for the duration of the film. Has anyone else noticed that none of the loves are happy in this movie? Todd's mother is slightly crazy (on the phone 24/7), her father does not find it attractive (more?) Todd's teacher is visibly disenchanted by his wife and vice versa? Todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic and daring relationship that, as pleasing as it is, would be very difficult to maintain (age difference, maturity difference, etc.), and Alexondra & Zak do not meet because Alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship (-> her reactions to the condom, cheating, Zak's advances, etc. are all very immature and often involve running away), and Zak himself, the poor guy ?? is too much of a best friend / like a brother-in-law to even shoot Alexondra. <br /> <br /> Notice, good movie though! I gave him an 8/10. Brilliant performance of the actors - who give life to the scenario.
