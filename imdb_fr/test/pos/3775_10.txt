I saw this film for the first time in the early 80s and we had it on betamax. As we all know, betamax followed the same path as the 8-band, sigh, the quality of his images was also excellent. In any case, I'm glad to have found this film, I've been looking for more than 10 years! This film is in the category of movies like Airplane: jokes, oneliners, funny actions (bodylanguage). Mark Blankfield is absolutely hilarious. His transformation from shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll into a partyanimal to sexual madness, Mr. Hyde, is unforgettable. What I liked best was when he hijacked the poor guy's car and went to see Mrs. Woo Woo. Totally psychedelic experience without drugs! If you need a laugh therapy, it's the movie to do it. When I saw him for the first time, I had tears in my eyes and my belly ached from laughing constantly. It's a movie that I could watch again and again. I highly recommend it.
