Drew or Leelee are total girls, but there are a lot of girls who are so pretty and hot, but they seem so lame. This film is not Oscar-style, but it presents at least a good point of view on the lives of young people and "real" ones. It made us laugh and learn to accept others for who they really are. this film represents the real world and what really matters.
