It is a masterful film, with many themes simmering and overflowing sometimes in these warts and all the study of the poet's bohemian and indulgent war years that cover the aerial bombardments of London and the outer tranquility of a Welsh coastal retreat. - the boundary between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience and practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egoism against heroism and sacrifice self, etc. A mature and subtle scenario that suggests and sometimes underlines the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (aside from the strange and unpleasant smile that Keira Knightley tends to, although this may be under direction this time , as the other characters themselves often say.) But most of all, the exquisite visual composition of every moment, with the inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and light, including sequences of fake pointillist house dots, is a wonder and a joy to see. It's still as good looking as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of this master's work. A rare type of film nowadays - it captures attention and arouses emotions without giving up artistic integrity or succumbing to manipulative and superficial shortcuts.
