A disorderly mistake at the Department of Education means that Nutbourne Boys School has to share its experience with the St Swithin Girls' School. This bothers the principal teachers in each school and leads to all kinds of chaotic activities, but both are forced to make an uncomfortable alliance in the hope of avoiding major problems. <br /> <br /> The Happiest Days Of Your Life is based on John Dighton's 1948 play, in which Dighton wrote the role of Director Whitchurch, especially for Margaret Rutherford. Alastair Sim is George Howe's replacement for the role of Headmaster Pond, and this is the culmination of this film adaptation. Sim & Rutherford are absolutely great. They rebel against each other to keep what it was actually a joke, very entertaining. Directed by the talented Frank Launder, and produced by the no less adorable Sidney Gilliat, "The most beautiful days of your life" is a typically British film, obviously a precursor of the St Trinians franchise, the film entertains children with its game of shock. heart, while tickling the adults who watch with its very disgusting undercurrent. Fortunately, the chaotic ending cements all of the above to leave this particular viewer with a smile as wide as the Nutbourne train station, a very entertaining 8/10.
