Chanwook Park's latest film about Thirst is that it's anti-Twilight. Some of you may take this for a disadvantage, but in reality it is a considerable advantage. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, as well as the torrid love affair between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts between the two characters - Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unknowingly, turns him into a sickly vampire but a real blue, and Tae-Joo with his mother and brother " idiot ", the latter is killed by Sang-like in a very strong melodrama. The story and the characters are not terribly crying or insipid, and the implications of religion at the beginning (for example, is considered a healer because he is resurrected through his vampirism, even he can not simply not be that and know it) over those on good versus evil, push it into another plane kinematically. <br /> <br /> This thirst also rises to the impressive artistic level of Park displayed with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and the underrated I'm a cyborg, but it's okay, should be taken for granted. Thirst is a film with a juicy narration and weird suburban characters. It has been shot and edited with an eye for an atmosphere that is at once satirical, romantic and erotic, dramatic and ultimately fantastic. And he does not always treat vampirsim as a mere horror movie installation (although like a horror movie, Park has more than his share of scary scenes). It looks more like the movie Near Dark that never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was, and treated it with sincerity and some kind of lucid attention track, and that the disease it and its effect on the existence of a person are perhaps more frightening. than murders or bloodshed. Once you've seen a vampire jump high or heal his wounds, you've seen them all. <br /> <br /> Thirst also has a diabolical sense of humor, much like Old Boy, only here with a bite intended to emphasize bizarre physical states. An example of this can be found with the predilection of the priest to suck the blood of people in coma by taking their blood tube and sucking it on the floor. Or how Tae-Joo retains a part of humanity by keeping her mother alive, even though she has had a stroke and can only blink and tap to react to blood suckers that brought pain and horror to his house. But these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. What makes Soif stay in the mind is the way the elements combine, the drama and the existential pains, the bunuelian surrealist Catholic meaning but really wants to be a vampire too, and the eroticism: scenes where the priest finally yields to Tae-Joo are incredible by their pace, the length of their strokes and their realism. Not pornographic, but in the sense of liberation and escape from these characters, which do not last long about the story. <br /> <br /> If it's not as good as Oldboy, it's not something to carp about. All the direct films of Chanwook Park will not reach the stature of his masterpiece (and, at the very least, he will always be known as the man who directed this film). But Thrist is a great addition to his work and a serious part of vampire movies in general. The realization of the film is clear, exciting and even dangerous (and what a clean room where "the characters live"!), The humor is dark and hilarious, the acting is intense and moody, especially the subtle strokes of Song Kang - Kim OK-wine, the perverse quirk and surprising vulnerability, and the end, when she finally succeeds, is one of those awesome vampire movie endings you've been talking about for years, in the good sense of term. In a battle between Thirst and Twilight, Thirst is eliminated in the first round. Between leaving the good in or almost dark, it is harder to call. 9.5 / 10
