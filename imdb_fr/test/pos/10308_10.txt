Regardless of the accuracy of the facts, Bandit Queen is a true story, as its themes deal with as much truth today as in 1994. This film is violent, powerful and thought-provoking. The protagonist is a woman. of flesh and blood, whose adversity has brought out the best (or the worst) of it. Regardless of the subjectivity, there is no doubt that Phoolan's character is an 8-year-old girl, married by her father to clear a debt (pun intended), to a gang leader who then becomes a chef de the lower caste. has become a champion in its own right. His representation is so powerful that the spectator is even willing to forgive him a massacre. <br /> <br /> I can understand that if the Western public is not able to appreciate this masterpiece, Bandit Queen must be studied. the Indian context, not just verified in stereotypes. I may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal, but it is certainly an attraction not to be missed for the Indian public, it is a pity that the film had a late exit, censored openly, in India . <br /> <br /> Bandit Queen is the story of a woman who fought against all obstacles in India, being a woman and an inferior caste, her rebellious nature and her inability to surrender caused her the experiences of more horrible in his life, which only reinforce self-proclaimed goddess. She responded to violence with violence and became the submissive woman society wanted her to be. Call it divine justice or judicial failure, if it had killed one person, it would have killed 24 and would have been worshiped, respected and glorified. <br /> <br /> PS # Whoever found his character "psychotic" needs to be sodomized at 8 years old, trapped by 10 men and paraded naked. Then they should be questioned: how normal do they feel?
