I find this film meretricious, tentative, lethargic and cleverly a bad choice of celluloid entertainment. But I admire the courage to throw a script, turn on the camera and play the idiot. I find the performance, lighting, cinematography, sound and laws of the film school unpleasant, it's funny. From the point of view of the directors, there are times when I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. This film looks funny. When other budding directors ask me for advice, I just tell them to watch any Rudy Ray Moore movie. They always make me look puzzled wondering why not look at the masters Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra? I laugh and say that you always want to know what not to do in film narration first.
