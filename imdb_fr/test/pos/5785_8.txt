A really scary movie. Rumors of James Kunstler led me to create newly formed web journals such as LATOC, The Energy Bulletin and The Oil Drum, as well as the data behind Hubbert's Peak theory. Like this movie, LATOC and Kunstler paint a sinister picture of death or withering. I hope they are premature, but by mid-2005, rising prices for gasoline, oil prices, Chevron Join Chevron's campaign, BP's becoming Beyond Petroleum, and even of T Boone Pickens, have confirmed the idea of ​​oil production. <br /> <br /> After extensive research on limited data, oil banker Matt Simmons has hinted that the Saudis may no longer be able to increase production in their vast, aging estates. Faced with increased demand (mainly from the United States and China), the Saudis did not react by increasing their production, despite assurances given previously. Reported world production in 2000 and 2004 indicates that light and sweet crude has actually peaked. This means that refining will cost more. <br /> <br /> The movie seems geared to the baby boomers, but the kids, our children, must also understand the implications of a future without energy.
