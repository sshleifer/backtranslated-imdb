Honestly, at first I watched this movie because of the free sex scenes that I heard, but watching the movie, I just realized that there are still good and reasonable movies. Really, it's one of the most successful and touching films I've ever seen. I am a bisexual teenager and the film told me about my problems - sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. This gave me an idea of ​​how to deal with these problems with the help of myself and others around me who love me for who I am. Cox really managed the film by sprinkling dozens of comforting lines and a little sexuality. This made the film more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain but I do not agree myself. Brokeback Mountain has more drama while Latter Days is well balanced.
