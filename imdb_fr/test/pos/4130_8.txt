Buddy Holly was a pioneer and a victim of rock 'n' roll debut. The young singer-songwriter from Lubbock, Texas, left his mark on the model of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system to record her rock-a-billy sound. Before his untimely death, he mixed lush strings with bebop rhythms. Holly would take her place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voice of teenage anxiety. <br /> <br /> This easy-to-look biography is not without flaws. Certain situations, events, places and even names were not correct for various reasons. What makes this film so credible is that Gary Busey sang himself in the role of Holly. A well-produced soundtrack has become a multi-million seller. <br /> <br /> Busey has been nominated for an Oscar. The other stars to note are Don Stroud, Conrad Janis, Charles Martin Smith and Maria Richwine.
