The first time I looked at it was when it came out (1994), and the last time I looked at it was just before writing this article. It makes me laugh again ... after all these years, it did not disappoint me. Really the most intelligent Bollywood comedy ever made. It is an Indian film that deserves its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan are probably one of their best performances in comedy roles. What makes this film a little less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing. The jokes are refreshing and not expensive. It's a movie really ahead of its time. If you have not seen it yet, go watch it now !!!!!!!!!
