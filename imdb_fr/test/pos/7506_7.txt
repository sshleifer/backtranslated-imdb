SPOILERS OF FIELD !!!! Dr. Boch (George C. Scott) is the chief of medicine at a large hospital in New York. He has left his wife, his children have disowned him, he is helpless, drinks a lot and is considering suicide. There is also a killer walking around the hospital. Then he meets very strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. She wants him to leave - but can he completely abandon his old life and start a new one? <br /> <br /> A very strange film with an Oscar-winning screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky. He presents a suicidal main character and shows us a hospital filled with nurses and overworked doctors who is incompetently run. He manages (in a way) to make it really funny. It's not laughing at strong humor - it's VERY dark humor. Plus, the acting is just as expected - Scott is just awesome (and Oscar nominated) here. You see him trying to keep his sanity in a totally crazy situation. Riggs's character is more than a bit odd, but her manner of speaking works and she's also incredibly beautiful. The scenario is loud and brutal - but never too much. I think he ends up cheating the ball in a situation that goes too far, but it's still worth seeing. If this had been done completely seriously, it would probably be impossible to take. Also look for Katherine Helmond in a small piece and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in uncredited pieces. I personally had trouble taking this seriously. From what I heard, hospitals were so bad in the 1970s, but not anymore. See for the act and the script. I give him a 7.
