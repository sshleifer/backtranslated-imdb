I discovered this film when I saw American Pie 2: at the beginning, there was a trailer for Ali G indahouse, I watched the trailer and it forced me to buy the DVD, he was incredibly funny! so the next day I went to my local store and picked it up for Â£ 3.99 (bargain!). The film is about Ali G, a "gangster" of the massive team of western staines, whose rivals are the massive team of Eastern staines. Ali has a group of Cub Scout children where he teaches them how to survive in the ghetto by telling them to swear and steal cars, after Ali discovers that the government is preventing money from coming to the center. where he teaches children, he runs for MP instead and overthrows another MP in his attempts to get rid of the recreation center in order to make room for an airport in Staines. Throughout the film, Ali laughs wildly! Borat also makes an appearance in the film for a few seconds. It's a must-see movie for all fans of Sacha Baron Cohen!
