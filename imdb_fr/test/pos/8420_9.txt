I filmed this movie in DD while changing channels ... And thank you, it's also just started ... After studying in Pune, this film has hinted at many memories of the city ... apart, we wonder why other films like this are not done ... Each character is so well engraved - the grandfather, the child, the doctor ... except the social worker who grates a little, the The rest of the movie has hardly a flaw ... a deserving entry for the Oscars, even if it has not been nominated ... definitely leaves a lump in the throat ... who needs to boil to tickle our tear? And to say that this film needed Sachin Tendulkar to propagate it. Despite the fact that I am in Marathi, there was hardly a time when I could not follow the movie ... the subtitles were good. Must watch for all fans of good cinema.
