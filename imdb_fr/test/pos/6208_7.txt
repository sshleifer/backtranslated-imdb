A precursor of the "Citizen Kane" in his analysis of the life of a dead mogul, reviewed here by his faithful secretary in a series of nested flashbacks. In the fifteenth film of Spencer Tracy, he already looks like a middle-aged man, even in the scenes where he's supposed to be young! well written drama.
