* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the movie fun. It was weird and I appreciate it. I laughed a lot, so I recommend the movie.However, I have problems with what LaBute meant. The plot is very simple.Betty (Renee Zellweger), a very hard housewife saw her assassination being murdered and while having forgotten all that she had seen, she follows her "true love" for a character of the series of soap operas, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Pretty simple but not enough to hold a 95-minute movie. And here is the big question. What is the film about? The reference to "The Wizard of Oz" is obvious. Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas. However, if Dorothy concludes at the end of the film by saying "there is no place like ours," Betty does not reach a conclusion. and at the end of the film, we wonder what she has learned from her experience and the answer is just not nothing. It does not seem to affect him at all. <br /> <br /> That's what the film says about the difference between reality and fantasy? could be, but the scenes that deal with this subject are short and serve only as a joke and not as a serious story that can lead the film to other places. (and by the way "The Truman Show" treated this subject in a much better way). <br /> <br /> The film could be about obsession.Betty is obsessed with the soap series and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty.LaBute show both sides of the obsession and he seems to forget this obsession, whatever its form, is dangerous and must be condemned. He seems to have sympathy for Betty's obsession because he regards it as a matter of no consequence. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we have scenes that In itself, it could have been a subject for a movie, but we have to think otherwise they will have an impact on the characters. <br /> <br /> The end is simply a makeup that has nothing to do with It's a shame because the film could have been cleaner if it had focused on one or two topics. As it stands, it is a lot, but in reality do not say anything. <br /> <br /> What we have left is the feeling that we have seen a funny and strange little movie that could have been a lot more.
