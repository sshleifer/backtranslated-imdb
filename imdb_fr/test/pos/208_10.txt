If you're looking for a typical war movie, that's not it, so leave a note to all the fanatical fanatics of carnage and stuffed with testosterone, do not bother. Although the film talks about Russian characters during the Second World War, do not expect to see Nazis, cannons, blood, blood, etc. It's not a movie about people who are waging war or waging war. It's a film about the ordinary people who make war and the choices they make to face it. <br /> <br /> Actor, cinematographer, screenwriter: all 10 perfect here. You will certainly appreciate it if you are Russian like me, but even if it is not the case, you will probably love it. If you do not speak Russian, look for the DVD version of RUSCICO (Council of Russian Cinema). It has subtitles in about 14 different languages, but the dubbing in English on this one is just as good. Of course, it's not as good as the original Russian song (some songs are lost in the translation), but just as good as the English subtitles. So go ahead, especially if you study cinema in all its aspects.
