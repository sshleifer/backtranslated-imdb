First of all, I must say that I like this movie. <br /> <br /> It was the first film of director Micheal Haneke that I saw and I was impressed by the quality of the staging! <br /> <Haneke surely knows how to direct the actors. What I found interesting is also the scenario of Haneke. At first you saw a very upright woman who seems to be a good piano teacher and who is very much loved and respected by everyone around her. Then you realize that she has a mother who is a control freak and who is too present in her life. Now you know that she is disturbed, that she has emotional problems, but you do not know what. And then, you fall into its dark side, but its dark side is only revealed when a student falls head over heels in love with her. She can not control herself anymore. <br /> <br /> The roles are very complex and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is wonderful in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at the Cannes Film Festival. Benoit Maginel is very strong too, but a little overshadowed by Huppert's performance. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that I found strange in the scenario is that the character played by Magimel is not very credible. He has too much talent! It is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but spends most of his time playing hockey and studying ... She thinks it's a weak point, but only a minor flaw. <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie once, so I can not do a very thorough review because I did not analyze the movie. I like what I saw! so I give the movie a 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... as to the end, Haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. A motivation that does not think it's necessary to make movies, but Haneke does it with style and precision, which is why his film is better than Baise-Moi for example. <br /> <br /> Vince
