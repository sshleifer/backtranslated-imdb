It's a little gem on a budget and played well. Alice, a Massachusetts teenager, tired of her life, sets off to escape her mother who returns her burgers and her own job as a cashier in a supermarket. She leaves for Florida and stays with her richer friend in high school who is a freshman in Miami. After her car breaks down on the road and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in a motorhome that also travels to Florida. The couple, brilliantly played by Judith Ivy and Bill Raymond, is too hospitable. and, ultimately, a prostitute and her pimp. Slowly, Alice is drawn to prostitution when the truck stops while the passenger vehicle is driving in the general direction of Florida. Through intermittent flashbacks, we learn a little more about Alice and her desire to leave Little Milford. We also see the couple in a new light and their lives and the choices made by the couple and Alice all seem very believable. An excellent, well done movie that you'll think about when it's over.
