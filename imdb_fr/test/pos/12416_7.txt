I recently caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel. In fact, the horror / suspense B-list movies have proved rather decent. Two guys (a naive and a strong **) make a trip down the road to stop a wedding, but have the worst chance possible when a maniac from a weird truck / truck hybrid decides to play their cat. Things get more complicated when they take a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker. What makes this movie unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually works in this film, unlike so many others. Both guys are pretty friendly and there are good chase / suspense scenes. A good rate of rhythm and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror / slasher buff. Well worth a visit.
