After seeing Meredith in "Beyond the Prairie", I had to buy another movie with her. I can not believe she let herself go to this teen movie. It is best to watch this one without sound, but to focus only on Meredith who is moving across the screen. Save your money until the TV network publishes a DVD entitled "Beyond the Meadow". It is worth it at all costs, it must pay you to see. <br /> <br /> This pretty lady needs someone to put her in a scenario that can use both her acting talent and her beauty as a woman. Maybe some of his last ones would fit but I did not see them. She has the smile of a Cathrine Bell and the eyes of Dana Delany with a much younger body. <br /> <br />
