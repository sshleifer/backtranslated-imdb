I own this movie. In fact, I come from the same city as the brothers directors. But that does not make the film better. But, if one night you want to look at something that does not matter and you do not have high expectations, I highly recommend Demon Summer. Yes, the lines are lame and the plot is corny. But it contains key elements of a horror / comedy. I just want to see kids from small towns make a movie full of effects. And I say "bravo" to the Campell brothers. They are now making more movies and chasing a long dream. Demon Summer was one of the films that will help them start a great career with a bright future.
