My children loved this movie. we watched every chance we had. it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without uncomfortable places that you would have to explain to the younger ones my boys loved this movie and they would like to see it again. even after all these years, they remember it. Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had a crush on her. they loved him as a pink guardian of power, so we started by watching this movie. (as you can see, I'm struggling a bit to fill the LOL lines). but seriously it's a fun movie and deserves to be watched. Disney, give us a DVD or a replay!
