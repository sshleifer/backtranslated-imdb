ok ... first of all for the fans of Anne rice BOOK .... <br /> <br /> of course Lestat's eyes are not blue ... although he is not blond in this film ... but even if Marius is not Lestat manufacturer ... even if they have completely changed the story ..... <br /> <br /> how to say that it is not is not a good movie .. <br /> <br /> this movie ... is the BEST vampire movie I've ever seen ... and Lestat is perfectly described ... maybe not his features ... but I do not think we can find a better Lestat ... the way he talks ... and the way he looks at mere mortals ... his arrogance..and his love for the glory are perfectly represented. <br /> <br /> If for once ... consider it a movie ... and do not try to associate each scene with the book ... you'll love the movie as much as me. <br /> <br /> now ... to non-readers .. <br /> <br /> get ready to fall absolutely in love with this movie ... it has everything ... and gothic music. .. is like an extra treat ... the dialogues ... are beautiful ... and catchy ... and even though it's a vampire movie..you will find smiling ... in the characters mind ... and you will end up sympathizing with the vampires .. <br /> <br /> all in all ... one of my favorite movies ... !! 10/10
