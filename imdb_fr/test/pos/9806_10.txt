I think it's a film that pulls the heart. Richard Donner (Director of the movie "Superman"), did a great job in making this film. Some of the segemets were good and some horrible because Bobby (Mazzello) had been beaten by the king (Baldwin, and especially their dog, Shane, who had attacked him, which meant he had paid for what he had done to Bobby. <Br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, who plays an important role in this movie, dreams of following the buffalo's advice that Bobby is beaten.Morton Bracco, pre-soprano, played a awesome role. <br /> <br /> I give this movie *** on four !!!
