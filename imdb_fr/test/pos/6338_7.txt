In addition to being a smart and well-marketed variation on the hugely popular horror genre and a great formula for attracting potential new fans in general, I have always considered "Supernatural" a giant tribute to kind through the decades. Although not always visible to the youngest viewers and / or those interested in more recent horror movies, each episode contains some obvious and more subtle references to classic and influential titles. From this point of view, it's only a matter of time before screenwriters pay tribute to the film "driverless vehicle", and more particularly to the highlights of the 70s, "Duel" (the first album acclaimed by Steven Spielberg) and "The car". Passionate about these two films, I really liked Route 666, even in spite of its flaws and imperfections. The episode opens tenderly and atmospherically on a remote Missouri road, where a black man is chased and eventually killed by a threatening, seemingly driverless monster truck. The victim's daughter, Cassie, is Dean's ex-girlfriend and she calls the Winchester brothers for help. The two brothers can not stop two other similar "accidents" before discovering that the sudden presence of a ghost truck is connected to a racial conflict of the 1960s, involving both Cassie's parents and several other important inhabitants of the small town. city. Some of my fellow critics here tend to call Route 666 one of the weaker entries in Season 1, mainly because the scenario is too pretentious about race issues and shows a different and more emotional aspect of the character. from Dean. He is usually of the silent type, whereas here he is confronted with an unfinished romantic story of the past. To a certain extent, I agree with the debate on racism, but that did not really bother me. The authors have finally had to explain the presence of the ghost truck, and racial conflicts are acceptable to me. With respect to Dean's emotional vulnerability, I can only see how admirable it is to see how writers continually attempt to bring depth and detail to the main characters. Dean's behavior towards Cassie brings him a whole new light. Moreover, what really matters in this episode is the wonderfully sinister truck and its virulent attacks. It is an impressive and overwhelming vehicle, producing blinding lights and terrifying motor noises. In case you love the brilliant "Duel" mentioned above, you will certainly find some fun in the captivating tracking sequences described in "Route 666".
