Edward Dmytryk directed this film on an investigation into a murder involving demobilized military personnel. Robert Young comes to teach us about hatred, Robert Mitchum goes through almost this whole picture, and Gloria Grahame revisits the passion she exposed in "It's a wonderful life". It's Robert Ryan who gets into the thick of things: anti-Semitism. He is so immersed in his role as Monty Montgomery (Imagine parents named Lawrence calling their son Larry!), That the drama lies squarely on his shoulders and that he is more than ready to take up the challenge. Without him, the film would be banal. Ryan played a number of memorable villains in his day ("Bad Day at Black Rock," "Billy Budd"), but this performance put him on the map. With Sam Levene as a victim of the murder.
