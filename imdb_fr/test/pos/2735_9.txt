It is a multifaceted, insightful and daring story about the life of a schizophrenic patient, his perception (and ours) and his realities. Although the main theme revolves around a delirious young woman, the story flirts deliciously with physics, medicine, religion and even politics, as it challenges our perception of what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma admirably expresses that the world in which Mithi lives is as real to her as ours to us. In this world, it is logical and its thoughts are coherent, not the gibberish that they seem to us in our world. <br /> <br /> Here are some great scenes to watch while watching the movie (do not worry, they are not spoilers). I absolutely loved how Aparna Sen incorporated these comments into the story. <br /> <br /> - References to quantum mechanics and relativity have mingled with the wizard-doctor ("ojha" in Hindi) performing his religious rituals that he believes. will chase the "ghosts" sitting in Mithi's brain. <br /> <br /> - The doctor has prescribed the shock treatment as a "supposed" effective solution <br /> <br /> - A window of perception - The scene of the criticism of the book of Anu. <br /> <br /> - Allusion to the illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "maya". <br /> <br /> - Press pictures of George Bush telling the world that there is "no doubt in his mind" that there are WMD in Iraq (now, this is not so much the perception of Bush as I suppose, who knew the truth, as the gullible public perception about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.) <br /> <br /> - Mithi tells Anu: "The one of the best scenes of the movie is "Charu sent this man to beat me" and Anu rejects him of course.Konkona did a fantastic job in bringing out the strange mixture of confused thoughts in a schizophrenic's brain when his world and the real world clashed. <br /> <br /> Aparna Sen was daring, but not daring enough to ask an important question: Almost all men are delusional about believing in God? "normal", "healthy" people praying and sacrificing for a being that no one has ever seen or heard of ute the history of humanity (the ritual / exorcist scene does not go far enough). That would be the ultimate question: what is normal? Who is the reality, that of the believer or that of the atheist? <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this film is a much more complex exploration of the schizophrenic spirit than "A magnificent spirit". It examines not only the sick person, but also the health, from different angles and illuminates our understanding of our mind and our world. If the first got 4 Oscars, it deserves more - At least one for the story, the script, the direction, Konkona and Shabana Azmi. It was really a treat to watch this movie and I'm happy to have bought the DVD for my collection. <br /> <br /> It was a story very well told.
