From the beginning, I knew it would be a fantastic film, the rhythm, the cinematography, the native people of the Dallas area, the diversification of the characters, without forgetting the director Oliver Stone and of course Eric Bogasian ... The film begins on a Friday (apparently occult in the first place) and begins with a radio station in Dallas that hosts their number one talk show, the Barry Champlain Show (based on Talk Radio host Alan Berg) ... Barry (Eric ) Bogasian) is the host of an aggressive radio show and his work is such that he is obliged to pontificate all the sensationalist nuances of the public of the radio which feeds his emission ... He tries to sympathize with a group of deviators of society become lonely and vulnerable. Barry Champlain is an obscene telephone interlocutor who publicly aspires to be vilified. It effectively manages to cope with this precarious embarrassment by lowering them socially rather than by subjecting them to a mere warning ... New techno logies have a stigmatic purpose for the Dallas radio audience, and the essential concepts go to the background, evoking "baseball scores, orgasms and pets of people !!" <br /> <br /> All this is a drug cacophony. induced diatribes and a potpourri for psychopathic paranoia !! Barry Champlain feeds on this high level cannon fodder! The convoluted pathos, the deranged propensities that underlie the inanimate and the purveyors of pornography, and the afflictions of pop culture serve as explosive ammunition on Barry Champlain's elevated battlefield !! an ideology in free fall. In the center of Dallas, a dominant cosmopolitan consciousness reigns: 20 miles away is an important chapter of the Ku Klux Klan !! ... The play is based in Denver, where the story unfolds, other small plays depict the cities of Louisville, Atlanta and Cleveland. Dallas is the city where the film is taking place, I thought it was an excellent choice !! ... This film shows how much people have a horrible, erroneous and deadly misconception of the Jewish people in America, by which they control the banks, their program is different from all the others and their intellectual literature leads to perversion! ! These preconceived notions constitute the general dilemma of Barry Champlain !!! Barry Champlain's personal loss is his irascibility and lack of responsiveness to his alcoholism, and his abrasive and politically controversial nature is his ultimate loss, which makes the film so credible !! <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie were well presented, Dan, the tailor made for the group leader (played by Alec Baldwin) who constantly monitored each movement of Barry Champlain !! .. Laura, his girlfriend, also his producer, will constantly feel that Barry is someone who is always misunderstood !! Ellen, his ex-wife, is a recipient of Barry's anguish and selfishness, but can not give up his feelings for Barry, no matter what path of personal destruction he ends up using !! The hearing of the Dallas radio is a melting pot of socially misplaced retro-minds who have fun like crazy by their own weaknesses !!! ... In part, all those who hide, including those of Barry Champlain, are the subject of Barry Champlain! ! His audience oppresses depravity, seeks to improve and ultimately becomes Barry Champlain's favorite project for prescribed sinners !! The social culture conflicts become the loss of Barry Champlain !! <br /> <br /> This movie is superb !! In my opinion, the best image of Oliver Stone, including Platoon and Natural Born Killers..This statement itself tells you how a film is a talking radio ... The story of the story, the realization and the Eric Bogosian's coproduction are simply fascinating !! The angles of the camera, the dialogues, the portraits of haunting characters, at the very top of the scale. The cinematography of the Dallas skyline at the end of the film is fantastic !! Dallas has the dubious distinction of being considered a mega-metropolis ... So now, as in Los Angeles and New York, there are too many cases for cracked babies, neighborhoods of low-rent housing of the hell and budget cuts that will imply that there will be a significant number of people who will be dead at this time next year !!!! ... Dallas affirms its precarious status as a large metropolitan area through which human debauchery prevails !! The radio listeners lynching in the city have given a derogatory twist to the wonder of over-the-air radio communication nationwide! These are the culprits in the movie !! The abandoned macabre tabloids who want to meet the big bad wolf, and their decadent curiosity have morally erased "The Last Quarter of America"
