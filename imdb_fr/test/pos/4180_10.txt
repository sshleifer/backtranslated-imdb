Try to look for another movie that looks like such a trip without history or intrigue and you will be in a hurry. HEAD is a masterpiece of nonlinear non-structure, surrealism and experimentation. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time capsule of an era, but also an experimental feature that defies time, space and conventions in a way that only the underground films of the sixties could to have. HEAD is a reflection of these films. No matter what you think of the Monkeys, it is a film that any filmmaker should see because it opens up the infinite possibilities of the film as an artistic medium. Without the film's unorthodox advertising campaign (and the fact that the Monkees were so supersaturated in the media that the audience grew tired of them and all the critics were ready to confront them), that would have could impact much bigger. Studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than what is actually in the film - and yet it contains some very good things (great songs, great cinematography, etc.). Should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because of its dreamy feel. 1968 was a period of social unrest and a call for change (thus the title of the movie "Changes") and HEAD perfectly reflects that era.
