I saw it last week during Bruce Campbell's reading tour. I thought it was wonderful. Almost everything I would expect from a science fiction film by Bruce Campbell. It's camping and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely clumsy. The plot is far-fetched, an American businessman goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves / brings back Bruce Campbell to life by implanting half the brain of a former KGB converted cab driver. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal disputes between him and the KGB agent. The film has all the great Bruce Campbell slap stick and humor. The film is somewhat predictable, I knew that once his wife was killed, she would share a brain with his killer. However I did not go to see this movie because I thought it would have an Oscar winning script, I went to see it because it was a sci-fi movie by Bruce Campbell and I did not been disappointed at all. I urge you to go see him on his reading tour or wait and watch him on the science fiction channel next month. Although before the film, he said that the science fiction channel had cut a part of the film to make it compatible with television. If you are a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it.
