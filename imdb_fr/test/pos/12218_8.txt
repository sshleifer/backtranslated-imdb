*** SPOILERS *** Whatever one can say (or not say) about it, SURFACE is superbly designed. Cinematography is simply beautiful (to say the least) and special effects are nothing but the state of the art. Conceptually, the show offers a bit of everything for almost everyone (parents, kids, fantasy fans and / or fx). CLOSE THIRD GENDER ENCOUNTERS through CREATURE FROM BLACK LAGOON with a few JAWS and GODZILLA added for good measure, say. And there was also no one sour beating note acting; some surprisingly solid cast, here. Apparently, this series came out of nowhere and, by telling simple stories, trained the viewer all season long. All things considered, a job very well done. I only hope that it will resurface next season ...
