I saw Chomps for about two days after his theatrical release. It's a delightfully cute and fun film in the spirit of 'Benji', although much improved and focused more on actors than on dogs. The humorous portrayal of the difficulties of life, followed by bullies and villains taking their just desert, is both sympathetic and comforting. It's also provocative. With a subtle subtlety, this film affects the awareness of cruelty, personal behavior and intimidation. Movies have different genres and goals. This film, which delighted all ages, offers an interesting humorous look at our own experiences. Everyone will recognize the types of personality and behavior of themselves and others. Everyone will see humor. Humor makes the move pleasant and brings the understanding of life situations to a new level. <br /> <br /> For a light laugh and a "feel good" movie, Chomps is a great choice. Memorable.
