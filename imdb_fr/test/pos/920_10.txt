The greatest movie of all time. <br /> <br /> How is this an argument? However, if we examine the issue through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colors Red is a masterpiece. It's not enough to say this: Three Colors Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept the fact that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not really good, if you agree that Ozu and Mizoguchi both need to step back, the Three Colors Red is the masterpiece of all time. As a discussion of human morality, Three Colors Red works on an intense metaphysical level, with unparalleled depth. Blue penetrated almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped because he was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat. Whites forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this, in retrospect, was even better, but not yet quite there. Red, however, is the real thing. What he expresses in this film is an expression of what the human being is. In fact, what he expresses is how it feels to be human. This forces us to examine in the slightest details the very nature of our soul, of our ethics. In red, we can find meaning at one of the levels. At the first level, Red achieves a high level of likelihood - we could have no trouble calling Red a particularly entertaining story. However, the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceptions force us to examine the film as a film. It's as if Kieslowski said, "This is not the reality." Indeed, in pursuit of a humanistic goal, Kieslowski can also challenge reality. It's something that Kieslowski has been trying to do since Veronique's Double Life, but it's only until this one, her latest film, finally manages to reach that divine entanglement of destiny, philosophy and circumstances. Actors and actresses also seem to be at the mercy of greater power. Valentine (Irene Jacob) is aptly named because it seems to represent a love almost pure. Meanwhile, the idea of ​​first impressions is challenged by Judge Kern, judge of Jean-Louis Tritignant, who becomes in the end an almost omniscient observer of events - a character who seems to symbolically possess the power to bring them closer together. - a power to make people happy, a power he could only get from Valentine. <br /> <br /> We are able to consider movies as more than just a series of images. In fact, movies have the potential to be more meaningful than literature. That will not happen, of course, but at least we have the power to watch this film, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve something that we can not define, but that everyone has. A synopsis of this film said: "A film about a woman who crushes a dog". Well it is. <br /> <br /> Is not it? <br /> <br /> -Simon Huxtable <br /> <br />
