Well, the movie turned out better than expected. It's not boring and it's not without originality. It's really not a silly romantic comedy. The situations in which the characters put themselves are very unusual, of course, we are still talking about a movie, but the main characters are actually plausible. Donald is an exaggeration, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a way to prove something. The end is not one of those ridiculously happy bullshit, always the same, moral that you can usually see in movies of the genre. I really liked it and I am hard to please when it comes to this particular genre of movies. Well worth a look. In addition, it is better realized than the other films, the scenario is still standing, the characters themselves are standing. And they do not know this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them as an artifact given by a sacred god, yada, yada. At the end of it all, you really see yourself going through all this, the movie makes you feel something, you can even learn a thing or two. It is not idiocy that moistens the tissues, which usually gives hope. It's a good movie, not a consolation prize for women in tears around the world.
