First of all, I'm an American - I have not heard any comment on IMDb about this series from an American TV viewer yet. Secondly, I work in the developing television sector. So I sneak into much of the mud that comes from American broadcast programming. "Unit One" is an example of television that refers to what I would call a 70's style style script. These include films made by young Autueurs who had the opportunity to make the dramas more realistic and allow an organic development of the character. It is inspired more stellar British dramas such as "Cracker" and "Prime Suspect", as well as the brilliant "Underbelly" of Australia. "Unit One" presents autonomous cases that are validated and resolved each week. The mysteries are neither extraordinary nor particularly Byzantine. They usually center around a single round, usually marking the 40-minute mark, and the resolution is perfectly complete within 15 minutes. What makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it presents the main characters you are hooked on and that we find related to episode 2. They are real characters, alive and breathable who have a personal baggage, but it's not a talkative baggage that American flotsam such as "Gray's Anatomy" or "Desperate Housewives" spoon. They are realistic people whose stories unfold throughout the series, as if you worked with them on a daily basis. After the senseless decade of "CSI", "NCIS" and "Criminal Minds", as well as their subsequent appearances, it's refreshing to sit down to watch friends with whom you want to spend time, as it's the case with "Unit One". "The pleasant joke, the un-emotional wooden dialogue and the exaggerated danger that the American series I just mentioned each week are still absurd in comparison to the nuance and discreet resonance of this remarkable Danish series. Episode 7 of the first season, but I've already bought the four seasons and I'm going for the long run.If you need artificially wacky explosions and testosterone, as well as the music of The Who and the quick action of paralyzing neon-lit paralytic paralysis with key figures-like characters, I suggest you stay away from this series.If you are an adult thirsty for simple, poignant, thoughtful and sometimes simple procedural crime dramas, I urge you to watch this program.
