I had the chance to attend the premiere of this film in London. Although I'm not at all a fan of British drama, I was deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made. I was in tears at the end of the film. Each scene was hypnotic. The attention to detail and the excellent acting of the actors were quite impressive. <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the other comments here that ask why all these women are throwing themselves on such a despicable character. <Br /> <br /> ******* SPOLIER ALERT ******** I was also hoping that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the opportunity! **** END SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley did a great job and radiates the beauty and innocence of the screen, but it's Sienna Miller's performance that deserved really the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this production will be nominated for other awards.
