A film like this does not come too often. I'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it. Politicians and civil hawks should look at this before making decisions about how lives are destroyed. I watched it the next day after watching the television version of "Uprising" on the Warsaw ghetto. Even with this new spirit, I felt sympathy for the German soldier. I felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen. It will take a little time to thaw out of it. I'm surprised they did not make a movie based on Buy Sajer's "The Forgotten Soldier". This film shares the cold with the book. Both will haunt me for the rest of my life.
