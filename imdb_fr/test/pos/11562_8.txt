I have not seen this movie since it was released in the mid 70's, but I remember it was a very realistic representation of the music industry (with Paul Simons "One Trick Pony". .. another widely underestimated film.) <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel does a great job as a producer, caught between the music he believes in and the commercial "guts" that the record company " agree "want to see him work. <br /> <br /> Since I have spent my entire career in the world of music as a composer / arranger / producer, I can really testify to the likelihood of this film. <br /> <br /> If it were to be released on uncut DVD, I would buy it!
