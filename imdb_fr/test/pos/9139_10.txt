Having not seen this movie for some time, we discovered it recently in the DVD well transferred from Criterion. "The red circle" is a film that owes a lot to other films, because it reminds us constantly the movies "Rififi", "The Asphalt Jungle", among others, because they all deal with capers who occupy a place central in the film and reproduce. that in detail. Unfortunately, we know that the old adage says that crime does not pay and that from the beginning the men who participate in it are doomed to failure. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Melville was the director of a few words. He did not fill his pictures with a lot of dialogue, as is the case here. Yet, not to be "talkative", they had a style of their own, as evidenced by "The Dolous", "The Samurai" and his masterpiece, "Bob the flamboyant", among others. Mr. Melville had a sense of style that was reflected in everything he did. In this film, in collaboration with his director of photography, Henri Decae, he takes us on a tour of the streets of Paris, which shows the lively city mainly at night and the dark winter in France. The score is by Eric Demarsan which highlights a jazzy music that accompanies most of the action. <br /> <br /> Although the film shows Alain Delon, in the role of Corey, the center of the action, it remains nonetheless that the intelligent inspector Mattei who is the real hero of the film. As played by the great Bourvil, it is a man who shows a lot of patience, since he understood from the beginning how to catch Vogel and, in doing so, he participates in the investigation of the theft of the jewel in which he knows the escaped man. he has the tail behind him. Bourvil gives an extremely satisfying performance while Mattei shows both determination and tenderness, as is the case with the three cats he loves. <br /> <br /> Alain Delon has always responded interestingly with his performances in Mellville's images. Here, it's about Corey, the man we see for the first time out of prison and promise not to go back, but he can not miss the good thing when he decides to go forward and participate in the flight. His association with Vogel and Jansen pays off in the way they do their work, but it will also prove a mistake in how they will not be able to get rid of the loot because the fence they have relied on has changed their minds. . <br /> <br /> Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand are respectively seen as Vogel and Jansen. They were excellent actors who merged well in the action of the film. Both actors were at their best when they took the roles in the film and it shows. Mr. Montand has the most complex character to play since we see him at his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons in his head. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Mellville has achieved wonderful results thanks to his actors and the film crew in a film that seems a little longer, but still manages to show his style in one of the most memorable images of the director.
