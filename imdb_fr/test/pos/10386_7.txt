First, the positives: an excellent job of representing urban landscapes according to the mood of the film. Some of the pictures could be paintings by De Chirico. Sophie Marceau, beautiful. <br /> <br /> Negatives: stories are hard to believe. Unreal and one-dimensional characters collapse and post 100% of the time, as if they were in a kind of bridge. This is neither the Antonioni of his previous films, much better, nor the Wenders that we have all come to know and appreciate. Malkovich is an excess of baggage in this film.
