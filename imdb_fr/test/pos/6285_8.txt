When I first saw that this movie was going to air on television, I only heard about this new joke of pauly shore, like a comedian who wore really strange outfits to me. 'time. I still decided to watch it and I was impressed. The shore brings a new breath of air to the screen. in this film, he plays on the crawl a college counselor who probably also needs his own advisor. Carla Gugino, in an underrated role, plays becca, a "farm girl" from the Midwest with a simple family and a film-clich√© travis boyfriend. when she goes to ucla, she meets crawl and he quickly turns her into a blonde and bubbly Californian girl. she decides to bring home the crawl for the Thanksgiving break. when Travis decides to propose, becca needs some distraction. crawl then decides to make everyone believe that he and becca are already engaged. This drives us to spice up the romance between becca's parents, to befriend his brother and even to get the dancers to the local bar to let off some steam. I will not reveal the end, but I liked it. in any case, do not rent it if you want a poignant performance; praise him if you want to laugh and enjoy a 90's often forgotten humor.
