Alexander Nevsky is a series of superb sequences of cinematographic operas that go from pastoral to lamentation and end with a triumphal cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Teutonic Knights in a battle on the ice of Lake Peipus. <br /> <br /> The film is a magnificent historical show that shows more inventive pictorial, and culminates in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. Several films depict scenes strongly influenced by the Battle of Lake Peipus, including Doctor Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998) and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky was kept out of circulation due to changes in political wind, and was later consecrated as the most influential historical film of Soviet manufacture.
