I was blown away when I saw "The best years of our lives". The film, screenplay and direction of Master William Wyler (winner of Best Director in 1946) are brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three World War II veterans who return together on a plane and live by chance in the same city. They are all reunited with their families. <br /> <br /> The first man Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar-winning role) has to adapt to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) being different from before leaving for the war. <br /> <br /> The second man, Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in a great role) must find a good job and fit a woman, he had only been married 20 days before he left for the war. He begins to discover that it is not the same thing. <br /> <br /> The third man has a much more difficult adaptation to make. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his excellent Oscar role) He lost his hands in the war and has to face the reactions of his family and fianc√© 'Wilma (played by Cathy O'Donnell) in the face of he has instead of his hands. All these men and their families are gathered in the film in different scenes. The stories of these men are intimately intertwined. <br /> <br /> This film truly defines the meaning of "classical". This unforgettable drama (winner of the best film in 1946) is a film that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I were asked to choose a favorite movie, I would choose this one. <br /> <br /> On 10, I would give "The best years of our life" A 11. <br /> <br /> So, the next time you rent a movie, rent this one, you do not you will not regret it.
