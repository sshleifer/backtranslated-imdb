Carefully designed and terribly interesting to watch Garfield's punchy and revolutionary performance (introducing a new style of rebellious game that would focus on the Brandos and Clifts and so on after the war), but all this fraternal affection is a bit stifling. Priscilla Lane is a brilliant and engaging performer, but the other sisters do not really register (though they all have the right to be pure and witty) and I struggled to buy one of them. other male characters besides Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pretty good actor, but he lacks the weight of the movie star to deal with Garfield's misfortune, Mickey Borden, which destabilizes the film a bit. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or a person in the room.) Moreover, I was not convinced that Garfield would make the final (at least decisive) final decision. The movie needed an extra half hour to better explain this action; he feels terribly rushed and unmotivated. <br /> <br /> It's not difficult to understand how everyone who grew up with this photo would remember it with affection. This is not a classic, but it contains a few classic moments. The two swaying scenes are pure movie magic.
