What gives this film its personality is knowing that all of this is true. Even if it's a compelling and humorous documentary that sometimes borders on fake documentaries (are they staged or does it really go with humor?), It seems to go a little long towards the end. <br /> <br /> This film is funny in places where it must be and flows relatively well. This is reminiscent of Christopher Guest's movies, if you liked these or Adaptation, I recommend keeping an eye on this one. <br /> <br /> B +
