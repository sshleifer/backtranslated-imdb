This is the episode that probably has the most to do with his partner's law, "You Will not Kill", in that it will directly raise the still controversial question: "Why are we killing people who are killing people for to show that killing is bad?

It is supposed to be done, followed by the period after the trial and before the execution, when both suffer suffering for the dead whom they feel responsible for and therefore share. <br /> <br /> One of the great benefits of The episodes work in the most complete way, so that we understand the motivations and stories of characters with whom we can pass a little less than an hour. Despite all his criminal intentions and mockery, the murderer is always very friendly and revolves around the most important part of his actions around a story of accidental death. His way of killing is more a desire to control death than a desire to destroy. Similarly, the lawyer's idealistic naivety shows that he does not want to let death happen in a world where he can not control it. Their meeting is indeed important; <br /> <br /> By the way, it is interesting to see how much this episode affects the viewing of Red, the subsequent completion by Kieslowski of the trilogy of the Three Colors.
