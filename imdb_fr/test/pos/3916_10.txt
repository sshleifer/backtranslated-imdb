Okay, Paris Hilton aspires (typical Malibu Barbie), but the rest of the actors is just great! I watched the movie last night and it totally stopped me from going through the whole movie. Chad Michael Murray is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he is just an actor ace. Total hero man. The main daughter who is Nick's sister (Chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to release their movies, most of them going with psychopaths, goods, ghosts, but here you have a wax theme! The wax models in the house messed me up, although they look so real. I still do not have the story with the twins at the moment, I'm just waiting to receive the DVD, then I live it again. Congratulations to such a good movie! 11/10. Anyone who does not like it, please, do not bother 2, criticize my opinion, because everyone thinks it's cool to do it. Also, I think the Parisian scene when she undresses is totally embarrassing. Why not just have a dog that fucks a cat .. be more entertaining than that. When the scene of Parisian death came, I thought it was poor, because it continued to run even if a knife had just kicked him. Hum ... interesting. <br /> <br />! CHAD ALWAYS!
