From the first percussion hit of "We Gonna Groove" to the latest guitar hit from "Whole Lotta Love", this set of two DVDs could be one of the best music DVDs ever released since the release of the Beatles anthology . earlier this year. <br /> <br /> One of the highlights of this DVD is that, on disc 1, you will be able to find a whole concert and numerous appearances on television. For example, the entire Royal Albert Hall concert is recorded on the DVD, as well as some of the best performances of the band's last concert in Knebworth. <br /> <br /> At the Royal Albert Hall concert, for example, the band had plenty of room to improvise. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make "Dazed And Confused" a huge ballad rock power unlike Led Zeppelin I's laid-back blues. <br /> <br /> Next, DVD 2 is a promotional video for the hit of Led Zeppelin III "Immigrant Song". One of Zeppelin's most difficult songs, the video is about as fragmentary as a Pre-MTV video, but it displays a lot of Jimmy Page's guitar power, as it was taken from 'a live performance. Once the video is over, we are treated, in transition, with a short photo of fans filling the seats at Madison Square Garden. The following are performances that were supposed to be part of "The Song Remains The Same", but have not been reworked. Excellent riffs like those of the songs "Black Dog" and "The Ocean" were present. <br /> <br /> After the performances of Madison, we are treated at Earl's Court. Most of the Led Zeppelin IV material was played here, like the most popular song ever recorded by Zeppelin, "Stairway to Heaven". It is brilliant as always, even more than version IV. <br /> <br /> Finally, to end the 5+ hours of concert, the last concert of Led Zeppelin in Knebworth in August 1979. As a spectator Looking at this, they must admit that the voice of Robert Plant is has become more serious and more serious because of all the cries he has made in the past, and this is evident here. On songs like "Kashmir" and "In The Evening", Plant does not have his old-fashioned vocals, but on "Whole Lotta Love" he's back for an extra song. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best music DVDs ever released, only next to the big box set "Beatles Anthology" released earlier in 2003. The sound, both in 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital, all like the Beatles DVD, gives you the feeling of being on stage with the performers, right next door, as one might think on the Beatles DVD when they play in the studio. Although the Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands, they each received a different DVD. Even though this set contains only two discs compared to the five Beatles Set discs, the viewer still feels very reassured after reviewing all of this content. It's also a pleasure to watch again and again, not only for the sound quality, but for the pure energy on stage when Robert Plant begins to sing. <br /> <br /> A brilliant effort from the Atlantic.
