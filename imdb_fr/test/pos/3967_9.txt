Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really, all the characters are incredibly fun to watch. <br /> <br /> (MINOR SPOILERS) As usual, the main character, B, is the most sane of the group. B has this crazy idea to create his own college when he will be rejected by all the colleges he is applying for. He is known to have made false identity cards. So, a letter of acceptance is not a problem. <br /> <br /> Because B's father is a hard @ $$ and he is suspicious of this university he has never heard of, B asks his friend Sherman to design a website for university. Sherman has been accepted into a big college and fears being arrested for fraud. He is very fast with spiritual lines, but his fault is that he wants to be too socially accepted. <br /> <br /> Glen, Hands and Rory are the three stalwarts who follow B. Glen has a Zero on his SAT and has no thinking process. He constantly offers Battle Royals, but he is very good at making smoothies, which makes him a lot of sexy girls. Hands was a great football player who had not received the purse on which he relied and who turned to crafts to cover his lack of athleticism. Rory had been preparing to go to Yale since Grade 1 and was not accepted. She spends her time meditating. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Picture Lewis Black is playing himself. If you have no reason to see this movie, see it for Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are incredible. <br /> <br /> Monica is B's love interest. As most of these stories disappear, she's more popular than he is and does not even notice it until halfway through the movie. Unlike many other stories, B takes it and keeps it to the end. Monica is actually a good character on her own, but of course, she's mainly there for B. to love her. <br /> <br /> There are more support students who are fun to watch at the makeup college. The name of A.D.D. is explicit, and oddly enough, he ends up in meditation class. Kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls head over heels for the chance to go to school and ends up having a crush on Glen. Maurice is an ex-military fool who has had his G.I. Bill and wants to study rock n 'roll in college. The last guy is only known as Freaky Student, who thinks he can blow things up with his mind. You who have little confidence in him, wait for the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bad guys are the dean of an opposing university, the president of the student body of his university, the girlfriend of this president and their circle of friends. . <br /> <br /> Every character is adorable. I think this film has a good plot and is well done, despite what many people say. Although the whole story is predictable, the characters continue to let you guess and make the movie awesome. Go see this movie. I give it 9 out of 10.
