At first glance of this film, the angles of view immediately give you to think that it is about a low budget film which bores you to the tears or forces you to press the Stop button. Surprisingly, the story moves forward and is played across the screen in a way that, in my opinion, would be the most relevant. I marked this film at 7 but, like most people, I think it should be a 10, you will understand by watching, because it is rare that a film is in contact with the a person's feelings and how television should show life together. Most movies try to let you impress with their special effects, twists, and so on. This film has really shown a good movie backed by an Alabama style scenario that, according to most people, would be a waste of a few hours. I would have liked to put the popcorn machine after all done well!
