In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of litter bearer Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a twenty-six-year-old Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji), under 26 years. Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and conspires with Seki to kill him. They strangle Gisaburo and lay his body in a well in the woods, and Seki tells locals that Gisaburo has moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the locals talk about the fate of Gisaburo and Seki is haunted by his ghost. The situation becomes unbearable for Seki and Toyiji when a police authority goes to the village to investigate the disappearance of Gisaburo. <br /> <br /> "Ai no Borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. Seki's remorse and guilty complex make her see the ghost of her murdered husband, spoiling her lover's perfect plot. The quality of the VHS broadcast in Brazil jeopardizes the quality of the cinematography, but there are some very beautiful scenes, of which "Ringu" and the American remake "The Ring" use the sight of the well of the interior from the same angle . The performances and staging are excellent, making "Ai no Borei" an excellent film. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Império da Paixão" ("The empire of passion")
