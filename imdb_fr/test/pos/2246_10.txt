The episode a bit too long last week, which has had a slight overbid, has paid off with an episode that has reached peaks. The cliffhanger's resolution brought some flavor to the ex machina, but it was a good start for all of this. As he is now familiar with this doctor, the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were at the center of the scene. They were always present in the classic series, but it was a secondary problem to remember when the Doctor was at the heart of the battle. This regeneration even says sorry a cyberman during the battle! This episode finally shows Mickey embracing the heroic side that had been alluded to in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is over and he was quite convincing. With fears, humor and scenes that put you in the throat, this episode had it all. After careful consideration, I can finally say that the new series improves the classic series in all respects. Coming from a fierce whovian, you can only get a better recommendation than that.
