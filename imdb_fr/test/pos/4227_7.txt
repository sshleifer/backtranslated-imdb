This film is an example of a kind of strictly adult horror comedy but very different from Troma films (with which it shares certain qualities). The humor is rough and ready but fast and furious. If the idea of ​​hideous dolls with evil powers and twisted minds does not make you shrug with boredom, grab the six-pack of beers and enjoy the best "Chucky" movie to date.
