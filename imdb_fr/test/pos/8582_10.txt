A fabulous movie, which I have watched many times since I bought the video just four days ago. Yes, I am a fan of Colin Firth and Colin was his talented and beautiful natural self. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Nimi's 7 year old son) was very special and so natural to watch. They were hilariously funny together and also touched the strings of my heart. The scenes I loved the most were Sammy and Matt sitting on the wall chatting and Matt then falling backwards from the wall hilariously (I will not reveal the content of their discussion not to spoil the plot). Sammy also asked Matt about sex. Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene and made what can be a delicate subject between adult and child so natural. The words and face of Colins at the end of this scene were so delicious and said it all! just awesome. Merit, of course, must also go to Fissy Roberts for her delightful portrayal of Sammy. He played an adorable and cheeky child character. The two actors were just perfect together. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Nimi) was perfectly balanced and I could not agree more on the fact that the chemistry that united them was wonderful to watch, displaying love, tension and of course passion. It was exciting to see how their thriving and delicate romance unfolded gradually, also showing how their cultural and social divisions affected their relationship, and it was nice to see how Colin and Nia sensitively described Matt and Nimi discovering, accepting, and overcoming these differences. . This kept me fixed on television and guessed until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Colins' portrayal of Matt's vulnerable and juvenile side was also perfectly described, so much so that I found it hard to see when Matt was so mean and childish to Sammy because he (Matt) thought Sammy could not help but feel very disappointed, angry and frustrated that Matt treated Sammy that way, threatening to ruin a special relationship between Matts, Sammy and Nimi. Colins' special talent of "penetrating a character's mind" and showing the public the different facets of a character was very present here, as well as magic to watch. I should also mention that Colin also enjoys such good relations with young actors (see also "My life so far is a wonderful film not to be missed). <br /> <br /> I also really liked the relationship between Matthew and His wife Jenny, both were excellent in showing the public the dark side and the tensions within their marriage and the fact that all "happy marriages" do not seem to be what they may seem outside. <br /> <br /> I must not forget to mention the Reverend that I found very funny, seriously! The mother and family of Nimi were also hilarious, while stressing the importance of the Nimi culture and its situation. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage, I can not really find any inconvenience, but be objective To give credence to my criticism, the only negative comment I would make is that the writers did not explain e n detail why Matt collapsed in the car; there was only a vague suggestion, from Nimi, of something wrong with his heart. However, that did not spoil the enjoyment of the film, far from it. I just had to rewind the tape a little for a second shot. <br /> <br /> I had the impression that this film had everything, entertaining, uplifting and I loved the rich colors and the sunny landscapes. The film warmed up a cold winter day and m ' made us smile :-)) All the essential elements were there: laughter, love, tension, sadness, anger, drama and warmth. Good factor, with, yes, many of those delightful moments of Colin Firth, including a very wet Colin in a scene of "wet shirts", not to be missed by the fans, what more to ask a girl; - )) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie, especially to all Colin Firth fans ;-)
