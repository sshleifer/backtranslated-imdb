Ocean's 12 <br /> <br /> "If you steal fifty million dollars, they'll find you." (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) <br /> <br /> This adage certainly sounds in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that it is Danny Ocean and his companions who have scammed him and now he wants to recover everything. The ocean gang needs a lot of money and speed, but can not work in the American states because Benoit has made it impossible for them. It is up to Europe to commit acts of death to defy the theft, while trying to avoid the super cop Catherine Zeta Jones, an old flame of the past of Rusty (Pitt). <br /> <br /> On their first flight to Amsterdam, they discover that the "Night Fox", a very clever thief with a complex of legends, was mentioned. He launches them with a challenge that could wipe out their debt altogether or bring them into some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II's underground-type sequence. Interesting? Well yes. Slow? Kind of. Entertaining? Most. Useless scenes of character development? A lot. <br /> <br /> Ocean and his band of happy men are charismatic, it's a sequel and as we are all old friends, we see many more situations and "pale" conversations. Too much. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before. the cousins ​​bicker as we knew they would; Bernie Mac speaks too much and Don Cheadle's accent is as serious as ever (I really like Cheadle, but I can not stand it). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling the glasses and reading each other's thoughts. However, what worked so well in the last film is the lack of development of the character compared to the glory of this damn operation. And as much as these actors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this film as a big square peg in a narrow hole of eleven faces. She simply does not fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. <br /> <br /> The stars of this film were for me Vincent Cassel, the choice of venues for the Night Fox and Soderbergh. Cassel plays the pump and wealth as if he were born in both. His Night Fox is arrogant, "terribly cavalier with the lives of others" (Danny Ocean) and totally contrasts with the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film is lost. Cassel and the European places offer a quite realistic contrast with the American actors and the style of the first film. We want smooth, impetuous and quick-witted; not gritty, considered and intellectual. This is where the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can not repeat the same formula twice to the letter, but going too far left or right usually causes more harm than harm to a classic film like this one. .
