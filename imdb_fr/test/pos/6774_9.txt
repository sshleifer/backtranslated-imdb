THE GREEN BUTCHERS (Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark 2003). <br /> <br /> How do the Danes continue to offer these films always funny, written with precision, extremely filmed and filled with remarkable performances? THE GREEN BUTCHERS is a dark comedy and funny, in many respects the Danish counterpart of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it has more to offer than laughs or parodies. <br /> <br /> The film presents the duo formed by the chronic head of chicken Bjarne (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) and the chronic persecutor Svend (Mads Mikkelsen). Sick of their bad boss, the two friends decide to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town, but in the beginning, business is slow and customers stay away. When an electrician is accidentally locked up and freezes in his meat rack, Svend decides to turn the man's thigh into fillets. He quickly calls him "chickie-wickies". This special dish suddenly attracts everyone to town and Svend - unable to resist this sudden increase in popularity - turns into a serial killer, Bjarne playing the part of his reluctant accomplice. But soon, under the guidance of their former boss, many city residents are beginning to wonder what special ingredients the two men use. <br /> <br /> Without the extraordinary performances of Kaas and Mikkelsen, the film might not have emerged above the level of average black comedy. On paper, Svend's character may well be a caricature, but the portrait of Mads Mikkelsen is that of a serious, insecure and deeply twisted man, but Mikkelsen manages to make him frightening, funny and moving at the same time. Kaas actually plays a dual role, also playing his comatose twin brother, Eigil. Watching the movie, I never even realized it was the same actor. The other representations are just as wonderful. All the characters in the city are refreshing, with really wonderful vignettes. <br /> <br /> The subject is naturally a little morbid and the material may not be quite fresh. although many of the predecessors used the same kind of material, but director Jensen gives it a new twist and manages to create real characters with the strange duet of Svend and Bjarne, with this wonderfully strange story of two social misfits. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
