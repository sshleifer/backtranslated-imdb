Like Richard Pryor, Mason never had the equipment he deserved. All you know about him is probably wrong. Skip the accent and go see her stand-up. You'll be very surprised - it's one of the best stand-ups I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy (from Lenny Bruce to Eddie Murphy to Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock - Jackie Mason is definitely up there). He is known to be a comedian. Even Howard Stern said he was one of the 3 funniest comedians of all time. <br /> <br /> The accusation that Mason is not a Dangerfield is ridiculous. Dangerfield is known to have been a big fan of Mason. Dangerfield's career was nowhere until he started following Mason's shows. That's when Mason inspired Dangerfield for his "get no respect" routine. Although I think Dangerfield is great, see them both stand up and you'll see that Mason is the best comedian.
