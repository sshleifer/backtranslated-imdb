When this film succeeds, it really does. And when it's not right ... I would say that 3/4 of the movie is great. I can even isolate the bad side. It's all about romance. All you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes, but it takes about 30 minutes. I recommend you skip this section if you can. It does not do anything except explain his exile. This should have been a minor element of the plot quickly spread. Fortunately, the period between 0-30 and 1: 00-2: 19 (The End) is excellent. <br /> <br /> There are a number of excellent performances in this film, and an equal number of terrible ones. Like everything else in this movie, the acting is either perfect or terrible. Peter Ustinov as Kaptah, the gooey, one-eyed slave, is perfect. This is one of his best performances, up there with his role in Spartacus. Victor Mature as the ambitious Horemheb is also perfect. Again, one of his best roles. Jean Simmons is ruined by Merit, the perfect love girl of our hero John Carradine plays a supporting role as a philosophical burglar; and Michael Wilding is excellent as Akhnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt only to see him collapse because of his reluctance to fight. Now for the bad. Edmund Purdom as Sinuhe is unfortunately misunderstood. This is doubly regrettable because he is the main character. The entire film revolves around him. In fact, he is doing rather well as the disappointed exile and the wise old man. It's because of its extremely limited range. He does not seem able to put any passion into his words. This is particularly evident in love scenes that are beyond clumsiness. He spends the last half of the film as an old man, a performance to which he is quite decent. He has the perfect voice for the character. The less we talk about Bella Darvi as Nefer, the perfidious Babylonian woman, the better. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets are beautiful. This is the only film I know that tries to portray a life in Egypt that is not overshadowed by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th century BC. J. - C. who is even before Exodus. The only monotheists are the pharaoh Akhenaton and his followers. There is the same powerful element of religious zeal that is found in most epics, but it is done differently and this only manifests itself at the very end. An interesting note: by having Akhenaton followed by Horemheb as Pharaoh, the film completely ignores the most famous pharaoh of all: Tutankhamun. It seems strange to use this name to increase the notoriety of the film. <br /> <br /> Be warned: it's an epic movie from the 1950s. If you do not like that kind of thing, then do not expect it to be different. It's different, but it's still an epic. I appreciate this film and I appreciate what he did and what he tried to do. It's a film we should remember best.
