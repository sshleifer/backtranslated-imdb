The existentialist experience of E. Elias Merhige in endurance is definitely a horror of a boring watch. It's as if something that Alexander of Large had been forced to look into "A Clockwork Orange". But, despite the unassailable nature of this film, it's a success. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this and you have not seen the movie before, it is too late. For me, at least, the gain (after 3 separate screenings with a lot of pause between you) was to see the list of characters * after * the story was told. That's when the simple message hit home. But I wonder if Merhige could have told a 5-minute story in about 30 minutes, instead of 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, since the distribution of the credits is clearly visible on the first page of this film, the cat is already out of the bag and you will surely appreciate this film only if you appreciate the making of films existentialists of the early twentieth century. Even then, you could throw up. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but I congratulate Merhige for creating a work of art, even if it is unassailable)
