This film rocked !!!! I saw it a few weeks ago. It's a strange story, where James Franco plays this moron who marries Sienna Miller just to get out of the country and goes to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. I do not want to give it because the movie is not out yet, but it's totally cool and you would never expect it to happen. I thought I would hate it because it's a romance but it's also a bit crooked and stuff I like a lot. The acting is really good and Sienna Miller is totally smokin 'and plays this really sweet girl. I think she should be doing more roles like this. James plays a fool but we end up loving him and the end of the film is really good. David Carradine plays a cowboy and he is good. I gave a 10 to this film because I came out of the movie and I really wanted to see it again, which I did not expect. My girlfriend really liked and cried. good appointment
