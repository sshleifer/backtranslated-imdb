It's a classic forgotten movie, and Harmony Karin has borrowed a ton for "Gummo". Gummo is good, River's Edge is much better. It's no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor who has walked the land. No, in fact, he's a terrible actor. But, he was born for certain roles: Ted Preston, Esquire Bill and Ted and his role in this film. He is perfect as a kind of teenager in a good mood but very apathetic and confused. Then there is Crispin Glover. I think his performance in this film is the best of his career. He is phenomenal as a drugged wackjob character. Then there is Dennis Hopper, who is also perfect. This movie is just amazing, and if you have not seen it, go out and watch it today. It's brilliant. One of the best representations of modern America I've seen.
