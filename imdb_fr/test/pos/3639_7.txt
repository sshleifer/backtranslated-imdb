I know Gerrit. He currently lives in the United States. This film is based on the events of the life of Gerrit and Celeste Wolfaardt. It's a remarkable story. That inspired me to read "Cry, Beloved Country". The film is well produced. The music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashback. You learn the stories of a white racist South African (Gerrit) and a black South African (Moses). Their lives cross each other violently. The end is not typical of Hollywood - it is exceptionally realistic and ends with a note that encourages you to think about characters and themes. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look through the credits - you will get there to see Gerrit's pictures in real life.
