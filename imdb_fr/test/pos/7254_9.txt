I love that movie. The chemistry between the two leaders Miller and Carlisle is incredible, they settle so well, creating an unlikely comedy, Duo. Alan Cumming is hilarious, his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he camps it. The acting is superb and it's a really fun and touching movie. I admit it's not the biggest movie of all time, but it's a lot of fun, and I recommend it to those who love other British movies. Includes some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you can not go wrong. Do not miss the likes of David Walliams and Matt Lucas from Little Britain and Rock: Profile Fame.
