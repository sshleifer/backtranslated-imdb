As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot is not really staggering, the movie does not move anyone, and it certainly will not justify any price (apart perhaps from Blockbusters) ... but again, who cares. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, sometimes hilarious film that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner also played their small role. I hope my wife will age as well as Miss Renee. <br /> <br /> In the future, this detective film will produce bursts of laughter in a reasonable time. The movie is nice enough to avoid waiting for the video / dvd output and instead of watching it. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is on top of his usual form and is downright pleasant to watch. De Niro has perfectly integrated this type of role. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and I think any true movie fan looking for a good movie or just a good laugh will really appreciate Showtime. <Br /> <br /> Best performance: Murphy. Hilarious. Enough said. Staging work: Nice. Pretty action scenes, where Murphy and De Niro were used as a charm, Russo grew up well. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. It will not move you or anything ... but it's an extremely enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> It's Showtime ... was a great success.
