Best years of our life is a film that has been under my radar for years - I had heard about it, but I never had the opportunity to watch it. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to watch it without interruption or publicity. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about this film is how fast it was shot after the war. The film deals frankly with people wounded in the war, physically and mentally. It perfectly captures almost every war experience within three characters. <br /> <br /> We have an air force officer, a veteran of the first European bombing campaign. Because of the horrendous attrition rate among the crews of the bombers, the air force had at that time the reputation of chasing the officers who were rapidly climbing the ladder. This is the case of this guy who went from a humble soda to civilian life to a captain and bomber of his B-17. He also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, called "combat fatigue" at the time. <br /> <br /> The Army, a non-military member, served in the Pacific and suffered the horrors of this campaign. His story is the opposite of that of the Air Force member as he moves from a prestigious banker job to a humble soldier in the military and becomes a sergeant. The stripes on his sleeve clearly indicate that he is the highest ranking sergeant, but he is always on the front line. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have the Navy Marine, who is part of the Faceless Support Staff. , commonly referred to as MERL (Rear Echelon MFers) by online fellows. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical injuries when working as a mechanic under a bridge on a Navy ship. His ship is struck, presumably by a suicide bomber, and is sunk, causing 400 deaths. He is drawn from the water but his severely burned hands are amputated and replaced by prosthetic hooks. <br /> <br /> BYOOL tells how these three people meet in a transport plane where they are assembled and resettled. in civil society. <br /> <br /> What impressed me the most in this film is that despite the obvious problems facing the three protagonists, it never falls into melodrama. The Navy kid, played by an amputee, is placed in situations where we might feel sorry for him, but the script never lets us feel that emotion. The army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and history emphasizes it, but never dwells on it. Air Force captain suffers loss of status as he is forced to return to the pharmacy where he bought a soda (bought by a large chain) and accepted a humiliating job to support his wife ungrateful and unfaithful. <br /> <br /> The script offers many possibilities for all these characters to reach a dramatic climax in terms of their fate, but it clearly avoids it. But for the too dramatic score, the director exploited the evidence. <br /> <br /> In a scene that represents the entire film, the daughter of the army sergeant (Frederic March) discusses with her. father and mother with respect to the captain of the air force. Despite her marriage, they fell in love and she is determined to break the marriage which is obviously troubled. Now, we have seen thousands of scenes typical of this scene where the father stammered furiously and the girl finally run away in tears in her room, slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later, Mom introduces herself, comforts her daughter and offers words of maternal wisdom, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In BYOOL, this scene unfolds in a completely different way from the cliché I described above. While the conversation ignites, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion about the nature of relationships that is among the best dialogues I've seen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, BYOOL is extremely satisfying film, with honest performances from the entire cast. Technically, it's well framed, the editing and cinematographic framework, but never obscure the striking story. Despite the score, which is cliché and too dramatic, I give this film the highest score it deserves.
