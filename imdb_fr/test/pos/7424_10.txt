I used to enjoy "Happy Ever After", but I was absolutely hypnotized by "Terry & June". Once Aunt Lucy was gone, the focus seemed to be more on the relationship between Terry and June, a middle-aged and middle-aged English couple, which I really enjoyed losing myself to every episode. <br /> <br /> The 1980s were the era of alternative comedy, but it was also a decade of choice - and Terry and June certainly matched more traditional tastes. And mine - and I was also a big fan of "The Young Ones"! Every week, Terry found himself in a stupid situation and June found herself stuck and usually ended up having to bail him out. How much does it look now - it was a different world, but it's a lot of fun to see the trends of the 1980s in the spotlight - like the CB radio scenario in 1982 (CB radio was legalized in England in November 1981), in which Terry was trapped in the back of a truck! I recently watched the DVD shows, and I still think they are great! Not liked by the enlightened elite - talkative classes, but a huge hit with the masses! Wonderful!
