I would like to express my dissatisfaction with NBC Canceling Las Vegas. The show had been Top Notch for the last 5 years. The addition of Tom Selleck was excellent. He really brought a nice addition to the show. What does NBC have now? Reality Blade and Game Shows. I mean, come on Keep the law and order old and tired? Not even putting Jack McCoy as DA can keep the show interesting. Gee, let's keep a quality program like Deal or No Deal or ED? ER should be put to pasture for. NBC is worse now than it was at the time of Pre Seinfeld Cheers. With cable and Internet, NBC can not afford to fall flat on the face. PLEASE REPORT VEGAS! I remember the end of life on Homicide Street. At least they had a final of the two-hour series. Hey CBS are you listening? Please look for Vegas it's a great show.
