I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. Whether you are a fan of Gore or a fan of suspense; you will love it. I used to not like horror movies, I considered them stupid. But, anyway, sometimes I make exceptions. I find something really extraordinary in this film. Rarely have I ever seen a film that scared me, but I tell you the truth, this film gave me chills in the neck. Unlike most horror movies, this one is concerned about character development. I highly recommend this film and am happy that Asylum is finally publishing good horror movies these days. <br /> <br /> I recommend! Enjoy!
