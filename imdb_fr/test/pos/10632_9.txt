After seeing "The Pianist" several years ago, I thought I would never see him again, so powerful and so disturbing. Time passed but I could not release the film and its main character, Erika Kahut. The story of a respected piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, expert in classical music, whose inner world is so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-hatred and Self-destruction that is powerful enough to ruin it required more than one visualization. I read Elfriede Jelinek's book "The Piano Teacher", the controversial Nobel Prize winner for literature on which the film is based and after reading it, I reviewed the film. The second time, all the pieces of the puzzle came to the right places. Not very often, an exceptional heart-rending book is transferred to the screen with such brilliance as "The Pianist". Three actors gave exceptional performances. Franz Schubert's piano music, "imbued with morbid humanity," is another brilliant star in the film. <br /> <br /> I have only one problem with Haneke's vision. In the film, Haneke changed Erika's character from the novel. In the book, the farthest she went to reveal herself to Walter, the young conservatory student who drew her, was in a letter. As soon as he understood what he was dealing with and showed him how much he was repelled by that, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika from the book would never sue Walter to throw himself at him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to play, she was not a chaser - she liked to watch. The big stage of the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika friendly (and of course, Huppert was heartbreaking), but it took the mystery around it - Jelinek did not write this scene, it sounded and looked wrong in an otherwise excellent movie.
