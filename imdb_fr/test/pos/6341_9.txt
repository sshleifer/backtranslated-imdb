I just watched "Loneome Dove back" and it was very good! I've seen a lot of negative comments about this and I do not think viewers really talk about it! In the television and cinema sector, it is difficult to bring all actors back for a second or third part. WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE OTHER MINISERIES THAT BIND TO LONE D. FAITHFULLY !! This production was first-rate with the original score, and the actors put their heart into it (you can say it). If you want to watch Lonesome d. with Robert Duvall and Tommy L. J. then look at the original. Back to L.D. did not have as much wit and took a more serious tone, but was no less captivating. From touching to wicked moments, this one is a winner! "Wonderful!!!"
