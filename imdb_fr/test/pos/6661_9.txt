Cold Mountain, in northern Colorado, near the time of the American Civil War, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), for health reasons . Ada meets the shy Inman (Jude Law), who falls in love with each other. With the start of the war, Inman becomes a soldier and his great support for staying alive is the wish to see Ada again at Cold Mountain. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Ren√©e Zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her on the farm and becomes her best friend. The story alternates present and past situations, revealing a beautiful romance. I really enjoyed this film. With such names as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the cast, a magnificent direction of Anthony Minghella and seven clues to the Oscar, this film does not disappoint. My comment is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of them, who shows what's going on with Sara, her baby, and the three corpses on her farm, should not be removed as is. My vote is new. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cold Mountain"
