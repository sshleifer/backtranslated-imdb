I like the movie, it's the best pirate movie I've ever watched (forget the stupid Errol-Flynn-stuff and Pirates of the Caribbean). This film is wonderful melancholy. I compare it with "Johnny Guitar" at the seaside (but 3 years ago), two women fighting for a man, where a crazy love could lead one. <br /> <br /> The character of the woman () the heroine, Anne Providence, is superb, acting without compromise as a child, lost alone in her quest for her own feminine identity in the world of men. She is a strange movie hero, not a funny pirate, like most of her companions in this genre, not joking all the time, fighting for the poor and the good and only killing stupid Spanish or British soldiers or - better - sneaky governors, but she kills all poor prisoners of war, having captured a ship (beware at the beginning of the movie), she is primitive (she can not even read), she is desperate and she As Alcoholic, she loses all her friends because of her obstinacy and wears rags most of the time. This movie shows a "hero" pirate a bit (!) As he (or in this case "she", but there was a woman "Anne" flibane, Anne Boney) could have been in a brutal reality. <br /> <br /> The film is quite short and the story is breathtakingly told. Admittedly, a film from the 1950s has no exciting special effects for current viewers (boats swim in a bathtub), but this real drama about love (which kills), trust, betrayal, revenge, hatred and mad sacrifice. Anne is perhaps even supposed to be Judas Iskarioth and Jesus of Nazareth in one person, betrayed by his friend (the French LaRochelle) as being Jesus; after being disappointed by the friend, condemning him to the death penalty (like Judas); to have remorse about it (like Judas, who commits suicide according to the Gospel of Matthew); and at the end sacrifice for the rescue of the beloved enemy (like Jesus). But even if you're not interested in this philosophical question of guilt and atonement, the movie is a lot of (inexpensive) action, such as sword fighting and burning (plastic) ships for a very short time. and a half.
