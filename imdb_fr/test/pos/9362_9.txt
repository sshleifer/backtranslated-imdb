It was a very critical film about anti-Semitism. However, unlike GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT (which also deals with anti-Semitism), the film has aged well and does not seem heavy. In other words, he treats the subject without appearing preached or banal by today's standards. <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan plays one of the vilest characters, as he beats a man to death just because he is Jewish. Robert Mitchum plays the investigator who tries to shed light on this crime. <br /> <br /> I congratulate the film for its sharp and flawless look on hatred. This is in many ways an example of Black Film - although the subject is not about usual gangsters or theft.
