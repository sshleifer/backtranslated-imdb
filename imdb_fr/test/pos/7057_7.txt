I just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe almost 20 years. In some ways, it was better than I remembered ... to others, it was MUCH worse. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is music. It's just awful. There are only 5 songs in the movie, most of them being used more than once. The opening song is shouted by a chorus of annoying children, and the disco-y title track is performed by Rick Dees. It's not worse than that. Even the background music is terrible and largely resumes the themes of the other nauseating melodies. We also receive slapstick really lame, mainly in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Bill Murray is brilliant as usual ... you have to wonder if he clarified everything. or if the writers gave him all the fun lines. Or maybe it's so great, turning a low scenario into a comic genius. The best part is his surreal ads. ("Lobsters ... get out of here ... you're a threat!") <br /> <br /> You're also developing a lot more characters than you can expect in a movie like this. At least half of the characters seem to be real people ... and especially real people you would like to have around you. Even "Spaz" manages to do more than any other Eddie Deezen character, and when he gets the girl, it's plausible. (She's not absurdly sexy, but he does not automatically associate with any of the nerd girls - see "Revenge of the Nerds" for examples of both cinematographic phenomena.) <br /> <br /> And when the plot seems clichéd ... well, you have to wonder if it was not a cliché yet when they did that. Although this is not the first summer camp movie, we must at least go back to "The Parent Trap" - it's certainly the movie that made it its own genre. In fact, I was surprised that there is no Talent Show scene ... "Wet Hot American Summer" has so stolen the kind of summer camp that I assumed everything was coming straight from Meatballs. (I half waited for Jon Cryer to stop in a convertible with a chimpanzee, thanks to the epic "Mr. Show" parody camp-olympiad of "Monk Academy") <br /> <br /> disappearing a little as far as the comedies of the late '70s and early' 80s, it is no longer a must-have cable, and certainly does not have the cult reputation of Caddyshack or Animal House. I had the pleasure of seeing it today on Showtime, and in high definition! Of course, it's pretty awful in places, but you could do a lot worse in a 70s / 80s comedy for teens. And again, Murray is a genius.
