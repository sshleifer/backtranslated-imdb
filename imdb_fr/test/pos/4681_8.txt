The Italian job is a real explosion to watch. It's a really entertaining movie, to watch just for fun. It is not heavy with emotional or emotional emotion, it has no cosmic statements about life, and is neither violent nor profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly through the crowded streets of LA and the big things of the computer-stereotyped geek-turned-rogue (played happily by Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this movie. > Congratulations to the background music. They really give the masterful tone for such a film, so subtle that you keep on edge when needed. Apparently, many artists have contributed to the music. I thought it was the most classic part of the movie. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10. Not impressive, but a good movie to watch at the end of a movie. ugly day at the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
