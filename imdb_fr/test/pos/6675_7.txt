Prot (Kevin Spacey) is a patient from a psychiatric hospital who claims to be from a distant planet called K-PAX. His psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) tries to help him, while trying to understand Prot and whether he is really K-PAX. <br /> <br /> This film does not really fall into a particular genre. Much of K-PAX is drama / science fiction, another part of fantasy, in addition to adding a touch of comedy and you begin to understand what K-PAX stands for. The story (as you see above) is not too complicated or profound, but it still offers some twists of the plot that may surprise you as they have done to me. This film contains no special effects or graphics, and it is not necessary to have them, the music of the film is excellent. A techno soundtrack and an excellent piano piece make K-PAX a sci-fi sound and make some scenes intriguing. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is at the heart of the film and plays a very convincing extraterrestrial (Prot) from the planet K-PAX, emotional with great facial expressions, Spacey does a great job in the lead role. Jeff Bridges is Dr. Powell, who helps and tries to understand Prot. The bridges are also excellent in its part. Bridges and Spacey are doing very well together and they should, after all, have a lot of experience. Dr. Powell's wife is Rachel Powell, played by Mary McCormack. McCormack plays her role well, showing the frustration of seeing her husband gone and her dedication to her patient. Alfe Woodard plays with Claudia Villars, a colleague of Dr. Powell. We do not really see Claudia, but overall she has done a very good performance. <br /> <br /> K-PAX is rated PG-13 for "a sequence of violent images, and short language and sensuality", and that covers. As for the "violent images", we do not see too much. Some people who have some blood on them, but that's all. The language is: 1 word "f" (wow, only one!), 11 words "s" and some uses of the name of the Lord in vain. Not too bad really. The "sensuality" part comes from the moment when Prot explains to Dr. Powell how the reproduction works on K-PAX, nothing serious, something about it, it's like "having madness in a vice". Not too bad at the content level for a PG-13 movie, it could have been a lot worse. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, K-PAX is not a bad movie. It will not stun you, but it's fun and fun to watch. It has fun parts, sad parts, really sad parts, and, well, you know what I mean. This is the story of a patient in a psychiatric hospital, what are you waiting for? All in all, this is a good rent for those of you who are looking for a good drama in which to relax, K-PAX is a well done film. <br /> <br /> Bonus! If you've ever seen this movie, like it, and consider getting the DVD, I highly recommend it. It contains many extras, and even an alternative ending and deleted scenes. 8/10
