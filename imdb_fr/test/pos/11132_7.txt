A recent survey of children in the United Kingdom reinforced the notion put forward by this film 27 years ago. That being more than anything else, young people want to become celebrities. It used to be the doctors and firefighters the kids wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is the story of a group of children admitted to the High School for Performing Arts in New York. We saw them first auditioning, then taking classes and learning about life for the next four years. The film has many qualities, but ultimately leaves you a little dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Alan Parker's daring director style fits the story quite well. The film has been classified as a musical, but it is above all a drama. Music numbers and dance routines spring up here and there, and Parker keeps them as realistic as they could have been filmed. The acting game is mostly top-drawer with few exceptions. The pace is a little off, especially towards the end of the film, but at this point, the story has already taken a few wrong turns. <br /> <br /> First, the auditions at the beginning of the film should have removed some of the main characters. It seems unlikely that someone will show up and audition for one department, then stumble over admissions in another. Some of these people just do not look so talented or interested. Once the first year of classes begins, the film sets in a beautiful gorge. The interaction between students and teachers is very well managed and leaves you wanting more. The film begins to get lost later as more and more people leave school. Some of these people are simply not worth considering. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake of the film is to make Ralph Garcy's character so important. This guy is a boorish; egocentric jerk. A "professional a-hole" as he proudly states on stage during his comedy routines. The audience is supposed to feel something for this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I was just hoping he would throw his butt out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people who will interest you at the end of this film. Despite all my efforts, I still can not develop abdominals similar to those of Gene Anthony Ray in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is good. It's memorable, interesting and full of scenes and daring performances. It may take a little too long, and maybe some of the bad characters are fully developed, while others are hiding in the background. The music numbers are excellent and there are even one or two surprises to discover before the end of the film. Although not perfect, Fame will be a movie that will live in one way or another for many more years. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
