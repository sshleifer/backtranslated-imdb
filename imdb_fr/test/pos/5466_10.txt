Excellent story with supperb acting by all actors. The warmth and understanding of what Joad represents are off the screen and are at the heart of this viewer. The frustration and tenacity of Mother Madalyn in her quest to do her job until her last breath was also accomplished with excellence by Barbara Hershey. The interweaving of the personalities of Joad and Mother Madalyn has grown over time, with a breathtaking crescendo in the final scene.
