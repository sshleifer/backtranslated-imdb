I saw this movie one night where I could not sleep, I loved it and I tried to know when it would be, probably the best movie I've ever seen, at the time, and even now the cast is full of people I have never seen before, but it sounds like a true story based in NYC. It's the kind of movie that makes you enjoy watching because you see it, hear it and feel it, from the moment I saw Wirey drinking a beer and watching the game, I imagined this that it must be to grow without father, there are so many replicas of this film that I use daily, like "personal time alone" in the bathroom while drinking a drink 7-11, GREAT FILM
