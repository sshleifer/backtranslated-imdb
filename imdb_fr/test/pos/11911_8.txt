Being high at the time of the release of this film probably influenced my superficial mind, but nevertheless, it is not a bad film, far from it. It's a hostage-taking film involving a preparatory school populated to some extent by endearing teenagers who do not seem to be able to cope. What's wrong with that? There are no big special effects, but then what? Who needs special effects? The decline of cinema began around the same time as the popularization of special effects. A coincidence? I do not think so. He turned the movies into intrigue and potentially positive emotions and made a big light show with no substance for innocent kids and drug-soaked kids. Well, you know, not all movies need special effects. About three-quarters of IMDb top 250 movies have no special effects, but almost all Top Grossing movies of all time have special effects. Think about it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc. All good movies, but the rest of the best movies are usually shots of guts with nonsensical intrigues and a lot of chuckles. Some movies do not need this junk. <br /> <br /> Excuse me for taking a tangent, which I normally do, but I'm so sick of this special effects junk. Back on the subject: Toy Soldiers is simply a good movie. I admit that some content is a little tacky and uprooted, but what, each film pulls another to a certain extent. Think of Resovoir dogs. Countless "appreciation" sites dictate the fact that the beloved Quentin Tarentino, whom I admire to love, has copied many films in the making of his first major film, Reservoir Dogs. Many say that the entire plot is almost torn from one scene to another of Japanese and Chinese gangster films that Mr. Tarentino loved so much, and probably still. Sorry again for the tangent. <br /> <br /> Soldiers toys is fun. There is all the insubordination of the teenagers to the unwanted members of the authority, that is to say to the takers of hostages. It's fun to see kids take over when they're forced to do something they do not want to do. Hell, the revolt inspired by teenage anxiety was the key subject of a large majority of the comedies of the 80s. Moreover, there is the tension and thrill of having the characters who use firearms and eliminate the wicked, etc. In addition, the film has emotional aspects. When one of the characters dies, the others have to face and adapt. It's not a perfect acting game, but it beats most other guts. <br /> <br /> In short, Toy Soldiers is exciting, interesting and fun. How dare you bluffed bluffing evaluate this movie badly! Shame on you all! <br /> <br /> Personal note: 8/10
