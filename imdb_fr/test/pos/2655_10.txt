2001: A space odyssey <br /> <br /> Is it a sermon? A story of the history of humanity? An exploration of man's vain attempts to advance technology only for technology to destroy it? Is it the fragile balance between time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacle of spectacular effects? a film that Kubrick did only to show us the unlimited possibilities of the film and to show us the truth: the images are extremely more powerful than the words? <br /> <br /> 2001: The Space Odyssey is all of these things. One of the most interpretable films ever created, it's almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and the film's events than to actually look at it. But he is left to the discussion intentionally; if Kubrick had explained the meaning of his wonderful classic of 1968 (ranked # 22 on the list of the 100 greatest movies ever made by AFI, my 21st favorite movie, currently - and nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Director, Original Screenplay, Art The direction and visual effects for which he won), he would have lost half of his fascination, all his complexity and much of his cinematic value. We would only have technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth congratulating. <br /> <br /> Because every shot is worth taking the time to watch. And there is a lot of time. 2001 is very elegant and also coldly distant; detached. The emotional distance and slow pace make a perfect tribute to the unique visual experience; The year 2001 begins with the ancestors of the monkeys of humanity, who passed scavengers from the planet to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the middle of their house in the desert, then (in one of the editions of the most inspired leaps in the history of cinema) thrown into the air and becomes a satellite, jumping a few thousand years into space, where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the Moon, followed by the film that follows a mission crew of a space traveler following the signal of the monolith in space accompanied by their unreliable computer, HAL, who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew, before the solitary survivor is finally launched in space and time age, die and be reborn a "Star-child". Phew. <br /> <br /> This rhythmic and emotional impassiveness is also in strong contrast to the film's most ironic scene; the destruction of HAL. While the last explorer of the crew turns off the machine, bathed in the holy aura of red light that Kubrick has always used as a motif of repetition, HAL singing a beautiful melody, it is a strangely emotional experience. And it's all a genius. <br /> <br /> Other notable aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece are HAL's memorable voice (a calm, somewhat sinister voice, Douglas Rain), the minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick was wisely confidence in his images, propel the film, give only banal replicas and useless to his actors.The most famous being "Open the doors of the bay of pod" (HAL)), satellites dancing in orbit around the little music orthodox, and this first impressive shot; slowly revealing the brightness of the sun in front of him, played at the sound of triumphal and explosive horns. <br /> <br /> 2001 will always remain a mystery and will forever be a testimony of the strong point of cinema: visuals are more powerful than writing. He is one of the most legendary and best filmmakers in film history, whose unique vision has always been his. 10/10 <br /> <br /> "Open the doors of the HAL pod" -2001: the space odyssey
