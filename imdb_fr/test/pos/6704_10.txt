Lifeforce (1985) was a Cannon-funded film directed by Tobe Hooper. This is a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires that were accidentally brought back to Earth during the Space Shuttle's last mission. Steve Railsback is the only survivor of the tragedy. But really, the film is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of Mathilda May. She is a smoking number. The director was a big fan of Female Vampire (a.k.a. Erotikill). Miss May recreates the role of Lina Romay. The film is beautifully photographed and realized. There are many gore effects to please genre fans. <br /> <br /> I must give a very good note to this film. Tobe Hooper was the man. He made three interesting films for Cannon during this period (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars). If you like sci-fi / horror movies, movies by Tobe Hooper or Mathilda May, this movie suits you perfectly. <br /> <br /> Highest recommendation! <br /> <br /> Did I mention that Mathilda May was smoking hot?
