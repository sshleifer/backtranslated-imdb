I was so happy to hear that Hari Om will finally be available in theaters in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International Film Festival and I have been waiting for it since then to be able to send all the people that I know about its diffusion. It's like going on a trip to India ... colorful, magical, provoking thought. Aside from a rather strange rickshaw hunting scene in Hollywood, this movie is very realistic. It's not a Bollywood style song or a dance film, but there is a lot of drama, romance and humor. The interactions between the Indian taxi driver and the French tourist are a good reflection of the fundamental differences between lifestyles and Eastern and Western philosophy. The characters are a bit drawn but the acting was very good. Visually, this movie is a treat because you really have an idea of ​​what a drive through Rajasthan looks like: a dream. It is sometimes hard to believe that everything you see and experience is real ... the film has the same quality. Great soundtrack too!
