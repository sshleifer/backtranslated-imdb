This film is powerful. I watched this movie at 3 am and was supposed to be at work at 6 in the morning. Needless to say, I was late for work. I could not bring myself to get up from my bed and go to work. It's the most powerful movie I've seen in a long time. And that made me cry and feel the pain of the family. I think Emilo did a great job in making this film. I agree with previous comments that this is the only film I've seen that reports the war at home and shows what a family had to endure, a veteran. It's almost heartbreaking to think that at the time people thought you could go home after an experience that changed your life and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother in a way. I think she really showed how women felt and acted at the time. I'm surprised this movie was not rewarded.
