I only heard about Driving Lessons through ITV commercials and, to be honest, I did not know how much I would like it. I turned on the television last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a simple and modest film that attracts you from the beginning. Rupert Grint brilliantly plays the role of Ben, a socially awkward teenager. It is certainly to be watched in the future. Lady Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with a lot of sensitivity. The highlight of the film is for me the rather colorful poem of Evie. It shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs. In my opinion, watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. The landscape was also striking, especially the countryside. Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgotten, I strongly disagree with
