When I watched this movie, I had no idea what it was and I had never heard of it before. But I must say that I was positively surprised. The first few minutes are almost the funniest of the movie. The store seller in India is too funny! In any case, the story is not really too much to tell, but I think it's good. On the other hand, the acting is pretty good and the only actor I recognized is Mickey Rourke who was not really in the movie until the end. And I think it's the end, it's not bad, but I do not feel like it really ends. I feel like there should have been something more. A final battle of sorts. I do not know. All in all, it was a good movie and I recommend it to anyone who loves Tarantino-style movies with a lot of violence and a dark and sinister humor! I note 7/10.
