I have always loved this film, I have seen it so many times but I have always appreciated it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I do not agree with is that I do not think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what it was: P They do not look that way in Romania. Anyway, Ghita Muresan played well. Well, but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. <br /> <br /> And there were some fun moments and some tragic / sad parts too. It's worth being seen, I thought it was nice that the giant wants to find his love. I have recommended you all. It's not the best movie of all time, but it was nice!
