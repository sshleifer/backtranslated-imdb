If you are in the midst of a fierce war and it is still unclear that you will win, you must be careful to maintain the morale of civilians ... to demonstrate. that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication necessary to overcome all the difficulties for a noble cause. And that's exactly what director Anthony Asquith provided to the British with the film We Dive at Dawn, a 1943 film about naval warfare. After more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some movies are dated. This does not help that the class stereotypes that help define enlisted men among officers can be shocking. Here, as in many other British war films, men invariably have a strong regional emphasis on the working class while officers speak with fluent fluency that would place them at home in the best institutions of the English ruling class. In this movie, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), the captain of the submarine Sea Tiger, is intelligent, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, humorous with his peers, quick to make a decision . And it helps him to be lucky. His men are generally gay, competent in their work and always ready to joke when the situation becomes tense. Although we spent the first third of the film getting to know these people during their leave, things quickly became tense. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his submarines are ordered to destroy Brandenburg, a new German battleship. They miss the boat when they enter the Kiel Canal and head for the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides that the Sea Tiger will pursue him, through minefields, anti-sub-networks and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return home. After several situations of tension, the confrontation takes place. The Sea Tiger loose six torpedoes but must dive without knowing if he did his job. After an intelligent subterfuge, Taylor crushes two German destroyers but realizes that there is not enough fuel. He plans to surrender and surrender when, just at the last moment, James Hobson (Eric Portman), a sailor who had been sullen and lonely and speaks German, says that there is a small Danish coastal village that has been a fuel deposit. He thinks that could still be for the Germans. The last third of the film is a rousing action sequence as the submarine team tries to hold the Germans long enough to inject enough fuel to bring the sea tiger back to Britain. It's a war propaganda film, so do not expect a failure. And did the Sea Tiger really shoot Brandenburg? Are men reunited with their wives and their loves? Has Hobson had a reconciliation with his wife and grandson who left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have the opportunity to use all these female names in her little black book? You will have to see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are propaganda war films and propaganda war films. Some, such as Powell's and Pressburger's and the 49th Parallel, are still resisting today, because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators have not used obvious stenographic clichés. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were pretty clichés for us to remember how dramatic the film was. Asquith can nevertheless create a lot of suspense even with some shots. The Sea Tiger sneaking into a subnet was tense. The harassment of Brandenburg and the conspiracy necessary for torpedo shooting were realistic; John Mill's attitude as he prepared to attack was well under control. The false preparations to give the impression that the Sea Tiger had been destroyed by depth charges were as realistic, both inside and out, as you might expect, and the battle for the deposit Fuel was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it is a well-done and well-played example of its type and time. <br /> <br /> Note that John Mills had a very long career. Especially in the 50s, he played in a number of serious films shot around the time of the Second World War. He had the quality to show courage, cheerfulness and perseverance, but also to be trustworthy, a man England could be proud of when fighting the war. Eric Portman, a remarkable actor with a unique voice and the ability to give so cold glances that you would like to put on a sweater, was at the top of the film. Everyone on the submarine is really in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman handles some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman have worked well for this film.
