I have seen films coming and going during my years, and when I see a film in case of disaster, I still hope that I will not be disappointed. And with this one, I'm not in the least. The story of a whole country sinking into the ocean concept written by sakyo komatsu, a novelist with intense theories about the destiny of this land. The characters were first rate, and even though I'm not Japanese, I do not need a translator to give an idea of ​​how desperate people are. the needs can be reunited for the common good.The special effects took me away, I was literally on the edge of my seat watching the tidal waves pour into the lava and the earth explosions that had to take months of work to perfect yes, that's what's best, emotions are ubiquitous throughout the film and I cried during the most serious scenes. For moviegoers, you do not need to talk or to understand Japanese to watch this movie, you can get the idea. feeling each person and each character to understand it well and to follow it My congratulations to Shinji Higuchi for his realization, I hope he will be able to surpass his work with another amazing experience. As I said, .. .. Fantastic movie.
