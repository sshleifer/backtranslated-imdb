I was lucky to see this at a friend's house today and was impressed by the results achieved with such a small budget. Anyway, it never bothered me, because I love low-budget science fiction like Dr. Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even the Outland was not a big budget deal, so if the money is used, it takes more than money to make it profitable. <br /> <br /> The story is simple at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. They then discover that the prisoner has done it too, that it is a hopeless case and that it is only the beginning of their problems. <br /> <br /> The effects, with the exception of the shootings, are minimalist and add to the film without being overwhelming. he. Computer effects sometimes seem a little gloomy, but they do a good job and enrich the story by giving a futuristic aspect to the procedure. Movies such as I, Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being essentially melted on the bottom and substituting special effects for a piece of land, like too many Hollywood offers. he is well written and shot and at one o'clock and ten minutes does not exceed his home. The characters are not very rich, but they do not have it either in Predator, what it looks like. The great man Mike Mitchell is a good substitute for Arnie and a good combination of brains and muscles. <br /> <br /> Some people may be annoyed by the lack of explanation towards the end, but I like it. Unlike many movies and shows that leave things unexplained, it's not so dark that you can not control it at all, and I'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens will be explored further. <fr /> <br /> A small crack movie from an enterprising team, made cheaply but with a fun way to spend an hour. If that's what they can do with a meager budget, I'd like to see what they would do with a little more money, and hope that the film industry and the critics of unskilled chairs not knock all the creativity first. <Br /> <br /> Recommended.
