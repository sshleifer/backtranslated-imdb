Although I saw this movie when I was very young, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd who escaped from Newgate Prison. <br /> <br /> Besides the freedom taken at the end, the film follows more or less faithfully the true story. This film resists the temptation to distort the facts, characteristic of so many so-called historical films, and we must congratulate the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Among the performances, there is hardly any mediocre performance, and Tommy Steele is ideally cast. Stanley Baker is also good as a Flight Attendant and Alan Badel is good as always. <br /> <br /> Because the film remains true to the facts, it is therefore appropriate for the whole family to watch it.
