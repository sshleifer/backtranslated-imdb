I was very impressed by this film that was directed by (Luigi Bazzoni). The story was about a young translator who had suddenly lost all memories of the past three days and had nightmares about astronauts on the moon. She can not explain how it happened to anyone. One day, a postcard arrives from the island of Garma, where she goes. strangely, people seem to know her even though she has never been there before. His dreams of astronauts on the moon come back to him too. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very strange Italian film that sometimes seemed very haunting and there were also strange pictures that seemed to stay with you throughout the time you watched the movie. I would recommend this film to people just to see how good it is. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
