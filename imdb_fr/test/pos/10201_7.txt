WESTERN UNION tells in a melodramatic way the chaining of telegraph lines between two points to the west. Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore, two brothers and sisters, work for Western Union, while Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for the Creightons. The Indians and some wicked whites get in the way, but nothing can stop America's progress. This sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first-rate musical score and a vibrant color photograph. Scott is a bank robber trying to recover, and he and Engineer Young are fighting over the fiery Gilmore. Many big players are helping to push big production forward.
