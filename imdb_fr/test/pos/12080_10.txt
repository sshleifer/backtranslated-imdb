Many years ago, I watched this film on television and filmed it. I could never really understand why my own mother was upset to watch it! It was because I was so young at the time. I just sat down and watched this movie again. I now have 2 children and I had to try to fight the tears but that did not happen. when you have children of your own! Such an incredible family such a heart-wrenching movie really wonderful! Someone said about 8 still alive more news that you are still in contact I would like to know! Touched by the movie everywhere!
