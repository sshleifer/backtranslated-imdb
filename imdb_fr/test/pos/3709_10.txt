William Faulkner is one of the American writers to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Faulkner mainly wrote about life in the South, especially during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to the projection. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing story of two brothers in December 1941 after the Pearl Harbor attack. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee, to enlist as hundreds of thousands of young men, some of whom would never come home. His younger brother is not starting well. He managed to get a bus ticket to Memphis without money to find his brother. He surprisingly becomes a soldier of another kind since he also wants to enlist at 10 years old. Ron Perlman performs a surprising performance as a military leader who manages to care for and connect with his son. This short film won the Academy Award for Best Short Film Action Short Film. If it was longer, it could compete with longer movies. Everything else, such as costumes, art direction and the reconstruction of the American era in 1941 is perfect. The film also shows the heartbreaking war at home while most Americans survived the Great Depression. Actors and actresses are not known but they do top-notch performances. If Hollywood would make more quality movies, I would probably go to the movies. If Broadway had more quality shows, I'd go to the theater more.
