This movie was so cool! I saw him on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were spinning, we saw that Lionsgate Films had directed this film. They are the ones who made this stupid film Wolf Creek, totally gay! When we saw this, we moaned. We thought it would look like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which is not that hard), it's one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time! They really redeemed themselves with this movie. It was gore, clever and scary, which are the combinations for an awesome horror movie. Kane is great in the role of Jacob Goodnight and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble and Luke Pegler have done very good work as members of a group of delinquents cleaning up an old motel. There were rough scenes and you are kind of sad for some of the people who are dying. All in all, it's a great horror movie to watch on Friday or Saturday night with the lights off and with friends. Just do not look at a hotel.
