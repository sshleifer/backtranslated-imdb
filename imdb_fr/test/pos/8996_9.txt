This film shows a very positive message for our young people. Through rugby as a means, a high school rugby coach guides his players in their behavior and lifestyle, on and off the field. <br /> <br /> The acting and the staging are good. Rugby shots are acceptable if you know rugby or really cool if you do not know much about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film, which is worth watching, especially at a time when this sport is gaining more and more followers every day. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a true story unfolding in Utah. The coach described in this film has been at the helm of the Highlanders for over 30 years (and only loses the game every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
