After a decade of turbulent turmoil, American films have begun to change course and turn away from war-torn battlefields, political corruption and general social malaise in the face of the more intimate world of family dysfunction. The record that the selfish baby boomers began to take on the American family as they grew up and their own children made themselves felt. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs. Kramer" is one of the first of these dysfunctions of family dramas that will continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s, and it is one of the best. It's a rather banal film now, because it's the movie that beat "Apocalypse Now" for the 1979 Academy Award for Best Film, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a breast of marinated chicken: they are not distant, but can not we both benefit? Director / Writer Robert Benton is not trying to do anything extraordinary with his movie. his strength lies in his performances, especially those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, playing a divorced couple arguing childishly and selfishly about their son. The scene of the courtroom in which they are fighting for custody and in which everyone is forced to hurt themselves in a terrible way, is devastating and feels authentic. The film does not portray Hoffman's strong father as a hero, nor Streep's wandering mother as a villain. They are neither good nor bad as people - they are just bad to be married. <br /> <br /> The film is torn in the final, but not manipulative. He has the right to cause sobs. <br /> <br /> Category: A
