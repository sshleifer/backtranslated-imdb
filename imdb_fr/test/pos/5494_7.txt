It's another of Eastwood's many films that mix intrigue, action, and a real nugget of romance, with "The Gauntlet," "Firefox," and so on. Clint's range of actors is now quite familiar. In this one, he is taciturn and a little scandalous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is a surprise. it's above average. <br /> <br /> Clint is Frank, a secret service agent who, perhaps in doubt, has failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took a drink, which led his family and dragged himself into the bureaucracy until he was contacted by John Malkovitch. that everything has meaning only the impulse to escape from moroseness and predictability. Now, it is rather a set of anfractuous attitudes that an artist such as Clint must project, but he succeeds rather well, less robotic than usual. And he seems to be carrying with him, like a stone burden, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He tested again halfway through this movie. He is hanging on the roof of a tall building and holds Booth's hand. He pulls his pistol and points it at Booth, who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. If he does, of course, he saves the president from an assassination attempt by a CIA-trained murderer, but he does it at the cost of his own life. Booth tells him about the situation as they hold their hand in the air. And Clint even has a brief speech, talking to Renee Russo about her failure to rescue the president in Dallas. "If I had reacted quickly enough, I could have taken this shot ... and that would have been good." It's minimized, but his voice chokes slightly, his eyes are wet and his lips are shaking. This is one of the few scenes from one of Clint's films that could be called "moving". We know from his new resolution that if he had another chance he would shoot the ball this time. (The irony is that he does not like the current president.) Who could do it? He makes pompous speeches in Colorado about how they "carved a nation in the desert." Do not they do it? same thing in Las Vegas?) br /> <br /> It is often said that a movie is as good as its villain. This is not true, nothing is so simple, but an argument could be advanced as to its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with his tartar eyes is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Talk about disillusionment. Okay, he can trap him a little, sniffing disdainfully, even if he's blocking two innocent hunters between his eyes, but he's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little to do. Fred Thompson, as the main White House leader, is back in politics, a relief for movie buffs. If Clint's range of action is limited, Thompson's range is lower. In each of his films, he carries the same solemn and unsatisfied expression, as if he were constantly plagued by a form of volcanic digestive disorder. <br /> <br /> The direction of Wolfgang Peterson is as good as in "Das Boot", which is very good. There are a lot of usual suspense crosses in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into a passionate embrace in his hotel room and rush back to the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson shows us playfully their feet with a succession of objects falling to the ground - not just the usual clothes, but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy watches and other impedimenta. Interrupted, Clint is lying on the bed and sighs, "Now I have to put all this back." <br /> <br /> Well written and deserves to be watched.
