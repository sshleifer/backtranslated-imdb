A very suspenseful and surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students standing in one place, then resurrected to share their experiences of death and what is behind them. Joel Schumacher performs with some skill - creating very strange and particularly beautiful scenes. Visions of death are not what viewers would expect, nor what we all expect when we go - thanks to screenwriter Peter Filardi who did a great job in producing this story. Although the creativity of the story is impressive, the story also has many holes, especially in the areas of logic and credibility. Despite everything, Flatliners is a good and effective film because of the scenario, the sometimes very surrealistic staging and the acting game that brings together four very talented actors and William Baldwin. This core of actors acts and reacts very well to each other. Keifer Sutherland does a very impressive job as leader of the group - the one who had the idea of ​​dying and being born again. He also manages to portray a man - a young man - with a destructive and destructive secret of his past. Kevin Bacon is good as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group. Oliver Platt is really good as a voice of reason and human fears. Platt has very good lines and plays paranoia well. Yes, Julia Roberts is here too and very well. the actors do better by playing each other and making us believe that they are such good friends. I was duly impressed by many Flatliners, but more than anything, the story touched me the most. The scene with this dog lying in the street is just one of those powerful images evoked, like many scenes of "flashback".
