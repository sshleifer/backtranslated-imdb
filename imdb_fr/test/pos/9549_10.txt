There are films that make a career. For George Romero, it was the night of the living dead; for Kevin Smith, CLERK; for Robert Rodriguez, EL MARIACHI. Add to this list DING-A-LING-LESS, absolutely amazing. Realization of irreproachable films, as assured and professional as all the aforementioned films. I have not laughed so much since I saw THE FULL MONTY. (And even then, I do not think I laughed so well ... So, to speak.) Tukel's talent is considerable: DING-A-LING-LESS is so full of double meaning that it would take sit down with a copy of this script and do a line-by-line review of it to fully appreciate it, uh, width and width. Each shot is beautifully composed (obvious sign of a sure director), and the performances are solid (there is no breathtaking scenery that could have been expected from a movie like this). DING-A-LING-LESS is a film whose time has come.
