It's hard to imagine that "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch", made by the legendary D.W. Griffith was created in 1914. It's a showcase for Griffith's emerging style. <br /> <br /> The story centers on a group of settlers called the Cameron Brothers and their families, including a young waif (Mae Marsh) sent from the east to live with his uncles and a young wife (Lillian Gish) who has just given birth. A group of Indians tries to capture the waif's pet dogs and is hunted by the men. During the confrontation, the son of the Indian chief (Henry B. Wathall) is killed. The Indian chief plans his revenge and launches an attack on the small community of Elderbush Gulch. <br /> <br /> It is this attack, quite brutal and graphic for this time or another, which constitutes the core of the image. The Indians massacred the city's inhabitants, women and children, and drove them out of the city to the Cameron family home. The newborn is separated from his mother and all hell is unleashed. Someone will seek help and come back quickly with the ordeal. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes contain graphic violence. For example, we see a live scalping woman and there is also a sequence where we see a horse being shot. I have never seen an animal being killed so convincingly on the screen. Mr. Griffith became a master of staged large-scale battle scenes, a talent he would use extensively in his epic drama of the Civil War, "The Birth of a Nation," released the following year . <br /> <br /> Even though "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch" lasts just 29 minutes but is nevertheless an exciting and historic film. See if you can spot Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in pieces.
