I saw this movie on A & E last weekend. The mystery was fine, I was not able to guess the culprit before the end. But I appreciated the characters and their development much more than the mystery. Some of them were mysterious, including George Abernathie, played by the wonderful Michael Fassbender and George's cousin Susannah. In fact, the story of these two characters left me wanting to know more. From what I tried to please the book Agatha Christie of the same title, I think this film did not follow it to the letter. Very good performances of the actors involved, notably Fassbender and the lady who played Cora / Companion.
