I have not seen "Hardware Wars" for years, but I remember it as one of the hilarious events in the human experience, and it was over too soon. Every aspect of this movie was hilarious, and even better than "Star Wars". I laughed. I cried. After looking at it, I asked a family member for a moment with three dollars just to kiss him goodbye (I'm kidding for the last one). I love when Ham Salad's boyfriend / co-pilot tries to eat Princess Anne Droid's cinnamon buns, and the character of Darph Nader is just hilarious! This movie would be great to watch immediately with "Thumb Wars" and I sincerely hope there could have been a "Hardware Wars, Episode II: The Arbiter on Strike". (Was here?)
