The characteristic of the creature of the early 80's is a long-abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to discover. Naturally, they do not find gold there, but a very hungry monster who sneaks in search of prey. <br /> <br /> I must be honest and admit that I found it boring at first (I personally prefer the similar theme "The Boogens"), it has actually grown over the years. Now, the characters are not too interesting nor the actors either. The closest character to an interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. Be that as it may, the main woman Terri Berland is pretty and Rolf Theison makes her domineering fool a person easy to hate. The writer interpreted by the man of the effects Mark Sawicki shoves quickly. <br /> <br /> It starts in a fairly predictable way, with a night room in which two victims are supposed to have an acceptable start. The monster intrigues itself by its design (as you can imagine, it is revealed a little at a time until late in the game) and by the product of frame-by-frame animation when this process was not more widely used. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (under the pseudonym David Michael Hillman) and her team deserve credit for creating their atmosphere. They manage to make the film quite dark and dark, and their use of lighting works well. The film builds intensity towards a pretty good end. Suffice to say that they do their best with their small budget. <br /> <br /> A little obscure article that is worth studying for horror buffs. <br /> 7/10
