I managed to record THE DION BROTHERS in the early '80s with commercials. I lent it to many friends, who all agree that it's one of B's ​​best "bandit" movies ever made. One day when I was going to my apartment in New York, I saw Stacy Keach shoot a scene for her television series Mickey Spilane. We had a moment to chat and I told him how much I liked THE DION BROS and considered it a pure classic. He thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable film experiences of his career. He was very friendly and sincere, and I was grateful for the few moments he spent chatting with a fan. This is a classic that must be on DVD.
