This is the type of film that may have to be seen several times to capture all its beauty and intelligence (just like Curse of Frankenstein of 1957). If you do not like unconventional strange movies, avoid this masterpiece. For me, the work in this film alone is worth the purchase price of the videocassette. The scenario is a little fantastic but seems to become a reality in our world today. To be produced in the 1980s, this film proves to be a prophetic vision of what will happen with Big Government and Big Brother who want to control us and monitor us. <br /> <br /> There are many slow sections and the dialogue can be quite difficult to catch in many scenes {that's why I watched it 6 times now}, but if you can digest it all, could be worth your time. <br /> <br /> The film is fundamentally about a world where people have become robotic machines that have lost their individualism. They are only concerned with accumulation and procreation. The film's hero did not succumb to this illness and was not "tagged" and watched by his big brother. Its mission is to release a secret drug in the water supply, which will change the thinking of human robots and allow individualism to become a part of humanity. <br /> <br /> Yes, his budget is very low, but in his day, computer effects and sound effects are unique and fascinating paintings. If you have an open mind, this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling.
