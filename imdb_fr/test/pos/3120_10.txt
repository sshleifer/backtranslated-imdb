For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - that Ford has made. The dialog box is fast, crisp, and accurate. The story starts at the very beginning and ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small distribution, but directs and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Sadly realistic, warmly amusing, acted brilliantly (difficult to believe that Johnsonj could not become an important man after that), with the best photography and the best editing of all American black and white films. Owes a lot to Sergei Eisenstein's editing technique, but never as cold and detached as this "scientific" one. And a beautiful musical score. A magnificent panorama of an important and misunderstood episode in American history. <br /> <br /> A small problem: we do not know why the film features the Mormons, who, to my knowledge, were never the pacifists of the Quakers and Amish were. This confusion leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the movie is a treat, it's easy to ignore. In all other respects, a true masterpiece of American cinema that must be revitalized and reviewed (and again and again).
