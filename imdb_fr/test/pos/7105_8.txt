The latest suites, besides Abbott and Costello, meet Frankenstein, who was more or less a parody. This time, Dracula (John Carridine) is in the center of the scene seeking a cure for his vampirism from a kind doctor (Onslow Stevens). Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr) is also looking for a cure. The good doc manages to heal Larry's werewolf, but Dracula cheats on the doc and ends up contaminating his blood and makes this doc a crazy delirious.oh and all that time big Franky (strange Glenn) is lying on a table and wait for his electrical solution so he can do some damage. It was a kind of short film, about 70 minutes and some changes, but the action is there and the big actors are also there.Lionel atwill introduces himself as a police inspector, here are some anecdotes, Lionel appeared in the son of Frankenstein , Frankenstein's ghost, Frankenstein meets the wolf-man and Frankenstein's house. and then this one. If there is another one in the series where they may have added the creature of the black lagoon to the queue, I give Dracula's house 8 out of 10.
