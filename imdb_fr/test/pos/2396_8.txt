No doubt that the independent film Eddie Monroe is one of the best independent films I've seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. I first saw Paul, or "Big Paulie", as it was called in the indie tube of Danny Provenzano, "This Thing Of Bear". Fortunately, the filmmaker "Eddie Monroe" did the same and used Paul's undeniable skills in a lead role (main?). This resulted in a performance (using camera and voiceover as well) that shows studio roles worthy of a big budget in the very near future. It's refreshing to see a skilled actor, engaged in the business, prove the same to the public. Keep up the good work with Big Paulie and we'll see you soon in Hollywood! Not bad for a Canarsie child, huh?
