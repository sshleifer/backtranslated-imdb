Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this amazingly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband - and the fact that perhaps the youthful joy and excitement of her youth are behind her. We learn little about the marriage of this woman, except that she has felt her independence crumbling for some time; she also recently learned that she was pregnant, which further complicated her heart (she does not want to be an indifferent woman, despite the maternal tone with which she speaks to her husband on the phone). She meets two men during her trip: a former university football hero who, after an accident during a meeting, suffered permanent brain damage, and a sexy motorcycle police officer who struts and has a lot of hardly live. The clear and clear landscapes (photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) are cleverly made, as are the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan and Robert Duvall each offer strong and captivating performances, all the more so because they are not very friendly from a conventional point of view. Some scenes (like Knight's first call home from a payphone, or his first night alone with Caan where they play "Simon Says") are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola plays with reality, transforming the jagged memories of her characters into albums of memories to which we are accustomed. It allows the scenes to unfold, but the editing is quite lively and the film is never too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments). It's an intoxicating endeavor - so much so that the photo was still shown at festivals nearly five years later. Some may avoid the unapologetic distortion of the Coppola events to emphasize the end with bitter irony. However, the strength and motivation behind the image almost completely erase its shortcomings. *** of ****
