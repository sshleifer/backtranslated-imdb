It was a great movie with incredibly realistic flight scenes! I have seen it many times and this has always caught my attention. I myself am a big fan of the Air Force and I love watching all the movies in which I can get a glimpse of an F-16 in flight. If you like Top Gun, I guarantee you that you will also like this movie. Apart from a few curse words, it's a great movie for the whole family. He has a great plot and does not have a moment of boredom throughout the movie. Each second is filled with action and lets you wait to see what happens next. So again I highly recommend this movie !!!
