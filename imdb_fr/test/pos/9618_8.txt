Five Fingers of Death: Although the previous epics of Shaw Martial Arts have shown the influence of the American cowboy genre, none of them have paid homage to him as openly as this one, especially in the saloon fights scene . And although the films of Shaw Bros. have borrowed from the Japanese genre chambara (swordfight) before, none has done so successfully as this one. I guess that's partly because the director is originally from Korea, so he brought a non-Chinese perspective to such borrowings, which certainly raises interesting questions about culture. but anyway, this film presents real technological and technical innovations in Hong Kong action movies. For the first time in Hong Kong, the camera had access to an entire set, which meant taking shots from different angles, such as the dive shot showing the ceiling of a room (the innovation original American). usually attributed to John Ford), or the long, high-angle shot that allowed viewing of a large area on the ground, or frontal firing. <br /> <br /> It is true that it was not the first hand in the hand. real cinematic substance fight movie - this remains Wang Yu's "Chinese Boxer"; but commercially, Shaw Bros. was right to choose "Five Fingers" as the first major release in the West because it could be said that it was the "least Chinese" of their action films, that is to say the least dependent purely Chinese theater traditions . Although this did not impress the American critics of the time (who unanimously distorted the image), it did not escape the American public, especially African-Americans, whose culture had always been - by need - an eclectic patchwork of borrowed elements and innovation. In "Five Fingers", they had the opportunity to discover the heart of the story, the serious young man forced to make the extra effort to overcome social barriers and betrayal in order to recognize his merit. This seems to be a universal problem to Modernity, but each culture has its own way of expressing and solving it; "Five Fingers" presented it in the same way as many Americans and Chinese. <br /> <br /> Does the film have only historical value? Certainly not. On the one hand, this problem has not disappeared. Secondly, some of the innovations give the film an appearance as fresh as on its first release. In addition, the action is well organized and performance, although a little too serious, are clear. The film may be too long, but the story covers a lot of ground. And there are wonderful sets overall, such as the saloon showdown, the fight on the road to the competition, the strange double final. <br /> <br /> definitely looks better on a theater screen, but still impressive for the home visit: recommended.
