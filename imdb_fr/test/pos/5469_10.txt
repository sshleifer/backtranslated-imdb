Almost no information is available on this film or its release dates. After a thorough and ongoing search, the DVD is available for version 3.99! From February 28, 2006. Try yahoo / DVD and video. In order to obtain this information, I will continue to say that it is a well-made film that tells a fascinating and fascinating story of a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in a church. It's a chance to see William L. Peterson before C.S.I. turned it into a star. Venerable Barbara Hershey is also part of the story. Does anyone remember his past Barbara Hershey Seagull? I have to keep writing for this to be published. Thanks to previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure TV movie that obviously leaves a lasting impression to many.
