I am very impressed by the acting in Comanche Moon. Before looking at that, I did not expect it to be as good as Lonesome Dove. I could not believe how much the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. It struck me how much they played each role! It was in my opinion almost as good as Lonesome Dove. It's hard to compare a movie to Lonesome Dove. If you do not make that comparison, I'll give it a thumbs up. It was very fun! I do not post a lot of comments on this site, but I just thought I had to make my opinion known. Unbelievable! I do not want to leave by naming each actor who has been brilliant, because I should probably name one. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit the nail on the head playing Captain Gus. His manners were perfect.
