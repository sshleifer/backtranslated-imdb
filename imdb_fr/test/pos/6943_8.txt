Although I lived in Australia in 1975, I emigrated abroad shortly afterwards, fed up with constant industrial troubles, the general cult of mediocrity - unless sporting! and the complacency of so many Australians who have chosen to ignore the dizzying pace of change in the countries to the north. <br /> <br /> As a result, I missed The Dismissal, as well as many other Australian television series from the '80s and' 90s, such as the superb Janus and Phoenix series I've seen since, as well as Wildside. <br /> <br /> For me, the filmed story of The Dismissal is accurate and, as far as I know, accurate. However, with regard to the "indignation" of the public, it shows only one aspect of the picture, not how families were torn by controversy. I know, as my two brothers would not talk to me for months afterwards. <br /> <br /> But the comment is, in my opinion, very biased. The inescapable fact is that, despite fierce expressions of rage by a large part of the population, the Australian electorate chose - and decided - to favor Fraser, as it did two years later. <br /> <br /> This apart, a docudrama historically accurate and superbly played.
