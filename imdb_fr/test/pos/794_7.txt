This metro film is episodic, but almost a series of lawsuits, aimed primarily at escaping the police, real or imagined, because Buster is confused with an escaped criminal. It's always inventive and fun. His greatest asset is documenting what Hollywood looked like in the early twenties, as 95% of them were filmed outdoors in the streets and outdoor buildings of the time. A moment and a sequence of gems are present here. <br /> <br /> The big moment is when a very distant train approaches the camera quickly and finally stops just below - with Buster sitting darkly on the cowcatcher and So, in a few seconds, you move from a close-up to a close-up <br /> <br /> The right sequence is the one with the phone booth next to the elevator - one being constantly mistaken for another with floor-to-floor runs - one of Keaton's big gags. <br /> <br /> Kino's print is crisp and clean - almost blank. There is an accompaniment for violin / piano. This is to look for and appreciate.
