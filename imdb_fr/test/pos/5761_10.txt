This film had very funny moments. The aforementioned feeb sketch for beginners. <br /> <br /> The parties where Rik tries to act with dignity in front of his guests, looking through their noses. Made very subtly, especially since the guest was himself an adulterous caramelized nose. <br /> <br /> The scene where Rik discovers that Gina has a fianc√©, "Ahhh, she was training me all the time, the brazen pussy" with her 2 candle eyes. As if she really believed him. But he believed it. That's why it was so funny. Great moment. <br /> <br /> Gino was also excellent. He should have been used more as the wicked man. "Where are the whores I ordered!" He blows. Bright trick.
