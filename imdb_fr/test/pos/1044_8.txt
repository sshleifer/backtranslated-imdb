I love this movie about a columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) from a big housewives magazine, which publishes a monthly welcome article that contains details about her wonderful family life as wife and mother in a beautiful house. of Connecticut. The problem arises when the owner of his monthly publication asks him to invite him and a WWII hero during the Christmas holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small apartment in New York, is not married and does not have a baby - and does not know how to cook at all! The hilarity (and romance) ensues when she tries to make a credible gesture in order to save face / not to be fired by the owner of the magazine (played by Sydney Greenstreet). It's a delicious comedy. one that I highly recommend to lovers of classical cinema !!!!
