This movie is great - especially if you like visual art. The landscapes that the two girls paint and photograph are beautiful. The story is both funny and poignant. <br /> <br /> Fans of European films and "art films" will appreciate this film. It's really an art film - it contains a lot of art. Go rent it. <br /> <br />
