Late at night on BBC1, I was about to go to bed, but the curiosity aroused by a contemporary Irish movie, so I stayed a few minutes to watch, and then to the end. I must admit that the main attraction was the only English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> It's presented as a dark comedy, which is one of the hardest things to get. . This should be the perfect mix of horror and horrible laughter, so you do not know why you're laughing. For me, After Hours (1985) by Martin Scorsese is the best example. Dead Bodies is darker than comedy, but the plot turns and turns black. I did not spot the latest twists in the story, unlike other posters here. So I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> In 2003, the Irish film industry seems to me quite worthy; it does not appear that they spent too much money on clothing, so they had the opportunity to get their money back. The scenario could have been much more precise, but the acting was overall very good. I am happy to have looked at him, his faults and everything, even if I do not think I have learned much about Ireland today, especially about his methods of policing!
