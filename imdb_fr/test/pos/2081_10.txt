Caught this movie on TCM in early A.M. It was amazing. <br /> <br /> Start slowly but worryingly ... Scott is a shady character who attacks women. In this case, two women who owe an inheritance to Southern California. <br /> <br /> The scenery of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940s are original and intriguing. The title may have been more creative, but the theme and the shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed, almost in a Hitchcockian version. <br /> <br /> Scott reminded me of Uncle Charley's character in "Shadow of a Doubt". , one of Hitch's favorite movies. The public learns that we really do not know what is hidden in the dark side of the human spirit. This film is a misplaced jewel that is worth buying. 10/10.
