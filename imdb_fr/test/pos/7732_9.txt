Simply charming. It's long. No climax. Do not wait for anything. Ideal for a rainy day. About a middle-aged crisis man who takes his family to an isolated area of ​​the Greek islands. I saw him as a teenager and I still love him more than 20 years later. I could not find it in the video stores though. Molly Ringwald is a pretty middle-aged teenager who wants to go home and settle more or less at home. There is no telephone, no television, boredom, which, when struck with calmness, the human condition must be bored and then reflect. And each character does it. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved in the character of John Cassavetes, but he is unable to, well, you know. Gina Rowlands, is the woman who loves him but who is about to give up their marriage. It is demanding and frustrating for everyone. There is another character in the movie, a Greek girl who talks about sex to Molly Ringwald inappropriately, but things that are curious. But he is irritating and excited and I did not like this character. The location of the film is what makes this film so good. It would not work if filmed elsewhere. I recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
