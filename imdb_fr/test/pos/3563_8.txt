A group of bandits led by Monetero, cunning, sturdy and ruthless (a perfectly imposing performance of Gilbert Roland) steals for $ 300,000 in gold coins during a daring train robbery. But the member unworthy of trust, Bahunda (a fun ride from Jose Torres) goes away with the coins and hides them. Unfortunately, Bahunda is killed before he can tell Monetero where he has hidden the spoils. Monetero must join forces with the strange, enigmatic and enigmatic bounty hunters, The Stranger (played smoothly by the handsome George Hilton) and the corrupt and corrupt banker Clayton (a delightfully seductive 50-year-old portrait, Eddie "Kookie" Burns) to find the coins. . Cleverly directed by Enzo G. Castellari, with a clever, complex and complicated scenario of Castellari, Tito Carpi and Giovanni Simonelli, a playful, amoral and nihilistic tone (everyone meets and crosses with a joyfully greedy surrender), a score twangy, tasty and catchy by Alessandro Alessandroni and Francesco De Masi, lots of moving shots and violent fists, a sneaky sense of humor that makes fun of itself, a steady pace and a real surprise In closing, this dizzying and often hilarious feature is an inspired introduction to Sergio Leone's "The good, the bad and the ugly". The succulent Stefanie Careddu, Marisol de Monetero, Ivisol Staccioli, hard-headed captain of the army, and Gerard Herter, Lawrence Blackman, are very classy. A gambol immensely fun and enjoyable.
