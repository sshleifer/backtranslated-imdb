One of the best shows ever, and it only gets better with age. <br /> <br /> The adaptation in English by David Weir was one of the main reasons. <br /> <br /> One of my Japanese friends told me one day that the show in its original language was more whimsical and less flat than the version we all know. <br /> <br /> The fact that the show sounds so loud for I think his non-Japanese fans are largely thanks to Mr. Weir's inspired efforts and a winning voice-over work. <br /> <br /> Well done, sir!
