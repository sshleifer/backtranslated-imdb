They do not make movies like this anymore ?? although some may say that it is a good thing. Although it was one of Disney's first movies, it has more sensations than the G movies of their studio shot in the 70s (ie "Freaky Friday", "The Biggest Athlete of the world ") that PG's films came out in the early '80s (" Watcher in the Woods "," Tron "," Something Wicked This Way Comes "). Because of Disney's support, "Midnight Madness" obviously had a large budget. A huge distribution and a ton of different locations will show it. But madness, a senseless treasure hunt and a spectacular visual style were not enough to save the movie from a huge flop ... A box office failure, most of us were introduced to the movie on HBO at start ?? 80s, at the time when the same movies would be shown 29 times a week (Oh, wait, they're doing it again!). Essentially, HBO did for this film what CBS did for "The Wizard of Oz" ?? they created a huge cult audience for a sweet-and-sweet mega-flop .... <br /> <br /> The biggest problem that makes this movie a "bad" movie is that there are too many characters and that very few of them are concrete outside ?? The "group" of Eddie Deezen does not even have a name! The Blue Teams, although they are the bad guys, are the most endearing and have the most work to do in their characters (with the exception of the girl who can not play and does not have enough to do). Harold, perfectly played thoroughly by Stephen Furst, is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film. The other notable character is Melio, a blunderer, played with great charm by the current director, Andy Tennant. Although then-Dr. Pepper's spokesman David Naughton was supposed to be the star, his character is often odious, especially against his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. Although everyone has favorite characters, I do not think anyone who loves the movie can disagree that Furst and Fox are the only two characters you really learn about. <br /> <br /> Despite the many flaws and bad actors of the film. (most of them fell from the face of the earth after this movie), it still works because the actors seemed to have fun - and having fun on the board is like having fun on the screen. Come on, what a university jock does not dream of floating in a vat of beer and what zoftig girl does not dream of stealing the show at the local disco ... uh ... I guess it would be a rave nowadays. .. Campy, an impeccable pleasure for all those who were young in the 70s and 80s, so it is perfectly fitting that this has finally got the massive release of videos it deserves. But where the heck is the big-screen DVD version with the commentary, the trailer, and the full version of the song played in disco?
