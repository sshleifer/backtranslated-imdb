Why do people have to follow the opinion of herds of masses and critics? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by the great Sydney Pollack (who also plays a small part in the movie) is another Harrison Ford vehicle. As such, it is good enough and fun. Certainly, anyone who sees it has that in mind or reads the book that is not better. Even fans of Kristin Scott Thomas, including myself, knew it would be a variation of his role in the love of his older uncle. Even as such, the film is satisfying. Why is this film so much better in other Harrison Ford vehicles (rated better)? This film is not a masterpiece, but it is not as serious as the audience would like it to be.
