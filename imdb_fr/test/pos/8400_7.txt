This mini-series is a reasonable sequel to the original Gone With The Wind. If we consider this on our own merits (and not immediately after the original), it will come out very well. I'm sure most viewers will wonder about Scarlett and Rhett's performance, but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better. Many characters here are new to this plot, so comparison in these cases (Rhett's mother, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen) is not a problem. No one will be more than Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. <br /> <br /> The best part of the production is the beautiful spring landscapes of Charleston and Ireland. Watch him alone. Obviously, it was a high-budget mini-television series. He follows the book for a while, then has a totally new plot when Scarlett goes to Ireland. <br /> <br /> The acting is credible if nothing special. James Bond.
