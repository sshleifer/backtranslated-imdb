Many of us find art enjoyable only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep within us. That is to say that the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can relate to it personally. It was winter, here in Australia in 1992, when I saw Batman Returns at the movies and it blew me away. Both "me". I was supposed to belong to an ideal, to a standard, but at the same time I lived in another life. Tim Burton was the first filmmaker to say that it's okay for a comic film to be dark and confess that darkness can happen to us all. After Bat Burton's performances of Batman, many other comic and anti-hero heroes have invaded cinemas. For decades, the comics' folklore has been about friendly and likable heroes with a radiant smile and magical superpowers flying through the air, spinning powerful canvases from their wrists, red boots and locomotive force. But what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents coldly executed before your eyes? You crack. Somewhere in your psyche, your young psychological tenderness breaks down. The only way to handle such pain and injury is to create an alternative character. You make a promise. Your other person will be stronger and will mobilize all the anger and anger necessary to use all available means to avenge the innocence of your parents on this criminal, these criminals, all the criminals. It's life seen through Bruce Wayne's eyes. The two pairs. The world he sees is dark, dark and cold. Although he patrols the streets and people hear him go by, they do not rush to get his autograph. He is their savior, not the winner of a personality contest. Batman Returns is about the losers. Batman, for yet another Christmas, remains "the lone beast of the city". Bruce Wayne can never legally arrest the ugly Max Shreck. The Penguin never manages to free his parents from being rejected by the Gotham citizens, and Selina Kyle is forever lost because of her mental fragmentation and trauma. And the hero does not understand the girl or the cat.This film plunges into the desire in each of us to want so desperately to belong, to have a home, as expressed Bruce Wayne and Oswald Cobblepot.The film brings out a need in each of us to be heard, respected and not ignored as desired by Selina Kyle, Oswald and of course Bruce Wayne. But sometimes we are all removed in one way or another, we are told to be an ideal, to behave according to a certain standard. That's until we finally snap. At the end of the film, all that remains is hope as Catwoman gets up to the night sky. But what should we all wish for goodwill towards all men and women? As for me, I can not say that I will reach a point where I will believe that my problem of duality will be reconciled. But it is okay. We all have a dark side. Batman Returns is not only the best of Batman movies, it's truly an exceptional tale masterpiece.
