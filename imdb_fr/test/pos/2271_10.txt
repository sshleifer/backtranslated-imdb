If you have any doubts about Liev Schrieber's talent, take a look at her new film, "Everything is Illuminated", which clearly shows a man who is not only one of the best American actors, but also a new director whose first an inspiration and a foretaste of what will follow. Mr. Schreiber adapted Jonathan Safran Foer's novel to a film that will live forever thanks to the director's adaptation. The film clearly exceeded our expectations because we had no preconceived idea. <br /> <br /> For those who have not watched the movie, you may need to stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector. His love for his grandparents is unlimited. He sees his grandfather dying and his grandmother sitting on what appears to be his deathbed. At one point, this dying woman gives Jonathan an amber image and ornament for his collection. Looking at the picture taken a long time ago, a young couple is seen together. Looking at this, Jonathan thinks that shows the grandfather and his girlfriend, taken in happier moments. To look at the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go in search of the past of his ancestors in Ukraine. <br /> <br /> Jonathan made arrangements with his travel agency, Heritage Tours, Odessa. at Trochenbrod, the mythical place from which his grandfather was born. The agency is managed by an elderly man, who claims to be blind, and his grandson, Alex, a man who loves American pop culture that captivated his imagination, as well as his contemporaries of the country. Alex speaks a kind of English that no one speaks and his conversation and translation, because the benefits of Jonathan are hilarious in our ears for the use of English terms sometimes unheard of. The old man insists on taking his dog, Sammy Davis Jr., against the will of Jonathan, who does not want to sit next to the animal that barks and barks during the trip. <br /> <br /> At the moment of their embarkation In search of Trochenbrod, it is clear that his companions, especially the old man, do not know where he is going. At this point, the film becomes a road movie, as the three characters at the back of the country become more familiar. When the trio arrives at the sunflower field with the house at the end, this indicates that it is indeed in the right place. Some places clearly recall the conflicts of the past. <br /> <br /> The elderly woman, living in an isolated place, is the missing link in history. She is able to put things in the right perspective. But it is here that the story changes focus, from Jonathan, who has clearly come to the land of his ancestors, to the old man. We see this old man begin to remember himself. This, in turn, changes the dynamics of the film when we discover how much Jonathan and his guides have been connected. <br /> <br /> Some critics in these pages have expressed opinions on the accuracy of the story, which after all, is a work of fiction and freedoms were taken. It would have been impossible to make another film, including so many things in the book. The brilliant way in which the film is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what is going to be seen. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, a great movie actor, does a great job of minimizing Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in any movie with his portrayal of the main character. The happy cast of Eugene Hutz in the role of Alex, the tour assistant and Ukrainian translator, seems to be an idea made in paradise. Mr. Hutz is the best thing in the movie. Its arcane use of English gives the film a fun angle that delights the viewer. Boris Leskin, as Alex's grandfather and driver of the passenger car, makes a valuable contribution to the film, as well as Laryssa Lauret, seen in the last part of the film. <br /> Matthew Libatic's excellent cinematography brings the splendor of the Czech Republic's campaign in all its splendor. The musical score of Paul Cantelon is audible in the background, adorning the film so as to add a richness to the film. <br /> <br /> This is primarily a triumph for Liev Schreiber, the first director certainly goes far in everything he decides to do next.
