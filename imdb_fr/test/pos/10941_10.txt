The Twins Effect - Action / Chinese comedy - (Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung) <br /> <br /> This vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the fact that I was completely entertained throughout of the film. First, the characters are memorable and contribute to a myriad of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute, charismatic and humorous. This movie was my first exposure to them, and all I wanted to do was get through my TV screen and give them a REAL BIG HUG. The remaining actors played well in their side roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, "The Duke", Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong and the vampire villains (one of them seems strangely familiar to Will Ferrell). Even the horrible horrible Ekin Cheng was good in this one. Good characters are important, of course, because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences. <br /> <br /> And speaking of action, this film has a lot. More importantly, combat choreography emphasizes quality. An aspect that has helped in this regard is the flagship weapon of the protagonists? a sword with a retractable rope with a spear. This weapon, in itself, has paved the way for a variety of movements that otherwise would have been impossible. Josie Ho and Gillian Chung, in particular, perform perverse aerial maneuvers using these devices. <br /> <br /> In addition, the swordplay is superb, and is underlined by two great sword fights ?? one taking place during the opening sequence of the station and the other taking place in the end of the church. In fact, the blade maneuvers presented in this film have made some beloved fans ashamed, and I'm really sorry for those who would quote the horribly choreographed debris of Ashes of Time, Storm Riders or A Man Called. Heroes with well-planned and accurately executed sequences seen in The Twins effect. It's not even close. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why this film provokes so much criticism. I am sure that Hong Kong's Golden Age apologists will hate this because it does not correspond to their narrow view of what Hong Kong's action should be. We should learn from the fall of John Woo - a one-pound pony who never learned to reinvent himself. We do not need another clone. We need something different. The Twins effect is a good example. <br /> <br /> This film was so good that it really prepared me to be disappointed by other Chinese movies with the same actors and actresses. This is particularly true for Ekin Cheng, whose other films are almost always null? and yes, that includes the overrated and exploitive wuxia shit mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even the Twins never managed to match the value of this film when they were both lead actresses, although they managed to shoot good movies when either took the lead role (eg , Beyond Our Ken, Good House Bed Times, House of Fury) or when one or both play secondary roles (eg Color of Truth, New Police Story, One Look). The Twins Effect 2 should have been a direct sequel, instead of a family fantasy. I always want to see Charlene and Gillian team up in another movie, but the fact remains that The Twins Effect is hitting at full speed, optimizing its charisma while avoiding falling into trouble (as in Protégé of the Black Rose). <br /> <br /> In total, this film contains everything you need to be entertained. And may I remind the reader that this is exactly that ?? ENTERTAINMENT ?? who judge the grandeur of a film, more than artistic dramatic elements or meaningless rewards from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Twins effect is a CLASSIC not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 stars <br /> <br /> PS ?? Hollywood executives decided to slaughter the film when it was released in the United States by renaming it The Vampire Effect and cutting 20 minutes of footage including parts of the action scenes. However, the final fight of the American version has a better soundtrack than the original version. That's why I bought both versions, which allowed me to watch the original until about 1:20, then exchange the discs to watch the final fight on the US version.
