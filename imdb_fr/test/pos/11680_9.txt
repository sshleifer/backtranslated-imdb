Absolutely one of the 10 best music movies of all time! An absolutely essential educational experience for any fanatic of music - especially the young rock / punk fans of today ... to understand the beginnings of any particular "artistic" movement, it is essential to understand the roots of music, as well as the mood and the musical environment of the group. times .... not to mention the political and social factors involved at the time. And, in addition to all this, this documentary is a rock-n-roll flat F U N !! Do not miss it !!! That said, can anyone tell me when, if any, "the decline of Western civilization" ... the first part (and not the second part, the metal version) will be available again. .. fortunately on DVD?
