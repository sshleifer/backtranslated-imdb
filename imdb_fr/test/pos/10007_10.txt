This film is amazing because real people describe themselves, tell their real life experience and do such a good job, it's like they're reliving the past. Jia Hongsheng plays himself as an actor who abandons everything except music and drugs, battling depression and seeking the meaning of life while getting angry at everyone, especially the people who like the most. There are times in the movie that will make you want to cry because the family, especially the father, did such a good job. However, this film is not for everyone. Many people with depression will understand Hongsheng's problem and why they do what they do, such as staying in a dark room, walking around or cycling alone. Others might consider the film as boring because it's so real that it's almost like a documentary. Overall, this film is excellent and Hongsheng deserved an Oscar for this film, as did his father.
