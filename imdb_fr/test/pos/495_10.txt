Blade is probably one of the best action / vampire movies of all time. It has everything to please: action, horror, blood. This film is made for action fans. Either you like it a lot, or you hate it and you hate it. It means you do not like action or vampire movies. Wesley Snipes takes his role seriously and he is the ideal man for Blade.
