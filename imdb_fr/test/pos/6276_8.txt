The jazz singer is one of many films made in the late 1940s and 1950s on the Jewish experience in the United States. In addition to Crossfire (1947) and Gentleman's Agreement (1947), which deal with anti-Semitism, they generally have a background in musical theater. These films include The Jolson Story (1946), Jolson Sings Again (1949), The Eddy Duchin Story (1951), The Eddie Cantor Story (1953), The Benny Goodman Story (1956) and Margorie Morningstar (1958). The main actors in these "Jewish" films have always been played by non-Jews. For example, Larry Parks, a non-Jew, played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly, Noel Airman, in Marjorie Morningstar. This cast was probably made to make the Jewish theme palpable to a mainly non-Jewish audience. The jazz singer (1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish although she plays the role of a non-practicing Jew in the film. The key to her journey is when she attends the Golding family meal before entering. She says, "I did not attend an event of sadness (Passover service) since I left home." <br /> <br /> The film speaks of a cantor son who has just left the service after seeing the action in Korea. His dilemma is to become a cantor, family tradition or singer of musical theater. His choice of theater leads to an inevitable conflict with his father. <br /> <br /> However, this film has much more to offer than that. This film was made after Rosenberg's trial of McCarthy's whitchhunts and the Hollywood blacklist. Therefore, in this film, Jews are portrayed as loyal and typically American citizens. The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. The singing friends also speak of baseball, one of them being a Major League referee. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and was visited by George Washington. As a result, Jews are portrayed as part of American society. No one in this film has an Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee has appeared in very few feature films. In this film, you will see her singing wonderfully "Lover" and "Just one of those things". Danny Thomas is quite credible and he plays and interprets the role very well. The comic routines could have been left out. Yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it's worth seeing. I enjoyed it very much.
