Excellent casting, history, performances. Totally credible. I realize the very united group that illustrates the Marine Corps. But this film scared me. The marines let the principles be damned. It seems that this film was based on real incidents. This shows how difficult it is to oppose settlement. Anne Heche was quite convincing. Sam Shepard was describing a gung-ho, Marine was disgusted. And Eric Stoltz as a lawyer was so adept in balancing his loyalty to the Corp. but also his loyalty to his client, at the top of his tightrope. He knew what his real plan of action was. But he was separated by his immersion in the marine tradition, his loyalty to the Body first and foremost. I sat riveted to the television screen. All in all, I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.
