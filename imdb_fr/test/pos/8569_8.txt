H.O.T.S. is a fun movie for a trip in which skin movies had a more positive and fun agenda. They were simply made to tickle and have some laughter. Everything seems less cynical and jaded. The girls all have natural figures and some are playboy playmates. The simple plot is about a group of young women who open an unsanctioned sisterhood to turn against the well-off girls who have despised and insulted them. Instead of the pitfalls of today's wickedness, most hijinks are simply fun and innocent. Women are decent actresses for this genre and are for the most part very attractive. To keep our attention between topless scenes, we have mafia henchmen, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a great housewife and the cheapest robot ever seen. There is even Danny Bonnaducci of the Partridge family. If you have a sense of humor, let yourself go and enjoy light entertainment.
