If you have not seen this movie from the late 80s on the Washington office of a news channel of the network, I highly recommend it. It is a sad commentary on the direction taken by the reports in this country, but tells the story with intelligence. The characters are well developed and the performance of Albert Brooks is fabulous. He delivers all his lines with a discreet and entertaining comedy. I'm not a fan of Albert Brooks at all, so it was a nice surprise. I have a friend who works as a producer for a local news channel and he said it was close to reality so congratulations to the author of the film and the director for conducting their research. overview of the Network News world. It is not nearly as dark as another film I also recommend in the same genre 'Network'.
