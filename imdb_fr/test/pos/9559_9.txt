In a previous comment, I mentioned how much I enjoyed this movie - better second time. I do not cancel this opinion. Strangely, I can not find anyone else who liked it. <br /> <br /> My mother was going to see him but several friends told him "Not at all". My sister and her family saw him and half of the theater went half way. <br /> <br /> My wife's suggestion is that Australians view the characters as ordinary, normal Americans and therefore, it's not funny. But, hey, most Americans think that all Australians are like the Dundee Crocodile. So it's nice to have the shoe on the other foot to change things.
