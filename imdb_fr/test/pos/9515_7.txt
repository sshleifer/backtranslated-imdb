Another "end of the world" film that calls for comparison with the abominable "Day After Tomorrow". Follow the same type of structure as DAT but with a distinctly Japanese style. How's it going? It depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the little human touches what makes this film captivating for more than 2 hours. Also frequent title cards explaining some of the science. The effects are probably the best I've seen in a Japanese movie and they compare very well to everything in Hollywood. Many disaster scenes are really horrible even though the human carnage is usually off screen. And that's one of the disadvantages. While the terror of thousands of deaths on the screen, as in the recent "War of the Worlds," may be too overwhelming, we do not really understand the chaos of an entire nation collapsing in the ocean. scenes take place behind the scenes chaos but most of the time, this part of the story is barely touched in anyway, this film works on many levels and is much more realistic than DAT, it's until the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the story is centered on a device of clich√© plot and another plot element that would be comfortable in the film "Gorath" of the Earth After the science is good enough and most of the time realistic in the face of the disaster, it leaves a little disappointment.The sudden stop of the film for a pop love song does not help either (unless that you do not like the song.) That's what made "exciting" the end of a bit difficult for me. i. <br /> <br /> The overall direction is good and the artistic design is excellent. Playing is just as good. Recommended.
