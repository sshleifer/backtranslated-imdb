A truly scary ghost story, full of thrills and sensuality, this film just misses what it promises. It is apparently based on an old ghost story, and may be a bit too simple. For most of the journey, his imagination and authenticity are striking, but in the end, it's almost as if Oshima had just lost interest in it and brought it to a swift end. her youngest lover kills her husband so they can be together. But their nerve failure and their ghost back condemn them to madness. It is beautifully manipulated, with imaginative scenes and the passion of lovers is portrayed beautifully. But all too often, the film does not keep its promises, almost as if Oshima was losing its cool in the same way as lovers. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie to watch just to see how Oshima combines his filmmaking talent with some exploitive movie stuff to train the audience, but this is unfortunately not a real classic in the mold of films like Onibaba or Woman of the Dunes.
