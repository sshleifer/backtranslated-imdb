Crackerjack is a fun movie, everyone at bowlo saw it and said the same thing. The cheese wheel was a big part of the movie, as well as the speaker "Dear Sir and you left the right indicator". Or when Jack comes home and lies down on the couch and splits a beer, "bowls are hard work" made me crack. And when his roommate shows interest in joining the club and calling the bingo number. Jack buys all the raffle tickets to win the meat platter. Damn good movie if you like lawn bowls as you can understand, if you are not a lawn bowler to forget, I think. The Evans Head Bowlo would be considered the best Aus club, friendly people, excellent company. Hi to Evans Head Bowlo Steve
