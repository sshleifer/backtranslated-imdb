I turned to this film in the middle of the night and almost passed it. It was only because there was nothing else that I decided to watch it. In the end, I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> An interesting plot, good characters, a clever scenario and a brilliant staging make this film an excellent film. It was actually the first time I heard about this movie, but I would have been happy to have paid that money to the movies. <br /> <br /> Rating from my IMDB bank: 8 out of 10 br /> <br />
