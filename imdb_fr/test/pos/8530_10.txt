Well, first of all, I'm a big fan of horror movies, but I'm pretty sick of all those American horror movies. They all talk about the same thing: blood and violence. It's not even scary. Well, it's not wrong with blood and all that - it does not even bother me - but that's not what makes a movie terrifying! That's why I find this film entertaining - it's fun to see a satire mocking the concept of "the main horror". Splatter / American movies gore, they are not supposed to be scary, only funny. Its good. But when they are supposed to be "scary", it becomes pathetic. However, there are some great American horror movies (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end it's the same thing. That's why this movie was a relief. Evil Ed is not just a cult movie, it's a classic! I can not wait until the principal, Anders Jacobsson, makes another movie to fuck! Until I have to watch Evil Ed again and again and again! But I do not care - it's such an amazing movie!
