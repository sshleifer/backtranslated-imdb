I read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration for The Consequences of Love came from simply observing a businessman alone in a Brazilian hotel and speculating on what he might be. The film reveals us in the same way. We see the existence of Titta who lives alone in a hotel in Switzerland for 8 years. He is secretive and avoids friendship. His life is dominated by order and regularly. Little by little, the truth about his existence is revealed to us until, finally, his world begins to collapse. <br /> <br /> The mystery of Titta is at the center of the consequences of love and works thanks in large part to the superb performance of Toni Servillo. His character intrigues us all the more as small details are revealed: he injects heroin once a week, he has no imagination. While some here blame the dialogue for not being naturalistic, it does not matter to me - it's not that kind of movie and I think the script is awesome. The work of the camera is also excellent. <br /> <br /> If you have to criticize, the film loses its way in later scenes as the mystery of Titta's existence is revealed to us and his world begins to fall. a part. However, the tragic final scenes are just as good as the previous one.
