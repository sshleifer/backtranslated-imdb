The Simpsons of course started with the Christmas special "Simpson's roasting" which featured basic drawings and did not joke, but this episode probably has the first joke that burst with laughter. better. This episode focuses on Bart who, in this episode, exchanges on a test of Martin and enters a school for the most talented, which leads Bart to restore his friendship with his father and to lose all his friends. The episode is very humorous and shows what would become the biggest show to be released. Overall, fans of the show will love this episode because it portrays the character exactly as it became 20 years later. So watch this episode in a season 1 pack and enjoy Simpson's debut doing what he was supposed to do, make people laugh. I note this episode 73%.
