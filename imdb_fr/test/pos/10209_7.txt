Hard to believe that this was done by Fritz Lang since he directed mainly crime dramas and mysteries. This film has a cast that includes Robert Young, Scott Randolph, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays the role of an outlaw trying to get straight to the point, leaving his old gang and saving Jagger's life. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to have telegraphs in the West. Jagger engages many men to make sure, as they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is responsible for the men and Young is a telegraph expert who can not shoot with a gun but can ride. Scott finds his old gang that wants to stop them but Scott can not tell anyone. It's a very good western and Lang should lead some more westerns.
