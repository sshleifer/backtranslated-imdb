Anyone who has seen the trailer of this movie would be forgiven for thinking that this movie is an exciting comedy. In fact, it's a light, but not too funny, conversation about a gangster gangster couple. <br /> <br /> The film contains many flaws. The plot and plot are weak and the love aspect of the story is strangely dull. Still, it's still nice, thanks in large part to the two leaders Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller. These two remarkable actors, especially Carlyle, are always interesting to watch. Here, there is good chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Director Jake Scott is the next generation of the family whose brothers, Ridley and Tony, have given us movies such as Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and more recently, GI Jane and enemy of the state. Its beginnings are directed with energy and enthusiasm, which keeps the film in suspense, although, without its solid casting, the results are not so convincing. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for an easy movie easy solution to spend an hour and a half then you could do a lot worse than Plunkett and Macleane. If, on the other hand, you want something subtle, historically accurate and provocative, go for something else. 7/10.
