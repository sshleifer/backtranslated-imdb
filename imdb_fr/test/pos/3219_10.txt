I love this show! it's amazing ... I can never miss an episode even though I've seen it before. the actors are perfect for roles ...... I love Gilmore girls! I had all my friends to watch it. even their parents are watching him now. I watch it every day and usually watch it more than once a day. I wish my mother was like Lorelei. my friends say that I speak and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it's a great teen show, because they kind of learn to watch it. my vocabulary widened after watching Gilmore Girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled are perfect for Lorelei and Rory. I think Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris left Lorelei and Rory too often. and broke Lorelei's heart too often.
