A girl becomes the correspondent of a navy and, when he goes to the end of the war, awaits a man a little more available, complications comic ensue. Everything goes well in the end, of course, but not before everyone involved chewed the landscape. Errol Flynn has a flawless impression of Humphrey Bogart from "Casablanca", as well as several shipments of his own braggart image (the "jump" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot). It's Tucker, however, who "puts" the film under his arm, lowers his head and shoots over the goal line. He demonstrates the comedic flair more fully developed twenty years later in "F-Troop" and gives a liveliness and energy that Flynn plays repeatedly to improve his own performances. Eleanor Parker is doing a great job as a prosecuted woman and little Patti Brady has become the friend of Tucker's correspondent. A beautiful and light comedy "coming home" in a refined setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.
