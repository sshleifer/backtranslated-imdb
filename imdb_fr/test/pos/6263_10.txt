A nice little film about the introduction of movies in China. Capture the astonishment of the movie's earliest viewers, as it is described as having been global, and use the actual Lumiere movies for most news. I do not agree with the others about acting badly on the part of the Brit - I thought he was fine, but the Chinese leader really stole the show. In any case, I found myself smiling for most of the movie. People who fear subtitles may notice that most of the film is in English (for some reason, the subtitles are given as well as the Chinese on the DVD).
