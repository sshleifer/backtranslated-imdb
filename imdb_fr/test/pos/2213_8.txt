I really enjoyed this movie and I think most of Lauren Ambrose's fans will like it too. His character is much softer than his role in Six Feet Under and all the performances are strong. I particularly appreciated the way Emily, a scholar with a developmental disability, was treated. Despite some criticism from misinformed users, the role was played accurately and uncluttered by the actress, Taylor Roberts. Fran Kranz has also distinguished himself, his natural ease has well accompanied the more experienced players of the season. Although the management encountered a problem here and there, it seemed that the only problem was an underdeveloped script. What may have worked well as a play did not hold as well on the screen. However, the beautiful cinematography of Paul Ryan perfectly compensates for this, as well as the rhythm of the film, which is surprisingly not slow. I recommend this film to fans six feet underground and also to lovers of good acting and cinematography.
