It's one of Peter Sellers' best movies. Why is he never shown on television or in the cinema? Will it ever be released as a movie at home? Is it too pejorative for the medical field? I would like to see this movie again. I would like my son, who is a doctor, to see him. Laughter is the best medicine and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for that.
