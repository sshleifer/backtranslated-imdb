It's an excellent movie. No, it's not Mel Gibson in "Braveheart", but then, it's not trying. In fact, "The Emperor and the Killer" probably (thankfully) have more in common with a Shakespearean production than a Hollywood blockbuster. <br /> <br /> In the third century BC, the king of Qin tries to "conquer" the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the kingdom of Han. He now needs an excuse to invade Yan's kingdom. <br /> <br /> This is where Lady Zhao enters the scene. She and the king are friends since their childhood. They are obviously very in love, but can not get married for political reasons. Together, they conceive a plot. She will pretend to have fallen into the disfavor of the king and will flee to Yan. Once there, she will convince the Prince of Yan to send an assassin to kill the king. When the assassination fails, the king will have his excuse to invade Yan. <br /> <br /> Once in Yan, however, Lady Zhao begins to reconsider her decision. Listening and seeing more and more examples of the cruelty of her old childhood friend, she begins to wonder if it is perhaps necessary to murder the king for real. <br /> <br /> A sure sign that you are not watching a Hollywood production is the final encounter between the king and the killer. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and the villain are clearly defined and where the final result is predefined, it is really a fight that could well be a two-way street. <br /> <br /> It's a well-crafted and well-played story of a tumultuous time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. The most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as Lady Zhao. I become more and more convinced every time I see her that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. <br /> <br /> I must say, however, that she has an unintentionally amusing line in this movie. Gong Li asked one of his servants early: "Do I have a beautiful face?" <br /> <br /> Duh !!!
