I could not believe it at all. Be a fan of movies made by the geniuses of music video. I am happy to announce that the photography in this film is a splendor to behold. There are so many rich and complete images that are presented to me that every time I see this film, I find something new that I have never seen before. As in previous films I've seen, like Blade and Mystery Men, also former directors of video clips, the use of color to capture attention is extremely well used. Although the characters could have been better developed, the action and the costume were well worth the price of entry. I recommend buying this one for your DVD collection. Even if you have not seen it on the big screen, you will not be disappointed. I know I was not.
