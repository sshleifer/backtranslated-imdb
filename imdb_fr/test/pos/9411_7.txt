Yes, it's a bit cheesy. But it's suspensive and entertaining, and one of my favorites; There are excellent actors in the film and they do a commendable job given the limits of the plot and the characters. It's interesting to see David Soul in a role of "bad guy"; I thought he was quite credible - and rather scary - as an increasingly paranoid commander. Robert Conrad is a longtime favorite - I think he wears his character very well; and Sam Waterston was a star in everything I watched - movies or television. <br /> <br /> I watch this film from time to time but our tape (a copy of VHS TV that I got) is of such poor quality that it is difficult to take full advantage of it. It's a movie that I think they should put on DVD; Maybe it would not be universally wanted, but I'm sure there are many people like me who like this kind of movie, so there would be a market for a DVD version. I will continue to hope!
