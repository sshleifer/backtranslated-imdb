I like to see a female protagonist, her name was Rose in this movie. Rose has raised many interesting questions in her journey of achievement. Is it possible to achieve peace and inner realization by external means? Does our society teach this? Can we be a victim of memory that can lead to victimization of others? Are we responsible for being a product of our environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a "typical" man similar to or different from Rose? Finally, would the outcome or the story change if they came from another country like France or Italy? I loved that this film provokes all these questions in me, while he entertained, stimulated and let me guess until the end! Every time I watched it, I learned more about the film and about myself.
