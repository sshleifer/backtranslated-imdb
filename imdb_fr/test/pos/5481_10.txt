I really like action and adventure movies and it's one of the best. Of course we like stars like Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and so on, but that's the story that really matters. The best are a little feasible but we can tolerate those who are a bit "exaggerated" as in the cartoon action style. The more twists, the more the heroes are confronted with dramatic situations and more shocking moments in the film; the more we appreciate the action / adventure fans. "In the Line of Fire" contains ALL the elements necessary for a thrilling action thriller. He has Clint Eastwood as an almost secret service agent whose only bad failure haunts him. He is one of John Malkovich's most perverse, most despicable evil villains, of the kind in which you can not wait to see him, "take his due." Ren√© Russo is his "love interest". It has twists, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. He is extremely well paced by the director Wolfgang Petersen and even has the score of the great Ennio Morricone. This one is a real roller coaster ride! Do not miss it!
