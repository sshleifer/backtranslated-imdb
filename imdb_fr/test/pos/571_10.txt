I do not need to say much about the quality of this documentary - it's really an incredible story narrative. The story is pretty simple: an elderly white tourist is murdered by a young black man in Florida, and the arrested boy is ill-treated and tried, with the public defender and his family at his side. It's very captivating, and the public defender is a joy to observe in all his human ways - you can not help but win the triumph of justice, and the end is more effective than one would expect from 'a true story. <BR /> <br /> Too bad more people have not seen this documentary, but hope you find a way to watch it. For those interested in racial relations in the United States, the actual operation of law enforcement and the judicial process, you will really need your time and effort to find this documentary. I give him a 10.
