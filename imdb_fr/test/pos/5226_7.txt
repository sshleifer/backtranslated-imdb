Raoul Walsh's mega-epic film, filmed at first by a big screen by the great Arthur Edeson, can be slow and static like a conversation starter, but this classic wagon journey across America to the northwest is throbbing like pure physical production on the big screen. On television channels, the lack of close-ups and distant sound restitutions can be daunting. The young John Wayne easily scores in his first role with a natural performance that the rest of the cast can not control. Surprisingly, the movie collapsed and Wayne spent most of the next decade in the western B-food supply.
