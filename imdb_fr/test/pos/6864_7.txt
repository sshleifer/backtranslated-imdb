Anatomy (Anatomy) is an entertaining and engaging film that does not produce the discomfort that should be associated with the subject of the film. The idea of ​​ethical ignorance in the world of medical science pushes the viewer towards discomfort, and the realism of institutions ('Heidelberg') and its special effects make it a film not quite easy to look at. <br /> <However, the characters, the script and the brilliance of the film all seem all too familiar with the Scream movies that have repopularized this kind of genre. Unfortunately, while the subject is a matter of concern, the viewer is presented with another film full of student characters that we do not have a chance to worry about, unresolved secondary intrigues and on-stage massacres that reinvent themselves since the memorable opening scene of Drew Barrymore in Scream many years ago. <br /> <br /> Steven Ruzowillzky makes a fair effort on the screenplay and the direction, but pushes no limits other than the general theme. While we are presented with an entertaining film with some reasonable performances, we have unfortunately remained with the old feeling: nothing is wrong with this movie, but nothing is extraordinary either. <br /> <br /> An entertaining film, and interesting chance to see how foreign filmmakers were influenced by the post-scream "horror" culture. 6 out of 10
