This almost documentary look at an enterprising boy living in the bodyshop outside New York is real. True lighting. His real. Less editing in the entire movie than in 1 minute of most movies. And if there is very little scenario, there is a story. Shot in primary colors, almost all in red, white, blue and yellow, we give an idea of ​​the life of a boy who makes something out of nothing. He has a place where he lives, he does his, has a good job and tries to get his sister into his little universe. People from the cutting-shop sector also give us a glimpse of this culture that I did not know. They seem for the most part decent and pay to Ale what seems to be everyday, seeming really concerned about his well-being. The actor (I think) playing Ale says more with a facial expression than one can imagine. It reminded me of what a real little movie can do. This shows what children are capable of, even without much support and love. Really recommend.
