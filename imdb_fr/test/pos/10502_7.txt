The offspring speaks of a husband and a wife who are wasting time while having sex. Completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means, they try to continue their lives. The husband begins to question this bizarre event and is helped by a very annoying psychiatrist. He comes to believe that the extraterrestrials are responsible for this time and that the unborn baby he once believed to belong to him and his wife actually belongs to the extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, c / history horror. Taking a very questionable real life scenario involving an alien kidnapping and a hybrid breeding is a bravo of this type. I love all things extraterrestrial and this story has certainly given good ideas. So, if you also share an interest in extraterrestrial activities, you should be quite happy with Progeny. At least at the level of the story anyway. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is mostly average. With average acting by all actors. Yes, even by Mr Dourif, always brilliant, who always offers the best performance. Although the black chief doctor, delivers his lines very well. There are some points in the film where part of the performance is creaked or worth laughing, which is good in my book. I like them cheesy and there was a little stinky cheese, and I say it well. <br /> <br /> In any case, with a less than stellar scenario, you can not really blame all the actors. . I did not particularly care about the mother hysteria targeted by the film. She was so craving for a baby that she had neglected and rejected everything her husband had told her (who is a doctor !!). He's almost reached the point where you make fun of what happened to him. <br /> <br /> The Progeny is another film by Brian Yuzna from the thorny movie Society. Again, it produces gooey effects, and once again, it tells a rather unique horror story. If you are a sci-fi / horror fan or if you are a fan of Dourif and / or Yuzna movies, there is no reason not to watch this movie if you have the opportunity. A generous 7 out of 10.
