John Leguizamo's one man show is both funnier and more engaging than most of the movies you'll see. A number of devices, such as slide projectors, are used to enhance the story, but it is essentially an old-fashioned performance art. Discover in particular his hilarious interpretation of "I Will Survive". * Highly recommended.
