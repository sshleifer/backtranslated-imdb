In one sentence, moral ambiguity. In the Soderbergh remake, there are good guys and bad guys. The character of Benicio del Toro is clearly the good guy, morally pure and irreproachable. His counterpart in the BBC's original, Fazal, the farmer turned reseller, is imperfectly realistic and conflicting over his fate. The two relentless cops are similarly different. In America, they win our hearts. In the original of the BBC, they are too zealous, almost obsessive. <br /> <br /> The best time for me at Soderbergh was when the student rhetorically asked the drug tsar Black and rich whites came to your neighborhood looking for drugs? "This point was insinuated throughout the BBC broadcast and crystallized in Jack Lithgow's last speech, both are excellent, but the BBC dominates the remake." My conclusion after seeing both shows is that the dealers are innocent pawns that only satisfy a demand, and it is the demand that causes so much suffering.
