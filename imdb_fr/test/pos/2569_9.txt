This film is complex and interesting in many ways. It is a non-stop plethora of emotions and taboo topics. Sex and Love Emotional Violence Against Women by Women, Physical Violence Against Women by Men, Sexual Violence Against Children, New Approach to Religion in Real Life, All Linked to Blues Music, Very Raw and Powerful . <br /> <br /> I promise you that if during the first 20 minutes you will find that all the characters are linked and improved. And the end will be nicer than what you can expect. The music is exceptional, the writing is powerful and the acting has been brilliant. <br /> <br /> And the DVD has some cool features, including Samuel Jackson's background in guitar and blues learning. <br /> <br /> This film is not for children and I even warn parents of teenagers.
