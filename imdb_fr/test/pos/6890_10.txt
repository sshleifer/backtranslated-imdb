All I can say is that I really miss this show !! My wife and I just got married at the beginning of the show! Why did CBS remove it from the air ??? I think it was the best show for the whole family! That made me laugh!! It also made me cry. But when CBS stopped broadcasting, my wife and I thought CBS had made a big mistake. You know what would be so great ?? Have a meeting show !! It would be really good !!!! Anyone know if it is already on DVD ?? During the last season of Promised Land, did CBS broadcast the entire past season ?? I think CBS removed it from mid-season. My wife and I will never forget it. The opening with this song was fantastic !!! This show only comes once in a lifetime! May we never forget Promised Land !!
