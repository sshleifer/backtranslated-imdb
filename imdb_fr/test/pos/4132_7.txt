Considering it's a low-budget cast, this film is surprisingly good about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey plays Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for almost all of his music. Supported by her Crickets, Holly was very successful and became a star before her death in a plane crash with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to fame, his marriage to his love and his eventual death. I like this movie and I think you will like it too. Charles Martin Smith is also doing a great job in this movie.
