This is a slightly uneven entry, with an exceptional sequence featuring a street gang that recalls in dinner that it was once - thirty years ago - their hiding place; a duologue between two aging rock musics; a black kidnapping turned on his head and an opening sequence (plus an epilogue) involving singer artist Edward Baer and the current "hot" property Anna Magloulis that has its highlights. No film in which appears Jean Rochefort can not be dismissed lightly. Here he shines like one of the open quintets. Indeed, the film is worth seeing for Rochefort alone, but each of the sequences has something to offer and is really worth a look.
