Let me start by saying that Tourist Trap is a better movie than 99.9% of horror movies recently released in Hollywood. If you do not believe me, see Darkness Falls or They. And it's certainly better than any of those shitty movies like Stab, Bleed, The Pool, etc. One of the big problems with the movie Tourist Trap is that there is never really an audience. When the film was opened in 1979, it was rated PG by the MPAA. Anyone who knows horror movies knows that a horror movie is a death kiss for the movie. (The director David Schmoeller talks about this problem in the commentary track of the DVD.) There are exceptions though as Poltergeist, who also had received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between Tourist Trap and Poltergeist. Tourist Trap was not a big-budget Hollywood movie like Poltergeist, nor produced by Steven Spielberg. That alone was enough to guarantee the success of Poltergeist. (Still for those of you who have seen Tourist Trap, you'll even understand why the MPAA has rated this film in the PG category.) The broken heart scene should be enough to give it a slap and a R note. you have a pipe in the back with the blood flowing out) I have to admit that when I was young, I watched a copy of Poltergeist on the shelf of the video store, I took it, I as a PG and put it on the shelf for a R-rated film. Years later, I finally saw Poltergeist and realized how much it was a big film I missed because that I had not rented a horror movie for PG. From then on, I would never judge a movie based on its rating. This is most likely what happened to Tourist Trap. People, like me with Poltergeist, will probably forget him in favor of the R-rated film. Most likely, he would also be a teenager, to whom most of these types of films are intended. Friday the 13th was not a masterpiece either, but performed very well at the box office because it was rated R and was heavily advertised by Paramount at the time. He found his audience and earned enough money to generate several suites. When we look at it, Tourist Trap is as good as Friday the 13th. The same thing could have happened to Tourist Trap. We could have seen Tourist Trap 2, 3, 4, etc. As for the film, Tourist Trap is an entertaining horror film made with a very small budget, but it is well played, well directed and well shot on many levels. Chuck Connors is a riot like Mr. Slausen and gives the best performance of the film. Particular credit must be given to the composer Pino Donaggio, whose score for this film is really what sets him apart from others and gives him goose bumps. The music in the scenes involving the dummies is particularly scary. Donaggio worked on the horror film Carrie and many other film scores from Tourist Trap. He has done an outstanding job in film and continues to score films to date. The weakness of Tourist Trap is that there is really no explanation of Davey's credentials. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be. He just has them, and we should accept it for the movie to work. We accept it to a certain extent, but the scenario includes incidents such as how Davey rings the phone in the store while he is in the basement of the house. In this case, is Davey limited in the use of his powers? Can he ring a phone in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is its range? These are things that people who do not care about this movie would be more likely to report as flaws. Others would accept it as a mistake. I accept it. There are not enough questions of this type generated by this film to make me hate. It's a horror movie. We should not be forced to read too much. Many people have called this the movie 'killer dummy'. I assure you that no model kills anyone in this film. The models are controlled by the power of Davey who uses them as a weapon. This is a common misconception about this movie. Some people have a problem with the dummies and others have even said that they are downright stupid. I think they add to the goose bumps of the movie. All in all, Tourist Trap is a very fun rental. *** (out of 5)
