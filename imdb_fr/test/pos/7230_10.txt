TROMEO & JULIET - 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION <br /> <br /> William Shakespeare's play, Romeo & Juliet, has been performed hundreds of times on stage and in movies. Sometimes, they literally follow the original text (which is sometimes vague in stage directions), sometimes in new interpretations where the directors have chosen to show their own point of view on the piece. Some are good, many are mediocre. Lloyd Kaufman's film is certainly one of the most original and modern versions of the bard's creation. It can be placed in a decomposing New York and full of anti-social behavior, body piercing, dismemberment and perverts. sex (of which Shakespeare, himself a reader, is not intimidated), but at the same time, he remains incredibly close to the general sensation and the object of the piece, which represents a considerable effort. Kaufman wrote the screenplay with his co-director on the movie James Gunn, who is now famous for writing two blockbuster movies from Scooby Doo, achieving the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect movie with his screenplay. Dawn of the Dead and making one of the best horror movies of the year: Slither. Lloyd Kaufmans 'innovative visionary vision, coupled with James Gunns' original and unrestricted writing, gives an interpretation of Shakespeare's play that may not be "understood" immediately, but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique view and extremely important of a classic piece. With a scenario entirely written in iambic meter, the appearances of Lemmy of Motorhead and a scandalous and catchy soundtrack that looks Tromeo & Juliet are unforgettable. In addition to its historical significance, Tromeo & Juliet is a treasure for moviegoers of all kinds.
