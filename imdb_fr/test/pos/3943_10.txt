It's true, maybe it's wine that speaks but it's maybe the best movie I've seen in a long time. While I spent a good part of the first half-hour wondering what was happening, but once I accepted the fact that I would never understand all the subtitles, I could appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> Can you really hate a movie where a staff turns into a flock of birds defecating on the enemy? How important is character development to a lesbian extraterrestrial princess whose people have built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear diamond earrings? Does all this matter to the sumptuousness of the visuals and the sly humor of the characters? Any battle for my heart was won once I saw the main protagonist dressed as a spider-man - awesome! Many people will complain about a lack of cohesion in the story, but for a fun movie, you can not do better, especially if you make an alcoholic photo every time someone says "I'll love you" 10,000 years ".
