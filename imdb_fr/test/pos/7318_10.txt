This is one of the best Stooges shorts. It was the only one of their shorts to be nominated for an Oscar. In this short film, the Stooges play with doctors, who cause problems as usual. This short film contains gags, puns and jokes. The party at the end, where the Stooges are breaking the machine. It's really a classic. I highly recommend this short film Three Stooges.
