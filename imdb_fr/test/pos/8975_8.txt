Aaron Sorking raises the same questions as Shakespeare. How could they know as much about the inner workings of the palace life? Here as in the west wing, Sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly shocking but seem to confirm our worst fears. Everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for the lives of so many people. An inflated Tom Hanks tells us in one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi-pure intentions, but without weighing the consequences, and Julia Roberts, wearing a blonde hairstyle from the south, reminds us hidden powers. The subject is serious but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as an invisible middleman, steals every scene in which he finds himself, as did Charles Laughton in every film. The dialogue is fast but not fast enough so that we can not catch up and discover ordinary comedy. The seemingly casual, witty and provocative pace confers another badge of honor on Mike Nichol's collection.
