When it was released in the early eighties, Pixote brings to Brazilian society the problems of young offenders and their impact on Brazilian society. I can not watch the movie at that time because I was too young, but now I had a chance to watch it a few days ago. It's a very brutal film, but everything is absolutely true and sad. Pixote is the name of a 12-year-old boy who lives on the street and survives with minor offenses; he remains in a prison for some time and when he leaves, he continues to plan flights with other rolls and a prostitute, played by Marilia Pera. the boy is still addicted to marijuana and feels the glue with another teenager, to forget his sad reality. the quality of the images is not the best, but the film is totally realistic about the problems of Brazil and must be seen and admired.
