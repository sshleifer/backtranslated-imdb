Four holy young men from the Mormon country travel to Latin America to preach the gospel to the Gentiles of the cities. But one of the young Mormons is a repressed homosexual who "happens to" meet with a very "partisan" boy. (What would be the film scenarios without coincidences?). These two very different young men become friends and, in doing so, mutually affect each other's point of view, creating an inevitable conflict between gay and Mormon cultures. <br /> <br /> This is the premise of "Latter Days", a 2003 film, written and directed by C.Jay Cox, himself a former Mormon missionary. The story of the film is, of course, very relevant, especially in contemporary America. The variations of this story must be told, and told again and again, hopefully, in future films ... because the underlying theme highlights the incredibly superior attitude that Christian fundamentalists too often display at the time. homosexuals. By its nature, "Latter Days" is provocative and I doubt that the film was well received in Provo or Pocatello, even if the scenario is intelligent, sensitive and insightful.
