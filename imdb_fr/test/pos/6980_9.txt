I saw the Director's Cut version and can only be content. Excellent actor (especially Cole Hauser, I'm sad not to have enough room for Claudia Black), subtle visual effects and photography in a credible plot (considering the genre) without too many logical holes, character twists. These are the greatest assets of the film. Combined with style - some may view this film as a category B effort but I do not agree with that. Everything is very original and elegant. <br /> <br /> And even though I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, Riddick's hard-working role suited him well. I can not wait for Chronicles of Riddick, it's really cool this movie will have a sequel ... <br /> <br /> 9/10 if you ask me
