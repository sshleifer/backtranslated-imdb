Here is another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on cassette or on DVD. I saw it a few months ago when it aired for the first time (even in the metropolitan capital of cinema, LA!) For a few weeks, then disappeared (the public art houses seems to have opted for their own special territory, where favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities). <br /> <br /> At first, I was disappointed, I found the rhythm unbearably boring and the fact that the man had lost a chance (Anton√≥ni had had trouble finding it for years). funding) at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his cannon; but knowing Antonioni for what he was and how I had reacted at the beginning to Blow-Up and the Passenger, I refused to pass judgment as long as I reviewed the film. I went back the next day and I should not have been surprised that the film carries me constantly, making me aware of things I had thought about and lost sight of throughout my life , returning home, in a contemporary setting, For the first time, forty years ago, in "L'Aventurra", I formed an environment of subtle moods so characteristic and fascinating tone (and quite comic in fact) that I could not get enough. The scene with Malkovich sitting on the beautiful, colorful swings of the wind-swept beach, with its beautiful silver weather, and the Eno / U2 track in the background crossing at his own pace, had been my favorite; it always was, but now the whole movie was just as great! What a strange phenomenon, the complex simplicity or the invisible complex that only Antonioni's eye seems to be able to capture and communicate. What is strange is that it looks at first sight to some softcore porn and that it has a lot of sex and the beautiful Sophie Marceau and many other international stars to distract you, this film is undeniably the one of Antonioni. but you will not feel how much, until you've seen it many times and get used to it. For example, it's a pretty funny movie with a deep sense of humor, which I did not notice at first, but caught the attention of another reviewer and was delighted at the next viewing (4 before going out and doing it I went back for more). If this film had been promoted properly and if people had been a little guided in the way of approaching it, I am convinced that it would have succeeded on the circuit of the art house like most of Antonioni's films of the years. sixty. But the 60s are gone and the film will have to find its audience on a small screen where half of its beauty will be lost, even in a DVD version in mailbox (if and when it will be broadcast). I urge all general and esoteric moviegoers to see "Beyond the Clouds" and add a piece of magic to the tragic.
