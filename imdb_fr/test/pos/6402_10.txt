Okay to say it was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember the show well because I was in the Florida Keys when the series debuted. I was looking through old videotapes that were "gatekeepers" and I found two that had about eight episodes. I ended up spending part of the Christmas night (and the next) watching these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx - saw his name appear on the credits. It comes from Anguilla and has a beach bar called The Dune Preserve. He is a longtime friend of Jimmy Buffett and Bankie's classic song "Still In Paradise" is featured in the latest Buffett CD / DVD combo entitled "Live In Anguilla". This is track # 12 on CDs 1 and 8 on the CD. I too would like to see this short-lived series come out on DVD. Keep the faith!
