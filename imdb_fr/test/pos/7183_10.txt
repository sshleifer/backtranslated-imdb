Yes, impossible is not Gaulish. <br /> <br /> Well-paced movie, very entertaining. A good command of the French language and a knowledge of modern France (and history) are recommended. I do not think this movie really works in another language. The movie is incredibly better than the previous one (In Search of ...). In addition to the great actors and the clever handling of the camera, it is the spirit and the fireworks of allusions, puns, etc. who make this movie a really great movie. The cartoon is recognizable but the film is very emancipated. The cost of the film is taken advantage of. Indeed, all special effects fit "naturally" in the film, you will never feel choked by them. > <br /> -A neighbor on the other side of the Rhine
