The line above summarizes it very well. The best features of comics are his visual gags and jokes (the latter are almost impossible to translate, which is why comics are at their best in their native language). <br /> <br /> It's pretty hard to capture in a movie, so they'll never be as good as comics. Movies are simply a different medium than comics. Keeping this in mind, this film is surprisingly good at capturing the pleasure of comedy. <br /> <br /> The word gags is bearable, and sometimes funny (Debouze refers to Amelie!). I must mention that I watched the French version. If you do not look at the French version or if your lack of understanding of the French language limits you to subtitles, the word jokes will probably be zero. <br /> <br /> The slapstick goes well too; It's a very simple form of humor, and not really funny when you're over twelve, but it captures the spirit of comics. Other visual jokes are the grace of the film for the older audience, as they are often quite funny. <br /> <br /> The acting is totally excessive, but again, it's not awkward at all because it captures the spirit of comics. Only Depardieu and Clavier do not react too much, which could explain why some people think that they do not appreciate their role (I did not notice anything). For their part, Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich become artisans. It's really fun to watch. Again, I'm afraid it will not be as funny as the voices are doubled. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a bad movie, much better than the previous one. It's not a classic and it does not destroy Asterix's Twelve Tasks like my favorite Asterix movie, but it's still worth seeing. The French version is. 7/10
