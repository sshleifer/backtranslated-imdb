OK, so this movie is NOT very well known and has not been much publicized. I discovered this pretty brutal gangster turned good movie by accident on one of Skys' millions of movie channels late in a boring night, but I'm happy The opening sequence of this movie is incredibly comical in a way This really defines what I think is the general tone of the film. I think a lot of critics and moviegoers who have seen this movie have been a little unfair to just think of it as a low budget gangster movie in the vein of Reservoir Dogs.OK, so there are some undeniable similarities between Thursday and some other criminal genre movies to which it has been compared, but in all fairness, I think this movie takes a much darker look at this type of film, and the end result is a captivating film, well done, funny, if not completely original. Tom Jane is good at this and deserves the recognition he now hopes to thank. his performance as a villain who has worked well is realistic, funny and just cold enough to make you think that Casey was really a bad guy before he reformed. It's another thing that makes this movie remarkable for me, the characters. In Nicks Gang, you get the weirdest trio of criminals ever assembled, a smooth, charismatic but very cold leader (Nick), a happy bloody trigger sexually loving a woman's predators (Dallas) and a psychotic hill character with a brain with a penchant for torture (Billy Hill). never seen on the screen, beautifully played by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe for ... well for Thursday really. It is sometimes dark comical, sometimes brutal, sometimes unoriginal, but always captivating and deserves to be watched. 8/10
