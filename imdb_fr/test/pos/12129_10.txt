"Let me ask you another question" Ha! what a super soon .. this movie was brilliant fantastic actor, super script. The only reason nobody noticed that it was because of the low budget, everyone will agree with me that it is a cult like "Donnie Brasco", it shows again a young Joe Pesci in gangster, this film puts them in conflict with the cults. He has sopranos and fortune-tellers, he got his idea for the sopranos when he looked at that and Scorsese found Joe Pesci looking at him, that proves it must be great. I must admit that they showed a brilliant scene where they threw peanuts at the camp pianist "Stop with friggen peanuts".
