As a fan of Rupert Grint, I rented this movie a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written film with a bunch of big actors. It was funny and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his best-known character, Ron Weasley. His subtle portrayal of Ben and all the other remarkable actors made this film very nice. <br /> <br /> Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely pious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes, I guess you could call "assistant" for Evie, a retired actress. At first, it's just a way for him to make money. But after a while, he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps Ben get a little out of his shell and allows him to have fun and be happy with himself. In the end, they both seem to need each other. <br /> <br /> Whether you're a fan of Rupert Grint or not, this movie is really fun with some very cute moments. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie with talented and talented actors.
