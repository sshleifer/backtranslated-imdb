I recently rented Twister, a movie I had seen on television a few years ago and which has aged well. I burst out laughing a few times and as strange as everyone else was, in the end I cared deeply about it. This is the kind of little film that is made for a cult audience because, like the gaspacho of Howdy (well, I think that's right), it's an acquired taste: you have to be at home. listening to its particular wavelength. The values ​​of production can be described as inexpensive by charity and the pace and atmosphere take some time to settle, but the film has a "look", especially in beautiful shots contrasting dry flatness from the country with new-rich opulence Inside the house: Michael Almereyda already had a good eye. Life with sodapop mogul Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his household (two grown children, a grandchild and a housekeeper) seem so detached from life outside that we could be in Gormenghast. Everyone in this movie is great (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover, Maureen and Howdy, a genius without direction), who live so comfortably their role after a moment that you only buy the strange premise of having survived the tornado and apparently unable to happiness, these people are lucky and do not know what to do with their luck. There are some really great scenes: Eugene's sudden confrontations, first with his girlfriend Virginia, a child researcher, a gold digger, and one with his kids; William S. Burroughs practices training at the target in the barn and tells the story of a mysterious Jim; Maureen's boyfriend, Chris, has a proven track record fighting a shed filled with wasps hidden in a tablecloth, a doily and an old fedora. Howdy, Violet, Maureen and Chris are all sitting on the couch (the last three dressed in lightweight, light summer clothes, the first wearing a red blazer and a black leather rock'n'roll outfit) laying down images of deserts on the huge TV and contemplating the future (the images were made by Bill Viola, who made the video installation as a backdrop to Nine Inch Nails' latest tour). Crispin Glover is as beautiful as Howdy: as always, he retains his character perfectly. Howdy has worshiped his misery and his brilliance; He looks like Kansas's Oscar Wilde, who strives to live up to his red velvet suit. That he plays with an electric guitar without noise or force, that he breaks a big bull while wearing an all black cowboy outfit, that he demolishes a room or that he does something simple, like drive or pour the aforementioned soup into a blender, it is fascinating. If you like his job, you'll like it.
