As other people have written, I'm a fan of Mario and I loved this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a bit boring, but believe me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your addict! The levels are fun and exciting. They will hook you until your mind turns to mush. I am not joking. This game is also orchestrated and is beautifully done. <br /> <br /> To keep this flapper free, I have to keep my mouth shut on the details. But please try this game! It will be worth it! <br /> <br /> Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's as good as that!) Hardness: 10 Attention Grabber: 10 Average: 10
