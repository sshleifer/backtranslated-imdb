I did not really think this movie was bad. Of course, the detective was a little lame about what he did, and he tended to fall on Captain Howdy by accident, but he did the job. Captain Howdy himself was rather scary. The makeup artist did a good job. I really liked seeing Dee dressed as a geek. I laughed so much when I saw that. Personally, I do not see how anyone can stay in the shit like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and call it a fantastic movie, then watch Strangeland, which is more troubling because so many things could happen if the Internet is so popular, and call it badly. Personally, I think the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a mass of shit. Probably one of the most stupid movies I have ever seen. I enjoyed Strangeland. It was a very disturbing film because almost everything is really happening.
