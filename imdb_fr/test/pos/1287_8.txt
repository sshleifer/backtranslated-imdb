I just watched Follow and I thought it was great. I noted it 8 out of 10. I plan to see it again with the director's comments, then back in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I rented this film because of my fascination with Memento, Christopher Nolan's most recent film. The following has some similarities; This film was probably Memento's project. Even music in some parts is very similar. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film in black and white gives it a mysterious sensation. The story and the dialogue are really good. The performance of the actors is credible. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan made this film with a very small budget. I look forward to his next release, Insomnia, a big-budget movie with my favorite actor Al Pacino.
