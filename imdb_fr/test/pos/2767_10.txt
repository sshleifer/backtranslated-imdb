This movie used to be played constantly on Disney Channel when I was a little younger, and I really remember having loved it. However, I did not have much taste at the time (not to say that I'm doing it now) so I can not vouch too much for myself. The film was probably a 7/10 but there was good music so I gave it an extra point. Yes, it's worth watching. I know some fans of this movie are wondering what is a song, the one that appears when she's in the car accident. The song is "Play a Love Song" Jaguars and it is VERY hard to find and get. In fact, this film is too. I can not find it anywhere online, on DVD or on VHS. I would like to see him again so that I can determine if it was really a good movie. Never mind.
