First, the obvious - like a cop cop drama with a fun melodrama, QUAY ?? is disconcerting, directly independent and a threat to banality. Jouvet's composure is put to good use in a difficult cop performance, immediately perceptible by his vigor and exuberant strength; His Anthony is not really a man of intellect, but a man of vast experience of life and an earthly instinct. QUAY ?? is not subversive in that the philistines of today (and already of yesterday) like to use this word. This is the most fun time of Clouzot. He tended to adapt Steeman's books in a satirical note. (It is said that Clouzot was a great reader of crime novels.) As a director, Clouzot has a firm hand. <br /> <br /> This is not a mystery or a thriller, but a satirical look at a couple in Paris and police procedures. Those who are accustomed to Clouzot's masterpiece, LES DIABOLIQUES, might find the multiplicity of things, styles, elements of QUAY ?? a little disconcerting. Clouzot talks about a lot of things, a couple, and a hidden love story (Simone Renant for Blier), world entertainment and old girls, police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise, etc. There is a note of exuberance - not only in the performance of Jouvet, but also in the design of the film. <br /> <br /> Quay is a realistic crime drama made like a satire. It offers Jouvet's outstanding performance as a police inspector. Antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa, but did not climb the stairs of ranks because of his independent behavior); he lives with his son, a schoolboy; At work, Antoine is hard and ruthless, he is a competent inspector, bitter, intelligent and hard. It is a role of great gusto, very picturesque. Jouvet composed his character with several defining traits: his clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality and that mocking air. Antoine is not made to appear more intelligent than plausible; When he questions Blier, Antoine makes mistakes and his talent is presented as the talent we encounter in real life, mixed with mistakes, gaps and flaws. Antoine's talent is also that of experience, of daily observation - it is not the almost supernatural divinatory genius of almost all famous detectives. <br /> <br /> QUAY ?? is a realistic crime drama, but also a satire and a melodrama. It can be considered one of the first cinematic incursions into the legendary endurance of the French police. A long time ago, the hard cops of Eastwood and Wayne, there was Antoine. <br /> <br /> The title is interesting, suggesting that it is a film about the police, not about a case or a mystery. <br /> <br /> As a craftsman, Clouzot was perhaps the best and most fierce of France (like Welles). QUAY ?? is very faithful to the nature of Clouzot: a sardonic comic strip, precise observations, a lot of psychology, an acute and unforgiving irony. The man was in first class when he filmed something, he knew what to shoot, what to choose, see the opening scenes of this film, with the great success of Jenny Lamour on stage. Each scene is memorably shot. The technical and stylistic skills of Clouzot were extraordinary. His style is inventive, satirical, lively, extremely limpid, ingenious. <br /> <br /> Jouvet's style was exuberant, powerful, vehement. (Some people hated him for these feature films, and since he was a great theater actor, his style of film was considered too theatrical, etc.). His Antoine is a fine example of what is meant by composition of a role. <br /> <br /> Jouvet had a very peculiar appearance, a bit like a threatening bird of prey, a little like Van Cleef, but much more subtle, more noble, more intelligent and more distinguished. Jouvet had that predatory, ferocious air, and he's helpful here, because he's playing a tough old policeman. One of the sides of QUAY ?? is that it is a Jouvet recital. He is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his game (I see that many, watching this movie, do not know that it is a film Jouvet, which is an amazing quality in itself). <br /> <br /> Fresnay and Jouvet are the two French actors that I admire the most; the first was revealed to me by a drama of Renoir (the famous one), while Jouvet by a comedy of Carn√©. I was delighted to see that Clouzot gave them a leading role. <br /> <br /> Finally, a word about Steeman; he wrote the novel used by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another Steeman novel, as a Fresnay comedy). Steeman was a mystery writer of the old school, in the vein of Wallace. It quickly became obsolete with the new hardboiled fashion. At 11, I read one of his thrillers and I liked it a lot.
