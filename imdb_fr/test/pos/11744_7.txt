Based on the 1952 autobiography "A thing that has many splendors", "Love is a thing that has many splendors" (1955) tells the story of Han Suyin, highlighting Han's novel, a widowed Eurasian doctor widow in 1949, with a married American correspondent named Mark Elliott. "I never want to feel anything again," Han said to Mark shortly after their meeting, but the two grew quickly for each other, and who could blame them? Mark is embodied by William Holden almost at the height of his dude's period (the "picnic" of the following year would be the top) in this first film about the next seven years that would find Holden in China (1960's "The world of Suzie Wong "and" Satan Never Dorse "of 1962 being the others). And Dr. Han is played by Jennifer Jones, who, although she is not a Eurasian (unlike Nancy Kwan and the pretty France Nuyen of these other exotic films of Holden), does a credible job as such . Whether it's wearing a cheongsam, a European dress, a surgeon's blouse or a swimsuit (hubba-hubba!), Jones is ridiculously beautiful here. No wonder East meets West in this film so dramatically! With its two attractive main stars, breathtaking scenery in Hong Kong, stunning CinemaScope and colors, Oscar-winning costumes, and Oscar-winning classic, which floats through the film like charming incense, Turns "Love is a very rich thing to be quite the winning and romantic concoction." Han himself did not care about the photo, so I can only imagine that great freedoms were taken with his sources. Still, I liked it, and if the end of the movie makes a tear cry, just remember Mark's words of wisdom: "The greatest tragedy of life should not be loved."
