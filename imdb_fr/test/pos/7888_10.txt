After recently seeing Cry Uncle, from the same director, I decided to look for this and I'm happy to have done it !? It's an extraordinarily good film. Far, much better than it seems likely given the ingredients. How many times have we had the embarrassment of seeing someone play with a middle-class dad mixing it with the children of Aagh flowers! And yet, here, thanks to a perfect script, it becomes credible. Not ideal, not good or bad but credible. Peter Boyle, as a working, hippie and friendly class, and Dennis Patrick, in crooked costumes, play their respective roles in an impeccable way and I do not remember ever having seen the two classes meet in this way without the things do not become sentimental. Susan Sarandon is effective as a hippie girl, but does not have much to do in her first film. It's really a movie to watch, as it did during this very short time in the West and especially in the United States, when the counterculture was about to collapse.
