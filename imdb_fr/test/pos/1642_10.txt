Ice the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A virus released from the ice <br /> <br /> I did not know how to play nice. <br /> <br /> If you are infected, kill yourself <br /> <br /> Because you are sick. <br /> <br /> The cure is to be infected twice. <br /> <br /> Ice is a big episode; one of the greats of season 1 that started shaping the show and if you ask me, you really could not ask much better throughout the series. It starts with a great teaser that, in my opinion, is really one of the best teasers in the series. A group of scientists in Alaska drilled something in the ice that, for some reason, caused them to kill themselves. Mulder and Scully are now sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened. As Mulder says, it's either because they are brilliant or because they are consumable. I guess that means they have interest in being brilliant or something else ... The group quickly discovers that the cause of the chaos is a small parasite from the ice core. A small worm that enters the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. Since the pilot is infected, the rest of the series turns to suspenseful paranoid thriller while others begin to suspect themselves of being infected. This is not at all helped by a paranoid doctor, Hodge, who does not trust anyone, what he learns early by the first thing he asks: see the references of each to "make sure that we are what we claim to be ". Events lead to the search for the infected person and how to cure them. <br /> <br /> I like the episode, and I like a lot of characters of course. This episode, as well as some couple flaws, but most can be attributed to increased caution and a lack of thought. I love Bear as soon as I meet him for the first time. It's a pity he must die. I also like the scene presented from the point of view of the other scientist while Mulder and Scully argue in the next room. This gives an interesting twist to our usual viewer perception and, for me, seems to suggest that we should perhaps not assume that just because someone is a government, it means that he knows all kinds of secrets of conspiracy. Even though Hodges frustrates me in this episode, I think Mulder was just as much to blame for some of the daring actions taken. I really like Scully in this episode. First, she can tackle as a linebacker to Frickin! Secondly, I really like the attention to her terror about what can happen to them and how she tries not to let Mulder's trust and friendship stop her from misjudging her judgment. I love the scene when she goes to sleep in the room and it looks like the image of the previous group who is hugging her and her birthday present is given to the person who was sleeping in this room and she suddenly fears and pushes the dresser in front of the door and in a last touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor, knees pressed against her chest, we see at the bottom of a poster on the wall that says "Bosom Buddies". It's such a beautiful writing. One way to say without saying that Scully is afraid of not being able to trust even his best friend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this increased suspicion leads the group to believe that Mulder has been infected since he discovered Murphy, a corpse even though they did not inspect him at all to find out for sure. That was my main problem with the behavior of the characters, that they could easily have solved all the suspicions simply by giving blood. But I guess I would probably have acted imprudently in this situation too. But then stupid Hodges decides that he must presume that Mulder is infected while Mulder voluntarily surrenders and that he will voluntarily be inspected and almost infects Mulder in the process. Fortunately, he sees that it is really Dasilva who is infected and we finally reach a resolution. At least as much as you can expect from an X-File. The "government" is wasting no time on burning the evidence, as it always happens in these cases, and Mulder finds himself faced with another frustrating "unresolved" case. In closing, I give "Ice" and easy 10/10 and I leave you with a haiku. <br /> <br /> "We are not what we are, it does not go beyond that, it ends here and now."
