Little Vera tells the story of a Russian teenager, her family and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life that is deteriorating more and more. In her quest for meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose hatred for her deeply flawed parents flies away quickly. <br /> <br /> Little Vera shocks and disturbs almost in every respect. The father's alcohol consumption, the mother's lack of spirit and lack of understanding, the occasional lies and misguided orientation, and Vera herself who forgives them all their faults are shocking and slightly disturbing to watch. However, the raw honesty of the film manages to become even more shocking than the plot or the characters. Situated in narrow spaces and in a vast urban decline, little Vera presented a vision of Soviet life very different from what had been seen before. In fact, Little Vera is a portrait of the collapse of Soviet society painted in shades of pain, despair and rust. It is the implosion of a family facing the implosion of a whole social order. <br /> <br /> Although painful and desperately unsatisfactory, the film itself certainly deserves a visit, if only to understand the feelings and cultures that are still reshaping Russia today.
