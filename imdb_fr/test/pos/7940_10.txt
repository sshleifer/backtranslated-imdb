You can look at each image of the film and see the beauty of it.I would first like to say that "when I saw the helmets of German soldiers, I understood that it was from there that" Star Les wars "were inspired. The scene where they killed the baby is scary and when I saw it, I did not like it. But when the film ended, I thought about this scene and changed my mind thinking that during the Second World War it's exactly what the Germans did. <br /> <br /> The ice battle scene is one of the best war scenes I've ever seen (if not the BEST). This film combines both music and a great feeling. the pictures are really excellent.Then, the score of Prokofiev is one of the most famous soundtracks in history and I thought it was one of the best at. <br /> <br /> What about more of a work of art.Eisenstein have created a breathtaking masterpiece, a propaganda film and a beautiful work of art. I am very happy because I have just received the collection criteria defined by Eisenstein.
