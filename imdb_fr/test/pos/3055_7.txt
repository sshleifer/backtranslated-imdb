The film is not divided by two as much as people want you to believe. <br /> <br /> What is the reason why so many people hate this movie? Is it because it's Laurel & Hardy's last wedding and it's not their best? Or is it because of the lack of regulars Laurel & Hardy? Or because it's not manufactured by Hal Roach Studios or 20th Century Fox? <br /> <br /> It is quite true that this film is not a successful attempt to revive Laurel & Hardy and bring it to the 50s. It is also true that the film is far from to be better, but honestly, the film is still entertaining, which also makes it far from the worst. This is not the imaginable farewell movie, but an entertaining and fitting goodbye. They withdrew from the cinema after finishing this one. <br /> <br /> The film still has some nice crazy moments and the chemistry between Laurel and Hardy is obviously still very present. It also makes this film better than most of their films from the 1940s. It's quite surprising that blinding humor is still working as well, since the era of blinding comedy was over since the 1930s. The story may not be as fun as it might have been and it contains too many characters and teammates, so the film sometimes loses its interest in the boys. Too bad, because they are still the ones who really wear and make the film. <br /> <br /> Sad to see what a mediocre form was Stan Laurel at the time of making this movie. He looked really sick and old, which of course he was. He was already over 60 years old. But after an operation, he completely recovered and lived another 15 years, before dying in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. <br /> <br /> A goodbye fun, but not perfect for boys, Laurel & Hardy and the end of three decades of fun, humorous and quality entertainment, from awesome movies that are always watched and loved by the whole world. <br /> <br /> 7/10
