Stan Laurel considered PUTTING ON PHILIP as the first true L & H film. The second year was L & H's first official film, but it was the one in which Stan completely resigned himself not only to playing (he had signed with Hal Roach studios as director and 'gag-man', before certain situations - Among them, the accident of Oliver Hardy with a leg of lamb forcing Stan to replace him and the extra money that would bring him the show would allow him and his new wife, Lois - to provoke his historic return to performance, writing, directing, editing and involvement in other areas of production), but also realized that he was part of a team that worked well together. It is therefore a very important historical film in the history of comedy. <br /> <br /> It's also a surprisingly funny little silent movie; quite different from what Laurel & Hardy would become known and what they are immediately associated with. 'Stan & Ollie' characters do not appear - Scottish Stan Laurel is the nephew of Oliver Hardy, a respectable man in town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange kilt boy who is in the habit of chasing pretty girls. There are some very entertaining moments in this lovely, well done little film, and the performances of these two kings of comedy are superb - look at Stan's scissors and his smile that says, "Well, waddaya, you know? " when he sees girls, or the scene of the hair at the airport, for example. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can, with the arrangement music of The Beau Hunks Orchestra (available on the VVL video outings) that enhances the 1920s atmosphere and is very enjoyable to listen to. It's a brilliant and underrated film, which is why I said it was "surprisingly" funny.
