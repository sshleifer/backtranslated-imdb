This film offers a lot of delights and surprises. When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet of "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the film, you appreciate the subtle strata of this excellent film. The story takes place in the 18th century in Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just another touch. You share the exquisite joy of General Loewenhielm when he attends the Sarcophagus Quails, even if you just watch a movie - but you only want a small sample to savor. food. No other form of art may allow the artist to share his creations directly. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this film, the potential that the sharing of food has to transform the world, is very similar to the theme of "Chololat", but "Babette's Day" does not hit you at the head with his message. The townspeople are conservative Puritans, but not too oppressive. You have come to understand and respect them and, finally, to appreciate their humanity. <br /> <br /> Many questions arouse your reflection: the nature of art, the contemplation of the paths taken and paths not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of the environment on behavior, take life to give life, among others. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment for me was General Loewenhielm's speech at the climax of the meal. I was expecting deep and sincere observations, but I had some vague mystical ramblings. The speech had such a minimal impact that I almost do not remember it. <br /> <br /> But this discreet film leaves a lasting impression. The heat it generates contrasts with its austere context. You will leave the theater to go out and dance under the stars.
