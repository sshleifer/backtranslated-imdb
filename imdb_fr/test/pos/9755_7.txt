If "Love Me Tonight" is "the musical for people who do not like musicals", it must be said that "The Gay Desperado" is certainly not a musical for those who do not like the comedy. 'opera. In fact - though apparently based on a comic operetta - it's not really a musical, but a parody bandit story with interpolated airs interpolated to show the voice of a character; and what a voice it is. <br /> <br /> Nino Martini, as a young singer Chivo, joins the gang of bandits to get a place on the radio (no, the plot does not make much sense later either ... ), has a glorious golden tenor whose style has not been dated to the time when it was recorded. The trills and riffs of some of his contemporaries of the music belong to a bygone fashion, but it is very easy to imagine Chivo shouting "Nessun Dorma" in front of a World Cup audience and climbing to the top charts. Unfortunately, although he has an engaging smile and a decent dramatic range, he is totally unable to play and sing at the same time. The result is that the film, at such a fast pace, comes to a standstill each time Chivo puts his hand on his chest and begins to decline, and the viewer's tolerance of the result will probably depend on his appreciation of the operatic performance. . Apart from this inconvenience, the film is a generous satire on the Hollywood conventions and the stereotype of the Mexican bandit in particular, which allows to reach the essential objective of such parodies by making his characters sufficiently engaging in themselves. keep the viewer's interest when the joke would have otherwise become bland. The bandit leader and his sidekick have the traditional double-act relationship, there is an enigmatic peon with a carved teak face and a lively heroine (a young Ida Lupino) who plays the credits "you say you hate me but you really love me "routine with a refreshing touch. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is funny and funny, and I feel like I'm getting my money's worth - but we can not deny that the musical interludes, admirable in their own way, introduce serious rhythm problems.
