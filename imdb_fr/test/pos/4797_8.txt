When you watch the best Mexican films, you will no doubt notice that the photograph was made by Gabriel Figueroa. He is recognized in the world as one of the best that has ever existed. His mastery of cameras gave an added bonus to the films he belonged to. If added to his participation, we add the direction of Luis Bunuel, you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world. This story, Nazarin, was written by the greatest Spanish writer, apart from Miguel de Cervantes (Don Quijote de la Mancha). The story itself is superb: a Nazarite priest who lives by his convictions tries to lead a very Christian life, but as always, there are people who do not accept this. He wanders in many places preaching his Christianity but finding, most of the time, people who do not accept it. But beyond the beautiful story, it's always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that Bunuel sends us throughout the photo in scenes that make you shudder.
