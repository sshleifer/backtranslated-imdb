Last night, I watched this film on TCM, an enthusiastic expectation, after seeing it for the last time (twice) during its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife, who had never seen him before, to watch the long, unbroken long shot of Veronika being seen on a bus en route to find Boris. In a hand-held setting that certainly precedes the modern Steadicam, the shot then picks up and cranes (unintentional pun) over the street when it comes out of the bus and rushes through the tanks to cross the road. THEN, I remember that, without a break, we follow her close to the fence as she watched him, looking for him anxiously, but not finding him. But we continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of the harassed recruits and their emotionally devastated women, all extras, and each of them a jewel of Stanislavsk's stigmatizing behavior. How, one wonders, Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky have mounted this extraordinary sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street, dodging the tanks, the scene ended abruptly and returned to the back of the apartment, before continuing towards the soldiers and their families at the fence. It seems to me that this film was not only restored, but also reissued. What a sad!
