After watching this film years ago, it never faded from my memory. I always thought it was Michelle Pfeiffer's best performance I saw. But I am stunned by the number of negative reviews this film has received. After seeing him again today, I still think he's powerful, moving and that he would not care if he was "vaguely based on King Lear". <br /> <br /> I realize now that this is the best Jessica Lange performance I've ever seen - and she's been hailed for her much less profound effort. <br /> <br /> Thousand Acres is complex, human, dynamic and extremely moving, but surely does not have any of the main features women lead with any touch of glamor or "sexy". I do not think that is welcome at this time. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons for this film's unconvincing response is that the writer (Jane Smiley (screenplay, Laura Jones) and the director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women. know that, in my youth, I would not have read a book written by a woman.I did not focus on this fact until years later. <br /> <br /> If If you have not seen or if you've given him a chance in the past, try to watch him again, maybe you're ready.
