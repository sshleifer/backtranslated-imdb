I liked it. I had just sat down for half of "The Glass House" (off ... god, what a bloody predictable plot and bad acting) and then I saw that movie. I thought it was great. I loved Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster. I liked the escape from all this scenery, traveling in Europe in the 60s - but they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all the bad things that could happen. It held my attention completely, although I thought some parts were incredible.
