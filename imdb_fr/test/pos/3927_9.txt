I have never seen the original "House Of Wax", so I really did not know what to expect when I went to see a preview of the new movie. After beginning to present our young characters in a somewhat hesitant way, "House Of Wax" goes into high gear and becomes an extremely effective horror release. <br /> <br /> The plot does not matter much here - I think most people know it By seeing this, these stranded kids will meet a nasty killer and find awful things in the house wax holder. This is the special effects here, and they are top quality. Viewers who love their horror movies with a lot of blood will be satisfied here, but there are also other macabre effects. The design and the scenery of the production are excellent, and the distribution exploits at best their underwritten roles. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people are probably wondering what Paris Hilton's performance is. To be honest, Hilton is very good at fulfilling her responsibilities and does not describe herself as such, as many people predict. His character is sexy and kind, and I think his good job will, hopefully, change the minds of many people about him. Elisha Cuthbert is also good, going from her previous film, the terrible film "The Girl Next Door". His character is put to the test and Cuthbert proves to be a brave heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is pretty to watch, but unfortunately is not very convincing as a "bad guy" in the group. <br /> <br /> I predict good things for "House Of Wax". the audience attending the screening witnessed screams, howls and applause in many parts of the film. Congratulations to the actors and the team for the job well done. <br /> <br /> And congratulations to Paris Hilton for proving the opposite to many people. As she always says - "It's hot."
