After watching John preform this one-of-a-kind show, I had to share ..... It was really something to watch an adult man portray himself as a child. I like the fact that with each character he "becomes", you can imagine what they look like. It is more fun to understand the individual. "Freak" is what the real "stand up" should be. John is a real talent.
