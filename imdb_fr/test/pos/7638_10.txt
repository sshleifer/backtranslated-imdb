I watched this movie thinking that it was going to be absolutely horrible and that it was ready for anything, bad effects, etc. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not to say it's the best vampire movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst. I liked all the reality / the alternative dream state that played in the movie. The graphics were pretty good for a movie directly on DVD and I liked the overall look of the movie. I enjoyed the main character Sai. Usually, I ended up hating girls but there was something about her that interested me. Yes, she makes bad decisions, but that was to be expected. Yes, the other characters were stereotyped, but I expected it too. I do not know if I would highly recommend this movie, but give it a chance and you could be pleasantly surprised. I put this one on my list of guilty pleasures.
