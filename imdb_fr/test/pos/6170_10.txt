Ever since I grew up in Czechoslovakia, I followed the story of the RAF pilots and crews during the Second World War in Britain, their stories and tragic endings either in action or in jails and prisons. communist camps. It is certainly more than a dark chapter in our history, although the fact that these brave men allow us to go through all this and recover afterwards is amazing. To all who want to see a good movie ... this is it! During the recent visit to the Czech Republic, I saw this film three times in three days (we only play it for three days ... otherwise I'll go see it again a few times !!! It's worth it! I hope you enjoy it, even if it requires a little more thought and knowledge of the basic information behind the story, in much the same way as the movie "Kolya". It's not a simple film because of its deep history, and the way it is told will most likely make you cry ... that's what happened to me three times in a row ... Zdenek Sverak did as always a good screenplay, his son Jan made an excellent film and distribution? Ondrej Vetchy, the role played by Oldrich Kaiser and all the other actors who made this film just awesome! If it's not an Oscar nomination, I think I'll be on strike at Holywood.
