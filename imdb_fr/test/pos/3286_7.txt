Wesley Eure is the young inventor Brian Foster, who invented a new anti-crime safety device in the form of a robot dog, the holder "C.H.O.M.P.S.". (It represents the Canine HOMe protection system). C.H.O.M.P.S., who has been modeled on Brian's true Rascal dog, can do almost anything; it has improved speed, strength, X-ray vision, etc. This is precisely what is needed to save the security company of his boss Ralph Norton (Conrad Bain). Naturally, a viscous competitor, Gibbs (Jim Backus) wants to have the advantage, so he tries to get his hands on the secret. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that is hard to resist. There's a lot of slapstick (Chuck McCann and Red Buttons play a great pair of stupid idiots), an upbeat attitude, an appealing cast and enough laughter to entertain one. The energetic music of disco style becomes repetitive but is undeniably catchy; the story is simple and the dogs themselves are absolutely adorable. In a completely strange but divisive gesture, there is another dog in the movie (named "Monster") whose thoughts we actually hear; his dialogue and the interpreter who makes the voice are invaluable. In fact, he even uses a slight blasphemy and his last words end the film on a dazzling final note. <br /> <br /> Eure and the cute Valerie Bertinelli are very nice beginnings, accompanied by their veterans the material with all the taste they can gather. Larry Bishop, Hermione Baddeley, Robert Q. Lewis and Regis Toomey are also co-stars. <br /> <br /> A rare theatrical adventure for the group of cartoonists Hanna & Barbera ("The Flintstones", "Scooby-Doo", "The Smurfs", etc.), "CHOMPS" is pleasantly stupid. I know it has left a smile on my face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
