Once again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh and such a joy to watch. As a vegetarian, I have to change just about everything she earns. But I'm happy to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she's so inviting with her fans and always seems to be down-to-earth. The studio audience seems to be rather small, but it creates a more comfortable environment. Some people have posted that the show is bad. I guess it depends on your own interpretation of it. If you notice the first episodes of 30 minutes of meals, you will see a personality completely different from the last years. I'm sure she will also find her comfort zone with this show. Good luck Rachael!
