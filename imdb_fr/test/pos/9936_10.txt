"Opera" is an excellent film with wonderful and imaginative images. An opera singer (Cristina Marsillach) is hunted by a murderer who forces her to watch him murder everyone she knows by tying him and him This idea of ​​needles comes from the fact that Argento does not like people to cover their eyes while watching his films. "For years, I was annoyed by people who covered their eyes during the most important moments of my films.I film these pictures because I want people to see them and do not avoid the positive confrontation of their images. Then I said to myself, "How would it be possible to do that and force someone to look at the most gruesome murder and make sure they can not avoid it?" that I found is at the heart of what is "Opera." About Argento.More suspense, a wonderful cinematography and brutal and bloody murders.A guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife that causes a wound, Daria Nicolodi gets shot in the ooking through the peephole, etc.For those who have not caught this one yet, try it.Highly recommended.
