We live in sad times today, where it seems that all movies and television series are painfully impossible to live with and inflicted with cheap, rude or mediocre humor. Most people do not know what it means to really laugh at a comedy, and these people desperately need to watch "Throw Momma From the Train". I say without hesitation that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, from start to finish. The comedy is so unpredictable and twisted just enough to make us laugh a few times. Do not be fooled by the assassination plot. The plot is not serious enough to worry or worry about what will happen. The story features a young man (Danny DeVito) who wants to get rid of his annoying and grumpy mother (Anne Ramsey, nominated for an Oscar in a totally impeccable role, in my opinion) and does it by killing Billy's wife Crystal. that Crystal wanted death for stealing his novel. I do not want to spoil the jokes and gags of this movie, but all I can say is that you have to see this movie if you want to laugh. A fast pace and a real treat for comedy fans, and the type of movie you do not see today. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 on ****
