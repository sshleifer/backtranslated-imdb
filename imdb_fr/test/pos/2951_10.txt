It's a very good film! It makes you think of your parents. We all have fragile relationships with them unless we really make an effort to know who they are. And, it's equally important not to forget to open up and show them our real identity, not just the one we think they want us to be. See this documentary! IMDb forces me to write more text before posting my comment, it's really weird. Usually, online comments should be short and I am asked to write more! Well, I went to see the movie with my parents, I thought after that, they would like to talk about their parents, but my dad wanted to keep talking about him and things in his life that he felt he had messed up, which was unusual, my father is not a reluctant man, but I was surprised that he wants to talk about mistakes he thinks he has made. Mike and Kitty came to the film to do an interview and there was a hilarious moment after, when my dad was talking to Mike, while my mom was talking to Kitty! Really, do not take into account my last sentences to make this comment and just remember "51 Birch Street", go see it!
