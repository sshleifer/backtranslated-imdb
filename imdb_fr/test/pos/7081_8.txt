This film began to be confusing and became one of the best films I've seen ... The acting was absolutely superb and when I did not dry my tears, I enjoyed Meryl Streep, whose game was amazing. The film discusses the difficulties of a distant family in front of a mother with terminal cancer. The movie was very hard to watch and heartbreaking. The soundtrack perfectly matches this movie. Brava Bette Midler !! On 5 stars, I give him 4 1/2.
