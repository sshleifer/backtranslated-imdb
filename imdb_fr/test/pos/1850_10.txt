I saw this movie with my mother and I loved it! It was such a beautiful story, (not to mention that it's funny because of the secondary cast!) They never make movies like this ... ever! What I prefer is when Grace (Minnie Driver) learns of the death of her boyfriend's wife, that she has the heart of the deceased woman and that she shouts: "WHAT SAYS GOD? I believe that everyone (no matter who you believe in) has such thoughts from time to time. But even if it's very succulent, it might make you believe in true love and true destiny for once and for all. (Sigh) especially in the aforementioned scene, it's terrible and yet so funny!). They make a good pair and I hope to see them again soon. 10/10 stars
