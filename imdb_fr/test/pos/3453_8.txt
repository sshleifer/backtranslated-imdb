Wow! An incredible lost piece from Australiana AND a glam-rock movie lost from the 70's in one. This film deserves to be viewed simply to see what can be done with little budget, but a lot of enthusiasm. By taking up the story of Oz, the film seems too obvious, but it is saved by its eccentricities. The chance to see how the glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. Previously, this film had a dual representation with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is. Although not as frivolous or as well built as RHPS, it's hard not to have fun with Oz. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Oz has aged well - perhaps a byproduct of the determination with which he stands in the true Australia of 1976. The passage in history shows that many of the ideas explored would eventually enter the general public. The film's desire to highlight homosexual characters is notable, especially as it goes back to the "revolution" period of the Australian campaign for the promotion of Australian gay rights. <br /> <br /> The performances vary from an amateur to a subtle shine. The management lacks subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an additional draft or two. In a way, these defects add to the appeal of the film, which is fortunately unpretentious. Just like in Australia in the 1970s, this film has some naive charm. <br /> <br /> There are several links to the original Australian stagings of the Rocky Horror Show that will remain obsessed. <br /> <br /> Oz is most certainly a minor classic and a potential cult favorite worthy of consideration. Laugh in the atrocious fashion of the '70s, play with the AusRock soundtrack, leave ALL expectations at the door and Oz will be thrilled.
