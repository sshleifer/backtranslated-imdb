Every time this film came back to the television late at night in the late '70s and early' 80s, I always took the time to sit in front of the television and watch it. To see the beautiful Kate Jackson, the handsome Richard Long, the "great" Polly Bergen that I've never seen anywhere but for this TV movie, the endearing Tom Bosley and another "big" that I've never seen in outside this film Celeste Holme. This is really the boat of love on a cruise to murder and chaos and boy was it always good !! And every time I looked at her, I always forgot who the real murderer was. <br /> <br /> As might be expected, someone here is already criticizing the film as if it could really help someone. It's an excellent TV movie to watch every time. I can not say about half of the movies I saw this month. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch it one day on television, which is unlikely, look at it. In the light of "The Girl Most Likely To" which will finally be released this year on DVD, there is perhaps a hope of release on DVD of "Death Cruise".
