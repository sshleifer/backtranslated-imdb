After a very disappointing part 3, I was wondering if I should not even bother with The Next Karate Kid, while I could see why this saga did not continue, I still enjoyed the next Next Karate Kid especially between the second and third films. Even if there are very unrealistic moments and situations, it was very pleasant and the story is catchy and warm. <br /> <br /> Hilary Swank, did this girl go far or what? She is a rebellious girl who lost her parents in a car accident and when Miaugi "watches" her somehow, he notices that she has karate skills. He offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. Now, of course, there is the boy who likes him and the bad guys who are quite similar to the first Karate Kid, but I would recommend this one. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
