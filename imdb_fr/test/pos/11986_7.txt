Take Martin & Lewis as a pinch of salt and pepper. Why does Martin support Lewis? Again, why do all the women in this movie like Jerry? Because he is innocently friendly! Martin sings some good songs (synchronized at least once) and Jerry kisses more girls than in all his other movies. I usually find that I can take so many Jerry antics before they become aggravating. BUT .... in this movie, look when Jerry is stuck outside on a submerged navy submarine! EXCELLENT! Buster Keaton should have been proud. I give a 7 to the film.
