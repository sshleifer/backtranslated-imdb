Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his feature films. And, I guess most people have only seen a few excerpts from his previous years, while he was playing dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. It's a shame because some short films are waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> If anyone watches this film, it has a good chance of seeing some of Chaplin's best short films. because Chaplin himself chose these three short films and put them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film. That's great for a number of reasons. First of all, in Chaplin's early films from 1914-1915, his character of the Little Tramp is still in its infancy or is totally absent. Moreover, even when he is there, he was often mean-spirited and egocentric - something very alien to the little wanderer we've come to love. Secondly, because the short films chosen were in very good condition, if you watch this film, you will not have to worry about watching a scrawny movie with holes and a lousy musical accompaniment that does not match the action (common problem) <Br/> <br /> So, for a great overview of Chaplin's shorts, give this film a chance. It's sure to provide you with great laughs.
