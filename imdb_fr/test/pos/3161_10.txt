Many things about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws a parallel between this country's attitudes to war and a kind of Hollywood-style falsity, which glorifies things that should not be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's views on recent events (although, to tell the truth, I can not always say exactly where he is), but I admire the unusual and artistic way of passing the message. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poems, etc. here play as important a role as the visual elements. Most of the time, the visual elements of the story are accompanied by these audio elements. I'm a bit of a radio fan, so it was good to hear how the radio was integrated into the rhythm of the movie. In fact, most of the dialogue takes place over the course of the story rather than letting the characters talk to each other. This does not mean that there are no "characters" (real people), but apart from "Jim" the protagonist (a kind of abandonment of the 60s with an erratic state of mind), the others come and go fairly quickly. Some make a very strong impression, especially a guru type taxi driver who seems to be the voice of wisdom itself. When he sings a spontaneous prayer song as he drives Jim to the subway, it's a very powerful moment. On the cover of the DVD is the quote "The danger is clear" which is extracted from the speech of President Bush which paved the way for our incursion in Iraq. In retrospect, hearing this speech at a defining moment in the film revealed how deeply we live in a moment of history that will always be remembered.
