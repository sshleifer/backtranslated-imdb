Martin Ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist response (three years later) to Elia Kazan's more conservative film, "On The Waterfront". While "Waterfront" has benefited immensely from an electrifying Marlon Brando, who inadvertently disguised Kazan's offensive theme of trying to justify the names (as Kazan had urged him to appear before the committee of non-US activities of the House), boasts young John Cassavetes and Sidney Poitier, a bold advocate, dared to face problems that "Waterfront" did not take into account, namely workers' rights and race relations. <br /> <br /> "Edge of the City" dives boldly into this unknown territory (at the time), and although the endearing black protagonist (Poitier) may seem a little simplistic in Hollywood, the brave struggle against fanaticism and barely veiled violence has barely aged. One wonders how much the film buffs of 1957 were shocked by such a bold presentation of the relations between black and white (if some fanatics did not leave the theater early, they should be left stunned, if not offended). <br /> <br /> The last reel of the film will still surprise the audience, as it refuses to sink into the expected clich√©s, including those who tarnished "Waterfront". Only the most jaded viewers will not realize how radical and fun movie "Edge of the City" becomes. <br /> <br /> What is the most disturbing in this classic lost: it is unfortunately unavailable in all formats, because reasons that remain quite cloudy. This film should be watched in history lessons in high school or college across the country, but it can be found on dark TV late evening, if ever.
