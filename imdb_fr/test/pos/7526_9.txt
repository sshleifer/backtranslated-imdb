This is the first cartoon of Pepe The Pew and in some ways it is very similar to the last ones but to some other strange ways it is not. Although the subject of Pepe's affections is a cat, curiously, he seems to be a BOY cat! This whole situation is due to the fact that a cat is tired of being abused by others, dresses like a skunk and tries to feel like a skunk so he can leave him alone. Unfortunately, this attracts our hero, Pepe. Most of the actions are pretty typical until the end very amusing and unexpected, making it one of the best cartoons in the series. Excellent animation (although the style is different from that of the last examples), excellent writing and a good sense of humor make her a guardian.
