Absolute must see a documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story. Told with an unshakable eye and with gripping style. If you think that conspiracy theories are meant for paranoid troubled people, it could make you change your mind. Something for the federal authorities too: a good model for government cover-ups! If you like your news tidy and easy to consume, it's not for you.
