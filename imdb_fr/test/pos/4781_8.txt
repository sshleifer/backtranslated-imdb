This era was not only the dawn of sound in cartoons, but also that of a cartoon character who would go down in history as the most famous mouse in the world. Yes, Mickey makes his debut here, in this joyful story of life aboard a steamboat. The animation is good for the time and the plot - although a bit simple - is rather cheerful. A true classic, and if you manage to do it on video, you will not regret it.
