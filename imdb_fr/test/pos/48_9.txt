I watch Lackawanna Blues every time. It reminds me of happy times. I grew up in a big city in the center west. It reminds me of my childhood, although my situation is a little different, but I feel the same way. I wonder if all we know about families is lost. The big moms of the day are under 55 years old. Will they know what it takes to be an inspiration to others? I hope I was not the only one to have liked this film enough to tell it to its past. The music was great in this movie. I really felt like it should have gone to the theaters I would have paid to see him. Watching the movie for the second time, I discovered who the life of this movie was. He did a remarkable job writing and producing this film. I guess who is best able to produce a movie based on your life other than you. As soon as I can, I'll get a copy for my home use. I always appreciate black producers or directors, because they give this film the feeling of living at the time. Thank you for such a good movie.
