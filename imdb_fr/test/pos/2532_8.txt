I have been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I came across "Cidade de Deus / City of God". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or better than "City of God". <br /> <br /> Actors, cinematography and musical surveillance make this film a unique experience. I have not been to Brazil yet, but this film presents the harsh reality facing the citizens of SÃ£o Paulo. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film if you like good cinema. This film is disturbing and you may feel a little discouraged after watching it. <br /> <br /> Something you want to watch, but nothing for which you want to fall asleep.
