I ended up loving this film but it was not the easiest to pass. What makes the movie awesome is the music and the landscapes. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. Great work has been done to show different settings to the Roma. <br /> <br /> However, the spectator was not guided enough. A deeper history of the Roma would have been good. Only a fraction of spoken words were subtitled in English. In addition, more detailed explanations of the parameters and the choice of people and their problems would also have been appreciated. It would have been helpful if a narrator had also explained the customs, clothes and music.
