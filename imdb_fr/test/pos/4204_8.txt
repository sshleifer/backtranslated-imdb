I did not expect much from this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it and I found it very remarkable. His notoriety is mainly due to the talent and appeal of his star, John Garfield. <br /> <br /> Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star sentenced to murder. He has to race and finish in the fray with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. We are offering here a chance of redemption, but will the past catch up with it again? Garfield was an actor before his peers. Even before the term "Method" was invented and before Brando shouted "Stella! it brings "natural" to the screen. His terrestrial quality and his incredible acting talent dominate this production. It is also interesting to note that his role here as a boxer has shades of that role of "Golden Boy" that he so desperately wanted to covet on the screen. Garfield looks at the guy and goes off like a boxer, proving he's worth it. <br /> <br /> Ann Sheridan plays here a small role at first as Jack's trampy girl, Goldie. I never thought much about Sheridan, but I liked him here. She plays well off Garfield. Dickson's performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with Garfield. The Dead End Kids are here and Garfield seems to be their natural idol (even more so than Cagney). Claude Rains is a bad idea and he looks uncomfortable in this role in many scenes. Strange because he has always been a reliable player. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that the director, Busby Berkeley, is best known for his first musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images. ease. It maintains a beautifully agitated atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A very good movie that deserves more attention 8/10.
