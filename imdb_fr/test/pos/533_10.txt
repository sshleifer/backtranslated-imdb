Adam Sandler's films are my favorite comedies. The silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie. The matrix is ​​my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere but here is my favorite drama. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most valuable asset of this film is its role as an actor. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing. At the end of this film, I had the impression of knowing his character better than I knew it myself. She did an amazing job. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman has also done a great job. I recently rented her first film, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12-year-old girl. I believe it is a contradiction in terms; she was a good actress for children. Well, 5 years later, she is still a good actress. In fact, she is much better. <br /> <br /> Not only did Sarandon and Portman describe their characters, but they also worked together perfectly. I mean, even now, I can hardly believe they are not really a mother and a daughter in real life, as well as in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is about a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and her restless girl. (Sarandon) leaving their hometown of Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends, and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that rises and after a few years (usually down , can I add). <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is a bit vague, the plot can only be summarized vaguely. But when you see this film, you will see that the plot is really neither vague nor weak, because it is really very deep. What I mean is that the plot is sketched weakly, but then they focus to reinforce it. <br /> <br /> And it's very strong, but the sequence of the plot is excellent. And there are some brilliant scenes that I hope will one day be considered "classic". <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And although, of course, there are some loopholes, it's still a stellar movie and it really meets in the end.
