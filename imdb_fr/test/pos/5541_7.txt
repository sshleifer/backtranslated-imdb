I'm not a fan of this kind of comedy - stereotypical characters over-acting through a joke of cops and thieves. But there are enough sympathetic characters to support the interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is adorable, but the person who really wears the film is Dean Stockwell, who steals every scene as gangster leader (named Tony, no less). <br /> <br /> Stockwell's performance is why I'm writing this review (and the only reason I would recommend it), actually. You will be tickled by his time on the screen. He plays the mafia boss perfectly, with comic touches in the right places, avoiding becoming an invading clich√©. In fact, Stockwell is a sheer delight to watch: a master of the "double take" and a real "watcher" in these elegant and fedoras suits. <br /> <br /> Meesa Says: A good movie to watch while folding clothes or eating leftovers.
