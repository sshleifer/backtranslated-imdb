The first minutes of this film do not do me justice! For me, it's not funny until they board the submarine and these hilarious characters start to freeze. I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, and met my share of "different" sailors. I even married one! Most of my favorite movies are just funny, not relevant, do not depend on sex or violence and are funny every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still fun, even after I know the dialogue by heart. Kelsey Grammar with her "God I love this job!" Was sincere, genuine and adorable. Rob Schneider is hysterical because the crew blames him for being annoying. I am always amazed by the size of this fishing boat next to a submarine! I can see why the people who live this life would notice the uh-oh, but it's not a documentary after all, it's a comedy and I love it!
