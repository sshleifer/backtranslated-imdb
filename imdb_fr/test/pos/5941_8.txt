Certainly, some scenes of this film seem a little unrealistic. The beautiful woman begins to panic, then a few minutes later, she begins to kiss the boy while the old man is at his side. But over the course of the film, we learn that she is a little volatile girl (or slut), which partly explains her behavior. The cinematography of this film is well done. We see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of these images and scenes really raise the tension. GÃ¶tz George plays his character well, an old cannon that gets older and is dominated by young men like Jaennicke. Wolfgang Kieling, whom I admired in THE TORN CURTAIN by Hitchcock, delivers an excellent performance which, although he does not say much, is by far the best actor in this piece. One critic complained about the film's unrealistic nature and the fact that in an emergency, nothing would really happen. But again, how realistic are films like Mission Impossible or Phone Booth? Since we are talking about a movie here, and that in a movie, you still have to deal with scenes unlikely to occur in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. It's a lot better than a lot of things I see on German television nowadays and I think the vintage style of the 80s has added something to this movie.
