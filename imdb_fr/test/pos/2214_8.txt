The Brightons have a traumatic tragedy in their family: Twenty-year-old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is delayed due to a fall while she was one, and her overprotective mother, Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan), blames his fault for the accident. . Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose), 17, loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father, Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railways. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities, and teaches her own poems to Emily. When Martha hears Emily repeat the poems, she takes notes and shows them to English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd), who believes that Emily has had a genius moment. When James (Fran Kranz), Evie's only friend, reads the notes, he immediately reveals the truth about the authority of the poems. But when Martha becomes aware of it, she discovers the reality of Evie, triggering a series of revelations. <br /> <br /> "Admissions" is a very powerful drama about people in need who need love and guilty complex. The performances are breathtaking and this is Lauren Ambrose's first work, "Six Feet Under", which I see and she is amazing. This independent film is an excellent choice for viewers looking for a refreshing story based on acting. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
