I was 13 years old when I saw this very underestimated movie at the ADAMS Theater in Newark, New Jersey, I bought the program and later the soundtrack ... I still have both .... I am now 55 years old. and I have not seen it since (maybe once on the network TV, in the 1960s ???) One of the biggest cast ever assembled, great score and production, thanks for leaving another generation see this great movie ... It was my introduction to opera, and helped with my understanding of tolerance .. Please Gerswhins family or Premingers, take out this classic soon !!
