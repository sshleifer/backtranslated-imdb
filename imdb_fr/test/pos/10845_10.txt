Over the weekend, I watched the movie Tipping the Velvet and if I had to score this movie out of 100, I would only have to give it 100 without asking any questions. I am a strong supporter of love and this film has moved me in many ways and the actors have adapted themselves to their roles. But I must say that the end was not great, because I did not see that spark in Nancys' eyes when she looked into Flo's eyes, because her eyes shone every time she looked at Kitty, Kitty only had to to be in the room or in the thought of Nancy and Nancy would only shine from this spark. Kitty told Nancy that she could not find her and she was looking for her, but could not find her. Kitty was ready to give everything to get Nancy back. In Kitty's eyes, you could see Kitty's pain. I think Nancy should have let Kitty see that their love is real and strong and she will not let her go so easily. You have to create a second part and bring the two together, but you must not let anyone else play the role that must be the real Kitty & Nancy, otherwise it will never work. My mother once told me that true love just was not real. I'm not stupid, I know we all have real love in a place that only expects each of us and I believe in my life that the true love of Nancy is really only Kitty and that the true love of Kitty n is that Nancy. Come on, let the game play the right way, the only way. Let Nancy's eyes shine again ... Kitty lost everything, losing Nancy. And Kitty is not the only one to blame. I am gay myself and being gay is not easy !! WAKE UP!!! in 1889, I would not want to be gay, Kitty got lost in her heart and in 1889 the good thing to do was maybe to marry a man. Even if you like a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to stand against her. Nancy had to fight for her. I remember how deeply I loved this girl and I let her escape because I thought I was doing something wrong and I went back to my ex-boyfriend's house. I thought I was doing what was right, but I knew I was wrong to let her go and I would pay for the rest of my life because, like Kitty, I could not find her anywhere. I heard that she is married to a man in the United States somewhere. I even heard that he beats her. I guess in the end we both lose. Give the two daughters of life another chance if you are not loyal to you and your beloved. <br /> <br /> Thanks Kristen Ann
