This movie is VERY LONG, but is definitely worth splitting into several nights. He has a cast of stars, and if you are a fan of Patrick Swayze, it will make your heart beat! :-) My mother is passionate about civil war and a history teacher. Every summer, we watched this movie (we recorded it on TV) for several nights until it was all over. We memorized all the lines of the film, lol. Pop a little popcorn, sit back and enjoy the action and romance. This is an excellent movie for those who love action, war, blood and guts, but also for those who have a sweet and romantic side. The clothes the women wore were beautiful! Sometimes I think I was born at the wrong time, lol.
