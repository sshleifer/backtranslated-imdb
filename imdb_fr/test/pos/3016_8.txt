I do not want to criticize the film, which I think is - for a big budget film - quite exceptional and daring. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say that I'm really fed up with the political studios and the laws of different states that treat their viewers as children. In the database, we find at least 4 different versions of the film depending on the duration. But, of course, there are probably many more different cuts. <br /> <br /> The result is total confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina where the movie lasts 115 minutes, which seems pretty complete). <br /> <br /> Later, on DVD and video, the studios try to rob us further by selling us a cut of the presumed director (in Germany, such a version already exists, it turns about 110 minutes). <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the studios think not only of the money they earn with their films, but also that their products are a work of art, even at risk. unfavorable, so that, as a spectator, I do not have to feel deceived and taken seriously, not just as a financial resource.
